	schema:headline " Key Film From The German Master";
	schema:reviewBody "Claustrophobic talky and highly inventive  The Bitter Tears of Petra Von Kant is a key film in the development of R.W. Fassbinder's art. According to longtime colleague Ulli Lommel Fassbinder wrote the entire work which also became a play and posthumously a modernist opera during an 11 hour plane journey from Germany to LA. Excited by this flush of creativity Fassbinder ordered his entourage to head straight back home and shot the entire film in a extraordinary 10 days.Set wholly within one room in the home of successful fashion designer Petra Von Kant the film deals with the destructive love affair Petra Margit Carstensen begins with aspiring model Karin Hanna Schygulla. As one of Fassbinder's early forays into the reexamination of 1950's Hollywood melodrama the film has the tendency to polarise audiences with it's highly stylised and almost stagy approach. Even the lack of incidental music may jar with those not familiar with the director's work. Rather than using a swelling score giving cues to the emotions the audience is meant to feel Fassbinder opts instead for selective natural sound a typewriter endlessly clacking away in the background during an important scene for instance and records from Von Kant's i.e. Fassbinder's record collection. Without this trapping we watch Petra's selfdestruction with a certain ambiguity and a more considered response is elicited from the viewer. More space is also given to the magnificent dialogue and inventive camerawork shot in long winding takes which allows the fine ensemble cast to to plunder the depths of emotional despair all the while dressed in Von Kant's wonderfully outrageous designs.This is all the more fascinating when read as a thinly veiled confession of Fassbinder's domineering ways with those in his inner circle. As also pointed out by Lommel the film's exclusively female characters were actually all based on men. Fassbinder however mostly preferred to work with women as he felt they were freer to express extreme states of emotional truth and more open to the requirements of high melodrama. As a primer for the great director's work The Bitter Tears of Petra Von Kant is an excellent example of Fassbinder's overriding theme how the hunter can quickly become the victim and that the universality of desire and need within all human relationships is a constant regardless of status sexuality or age.".

	schema:reviewBody "The archetypal midperiod Fassbinder film of the kind so lovingly pastichedparodied in Francois Ozon's 'Water Falling on Burning Rocks'. Like much of his early work the film is based on his own play which 'limitation' Fassbinder compounds by refusing to open it out  imprisonment and immobility being central Fassbinder themes as well as providing the metaphors that theatre provokes  roleplaying dualmultiple identities staging.  The film is like a prison drama  its four acts never leave Petra's preposterously ornate bedroom filled with dolls mannequins she is a fashion designer and the kind of obtrusive decor that allows Fassbinder to compose intricate multipleframe tableaux  and neither does Petra.  In the 'real' world of the film she is a jetsetter attending celebrity  shows photoshoots but in the film world she is paralysed stuck not only in this bedroom but in a circumscribed series of poses and movements not to mention stock phrases and attitudes.  if she makes any progress at all it is a negative one as she declines from empty rhetoric about freedom to a horrified admission of her own selfentrapment appropriately visualised in the bars of her bedframe and the mirror that reflects her  back on herself consumes her like Narcissus sucked into her own selflove her gestures at roleplay doomed attempts at consolidating her own egotistical power.  What's worse other characters seem as imprisoned as her but they can come and go even if they are doomed to return condemned to the same relations with Petra even if powerrelations shift.  Only one character seems to break free  Karin  and that is by using humiliating and ditching Petra. Like 'All about my mother' 'Bitter Tears' is a loose remake of 'All About Eve'  Petra is even paying alimony to a certain 'Joseph Mankiewicz'.  Karin is the rising star who submits herself to an elder mentor for as long as it suits before dumping her when she has taken what she needs.  Of course Fassbinder elides any Hollywood melodrama inherent in such a setup each 'act' involves a large time gap so that Karin's turning nasty seems disturbingly abrupt.  Stylistically the film's closed world is matched by the restricted camera movements and murky colours.  Fassbinder constantly distances us from the melodrama by compositions at once comic and mocking  the tears of two women being framed by mannequins etc.  In one brilliant scene Petra talks to Sidonie while looking into her hand mirror so that she appears to be talking to herself both Sidonie and her 'reflection' interrogating her. The women's bodies are undermined not only by unflattering framing but by the fetishistic limbless plastic  figures surrounding them.  Most incongruous of all is the large wall size painting that forms a background to the film a large classical subject with abandoned child prone woman and upright man continually ironising mocking undermining the narrative even provoking it as characters pose in a similar fashion.  There is one crucial difference  the man  the crucial absence from this malemediated female psychodrama.  Well one of two.  Another is the speech of Petra's longsuffering servant Marlene who may or may not be the real creative force behind Petra's success who exists in a Beckettlike relationship with her mistress as the latter like Hamm in 'Endgame' winds down towards inertia.  Like the audience she is mute and observing.  She is also the one sympathetic character her isolation and anguish eloquently expressed in some very moving composions as she stands behind screens unable to say no.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant 1972  was the first Fassbinder's film I saw many years ago in Moscow and it had started my fascination and interest in the work of the enormously talented man who was a writerdirectorproducereditoractor for almost all his movies. The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant is a screen adaptation of the earlier Fassbinder's play and it never leaves the apartment of Petra Von Kant an arrogant sarcastic and successful fashion designer who constantly mistreats and humiliates her always silent and obedient assistant Marianne Irm Hermann with whom Fassbinder made 24 movies. As a background for Petra's apartment Fassbinder uses the blowup of Poussin's painting Midas and Bacchus. The use of the mural is ironic on more than one level. Nude Bacchus stands in the center of the mural and is the only male presence in a film populated entirely with women. Petra not unlike legendary Midas wished for herself a golden girl young and beautiful Karin with golden hair Hanna Schygulla another Fassbinder's muse with whom he made over 20 films. As with Midas from legend it turned to be a huge mistake for Petra who learned herself what abuse indifference and humiliation meant. With just a few characters locked in the claustrophobic and suffocating atmosphere of the apartment the film is never slow or boring thanks to the young directorwriter storytelling ability and to magic camera work by Michael Ballhaus Goodfellas The Last Temptation of Christ and After Hours among others. It is hard to believe that such a gorgeous looking movie was shot for ten days only. I've read that Fassbinder was able to make so many movies in such a short period of time because they were cheaply produced  no special effects no big action scenes no exotic locations. This is true but his movies are most certainly not cheap  highly intelligent thought provoking always excellently acted and beautiful or perhaps I've been lucky and have not seen the ones that don't fit the description.9.510".

All the usual suspects are here Margit Carstensen has a ball as the Swansonesque Petra Hanna Schygulla slinks and drawls as Petra's lover Irm Hermann is at her beaky best as the watchful Marlene.  It all culminates in the birthday party to end all birthday parties.  A tough one to get into but you'll never see anything like it anywhere else.";

	schema:headline " Fassbinder's ultimate masterpiece";
	schema:reviewBody "During his 37 years on Earth the great German director Rainer Werner Fassbinder made a total of 41 films in his 13 year film career. Not counting the countless plays TV series and acting gigs he did his output was ferocious much like his personal life. There have been many things written and spoken about Fassbinder  that he was antiSemitic tyrannical misanthropic and homophobic even though he was an open homosexual  yet noone will deny his raw genius and his place as a driving force in the New German Cinema movement. He made many fantastic films and I don't think I would be alone is stating that he was at his best when dealing with melodrama and more specifically complex female characters.Possibly his best known film Fear Eats The Soul is widely considered his best but I feel that The Bitter Tears Of Petra Von Kant shows Fassbinder at the top of his game. He usually worked with the same troupe of actors Brigitte Mira Kurt Raab Karlheinz Bohm amongst others and here he has two of his finest  Margit Carstensen as the powerful yet desperate fashion designer Petra Von Kant and Hanna Schygulla who played the title character in Fassbinder's other masterpiece The Marriage Of Maria Braun as her newly appointed love interest Karin. In my opinion Carstensen is one of the finest actresses in cinema history along with Bette Davis and Liv Ullmann and is never better here. She is dominating and sadistic yet when she opens up to her cousin Sidonie Katrin Scaake or her new lesbian lover Karin she is tragic broken and lonely. It is a tourdeforce on display as her character changes as much as she changes her hairpieces.Petra is residing in her apartment when we first meet her awoken by fellow designer Marlene Irm Hermann who stays with her. We quickly learn that Petra sadistically treats Marlene like a slave ordering her to bring her things and even orders her to slowdance at one point. When she is joined by her cousin Petra reveals how her past relationships with men have ended in disaster and resentment and that men will ultimately leave her empty and disappointed. She is introduced to Karin a timid model who Petra visibly becomes interested in and eventually infatuated by. As Petra and Karin start a seemingly cold and difficult relationship Petra's jealousy and fear of loneliness comes to the fore as she struggles to hold herself together. In one particularly powerful scene Petra sits motionless on the edge of the bed after being told by Karin how noneexistent her feelings really are and a single tear rolls slowly down her face. Her face is as white as porcelain and as motionless as a doll as the realisation hits her that her situation is as fake as the mannequins she decorates with her creations.Adapted from his own play Fassbinder never moves the action outside Petra's claustrophobic apartment instead allowing the pent up feelings to explode within the confines of one room. The screenplay acting cinematography and music is absolute perfection and in my opinion this is Fassbinder's crowning achievement. The final scene which I won't reveal is in turn hilarious and heartbreaking. If you are as spellbound as I am by the acting talents of Carstensen then I would recommend both Fear Of Fear and Satan's Brew both Fassbinder to see the full range of her ability. Possibly the finest film of the New German Cinema movement.www.thewrathofblog.blogspot.com".

This is one more tale of lost love but Petra could never attain true love because she is a dictator looking for victims to dominant. But as in many a Fassbinder film the tide turns against her when she meets Karin. Petra heartily gobbles up Karin's tale of lowerclass woe and is soon a pathetic mess. This is an extremely well crafted film and each shot is thoroughly composed. Pay close attention to the positioning of Marlene to the mannequins and of course the penis symbolizing the maledominated world of which all woman are victims. The penis even gets the spotlight over Hannah Schygulla at one point. In the Fassbinder world we are all victims all someone's prey because we need love and will jump headlong into the abyss to attain it. We will humiliate and degrade ourselves. Petra becomes more and more like a mannequin as the movie unfolds symbolizing her degradation and emotional turmoil. I gave this movie a 10 because while not Fassbinder's best it still beats most of what Hollywood has put out in the last 30 years and many of the movies that have wound up in IMDb's top 250. Lastly for the uninitiated and the unbelievers Fassbinder challenges the viewer constantly to look closer and dig deeper into human relationships and whether real true lasting love is even attainable. He pushed the limits of what a movie is and what it can achieve failing several times along the way. The result is some of the most thoughtprovoking intense movies ever made.".

	schema:headline " Interesting early Fassbinder film";
	schema:reviewBody "Rainer Werner Fassbinder started to get some notoriety with this film and it's a film version of one of his own plays. This story strongly represents Fassbinder's own bitterness towards love and relationships. This film takes place in the apartment of Petra von Kant Margit Carstensen who is a fashion designer and she spends her days verbally berating her mute secretaryslave Marlene Irm Hermann. Petra is a lesbian and divorced with a daughter in boarding school and one day Petra's friend Sidonie Katrin Schaake mentions that an acquaintance is stopping over. Sidonie's friend turns out to be Karin Hanna Schygulla and she has just gotten back to Germany after spending some time out of the country. Petra offers her the opportunity to be a model and she agrees to be schooled by her. Soon Petra is deeply attracted to her and asks Karin to move in which she does. After time passes Petra finds out that Karin still sleeps with men from time to time and then Karin's husband calls and asks her to come stay with him. Karin says yes and asks for money for her trip. Petra gives it to her but is deeply hurt and starts drinking heavily and becomes very depressed. She lashes out at everyone around her and it takes some time for her to function again.SPOILER ALERTSome critics of this film say that its just too talky and that its just another bad filming of a stage play. But there are other things going on when you watch this film and the cinematography is exceptional. The cinematographer is the great Michael Ballhaus who worked on about 15 productions with Fassbinder. The use of color is very evident in this film even though it takes place in a rather modest apartment setting. The color of red is used effectively when the actors are wearing primarily white and the background usually has large pictures hanging on the walls to give it some interesting depth. Fassbinder has a solid background in theater and when he made films he could work as both director and set designer. It's a striking film to look at and Fassbinder always had a strong view of how his productions should look. The performances are all solid and Carstensen is very strong in the title role. One of the more interesting parts in this film is by Hermann as Marlene. She never speaks in the film and its not known for sure if she's a mute or not. She's basically Petra's slave and it's suggested that they're relationship is founded on Petra's domination of her. At the end of the film Petra tells Marlene that she is giving her freedom. Marlene responds by packing her bag and leaving Petra for what we think is for good. They're relationship was about possession and when that has ended then it's over for them. This basically was what Fassbinder wanted to show everyone and he has always been fascinated by human emotions in dire situations. Petra wanted to possess Karin but she fooled her from the start. She used her and left her without any remorse at all. This film also gives viewers a look at a very young Eva Mattes who plays Petra's daughter Gabriele. Mattes would become a very well known German actress and is probably best known for her work in a couple of Werner Herzog films. This is certainly not Fassbinder's best film but it is a fascinating character study with some very colorful visuals. Fassbinder was one of cinema's greatest directors and this early effort is interesting to watch from start to finish.".

Petra claims that her husband resented her success and could not chauvinistically come to terms with her financial dominance. At no time does she refer to sexual orientation and gender preference as factors.Enter the Baroness's young and beautiful friend Karin. Immediately Petra becomes interested and seductively attracted towards her. In classic bourgeois style she flatters and tempts the impoverished Karin with her wealth and connections I'll make you my model. Karin a heterosexual embraces bisexuality and embarks on an affair with Petra.In the background throughout the entire movie Poussin's Midas and Bacchus reproduced as a backdrop against an entire wall looms symbolically over the unfolding drama.We are now moved on in time. Petra is now hopelessly infatuated with Karin who although she is affectionate towards Petra her heterosexuality precludes her reciprocating. What Petra desires is a grand passion whichlike a moth being drawn to a flame is then consumed by it. The requited love that Petra insists upon remains unsatisfied. The situation comes to a head when Karin's husband returns and Karin walks out of her relationship with Petra and rejoins him.We now have the core of this tale as Petra fragments in agonistic convulsion. A fantastic sequence of humiliation and degradation emotionally convincing is magnificently pulled off by Margarit Carstensen who plays Petra and also by Fassbinder's tight direction. The scene takes place on a shaggy long piled white carpetfashionable in the 70's a bare room and the backdrop painting. An utterly masterful and absorbing display of emotion at the edge. Phew what an affective scene leaving the viewer quite exhausted. After the catharsis of all the descent into hell Petra recovers seemingly cured of the mad love and supposedly through the pain and suffering she now offers her long suffering slave cum assistant a new relationship  her freedom from servitude and from now on a partnership of equality. This political resolution was taken by this particular viewer that is myself with a pinch of salt as I find it highly optimistic on Fassbinder's part that Petra would so easily embrace a new personaThere is very little action in this movie but the authenticity is riveting.

	schema:reviewBody "I still can't get into Fassbinder's world here. Saw it many years ago possibly on Film 4 and now twice recently where it's been on Sky Arts.There's no doubt that it is an important film both for Fassbinder himself and for European cinema. It's like a moving art gallery so well and immaculately filmed the angles the depth of focus and the set design all rivet one's eyes to the screen.

Of course dialogue is important to all films but this is a world alien to me and something is locking me out. Maybe the visuals are too rich  the subtitles float above the perfect imagery.

Also Markboulos Fassbinder at his finest! Cinema at its finest! markboulos from Brooklyn NYC 3 February 2000 captures the film's quality. Shane James Bordas Key Film From The German Master Shane James Bordas from United Kingdom 22 August 2006 describes the film's origins. Finally Lexo2 Great film glad I don't live there Lexo2 from Dublin Ireland 1 May 1999 has a nice summary.The Bitter Tears of Petra Von Kant 1972 Rainer Werner Fassbinder  a ladiesonly slumber party is a slowpaced masterpiece from the renowned German filmmaker. Adapted from Fassbinder's own play it is set in a single apartment. It consists entirely of conversation that is spoken by worldweary characters. While it will likely bore many casual filmgoers it is a sublime achievement for those willing to stick it out. Bitter Tears is very profound and informs on the human condition in various ways.The titular character Petra Margit Carstensen is a celebrity fashion designer. Petra is used to emotionally dominating the people who surround her. Having been married twice before Petra explains to her visiting cousin Sidonie Kartin Schaake that men now repulse her and women are currently her romantic gender of choice. Bitter Tears shows us a lesbian triangle which seems unusually bold for 1974. Petra employs a silent servant named Marlene Irm Hermann that she continually mistreats. Because Marlene is obviously in love with Petra her quiet suffering is mesmerizing to observe. BTW Fassbinder leaves two essential questions about Marlene unresolved 1 Is she a mute or just unable to speak in Petra's presence? 2 Is she entirely or partly responsible for Petra's professional success? Leaving Marlene's relationship with Petra ambiguous is an example of Fassbinder's elite skill at storytelling. Through Sidonie Petra meets attractive Karin Hanna Schygulla. Karin is separated from her husband. Petra immediately falls for her. She tells Karin she has a future as a fashion model. When Karin arrives for a second visit Petra assumes her customary role as sexual predator. While treating Marlene miserably Petra tries to seduce the seemingly confused Karin. Unexpectedly Karin is the real shark. We learn she is taking advantage of Petra. Karin will ultimately stick an emotional dagger through Petra's soul rejecting her and torturing her before revealing she is returning to her husband. Realizing the consequences of opening one's heart at the wrong place and time Petra falls apart. On her birthday Petra has a nervous breakdown which is witnessed by Sidonie along with Petra's Mother and Daughter.While interpretations of this film vary Fassbinder is said to be showing how a group of people can all simultaneously reside in their own mental prisons. He's also employing substitution on many levels. The characters here are all drawn from Fassbinder's relationships with his recurring cast members as well as his conservative mother. As a celebrity designer Petra is an obvious standin for Fassbinder himself. The silent Marlene is regarded as representing the audience early and later Karin. Fassbinder reviewers have noted in other films he uses female characters as substitutes for reallife men he knows.Visually Fassbinder is electric. He is always on point with his imagery even though this is a low budget production. On the apartment wall there is a large reproduction of Poussin's Midas and Bacchus c.1630 which depicts naked and partially clothed men Wikipedia. As Petr describes her sexual preference for women to Sidonie the audience will have little difficulty in discovering the sleeping endowment of Poussin's central nude male in the background. Petra's words and the Poussin figure's little man seems to be Fassbinder describing his own homosexuality. Even though a homoerotic painting is often present and a lesbian triangle is in the story Bitter Tears has enough mild eroticism for every individual audience member regardless their preferred sleeping arrangement. Bitter Tears arrives decades before the Internet confirms the interest hetero guys have in watching lesbians.Fassbinder favorite Hanna Schygulla is adorable as the femme fatale. Meanwhile Margit Carstensen Petra also attractive turns in a superb performance as Petra. She won awards in Germany but inexplicably she was not internationally recognized.The origin of Bitter Tears is legendary. Fassbinder is said to have written the screenplay on an 11hour plane trip from Germany to L.A. Upon landing he immediately ordered his film crew which traveled with him to return to Germany where they made it in 10 days. This is all astonishing because many reviewers regard Bitter Tears as Fassbinder's crowning achievement.Cinephiles with some patience should not miss this Fassbinder classic.".

The acting is good and it is well worth a view.

But in her tentative move to woo Karin she gracefully throws concept of humility to impress a lesser sophisticated mind and when she is hurt by Karin's blunt frankness a black man with a huge cock she pleads her to lie to her a sardonic betrayal of her pride and principles. The subsequent fits of fickleness and servitude barely can erase a feeling of fatigue born out of the treacly theatrics and broadstroke tediousness a straightforward nervous breakdown should have arrived sooner than later.Speaking of performances Carstersen's soliloquyprone grandstanding never totally transcend into something ravishing to behold maybe because Petra is a far cry from a character we can easily project sympathy onto a deeplyflawed diva's sadomasochistic narcissism is psychologically overbearing for schadenfreude. Schygulla on the contrary retains something brutally honest in Karin cast a distinguished shadow of selfawareness against Petra's maudlin temperament and Hermann conveys Marlene a permanent onlooker in the maelstrom of melodrama with expressionless glare and stare she robotically types eavesdrops serves until dissolves into a subconscious existence simmering with suppressed orgasm only until Petra finishes with that Fassbinder's intricately personal and uninhibitedly experimental psychodrama dares to close its curtain.".

	schema:reviewBody "Die bitteren Trnen der Petra von Kant or The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant is a West German film from almost 45 years ago and chronologically it is in the middle of writer and director Rainer Werner Fassbinder's prolific but shortlived career. The cast is exclusively female. Men are only seen on photos or as naked statues. 3 of the 6 actresses in here were nominated or won German Film Awards for their roles here and these winners include lead actress Margit Carstensen who plays the title character. Unfortunately I personally did not find these 125 minutes too convincing. All this awards recognition is a bit of a joke. The actresses seem really lackluster which is generally a problem with several of the directors' works. Of course it can be one character's way to speak so boringly but here everybody does it. And that is not realistic anymore. No passion no enthusiasm even in emotional moments. It surprises me to see that this is among Fassbinder's most known works. It is not a disaster by any means but I felt it dragged on several occasions and the characters simply weren't interesting enough to watch for such a long time. The good thing with Fassbinder is always that he goes for realism instead of forced happy developments and endings but even from the perspective of this being an early gaythemed film I cannot see a lot of value.There are some Fassbinder films I like and some I do not like. This one here falls among the latter and I do not recommend checking it out if you plan on getting into the man's work. Instead a good start may be Martha another Fassbinder movie starring Margit Carstensen from a couple years later. This was a great watch. As for this one here I believe the material is more fitting for a stage adaptation really if they add a bit more focus cut out the many irrelevant moments and give it a more modern touch. This 1972 version does not do too much for me and that is why I think you should watch something else instead. Thumbs down. The only aspect that convinced me in here was the set decoration which is almost always good in Fassbinder's films and this one is no exception.".

Basically the film restricts us to staying inside the apartment of successful fashion designer Petra Von Kant Margit Carstensen who is arrogant caustic and selfsatisfied and this includes being rude and constantly ordering about her secretary maid and codesigner Marlene Irm Hermann. Petra is being visited by twenty three year old Karin Thimm Hanna Schygulla who wants to be a model but as they get to know each other in their time together they seem to fall in love and she asks her new love interest to move in. We see the affair continue on until Karin walks out and we see Petra turn into an emotional wreck on her birthday in front of her friends and family they all leave her to wallow in self pity Marlene finally decides she has had enough and Petra is left alone sobbing. Also starring Katrin Schaake as Sidonie Von Grasenabb Eva Mattes as Gabriele Von Kant and Gisela Fackeldey as Valerie Von Kant. Carstensen gives a great performance as the beauty who seems to only care about herself getting everything she wants and attempting a lesbian relationship that goes wrong the story is based on the director's own personal experiences as a homosexual and with inspiration from All About Eve it is unusual viewing and did not fully make sense at all times for me but overall it is a rather interesting melodrama.

	schema:headline " Irina Palm";
	schema:reviewBody "When I saw the trailers it looked like a European film and settings but luckily this movie was in English directed by a German born Belgium director Sam Garbarski.The story is in a small village near London about a widowed grandmother Maggie Marianne Faithful whose grand son has to undergo treatment in Australia. She has a son Tom Kevin Bishop and daughter in law Sarah Siobhan Hewlett who can not earn that much to afford the trip to Australia. Maggie loves the grandson a lot but does not have any skills to do work  she has never worked in her entire life. After being rejected at many places in search of work she lands up in the Soho area red light district of London in Mikky's Miki Manojlovic sex club  restaurant. Very shy and hesitant  she agrees to the work of masturbating men for a decent sum of Pounds 900 per week. Within no time she becomes the famous Irina Palm pseudo name for her skills. Maggie finds a new confidence and selfindependence through this new role  which she never thought would become her respected profession. She borrows money from Miki and gives to her son who becomes suspicious and when he follows her and knows about her new profession and is deeply hurt. He wants her to take the money back and leave the dirty profession.The movie is about the journey through the mind of Maggie. Her hesitations her doubts her fears her joy her confidence her love and her grandiose  everything is perfect.Marianne Faithful  who started her career as a singer and later got involved in film acting  looks beautiful just google her name and see how beautiful she was in her young days and has acted honorably in portraying the character of Maggie to its core. She speaks more in her silences stares and glances than with words. She was the perfect casting by the Director Sam. A special mention of veteran actor Miki Manojlovic  who has played the dark character of Mikky with so much punch and humanness that it is remarkable and not easy to forget. Both Marianne and Miki sparkles the screen with their historic.A very well directed film by Sam  this is just his fifth directional project. He has also cowritten the script with Philip Blasband. Cinematography by Christophe Beacarne is wonderful in capturing the life of a small British village to the dark and dingy streets and hotels of Soho especially the beginning shot of the village through bird's view and hand held shots of dark back alleys of Soho.At one point in the movie when Maggie is forced by her son to leave the work I was longing for Marianne to go back to her profession  because that had brought her self dignity and selfesteem. But I will not say the ending and spoil of interest.A very good  sensitive movie! Stars 7.5 out of 10".

He wants her to take the money back and leave the dirty profession.The movie is about the journey through the mind of Maggie. Her hesitations her doubts her fears her joy her confidence her love and her grandiose  everything is perfect.Marianne Faithful  who started her career as a singer and later got involved in film acting  looks beautiful just google her name and see how beautiful she was in her young days and has acted honorably in portraying the character of Maggie to its core. She speaks more in her silences stares and glances than with words. She was the perfect casting by the Director Sam. A special mention of veteran actor Miki Manojlovic  who has played the dark character of Mikky with so much punch and humanness that it is remarkable and not easy to forget. Both Marianne and Miki sparkles the screen with their historic.A very well directed film by Sam  this is just his fifth directional project. He has also cowritten the script with Philip Blasband. Cinematography by Christophe Beacarne is wonderful in capturing the life of a small British village to the dark and dingy streets and hotels of Soho especially the beginning shot of the village through bird's view and hand held shots of dark back alleys of Soho.At one point in the movie when Maggie is forced by her son to leave the work I was longing for Marianne to go back to her profession  because that had brought her self dignity and selfesteem. But I will not say the ending and spoil of interest.A very good  sensitive movie! Stars 7.5 out of 10";

The story is given every conceivable foreseeable twist and turn  a romance with the sex bar proprietor who just had to sample her talent on the sly her friends who are dying to be let in on the particulars but still are too prudish not to turn their backs on her her son finding out and flying into a rage and the reconciliation with her hostile daughterinlaw when she learns about Maggie's sacrifice  all predictable but still I liked it. Perhaps because everybody in the film puts out great performance. Miki Manoljovic is very good as the sex bar owner who falls in love with his unlikely ace employee Kevin Bishop is frighteningly good as the loving mildmannered son who cannot really see his way through to understand his mother which son could given her line of work? and Marianne Faithful that rarely seen blast from the past my past at least is certainly a far cry from her Ophelia in 1969 Yes I do know that she's been doing bits and bobs in between but somehow I've missed them. Marianne Faithful's slow slightly hazy style is recognizable still and I'd say she carries this film through in a very touching way  no pun intended.".

	schema:reviewBody "IRINA PALM may be a film too many people will overlook thinking it either empty headed or pornographic. But word of mouth should correct those misconceptions as this little quiet film is a tender story of an aging woman's sacrifices and healthy outlook in the face of adversity. IRINA PALM is that happy marriage of comedy and drama a heartwarming tale that leaves the viewer with both a smile and a tear. Written by Director Sam Garbarski with Martin Herron and Phillipe Blasband IRINA PALM is the story of a widowed grandmother Maggie Marianne Faithful in a luminous performance whose young grandson Ollie Corey Burke is gravely ill. Maggie's son Tom Kevin Bishop and daughterinlaw Sarah Siobhan Hewlett cannot afford the transfer from England to Australia where the young lad could undergo curative treatment. Maggie decides she must find a job  a daunting task for an older woman with no particular job training  to make the treatment affordable. After numerous rejections from employment agencies she spies a Sex Shop advertising for 'hostesses'. Thinking that designation means serving tea etc she enters the shady establishment and is interviewed by the owner Miki Miki Manojlovic a gentle man who gently describes the type of employment Maggie would sit in a room and provide simple masturbation through a glory hole for anonymous clients. At first shocked by the job description she in desperation investigates the business with the help of her soon to be best friend Luisa Dorka Gryllus and accepts the job with reservations. To her surprise and the surprise of Miki and Luisa Maggie gains a loyal following of customers so much so that she is given the name 'Irina Palm'. Keeping her employment a secret from everyone she is the brunt of gossip from her old cronies and when she gives the money from her job to her son Tom without revealing its source she causes a riff in the family. Maggie is courted by other sex shop owners who offer higher pay but she remains faithful to Miki who advanced her the money for Ollie's trip to Australia. Tom stalks his mother to her workplace discovers the source of her income and explodes with anger and embarrassment that his mother would stoop to such depths. But Maggie's role as Irina Palm has given her confidence and also opened her heart not only to her grandson's future but to her own happiness as well. The ending may be expected by some but will warm the hearts of everyone. There are many moments of humor  Maggie's learning her trade her ultimate confession to her cronies as to her occupation etc  and this lightness makes the dramatic message more powerful. Faithful is extraordinarily fine in this difficult role but the entire cast is sensitively responsive to the screenplay and to director Garbarski's vision. This is a film to cherish. Highly recommended. Grady Harp".

Music of Ghuzu guitar group propels the actions forward. Sensitive camera work doesn't allow us to be more than very limited voyeurs into the workings of a SoHo sex club where our protagonist grandmother played to perfection by Marianne Faithful in a role that shows us how multi talented this former rock chick of 1970's fame as the muse for Mick Jagger is as a mature woman. She does what she is able to do for not only her sick grandson but for her son who is unable to fix what a good father should be able to. Her moral dilemma is resolved in how she limits and defines just what a good mother should do for her children to protect them from life's foibles and cruelties. The Desert Film Society of Palm Springs CA screened this film on Sat. Dec. 15 2007 for our 300 members who thought it one of the best films we have shown this year along with The Man in the Chair.".

When MaggieMarianne Faithful jerks back and forth on a client's penis just be grateful that filmmaker Catherine Breillat wasn't at the helm of Irina Palm. It would just be too graphic for words. But the film is Breillatlike in the sense that the filmmaker deeroticizes sex by taking the sex organ out of context from the human body which is something the French provocateur attempted with female genitalia in 1999's Romance. The handjob soon becomes a normal job like an office job which is the case for anybody involved in the sex industry as exemplified when Maggie brings into her office some personal effects from home.Since the endresult of Maggie's unlikely occupation is for a good cause the greater good blinds us to how unseemly her line of work really is. When TomKevin Bishop chastises Maggie after he discovers what mom has been up to for the first time do we question her sense of morality. Irina Palm stops being a deadpan comedy and asks its audience to take a second look at what Maggie is doing. Is she humiliating herself? Yes and no. At the beginning yes because Maggie was squeamish. But she did it anyway as an act of love for her sick grandson. After the shock of the new wears off Maggie starts to take pride in her job. She's good at it. The formerhomemaker has never been good at anything in her life. Although Maggie lives in a good neighborhood and has fancy friends she's only upperclass by association. Her husband was rich. By being a sex industry worker she's reclaiming her working class roots. Arguably she doesn't belong in the parlour of a society friend sipping tea with the ladies. Maggie finds herself alone in a room with penises and becomes something more substantial than a widow. Like the girls in Lizzie Borden's Working Girls Maggie finds feminism in the strangest places too.".

Before you know it Maggie is doing quite the little business years of not doing manual labor have apparently paid off with a steady stream of satisfied customers queuing up outside her cubicle and a boss more than satisfied with the money she's bringing in. She's even adopted a stage name Irina Palm renowned for having the smoothest hand in the business. But hiding the truth from her son and daughterinlaw and her snooty gossipy friends becomes a daily challenge for Maggie as she debases herself for a noble cause.Despite its rather  um shall we say touchy subject matter  Irina Palm is a warm human drama about a woman willing to go to any lengths to help a person she loves. But that's only the glasshalfempty aspect of the story for in a bizarre sort of way this turns out to be one of the best things that's ever happened to Maggie. Indeed her willingness to meet life on its own terms  then eventually her own  opens up whole new possibilities for Maggie as an individual possibilities that have hitherto remained unrealized due to the various social roles and conduct restrictions that have been imposed upon her throughout the course of her life. Her new job gives her a type of freedom she's never had before simply because it is she and she alone who is now determining what course that life will take.Irina Palm may make some in the audience squirm at times but the sheer preposterousness of what Maggie is being called upon to do in the name of money and the empathy generated by famed singer Marianne Faithful's beautifully understated and heartfelt performance purge the film of any taint of luridness it might otherwise have had. There's actually quite a bit of humor here as well as Maggie begins by swallowing her pride  then finding a pride of her own in a job well done much to the consternation of the sanctimonious prigs who surround her. Yet as directed and cowritten by Sam Garbarski Irina Palm makes it a point to be fair to its characters. This is particularly the case with Miklos Maggie's boss wonderfully played by Miki Manojlovic who could easily have been portrayed as an irredeemable lout but who instead comes across as a shrewd but not unreasonable businessman with issues of his own to deal with and a spiritual connection with this strange woman who overturns not only his establishment but his heart. And fine performances by Kevin Bishop Siobhan Hewlett Corey Burke and Jenny Agutter An American Werewolf in London add to the emotional richness of the piece.This is a surprisingly tender and touching film that will have you rooting for the middleaged widow with the magic hand almost in spite of yourself.".

And further on I thought this film would be typical British in terms of showing how something exciting like a sex club could be funny and not exotic at all like they did in Full Monthy.The first sign that this wasn't the movie I expected came in the opening where there was a music so depressing that could kill all enthusiasm. And it continued all through the film. After half an hour where we had been shown how miserable this middleaged lady was and what she was willing to go through to save her grandchild I thought that something was going to happen that the film would turn around. But it never did. This story could be told in 15 minutes there is no reason to make it longer than that. You might think that making it as long as it was was to show the depth of the characters and what they went through but they weren't even close to give this any deeper meaning or emotion. I really think they went too far in describing the misery. For example the behavior of the people in the bank. Nobody in a bank talk to a customer like that not even close.And at the sex club they play the one song over and over again and she's so good jerking them off that they stand in lines so long that they would probably had to wait an hour to be jerked off and that hour had to be spent in between other horny males...come on this was so exaggerated and stupid that I was embarrassed.I could not recommend this movie. Normally I like different and odd films but this was just dull and depressing without any deeper message.".

	schema:reviewBody "First of all I have to say that I surf around IMDb.com a lot but this is my first review here. The reason for that is because I think that often the reviews for most movies on this page are pretty fair to the overall score of the movie. But this is not. And I feel like I should warn others from watching this as nobody warned me. It is very bad and I feel like people should know what quality they are about to see.At the time I am writing this Irina Palms has a score of 7.2 out of 10. In my opion that is at least 4 stars too many.Unfortunately this movie is horrible. The Idea behind the movie is okay though the grandmother who feels forced to jerk off lots of men in the sexclub in order to get the money it takes to save her ill grandson from dying. It could be OK but it's not. Far far from to be honest.Even in the beginning all the establishing scenes to introduce the characters feel rushed as if the director just wants to get to the wanking part as soon as possible. And when we get there it's an odd mix of comedy and drama  as if the director wants it to be both but without any success. All he succeeds in is the comedy part which is not even that good. True there are a pair of okay jokes but that''s not hard to make since it's all toilet humour. Most of the funny scenes are just funny because it's an elderly woman wanking off men for money and to be honest I think a lot of directors could have pulled it off just as good because this kind of humour doesn't have to be extremely clever to make people laugh a bit. In fact I was waiting for some more clever jokes than what were in the movie but they didn't show up... The dramatic parts of the movie are very bad as well the acting is fair in some scenes where Marianne Faithful misspell..? is on her own  that's OK some of the times. But pretty much everything else is rubbish  not only do most of the characters overact they simply also act stupidly and in many cases with no logic at all. This seems to be more of a flaw from the director andor scriptwriter though and not the actors themselves. There are many times where you will guess EXACTLY what the actors will do because it is clich and other times where you will wonder how anyone could make a character act that way in certain situations since it makes no sense at all. I would not recommend this movie to anyone as it is completely rubbish unfortunately. I wasted 80 mins or so watcing this and I regret it. It might sound interesting plotwise when someone tells you the story but it's not interesting at all. In fact the few fairly good jokes and funny sketches in awkward moments don't make up for the poor acting bad editing and very very clich situations throughout the movie. It fails at being a drama and only succeeds a few percent in being a comedy.But then again I and people around me were literally and I'm actually not exaggerating now this is true were laughing out loud in a handful of scenes from the horrible horrible dialogue and embarrassing acting. So in that sense I guess it kind of is a comedy...All I can say is though... Avoid this movie for your own sake. I have warned you now.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie was a total surprise and a lot more entertaining than expected. There were a lot of quiet or dead moments but those seemed to work out not only for use as a scene change but to convey just how bleak when you really sit down and think about it most people's lives are. The plot centers around a widowed grandmother and her son and daughterinlaw and their plight to get medical help for the grandsonson though we are never told just what he has and for most of the scenes we see him in he looks okay really. I would have liked a little background of his ailment and why he had to go to Australia in order to get treatment. Both families have borrowed as much as they can against what they own and are told that the treatment will be free as it's something new but the family must pay their own way there and for their stay. Of course none have any money and all have been turned down for more loans. So Maggie the grandmother and played quite well by Marianne Faithful goes out looking for a job but she's a 50yearold widow with no skills. She happens across an ad in the window for a hostess at a sex club and like most naive people thinks all she will have to do is bring tea to the customers and clean off tables. The scene where she's thinking this is what she will have to do and then told exactly what it is she will do is done perfectly and the look on her face is awesome as she comes to realize just what a hostess actually does. Of course she declines. But then there's that dying grandson hanging over her head so she chooses to do something that repulses her in order to help out to save her grandson. So the premise IMO is just how far would one go to save a loved one? And it's not like she was having actual sex. All she was doing was giving hand jobs and through a hole in the wall to boot. What was really funny was once she got into the job and she took her job seriously since this is what an honest person would do regardless of the job not to mention she was really good at it and thus she began to make her workplace more homey. Don't we all do this? We put up pictures of loved ones flowers personal items etc. And there is one particular scene where she is at work and like a lot of us multitasking. I won't give that one away. It was so funny we had to stop the DVD and rewind to watch it again. Yes there were problems. What movie does not? Some of the issues discussed are the acting talents or lack thereof of certain cast members and some were kind of dry and others overdone but overall the entire cast was right on the money. Even her socalled friends and their reactions when they found out what she was doing. One woman was actually quite interested while the others feigned repulsion. This is one of those sleeper movies to rent and just sit back and enjoy the ride.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I first saw Marianne Faithful in Irena Palm she was so much the frumpy housewife that I almost didn't recognize her. As the movie continued however I saw her bright eyes and intense expressions and realized that she's one of the few women who like the far less likable Leni Riesenstahl will be sexy in old age. She's had an odd career going from ingnue groupie to seenitall chanteuse seemingly without a middle period. In this film she emerges as a greater actor than singer though her Pirate Jenny from the Threepenny Opera may be the best version of the song in English. Her talent's in full bloom in Irena Palm. She appears in almost every frame and holds together a story that on its own is not always plausible.Maggie the frumpy housewife has a beloved grandson who's dying of some disease. He can go to Australia for experimental treatment but no one in the family can afford the 6000 pounds needed for travel expenses. Maggie without marketable experience roams the streets of London in search of work to raise the money without success until she applies for a hostess job at a grubby Soho sex show. Miki Miki Manojlovic the show's manager likes the look of Maggie's hands and is willing to try her out. Seems the work involves masturbating anonymous men who having been excited by nude showgirls feed coins to a meter and stick their cocks through holes in a wall. Maggie does a fine job develops a following and proves an accomplished earner.But of course things get more complicated and not only because Maggie develops penis elbow and must wear her arm in a sling. Her women friends wonder how she's spending her time and she refuses to tell them. When she gets the necessary money and gives it to her son he follows her to her workplace and is outraged to discover that his mother's a whore. His wife understands better however and insists on accepting the money for the trip to Australia with their son. The film ends with Maggie returning to Miki's sex club and kissing her pimpmanager on the lips in what is clearly a developing romance.Ms Faithful has displayed throughout her career a visceral hatred of capitalism her version of Working Class Hero is clearer and more intense than John Lennon's. Irena Palm can be seen as a sophisticated exploration of capitalist contradictions. Maggie is both satisfied by her financial success and happy that she can do something well but the sordidness of her occupation is not minimized. Miki's sex club is realistically crowded and dirty. When her coworker Luisa Dorka Gryllus is unable to line up the men like Maggie she is unceremoniously fired. Beneath its somewhat silly plot Irena Palm makes serious statements and Marianne Faithful enables it to happen.".

	schema:reviewBody "In this bittersweet tale of disconnections and possibilities perhaps we have the essence of the art of Eric Rohmer. If you have only one Rohmer film to see perhaps you ought to make it this one because it is so very very French so interestingly talkative one of Rohmer's trademarks and so very very Rohmer.The Aviator's wife incidentally does not appear except in a photograph but that is all to the point. Everything is a bit off stage in this intriguing drama love especially is a bit off stage. And yet how all the participants yearn.Marie Riviere stars as Anne who is in love with the aviator. We catch her just as she learns that he no longer wants her. He tells her that his wife is pregnant and so he must return to her. Meanwhile she is being pestered by Francois Philippe Marlaud who is in love with her. However he is a little too young and clinging. Truly she is not interested. It is a disconnection as far as she is concerned.The heart of the film occurs when Francois is following the aviator and the blond woman. Francois is obsessive and jealous. He follows because...it isn't clear and he really doesn't know why except that this is the man that Anne loves. As it happens while he is following them he runs into a pretty fifteenyearold Lucie played fetchingly by AnneLaure Meury who imagines that he is following her. She turns it into a game and again we have a disconnection. She is fun and cute and full of life but he cannot really see her because he pines for Anne. Meanwhile Anne of course is pining for the aviator.Rohmer's intriguing little joke is about the aviator's wife. Who is she and what is she like? We can only imagine. And this is right. The woman imagines what the other woman is like but never really knows unless she meets her.Maire Riviere is only passably pretty but she has gorgeous limbs and beautiful skin and a hypnotic way about her which Rohmer accentuates in the next to the last scene in her apartment with Francois. We follow the talk between the two of disconnection and off center possibilities of friends and lovers with whom things are tantalizingly not exactly right and yet not tragically wrong. As we follow this talk we see that Anne's heart is breaking or has brokenand all the while we see her skin as Francois does. She wants to be touched but not by him. And then she allows him to touch her but only in comforting gestures redirecting his hands away from amorous intent. And then she goes out with a man in whom she really has no interest.Such is life one might say. Rohmer certainly thinks so.One thing I love about Rohmer's films is that you cannot predict where they will go. Another thing is his incredible attention to authentic detail about how people talk and how they feel without clich and without any compromise with realityRohmer's reality of course which I find is very much like the reality that I have experienced.See this for Eric Rohmer whose entre into the world of cinema is substantial original and wonderfully evocative of what it is like to live in the modern world with an emphasis on personal relationships and love.Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!

	onyx:emotionText "In this bittersweet tale of disconnections and possibilities perhaps we have the essence of the art of Eric Rohmer. If you have only one Rohmer film to see perhaps you ought to make it this one because it is so very very French so interestingly talkative one of Rohmer's trademarks and so very very Rohmer.The Aviator's wife incidentally does not appear except in a photograph but that is all to the point.

Somewhere I've read that Rohmer's male characters are less perfectly or maybe it's less caringly drawn than his female. Yet I don't think there's one whose mistakes harms selfdeceptions I haven't either fallen into or sidestepped one time or another. Aviator's Wife flows to and then from a single easytomiss but magically telling moment worked by sprite of the park Lucie in the postpark caf across from the building into which the aviator has temporarily disappeared. Franois nods off for a second or two. With a touch on the cheek Lucie wakes him immediately and tells him it's been ten minutes. Circumstance and moment trap him into believing believing spontaneously like a babe even though he hasn't believed a word from his Anne all day. Up until the final reel Rohmer seems to be working to make us dislike Anne even as our embarrassment for Franois brings us close to hatred for him. Anne's tired from the start weary and wary of men who think they're in love. I was shocked that she's only 25 just as I was that wise Lucie is only 15 and that Franois is as many years as he is past say 12. Even understanding the selfinterest and harmfulness of Franois' selfdeception it's hard not to wince at Anne's defenses however wise and justified they are. Better to savor the funnily wise Lucie. For twentyplus years until this recent viewing I remembered Lucie but could only picture Anne. Anne in my memory dark unruly hair bony going to or leaving a lonely single bed like a convalescent. I remembered her as having a cold yet she doesn't.The film's proverb is It's impossible to think about nothing. Long ago in a language class a language I never carried through with and retain very little of when the gruff prof challenged me Stop hesitating! I got up the nerve and the unlikely spontaneity to complain understandably in the language I stop to think when I speak English. This is normal for me. Why can't I hesitate in ? When you speak  he shot back without missing a beat don't think! Franois and perhaps more justifiably Anne dig their respective holes because neither of them can manage not to think neither can successfully think rien.But Rohmer's never so simple so expository. That moment in the caf caught unthinking Franois is deceived. Trivially but deceived all the same. Does that instant overturn the proverb? Don't know.".

This is largely because the emotional topology is neither simple nor relatively stable like the triangular formula it first appears to be.Franois is too matteroffact to go with the flow of this gestalt of rapidly metamorphosing relationships. Like a latterday Polyphemus he drowses dimly through a hazilygrasped landscape of romantic artifice and always fails to get the girl through the folly of an approach so direct as to be lumbering. Because he is so ponderous Lucie teases him to relieve her impatience.Franois threatens the essentially gossamerlike dance of youthful romance  the flirtatious touchandgo of creatures as yet unburdened with any sense of their mortality. But he also burdens the older Anne with his stolid inability to hurry after and keep company with her advancing sense of years and maturity. He lightly observes to Lucy in the park that he is chronologically stuck exactly midway between two women but it is the formula and not its significance which strikes him.He sleepwalks across a wideawake Paris from yesterday's literally exhausted love to the dawning of a new love at a temporal juncture which unfortunately for him does not coincide with the pattern of his shiftdistorted days. In a tragic conclusion to this farce of an elementary failure of communication the student who must work his way through college is shown as forever excluded from the smooth and easy path set before the privileged children of the hautbourgoisie. Indeed there is a double tragedy as Anne still appears to be languishing in an at least emotionally unresolved divorce and yet age has put her asunder from Franois thus robbing both of their natural and mutual haven from those whose fortunate background will ensure that everything will come to them as a matter of course.This is the dark side of Rohmer's generally more sunny world of gently bittersweet dalliance The film shows the point at which all the lightness must become serious. The pilot and his woman  is she wife? sister? mistress?professional associate?  seem to preside from an aloof and unknowable distance like Arcadian deities over the cruel twisting of human destiny.Their inexplicable appearances and disappearances mirror the faltering course of human affairs which do leave most of us moreorless in the lurch.There is a Mozartian harmony to this conception of how life produces not only winners but losers as well yet losers who are not obviously the wilful creators of their own fate. As a portrait of the apparently random strokes of fortune dealt by the endlessly absconding figure of the vaguely heavenlocated aviator' this film could even be said to breath the air of Classical Greece ... were Rohmer not so conscious of the artifice as to locate the impossible flirtation of Lucy and Franois in a park all of the bucolic features of which are entirely artificial. Amidst all the pretty lies one thing is certain Disillusionment.Yet Rohmer seems to believe  as the subtitle of this film suggests  that such a bleak world of conceptual emptiness would be literally unimaginable for the artist unsupportable for the creative intelligence. Quintessentially French it is the rational play of wit that satisfies and expresses this cool classical sensibility. Here he deliberately objectifies the limits of his own talent or humaninterest It is an admittedly delightful formula bounded on one side by the beautifully illuminated world of the aquarium by Anne's bedside and on the other by the crystalline confection of the snowshaker in Franois' nervously occupied hand as she freezes him out' but it is a formula nonetheless and can only describe the imagined regions of those with the temporal luxury  the time  to develop such a rareified sensibility.Neither shiftworkers nor disappointed women  the one cruelly pressed for time the other by it  can luxuriate in that fundamentally aristocratic sense of the infinite possibilities of self  the sense which gives to so many of Rohmer's films their particular quality of timeless dalliance. This is a game for kittenish teenage girls and their attentive swains and it presents them with no immediate consequences. It is in short amidst those who are still young and therefore truly alive that Rohmer wishes to remain. In this film he acknowledges the cruelty implicit in the intuition that life ceases once consequence is encountered. He has created a Garden of Eden in his delightful films of the delicate blooming of relationships but in La femme de l'aviateur' he has prefigured the inevitable temporal fall of this first waking dream of those young creatures who early stretch in the sun's first kindly rays in fields that seem made especially for their innocent sport.The aviator's woman is like the rainbow's trajectory The occasion of charming speculations which can only be pursued but never satisfied. Don't be misled by Rohmer's documentary style.' He is a poet not a realist. Or rather perhaps he is the documentarist of the evanescent the ephemeral  like the green flash of sunset in his Le rayon vert.'Perhaps this director expresses that very French nostalgia for the ideal aristocratic society of Romance  an impossible political Eden therefore? And a somewhat guilty pleasure on the evidence of. La femme de l'aviateur.' Yet what sensual pleasure is there but eventually leaves us sadder than we were?Like that annual holiday which we dream of all the rest of the year and which figure prominently in Rohmer's films or like that hopedfor holiday romance undefiled by the unromantic intrusions of the daily grind we are glad to be indulged by the prospect of escape even though we know perfectly well that it will all come back to earth again with more or less of an unpleasant bump. Unusually for Rohmer in this instance we are made very conscious of the disappointing nature of everyday reality during the course of the film. This atypicality wonderfully rather strengthens the artistic integrity and value of what the director wishes to do in the rest of his oeuvre. Maybe nostalgia for our lost Edens is after all sufficiently distinct from a defective grasp of reality to prevent our losing our heads...?".

The film is capsulized in oneday's span Francois Marlaud a young student whose night shift makes the relationship with his girlfriend Anne Rivire in strain after witnessing Anne left with her exlover Christian Carrire from her apartment in the morning and later a sour altercation with Anne a jealousydriven Francois compulsively follows Christian and his blonde companion Caillot and by happenstance he meets a 15yearold schoolgirl Lucie Meury the two improvise an amateurish but perky private detective team until they find out Christian goes to visit a lawyer. After Lucie departs Francois visits a stressinflicted Anne it seems they reconcile and Francois figures out who the blonde is. When the night falls Anne is out for an exhausting date and Francois accidentally finds Lucie kiss another boy so he sends a postcard to her and put a closure to their stalking adventure the story ends. There is no big twist or melodramatic plots in Rohmer's film he masterfully recounts the dribs and drabs of emotions pestering one's relationship and daily lives visceral and empathetic he unerringly captures the quirks and fluctuations of the characters he writes no largerthanlife frills everything returns to an authentic basis which reflects its transfixing mojo for example the intricate discovery of the blonde's identity is casually schemed but never condescending or audiencepandering truth reveals itself in its most trivial form also in the park when Lucie intends to take a Polaroid from two tourists it is lifelikeness never feel redundant in spite of its overlong progress which would be trimmed in most cinematic presentations but Rohmer is confident to let his audience to savor the subtle interactions among the players and keeps it vibrant. The sad trivia of the cast is Marlaud would soon die in a tragic camping tent fire accident after completing this film he was only 22 in the film he interprets a sensitive and diffident boy who is smitten with Anne an independent working girl 5 years older than him their onandoff rapport is under close scrutiny and Rivire takes on a more difficult role and dominates the screen especially during her expository declaration of her credo in selfreliance in her tiny apartment. Meury is a delight in the midstream maybe too quickwitted for a 15yearold but her natural selfconfidence could easily win audiences over. The titular wife only exists as a glimpse on a picture whose backstory would illicit another film feature to expound an existential individual's philosophical quandary about affection and compromise. Sadly there is no Rohmer in this world anymore.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's hard to explain what exactly is so appealing about the films of Eric Rohmer. A plot summary of any of his films would surely make it sound like a dull affair or possibly even a soapy melodrama. Rohmer's films aren't about plot however one might even say they defy plot. Instead of focusing on conventional narrative Rohmer concentrates on his characters. This is not to say that Rohmer chooses to show extraordinary individuals the strength of his characters is actually in their ordinariness. His characters seem like people I really know or at the very least like people I might encounter. These characters aren't dumbed down or simplified to be more universal either each seems like a uniquely realized person.The Aviator's Wife is about Francois a Parisian college studentmail sorter and his relationships with his older girlfriend Anne who he suspects is cheating on him and Luciea younger girl who picks him up in the park. Throughout the film we come to know both the flaws and strengths of these three characters each of whom is curious albeit for very different reasons about a certain aviator and his wife. Francois is naive and clingy but very kind natured Anne is strong but cruel and Lucie is cheery and intelligent but also dishonest and coquettish.The Aviator's Wife is the first of Rohmer's six Comedies and Proverbs films. The proverb this time around is It is impossible to think about nothing. Within the context of the film this seems to refer to the inability of some of the characters to understand the significance or lack of significance of the things they hear. This theme works well enough but the film as a whole fails to be as captivating or as interesting as the previous Rohmer films I've seen those being Pauline at the Beach and The Green Ray. This is especially apparent in the bedroom scene near the end of the film which goes on too long. Still the comical ending was a fun surprise.".

The Aviator's Wife the 1st in Rohmer's series of Comedies  Proverbs is subtle like poetry by full of the irony of urban existence. Set in his hometown Paris as most of his films are this is a film about a young woman's insecurity about growing old lonely and a young man's obsession with the slightly older woman. Artfully made with a color palette that seems to reflect the hues of the lives of the characters the film is talkative yet reflective and insecure with a certain confidence. . Miseenscene The character's motivations are developed with painstaking detail in an attempt to build characters that we may grow to either love or loath but irrespective respect as real people. I was drawn to the  young man's character in particular and to his singularly obsessive personality even though he was gentle and carefree at first sight.. The older woman was so typically stereo cast as idiosyncratic intense and detached in a manner only the French can be.  In the final scene one feel for the boy when he discovers that the young girl he meets on the bus has been feeding him all along but before we have time to react Rohmer makes a comic joke of the situation by spinning the movie into a loop so that we end up almost where we started except that we've got a different man that the protagonist is trailing this time around. . The Cinematography is bland almost dogma like way before the birth of Dogma this is 1981 and there is almost no emphasis at technique beyond functionality.  Yet sound is used to haunting effect with ambient sound playing a potent character.  Whether this was because of poor on location sound or whether this has been used as a stylistic element to enhance the narrative is however difficult to tell.".

Writer Gerard Stembridge takes the main facts of Cahill's life and gives them a slight spin most especially the latter stages to create an interesting mix of fantasy and reality. It's not as good as THE GENERAL Spacey and Fiorentino struggle with their accents and the finale is a bit much for us to swallow. But for all its flaws it's a lively and amusing piece if destined forever to fall in the shadow of its more illustrious forerunner.".

	onyx:emotionText "Based on the reallife figure of Dublin gangster Martin Cahill his story was also told in THE GENERAL released in 1998 this fastmoving crime flick has little new to offer but is worth a look for fans of the genre. Writer Gerard Stembridge takes the main facts of Cahill's life and gives them a slight spin most especially the latter stages to create an interesting mix of fantasy and reality. It's not as good as THE GENERAL Spacey and Fiorentino struggle with their accents and the finale is a bit much for us to swallow. But for all its flaws it's a lively and amusing piece if destined forever to fall in the shadow of its more illustrious forerunner.";

How he utilizes his cohorts and evades the police headed by Noel Quigley the extraordinarily gifted actor Stephen Dillane who played Stephen Woolf in 'The Hours'. The cast is good and makes the best of a confusing arc of storyline written by Gerard Stembridge. Director Thaddeus O'Sullivan keeps things moving along but slides into some boring and nonadditive variances from the plot and character development that threaten to grind down the film. Tack on a corny ending not in keeping with the real character on whose life the story is based and the recipe for lack of success in the theaters is obvious.But keep the expectations low and this film will entertain. Sad that for its distribution in the USA the cover of the DVD lists Colin Farrell as one of the stars Spacey Fiorentino Farrell which says a lot about PR grossness Farrell is a VERY minor extra here and should any other actor be listed in top billing it is Stephen Dillane! Not a great heist film but it's always good to see more of Spacey. Grady Harp".

A criminal a gentleman and womaniser in one person.Kevin Spacey was excellently casted as the male lead. Furthermore we see Linda Fiorentino as Lynch's wife Peter Mullan My Name Is Joe as Spacey's right hand and a very small part for Colin Farrell.

I stayed with the movie noticing differnt changes from the other great movieThe General but I was pleasantly surpised that the movie turned out to be really good.  Of course I felt that Linda Fiorentino was totally wasted in the part of Spacey's wife and poor Collin Farrell if he was in the movie more than 5 mintues that would be something. Overall I'd say the film was watchable.  Spacey is good and there are soild peformaces from the rest of the irish cast.

	schema:reviewBody "Kevin Spacey is without a doubt one of the best actors of the 90s. After his performances in The Usual Suspect Se7en and American Beauty you expect more and more from him. That is why Ordinary Decent Criminal is a huge disappointment.Michael Lynch is the most artful criminal in Dublin who is never in a bad mood. His next heist becomes an obsession when his partners start questioning Michael's ability to plan everything perfectly although this is the only thing he does when he isn't playing good father at home.I guess it's partly my fault for not paying enough attention to the thousand plot details which sadly turn out to be the essence of the film. I gave the movie a chance by calling it a parody and.... well parodies are always funny no matter what they spoof or how they do it. So it wasn't after all a complete parody on purpose. It's just a different con movie that desperately tries to be funny and fails.Unlike some of his colleagues Ordinary Decent Criminal depends too much on story development and logical continuity forgetting what's the main reason the viewer has picked this kind of movie  to be entertained. This is definitely not entertainment. It includes one of the most ridiculous scenes ever  the introduction of Michael's TWO wives. I don't know whether it's some kind of a mindless metaphor or strange dark humor but the chicks are sisters. Remember Spacey's character has kids.Ordinary Decent Criminal is complex and confusing. You are not waiting for a funny scene. Instead you carefully follow the dialog because there is a big possibility of losing yourself into the boring pale universe the film has inhabited.Let's go back to Spacey. I wonder in what condition he has been signing for that movie. It's not miscasting but something much worse. An insult to his work in American Beauty released an year before Ordinary Decent Criminal. The character Michael is eccentric and talkative. Spacey is almost pathetic at times. The only cure for this is thinking of Lester Burnham and Roger Kint.Writer Gerrard Stembridge should definitely reconsider his screen writing abilities and be more objective this time. Because the dialog is very weak and the scenes are often pointless. And we are still talking about a comedy.Ordinary Decent Criminal is a really bad crime comedy which does not deserve your attention.".

The relationship between the character played by Mr. Spacey and his two wives was tittilating without being pornographic as it was incorporated into his family situation.

I thought that I would give the movie a chance because of Collin Farrell who doesn't really say a word throughout the movie so I just lost interest from the beginning. As for the storyline I think that the director was attempting a comedycrime caper but it went totally wrong when he decided to cast an American in Ireland with a Irish voice who is surrounded by Irish actors. Disappointing!RoundUp I wasn't really expecting that much from this film because I hadn't heard of it before even though it has Collin Farrell and Kevin Spacey in it. After watching it I can totally understand why they kept this movie under the radar because I am sure that its one that they would like to forget. The amazing thing is that its supposed to be based on a true story which means that the director really cocked up the project because it all seemed a bit of a mess.I recommend this movie to people who are into there Irish crime capers. 110".

	schema:reviewBody "Ordinary Decent Criminal is sort of based on the exploits of Martin Cahill already the subject of John Boorman's 1998 film The General. Cahill had a rough upbringing in a slum area and graduated from petty crime to armed robbery with honours. He justified his criminal career by pointing out his poor background at every opportunity. This is a common excuse for criminals that conveniently overlooks the thousands of slumdwellers who don't turn to robbing post offices and selling guns in order to make ends meet. Cahill made fools of the police and local authorities not to mention the IRA which earned him a sort of Folk Hero status as well as making him many enemies. However he was basically an amoral selfserving thief.My primary problem with ODC is that the protagonist is made out to be a lovable Irish rogue. Kevin Spacey does a good job portraying Michael Lynch with a blend of oily charm and quiet menace but the character is too amoral and selfish to be seen as any sort of hero even an antihero. The film is well shot and well acted by a fine cast but what lets it down is the script. Writer Gerard Stembridge can't make up his mind is he writing an Irish Lock Stock or a grittier treatment of Martin Cahill's thieving career? That's the problem when a writer bases his central character on a real person. It's also unfortunate that ODC followed the cinema release of John Boorman's The General which was a more accurate portrayal of Martin Cahill's story. Cahill was a cunning thief who knew the value of good publicity so it's not surprising that his exploits got the movie treatment.What IS surprising is that a studio was prepared to take Cahill's story and give it a happy Hollywoodstyle ending. Kevin Spacey's charismatictwinklybigamistthief Michael Lynch gets to ride off into anonymity on his motorcycle in ODC. In the real world Martin Cahill was executed by the IRA just to prove that noone makes fools of an outdated sectarian and corrupt paramilitary organisation and gets away with it. The real Cahill would never have walked away from his notoriety because it bolstered his Man of The People selfimage. Having Michael Lynch give up everything to avoid death in ODC is a copout ending to a weak and shallow movie.".

What can I say about this film. Firstly the accents are so awful. Kevin Spacey's accent is terrible and Linda Fiorentino and what about Helena Baxendale. Don't bother watching it. By the way the way Martin Cahill who the film was based on was no handsome metrosexual like Mr Spacey he was a ruthless angry thug who roamed about Dublin in a poxy anorak and never drove flash cars. John Boorman's The General is a far better portrait of Mr Cahill. Give this movie a wide berth but be thankful that some Irish accountant and some wily investors got some tax relief because that is what the Irish film industry is an excuse for some tax relief.".

Just like in Mexico's Y tu mam tambin there are two guys interested in sex booze and rock'n and roll and a hot chick. Whereas y tu mam tambin is a master piece and well acted directed edited and told this movie falls short of its intentions in building a coherent drama. Acting is flat especially the wooden love interest the girl that goes to Lapland and is followed by the two main characters. Maybe the reason for her inexpressiveness is the poor dialogue but we are never really let to understand her feelings or her motives and while we are meant to believe that she is the object of desire of one of the main characters there's a complete lack of chemistry between them which made me wonder why would he ever skip a trip to Mombasa because of her. She is a nicelooking girl but seems so amateur and uncomfortable with the camera that it is almost painful to watch.The two main characters are good to look at and there lays one of the basic problems of the movie. They are bald yes but that's the only visible trace of their supposed illnesses. They run jump dance and have fun and just look too healthy to be cancer patients. No medicine is that strong. The guitar boy bears a strong resemblance to Mexico's Gael Garca Marquez only time will tell whether he has the same level of talent and is given little material to work with. The real star here is Yusa the crazy guy. Even if this character is highly exaggerated and the script lacks 'profoundness' the actor is skilled enough to put his heart and energy in the character and while he completely steals the movie together with the outstanding Finnish countryside he is the only real reason to keep watching it.".

Pete cancerboy and his friend Jusa want to go to Mombasa. Pete's cancer is bad and he won't survive. Boys start their trip to Mombasa and they meet Kata. Pete and Kata are more than just friends and Kata wants to come to Mombasa too. After this the movie is most boring ever. It was fun before Kata came when boys were having fun. But when she comes you can stop watching the movie. The story is OK and actors are fine but I don't think it's very interesting. If you like Finland and our boring movies this is for you.

Again in Keinohrhase he is totally taken up with that funny but also dressy womanizer 'Ludo' who is working as a gossip reporter always going prey on explosive pictures from local stars. After a very tricky shoot on an important star happening which ends in an clat he is sentenced to do community service for a not insubstantially period of time at a kindergarten where he meets his unimposing school mate Anna and destiny continued to unfold. It is a very romantic and hilarious picture which could have been normally attributed to kitschy Hollywood. But as it arises from a German production it appears to be a bit fresher than any plain American romance. It is not really kind of a new plot but it directly goes into your heart due to a disarming love story which is pepped up with great actors who are doing very funny and bright dialogs. Its absolutely spoton for Christmas. Best Scene is the intro with Jrgen Vogel".

Til Schweiger has managed to shoot a movie classic this film will find its place in German movie history. The cast reads like the who is who of German cinema and delivers some unforgettable acting performances. I think Nora Tschirner and Matthias Schweighoefer will soon be recognized as two of the biggest young acting stars not only in Germany. In combination with the hilarious story and the stellar camera work Keinohrhasen will set a new standard for romantic comedies.

It's an overly familiar romantic comedy that trades on European sensibilities for a distinctively American atmosphere.Just as in Barefoot a love story of a selfinvolved cad and a depressively sweet escapee from a psych hospital with an aversion to footwear Schweiger uses the same sort of emotional modulation  with a touch of transparent manipulation and a fair amount of feelgood montages  to present its apparent mainstream appeal of the adorable differences between men and women. You could transplant everything here from a Frankfurt to New York setting while a Matthew McConaughey could easily play Schweiger's dapper hunk and a Sandra Bullock could slot in as his female costar Nora Tschirner  the latter being a dead ringer for the Hollywood star.So what's a rabbit without ears but just another flaw to be overcome? Schweiger plays Ludo a paparazzi reporter who sees his work and women as one venture. Till he messes up and gets 300 hours of community service at a local daycare facility run by an exclassmate the frumpily attractive Anna played by Tschirner who still harbours an improbable resentment of Ludo and his teasing over 20 years ago.But what's even more dubious is how easily these setups and facades drop to accommodate the inevitability of its central pairing. Ludo finds his redemption being surrounded by enamoured toddlers while Anna falls deeply into a void of selfesteem which is to say into the arms of the obliviously receptive Ludo. It could just as readily be named Men Are Dogs and the Women Who Love Them.Schweiger lazily allows the strings to be seen. There are scenes so ludicrously over the top and undeveloped that questions about the writing and editing have to be raised. Characters cease to act like they were written and anachronistic scenes mar emotional payoffs that could have been promising given the film's punchy performances and frequently wry dialogue.Sex is fundamental to these upwardly mobile Germans but the utter puerility of sexfaces and loud restaurant reveals aside the understated view on sexual politics is particularly lurid. The strongly defined angular features of Schweiger augments an ability to convey quick nods of sympathetic posturing  an incredibly useful tool that belies Ludo's selfish actions and blurs the perception beyond acceptable behaviour and the resulting consequences of its main pairing. Schweiger needs to rediscover the sweet emotionality of his previous film and disregard the rank superficiality of this film.".

TS's character however is so outrageous that I was constantly tempted to turn my TV off. I only kept watching because I didn't want to write a review about a movie that I did not finish. TS must have had a very long midlifecrisis fit while writing the script. The story completely misses plausibility while containing a lot of show time for TS a.k.a. Ludo Ihaveastupidfirstname Dekker Ludo not only is good looking he also must be earning a considerable wage knows perfectly well how to deal with children and gets the last word in every argument. His only apparent fault is a lack of ability to feel true love. Luckily in the end he even proves that he actually is able to love a girl and thus exchanges his label great guy for Superman. Along the way the spectator's opinion about Ludo's personality worsens from scene to scene. He is not capable of doing one single nice thing. Hence the spectator wonders why a beautiful woman who is obviously hiding her beauty behind a pair of atrocious glasses falls for a guy like that. On top of his knowitall manner he used to bully that same girl big time all the way through grade school. On what basis could she possibly fall in love with him? While he never says a word of apology to her she actually apologizes to him for treating him badly during their mutual work in the playschool. The only thing Ludo really has to offer is his look. Admittedly TS is quite good looking especially for his age even though I strongly suspect that he has been to a few plastic surgeons during his time in the US. I do also suspect that Jrgen Vogel's opinion about plastic surgery announced in the beginning of the movie is actually an exaggerated presentation of TS's own belief. Anyway MY belief is that TS made a movie about his very own life. He surrounds himself  in films as well as real life  with women who are way too young for him his current girlfriend is 25 years younger than him and tries to defend that behaviour with a movie like this one. Pathetic!!!".

If done correctly they are able to use the actor within themselves to their full potential as they know their own limits.This is the latter case. Til Schweiger again plays a cynical guy who seems to immune to love or affection. He has given a wonderful performance and done an admirable job in directing as well. He reprises the character he plays in Barfuss which also has a very similar feel to this film. I saw him in this movie first so I like it much more. Of course Barfuss is almost as good and I recommend it if you have liked this movie.Also the scenes with Jrgen Vogel were hilarious.".

Cue lots of cute scene of macho hardbody Til Schweiger being a super surrogate dad for the tiny tykes and eventually and predictably falling for the square she wears glasses ugly duckling Anna.So the story is supernaff and Til Schweiger plays the only role he is capable of himself but this is partially compensated by the female leads Nora Tschirrner Anna and Alwara Hfels Miriam Anna's sassy colleague. While Hfel is likable as the trashtalking floozy with a heart Tschirrner believably and memorably carries of her role of a socially inept and insecure everywoman by rebranding her natural laconicism as the protective shield of a social outcast.Overall it wasn't as bad as I had anticipated.".

I liked The screenplay of Anna Nora Tschirner was amazing I didn't know her before and I have to say that she is a great actress! you really buy it that she's a nerdy and stubborn girl. Ludo Til Schweiger was great too. He is an amazing actor and really talented. He fitted the role perfectly in my opinion.I didn't like The jokes. Most of them were pretty lame BUT the good ones made me laugh really hard what compensated this a bit. The story could have been much more complex in my opinion. Also I found some of the scenes pretty awkward or unrealistic...as for example near the end of the movie when Anna and Jrgen walk over the red carpet and she wears her usual boring nerdy outfit I was like yeah as if that would ever happen. And the scene when Ludo crashes through the glass ceiling...total unnecessary if you ask me. They should have focused more on the character and love story development than on lame jokes and stuff that was maybe considered as 'action' or something... I don't know. So i give this movie a 6 star rating.".

Till Schwaiger should train his voice because most times you can't understand a word because of his mumbling.To be honest I must admit that I just went to see this movie because of Nora Tschirner. She played a role in a TV Series that I kinda liked. The story had some good laughs  more than I did expect from a romantic comedy. In the end it gets kinda romantic as it should be and the happy end is preassigned. But thats how it should be like .I am no huge friend of that genre but I was well entertained and not bored during the 115 minutes. Even boys who are more comfortable with the action  horror genre and have a girlfriend go and watch the movie. For all the heardbreak stuff you get Nora nude lol. Let me have a word about the nudescenes they seemed to be designed just to get some men seeing the movie. They did not really fit into the story and they could have easily been left out. There was no need to have Nora that often naked apart from the scene on the toilet what was really funny and was good for a good laugh. ...and that out of the mouth of a man that is not gay lol shamed.Anyway to sum it up I enjoyed the movie ".

What I didn't understand was the reason why she has to do two brief totally superfluous nude scenes. What we get to see is really not that remarkable.

Oh and by the way JanJosef Liefers had a cameo in this film just a heads up to the database keepers...";

	schema:headline " Long dull unfunny clichd";
	schema:reviewBody "When Keinohrhasen or Rabbit without Ears came out in 2007 it was a really big deal in Germany. Having been a young kid back then I revisited this film out of morbid curiosity a couple days ago and I must say it really doesn't hold up that well. The story is of course terribly formulaic which in and of itself doesn't mean the movie can't be good. If the performances are likeable the jokes land and the film is wellexecuted I could forgive Rabbit without Ears for its clichd plot if it at least offered me a fun ride. Sadly Til Schweiger's film doesn't have enough charms to distract me from its faults. The positives of the film are mostly found in the performances Nora Tschirner as the female lead is pretty good. Her shy somewhat awkward demeanor is elevated by her natural charm so that feels rather authentic. And although he has since become one of the more annoying actors working today in German cinema Matthias Schweighfer can in small doses bring a welcome amount of energy into the film as Schweiger's sidekick. These two are probably responsible for most of the laughs that the film got out of me. Now for the negatives. For starters the images are really ugly to look at. I suppose Schweiger is a huge fan of O Brother Where Art Thou? because he has put a reddishbrown filter over every single shot in his movie just like the Coens did seven years previous. But while the Coens' film's atmosphere and gorgeously shot landscapes were somewhat enhanced by the nostalgic sepia tones Schweiger's film which takes place mostly indoors or in the cold sterile megacity that is Berlin seems utterly claustrophobic. He did the same thing in his previous feature Barefoot and while it already didn't work there it at least fit with the more melancholic mood of that film. Another element that brings the film down is unfortunately Schweiger's performance. He is awfully wooden in the main role and giving the role to someone younger and more agile would have made the fact that every woman in the film seems to fall for this guy a lot more believable. He seems mostly cold and uninteresting from beginning to end with the few moments in which he genuinely develops some chemistry with his supporting cast not being enough to sell his character arc. The fact that said arc has been done so many times before for example in Schweiger's earlier Barefoot doesn't help to make his performance more bearable. The script is not exactly wellwritten either. Every character in the film could completely be described with their respective character trope. Til Schweiger  Womanizer with commitment problems. Nora Tschirner  ugly duckling. Matthias Schweighfer  comedic sidekick. Rick Kavanian  angry boss. It doesn't help that there are very few funny jokes in the movie. I expected the worst before going back and watching this film again and while Keinohrhasen was better than I expected  not by much. If the film were shorter funnier and better to look at it might make for a decent enough junkfoodlike flick but I found it rather tedious and boring.".

Yes I understand people sometimes joke with each other in a relationship but when this is all we get almost all movie it makes me wonder what the hell are they seeing in each other. Specially when the female character falls in love for the other main character over a small act of human decency.The soundtrack is simply horrible. It seemed chosen by a 15 year old girl. There is also a ultra awkward explanation about types of man with regards to their sex prowess. It seemed totally uncalled for and made me cover my eyes while recoiling in not serious way.The movie has a few bright spots such as when a little kid gets a dart stuck in his head and says in a funny cold fashion that he doesn't hear a thing giving us a small taste of dark humor in a movie that doesn't set that tone at all. Another funny part was when the main female character had to use the bathroom but couldn't close the door.

	schema:reviewBody "DESERT FLOWER is a very powerful film that introduces many viewers to the atrocities of Female Genital Mutilation defined by the dictionary as 'FGM also known as female genital cutting and female circumcision is defined as all procedures that involve partial or total removal of the external female genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs for non medical reasons. FGM is typically carried out on girls from a few days old to puberty. It may take place in a hospital but is usually performed without anesthesia by a traditional circumciser using a knife razor or scissors.' Though that is not the main driver of this story it certainly makes the life of Waris Dirie who wrote this autobiography recognized as someone who overcame insurmountable odds to become one the world's top models and a speaker for women's rights.Liya Kebede stars as Waris Darie and is the perfect choice of an actress to fill this role she is an International supermodel actress and philanthropist born and raised in Addis Ababa Ethiopia. In 2003 she was the first woman of color to become the face of Este Lauder cosmetics.Waris Dirie Liya Kebede was born in Somalia and was subjected to FGM and fled across the desert to freedom form the heinous attitude toward women Waris as a child is beautifully portrayed by Soraya OmarScego. She struggles though dreary jobs eventually hooks up with Marilyn Sally Hawkins0 who introduces her to the world of fashion via Terry Donaldson Timothy Spall learns how to dress and walk in heels and eventually becomes the great model we know us as today. She has love interests Anthony Mackie but her aim is to gain enough credibility and money to go before the WHO and speak against the mutilation that exists in many countries to this day.Directed by Sherry Horman who adapted Dirie's autobiography for the screen with Smita Bhide the visuals are spectacular and the manner in which the story is related is full of passion and compassion. The entire cast including Juliet Stevenson Meera Syal and Craig Parkinson is pitch perfect. But it is Liya Kebede who fills the screen not only with her beauty but also with a powerful performance of the main character. A very fine film with a heavy message. Grady Harp".

FGM is typically carried out on girls from a few days old to puberty. It may take place in a hospital but is usually performed without anesthesia by a traditional circumciser using a knife razor or scissors.' Though that is not the main driver of this story it certainly makes the life of Waris Dirie who wrote this autobiography recognized as someone who overcame insurmountable odds to become one the world's top models and a speaker for women's rights.Liya Kebede stars as Waris Darie and is the perfect choice of an actress to fill this role she is an International supermodel actress and philanthropist born and raised in Addis Ababa Ethiopia. In 2003 she was the first woman of color to become the face of Este Lauder cosmetics.Waris Dirie Liya Kebede was born in Somalia and was subjected to FGM and fled across the desert to freedom form the heinous attitude toward women Waris as a child is beautifully portrayed by Soraya OmarScego. She struggles though dreary jobs eventually hooks up with Marilyn Sally Hawkins0 who introduces her to the world of fashion via Terry Donaldson Timothy Spall learns how to dress and walk in heels and eventually becomes the great model we know us as today. She has love interests Anthony Mackie but her aim is to gain enough credibility and money to go before the WHO and speak against the mutilation that exists in many countries to this day.Directed by Sherry Horman who adapted Dirie's autobiography for the screen with Smita Bhide the visuals are spectacular and the manner in which the story is related is full of passion and compassion. The entire cast including Juliet Stevenson Meera Syal and Craig Parkinson is pitch perfect. But it is Liya Kebede who fills the screen not only with her beauty but also with a powerful performance of the main character. A very fine film with a heavy message. Grady Harp";

	schema:headline " drama and fairytale but not an easy movie";
	schema:reviewBody "Desert Flower is a weird movie. It is based on the life story of Waris  Dirie a supermodel up there with Naomi Campel and Cate Moss. The  movie focuses on the time from just before her discovery until her big  success with constant flashbacks of her childhood in Somalia and her  way to London. Liya Kebede plays a wonderful Waris Dirie very lovely  and full of surprise and fear of the daily life we all take for  granted while at the same time showing great bravery and a strong will  to fight for a better life. The rest of the cast is medium at best a  positive exception only the character of Terence Donovan the  photographer. The director did not resist  the temptation to give Waris a sort of funny sidekickfriend as well  as the stereotypical IJumpedOutOfThe Devil Wears PradaMovie   manager to add some slapsticktouch which was totally unnecessary.  The movie does not leave anyone untouched though it has some  heartwarming and touching as well as some very cruel and disturbing  passages. It is funny and sweet when Waris is struggling with the  British everyday life making friends and so on. It is hard to bear  when you are faced with drastic pictures of a 3 year old girl being  circumcised with a 19year old woman suffering still from this cruel  and brutal violation and with the fact that a whole tradition tries to  justify this. And that is the main weak point of the movie. The changes  from the funny light and sweet scenes to the brutal and cruel ones  come without warning. The editor or director does not give you the time  to set your mind to that kind of situation and after a hefty scene  they just switch back to the light comedypart as if nothing happens.  While I understand the intention for me as a viewer I could not enjoy  the funny parts  which were never the less intended to entertain the  audience. I recommend this movie if you can handle the topic but do  not look for a entertaining biopic with some depth. It has  entertainment it has depth but it tries to deliver both but never  brings it home all the way in the one or the other topic.".

An old woman in the desert cut away those parts that could someday allow her to feel sexual pleasure.When Waris was sold as a young teenager to an old man who already had three wives she simply left one day walking hundreds of miles across desert and scrub land to seek her grandmother in Mogadishu.

The film cuts between her experiences as a young girl and what happened in London where she ran away lived on the streets and were befriended by a ditz shop girl named Marylin Sally Hawkins.It is while sweeping floors and cleaning slop at a McDonalds that she's spotted by fashion photographer Terry Donaldson Timoty Spell. Donaldson saw something in the bone structure of the cleaning lady that convinced him to give her his card. Waris was all worried trying to be model but thankfully Marylin knows her fashion and persuades her several months later to pop round and see him. She's soon on her way.Desert Flower is an important movie and a great one for all African women to see. Dirie's lifestory is inspiring for me her experiences as young girl are tragic and her ability to speak out against a custom that has long been hidden is impressive. The film certainly has an important message. The scenes that will remain in the memory long after the film concludes are those dealing with Waris' circumcision particularly an excruciating sequence in which I watch her three year old face as the procedure is performed. It's an angry damning indictment of a barbaric process. Which I wish it will stop.".

Mixed with the short mini flashbacks of Warris's life before coming to the UK they show the eventual story and reasons surrounding her presence. With little left to the imagination for the viewer Desert Flower leaves nothing short of a very educational story of a Somali woman coping with the taboo subject of female circumcising.As this truly is an autobiographical journey of Warris Dirie many people will find that much of the film is filled with emphasis on abuse  and that is the term that I would use in all manner of the word and expression  as the depiction of the young woman's life is put through sheer hell. With the help of her friends however Marylin and Terry the journey becomes possibly less raw and more tolerable for living as normal as anyone who has witnessed all that Warris has.Desert Rose is absolutely riveting viewing for those who find their True Stories more appealing than Fiction and Fantasy of which there is none of that within the scenes of this movie. We believe that maybe Desert Flower has broken ground in every possible place concerning the subject matter that it exposes the viewer to not to mention award winning for the strength fight and progress in the approach to the United Nations concerning the inhuman suffering that other country women like Warris have and are still going through.Timothy Spall playing his top modelling photography character acts out his parts with excellence as does the sometimes hard faced Lucinda who is played by Juliet Stevenson. Combining the world of fashion and real life together the overall and sometimes harrowing parts of a tortured life brings the viewer ever closer to the point where they will shout cringe or even remark loudly on such treatment that Warris goes through from a young age. If the viewer can get past the point of her Somalia Culture Tradition of young girls then what they will find is a welcome sigh of relief as to the outcome.DVD Archive Rating 1010 Top marks for a truly great directed factual based film".

The scenes of 3year old girls's circumcision were disturbing and sad but necessary. I watched the movie as a biography of Waris Dirie but it wasn't. The message given throughout the movie was deeper than the life of a Somalian girl. I cut two points because there were some missing points. For example this sad girl did almost nothing that really helped her during her way to be a top model her roommate and the reception lady. The turning point to be a model was indeed her meeting with her roommate and her acceptance to the hostel. The day she changed her life was the day when her roommate told Waris that he is a famous photographer. The fashion agency lady was weak and looked like a fake Miranda Priestly. This is my opinion of course but it disturbed me because that strong fashion character already processed by Meryl Streep successfully and I didn't like to see a fake Miranda. Anyways I liked the movie in general and it wasn't boring at all. What I liked most was they never used an expression as if this is a Muslim tradition. This is not and this cruel and pervert practice cannot be any religious in any way. I wish this movie attracted more attention to the Waris Dirie foundation and treated as Silver Linings.".

	schema:reviewBody "The movie is autobiographical and makes the grade as a well made movie. It is easy to understand and follow. There is a story that is compelling and rewarding. I liked many aspects of the music and cinematography.However the movie is important because it has a shocking affect on the viewer with regard to the widespread use today of a barbaric practice of female genital mutilation or FGM. It is a practice steeped in obligation most often based in religion but also cultural. Watching the movie demands the viewer make efforts to speak out and stop the practice. That can mean just shouting out to our politicians and demand greater controls in these areas most often targeted for foreign aid money. How do we get religious leaders to scream at the people and reject such barbaric Hadiths and interpretations. Watch the movie and be moved.".

	schema:reviewBody "A young Somali girl is at the center of this film based on a real story. Waris a young shepherdess lives with her nomad family tending to the herd camping everywhere in an inhospitable landscape. The family is dominated by a matriarch as we seldom see the father. Waris who is a teenager as this tale begins is horrified when she is sold to an older man with three wives. The only solution is to run away from that situation. The best thing is to find her grandmother in Mogadishu a trek that will take her days across the arid countryside.In flashbacks we get to know Waris best kept secret. She had the indignity of having been circumcised at the tender age of three by an older woman who performs the ritual that mutilates women's vaginae rendering her unable to feel or have any pleasure during intercourse. In fact the barbaric act kills a lot young girls who bleed to death by the way they are cut. Through ignorance this practice is done in a lot of countries. Waris is not the only one but she had the courage to speak publicly about it and create an outrage as she presented her case in the United Nations.Waris Dirie ended up in London as a teenager brought to work at the Somali embassy as a maid. When war broke in her native country she had to fend for herself. Through a kind soul who took pity on her Waris was able to make something out of herself. A lucky break came in the way of a photographer that realized her potential and she rose to the ranks of super model because of her beauty and talent which in a way plays as a Cinderella story in comparison to the hard life she endured as a child.Directed by Sherry Horman the film has two narratives. Waris' life in Africa and her meteoric ascent into becoming a fashion model. The best part of the film is the first one because it is more realistic with a clear message about a fact that has been played in the press from time to time but whose practice continue to maim young females throughout the world by men hating women and subjecting them to a barbaric procedure that kills a large number of young females as was the case of two of Waris' sisters. The London part of the story is more artificial when compared with the more real African narrative.Soraya OmarScego the young actress that plays Waris is quite compelling in her determination to leave behind family to look for a better life. Liya Kebede is the adult Waris. A ravishing beauty no doubt a successful model herself she seems credible. Wonderful Sally Hawkins is seen as Marilyn the English woman who befriended Waris and took her under her wing. Timothy Spall Juliet Stevenson Craig Parkinson Meera Syal are seen in supporting roles.".

But the plot although real is unrealistic and the frames and shots not to mention the story are absolutely superficial. The movie probably wants to convey us its rightful disgust for excision practices yet it prompted my disgust by treating its own main character as mere merchandise in accordance with some of our Westernworld values.

	schema:reviewBody "As a South African who saw this film on Friday morning I can tell you you the entertaining inspiring and enjoyable Invictus exceeded all my expectations. It really is a true story of epic proportions yet it's told with an intimate feel and it is at least 98 accurate to the events of the time. Clint gets all the big details and so many of the little details right but he never goes over the top. He directs with minimum fuss and achieves maximum effect just letting the powerful story unfold without getting in its way.I watched the 1995 Rugby World Cup and saw Madiba come out in the Springbok jersey. It was a wondrous sight. And when Joel Stransky slotted that drop kick over in the dying minutes and the Boks won I wept and cheered along with everyone else. After the match millions of South African  of all races  celebrated. It was an amazing time. It was the birth of the Rainbow Nation. Nelson Mandela is the greatest and most beloved of all South Africans. The man is a living legend but so human and real. When he was President he brought hope to all South Africans white and black. We in my country will never stop loving this incredible man. Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman did South Africa and our beloved Madiba proud. Francois Pienaar is also an amazing South African an intelligent bighearted rugby played who always led by example and Matt Damon's performance as him was superb. I was glued to the screen for every second of the film's running time I didn't even move from my seat until the final credit rolled and the house lights came on and I was moved to tears on several occasions. The final scene was especially touching.Freeman's performance was magical and I can see him getting as Oscar nomination. If you think his Mandela is too cool to be true think again. Mandela really is this cool. A brave and intelligent man whose courage and strength of character should serve as an example to people all over the world. After being unjustly imprisoned for nearly 30 years by a cruel and repressive regime he emerged to run a country and teach its people the meaning of forgiveness and reconciliation.I thoroughly recommend the authentically detailed historically accurate Invictus to film lovers Eastwood fans Nelson Mandela fans and sports fans everywhere in the world. South Africans would be crazy to miss this excellent film but it deserves to be a hit all over the globe. Let's hope it is.Viva Clint Eastwood viva Morgan Freeman viva Madiba.PS. I'm a huge fan of Clint Eastwood as both an actor and a director.Of the films Eastwood has directed my favorites in no particular order are Unforgiven Million Dollar Baby Gran Torino The Outlaw Josey Wales Letters From Iwo Jima The Bridges of Madison CountyBird and Invictus. Yes it's really that good. Invictus is another winner from Clint. He just seems to get better with age. What a creative roll he is currently on.PPS. Invictus is one of the best sporting movies I have ever seen. But it's also about more than sport.".

	schema:reviewBody "In surely one of his lightest and straightforward works of his career Clint Eastwood has achieved one of the most inspirational films of the year with his new film Invictus.Starring Academy Award Winners Morgan Freeman as South African President Nelson Mandela and Matt Damon as Rugby Captain Francois Pienaar Invictus is a picture full of emotion magnetism and revelation. What critics and audiences may be deceived by is belief that this is THE Nelson Mandela biopic which it is not. It is the story of Nelson Mandela's first years as President of the culturally separated country South Africa in 90's. In a way to unify his people Mandela used the country's love for Rugby to connect the whites and the blacks. As their record has been less than impressive no one expects anything notable from the Springboks. Mandela taps the captain of the team to rally his troops and surge into battle for the greater good of his country.Everything about Invictus works on so many degrees of the medium based on the book Playing the Enemy. The film never comes off as too pretentious or egotistical it requires nothing more from the viewer than an open mind and heart. Eastwood directs the film perfectly laying back when he needs to never pushing the subject matter or shoving it down our throats. He utilizes all the skills we've come to love about his earlier works in Million Dollar Baby Mystic River and Letters from Iwo Jima. The use of light shows a character' s vulnerability inhabiting their souls or a score by Kyle Eastwood that offers both zeal and subtlety during a rugby match. Cinematographer Tom Stern hits another one out of the park catching all the fury and apprehension of all the different elements of this strenuous time. Joel Cox and Gary Roach edit the film with the perfect amount of precision and friction. Morgan Freeman as Mandela is a wonderful charmer showing the man's most hostile yet tranquil behaviors. Not necessarily the most engulfed characterization seen on film this year as Freeman's accent comes in and out of remission but it's a tremendous performance worthy of an Oscar nomination. Matt Damon showing himself as one of the best working actors today doesn't have enough of the character depth and arc to carry the picture. Damon's performance doesn't allow him to really go anywhere. It's a superb turn with a great accent inhabitance that warrants credit where the credit is due. However Damon requires nothing more than a little motivational speaking and responsive humility.Invictus is one of the best pictures of the year standing in the ranks of one of the best sports films of the decade. This is the type of film that Oscar will likely be all over and fall in love with. I concur. ".

However Mandela's backing of the rugby team splits many hairs as the Sprinboks have come to be a symbol of apartheid for millions of South Africans making Mandela risk the very base that pushed him into office. He must also deal with personal security his exhaustive schedule and the strains on his personal life.As much as I respect Morgan Freeman I was concerned that his presence would be distracting that I would be seeing him instead of Nelson Mandela. I shouldn't have worried. Freeman completely immerses himself into the role and gives one of the best performances of the year. Not only are his accent and tone of voice quite good but he brings a true 3dimensionality to the role. Compare for example him having tea with Francois to talking with his family and to making a political speech. Freeman nailed every facet of Mandela's life.Damon also excels as Pienaar the solid enough rugby player who must do more than just lead by example for his team. The screenplay adapted by Anthony Peckham doesn't offer many narrative surprises but it does do a good job examining not only the strife South Africa was in when Mandela was elected but also the value of the team to the entire nation. Eastwood wisely plays the material straight. Though the material may seem familiar the performances by Damon and especially Freeman are what elevate this tale into a solid and even uplifting drama.".

	schema:headline " Inspiring and uplifting!";
	schema:reviewBody "Originally I thought this movie was going to be a biopic on the life of Nelson Mandela. To some degree it is a biography on Mr. Mandela but the film's main focus is on his idea of inspiring a country that is drawn to crime violence and poverty after years of Apartheid to a glimpse of hope via the nation's rugby team. Without a doubt this is the perfect role for Morgan Freeman. I will note that his accent comes and goes throughout the film but he nails the role down. He is not overly dramatic nor does he just read the script. He becomes the man. Morgan Freeman is easily one of my favorite actors because he never plays himself. He always makes himself into the character he's assigned to. He'll definitely receive the Best Actor nom and hopefully Morgan can finally win the Oscar he so desperately deserves.Regarding Matt Damon as the rugby coach Francois Pienaar he too immerses himself into his role. He even maintains a solid accent. However the sympathy of the film is aimed towards Mandela than it is to Francois. The other cast members none of which I recognized also gave decent believable performances. As with the plot it is predictable something we've seen beforeunderdog overcomes impossible odds yet screenwriter Anthony Peckham throws in many important themes that may seem all to familiar but is nonetheless eyeopening such as forgiveness unity and determination to do what is right. Racial tension between the whites and blacks is dominant in the movie particularly between the black and white security guards but the film's point as well as Mandela's goal is to put our differences aside and work together as one.The movie isn't just about a rugby game but rather organizing a nation to a success. It may be considered a wise political move on Mandela's part but as Morgan says to his aid It is a human calculation. People need inspiration in order to change and to do good. These themes are what make it a good film. It also makes it a different kind of sports movie. Tom Stern's cinematography is wonderful and this time he doesn't make the movie all sepia tone like in Letters of Iwo Jima or Changeling and I congratulate the editors Joel Cox and Gary Roach once again for making each shot beautifully seamless and well structured for the storyline. The music by Kyle Eastwood and Michael Stevens is not just a pretty tone that plays along with the movie but it adds some oomph and emotion. I particularly love their choice of African vocals for it not only makes the film feel more real but it is absolutely beautiful to listen to. Clint Eastwood has done another great movie. Not only has he captured the themes of the story but also the poverty of South Africa as well as the intense rugby sequences. There are some powerful scenes in this movie as well as some intense and suspenseful ones and even ones that'll make you smile. For the first time in a movie for this year I actually cried. Not because of sadness but from joy.Invictus is an inspiring film. Some backstory could have been added to the characters and the first act could have been faster but overall I enjoyed this film. Invictus proves that it doesn't take special effects and big action sequences to make a great film. It is excellent to see one of our great old directors to recognize this and display it so wonderfully without being preachy about it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Invictus is an enjoyable film Morgan Freeman is great as Mandela and it's an inspiring story. The movie revolves around the 1995 Rugby World Cup and Mandela's attempt to unite South Africa behind its rugby team. Mandela develops a relationship with team captain Francois Pienaar Matt Damonplaying the role of mentor and motivational coach. Although it's wellmade and worth watching. As a rugby fan I was a little disappointed with the action on the field although most ordinary filmgoers may not notice. I am not convinced the director Clint Eastwood really understands the game and the actors hired to play the Springboks didn't really look the part. At 5'10 Matt Damon is a little small to play the 6'3 and 240 lb Pienaar. Pienaar was a popular charmer with a ready smile and a real ambassador for South African rugby. Damon still seemed to be playing Jason Bourne. It was an intense performance but it wasn't how I remembered Pienaar.South Africa had not been allowed to play in previous world cup tournaments and the years of isolation had left the Springboks uncompetitive. They were seeded ninth coming into the tournament but exceed expectations by reaching the final. The action focuses on the final match with New Zealand. New Zealand had an amazing wing running back in the 20 year old Jonah Lomu who at 6'5 and 265 pounds seemed unstoppable. South Africa really were the underdogs. It was also the only time that the All Blacks have managed to reach the final since 1987. They usually get beat by the French 1999 2007 or Australia 1991 and 2003in the quarters or semis. Overall it's nice for rugby to finally receive some recognition from Hollywood because it's a major global sport. It's a good film.I discovered that Invictus is a short poem by the English poet William Ernest Henley. The title is Latin for unconquered. It was first published in 1875.".

It was also the only time that the All Blacks have managed to reach the final since 1987. They usually get beat by the French 1999 2007 or Australia 1991 and 2003in the quarters or semis. Overall it's nice for rugby to finally receive some recognition from Hollywood because it's a major global sport. It's a good film.I discovered that Invictus is a short poem by the English poet William Ernest Henley. The title is Latin for unconquered. It was first published in 1875.";

	schema:reviewBody "People forget that Nelson Mandela came to power at a time when his country was bitterly divided. There was the bitter experience that white South Africans saw in their neighboring countriesi.e. Rhodesia now Zimbabwe and other nations where the White colonialist had been replaced by Black African politicians and a stable government had been replaced by corrupt selfserving regimes where those in power feathered their nests after seizing the assets of their former White citizens and placed all their friends in positions of authority with the result of the country going to the dogs. The scene where the Afrikaaner newspaper remarks Mendela can get elected but can he run a country and the superb Morgan Freeman remarks to his bodyguard that the headline raises a good point.In a sense this film is about Mandela. The rugby team becomes a metaphor of what he faced when ascending to the presidency a nation divided. Noting that the Black South Africans were cheering for the opposition in the face of the old Apartheid guard whose love of rugby unified them. It's easy to forget that there was a great division among White South Africans i.e. the descendants of the Boers Afrikaaners and the rest. There was even a middle ground with the Coloreds Asian South Africans being caught between these two worlds and there were bitter rivalries among the competing African political interest groups as well.Mandela's focus on reviving the national rugby team and making it a symbol of a new united nation homes in on the role of Matt Damon an Afrikaaner who's the captain of the team. Francois is the catalyst that makes this story work and Damon the rugged Mick from Boston does a fantastic job showing the transition from hopelessness to hope as many White South Africans felt at that time. The wonderful thing about this film is its touching on all the levels. It goes beyond being merely the story of a single man or group of men. Sure we love a feel good movie and of course we love an underdog can win flick but this film works works because its about people working together to rebuild something new for everybody.The film reeks with great moments Pienaar visiting the cell where Mandela spent more than 20 years of his life thinking and planning The New Zealand Rugby team doing their Maori threat dance before the match the jet buzzing the field before the game and so on. See it. Enjoy it. And don't forget it's a bit of history. Romanticized? Somewhat. Mandela wasn't able to solve all of South Africa's big problems but he did one bangup job for the Springboks.".

	schema:reviewBody "Clint Eastwood manages to top himself with this true story of how the new president of South Africa Nelson Mandela used the national rugby team foray into the World Cup to unite his country after years of apartheid. Eastwoods soft touch provides a timely but not heavyhanded message about hope and change that probably wont be lost on American audiences. The result is beautiful exhilarating and wholly inspirational.Mandela played with effortless dignity by Morgan Freeman is fresh out of prison and desperate for a way to rebuild his country which has been torn asunder by the heinous policies of apartheid. Mandela comes to believe that the most sensible way for this to be accomplished is not by making speeches in faraway lands but to give his countrymen something they can all cheer about. His solution is to galvanize the national rugby team which to date had not been a particularly successful club and had been given very little chance to compete on an international stage like the World Cup. Mandela pins all of his political hopes on the clubs chances should they fail he will appear to have behaved frivolously in paying so much attention to a sport and the black people and the white people would be even farther apart.The odds were decidedly against the Springboks of South Africa. The team was a certified failure so much so that the coach had just been axed. Captain Francois Pienaar Matt Damon is frustrated. Times are so bad in South Africa that during the teams matches the white audience members cheer for South Africa  but the black audience members cheer for the opposition because the team itself is almost entirely white with only one black player. Indeed after Mandelas election as president South African groups vote overwhelmingly to drop the traditional rugby nickname Springboks as a way to shed themselves of all reminders of the apartheid era. Mandela realizes that such a action would instead drive a further wedge between the two races so he countermands the local votes and maintains the nickname and the traditional greenandgold uniforms.Sports movies in general are expected to follow a particular formula more so than other films. That is if were met with a ragtag band of sandlot players we expect them to somehow persevere by the end of the movie. This is one of the few genres in which such predictability is a major plus. Sports movies are meant to manipulate you shamelessly and youre a willing permissive participant. Invictus certainly plucks all the heartstrings it can but the bonus is that these events actually happened. This isnt The Mighty Ducks beating the bad guys or Henry Rowengartners Cubs winning the World Series this is a reallife rugby team gaining strength wisdom and inspiration from their newly elected president to triumph over steep odds.That said this is less a movie about winning the championship and more about unification. Mandela who had been imprisoned for 27 years had steep odds of his own to contend with. Although democratically elected there were still plenty of people throughout the country who really didnt trust their new leader at all and were convinced that he would lead them all to ruin. Sounds a little familiar and I assume that the timing was intentional on the part of Eastwood. Mandela had to unite everyone beginning with his own staff in order for the country to move forward and have a seat at the proverbial international table.Because of this grand vision Mandela takes a personal interest in the fortunes of the rugby team even to the point of rescheduling events so that he can watch the matches either in person or at least on television. He is careful not to intrude too much in the training and management of the team particularly Pienaar.Now granted this is an American movie made for American audiences so there are some concessions. For one thing the rules of rugby have to be mentioned at least once and not enough as far as I was concerned for another the focus isnt just on the political machinations and aspirations of Mandela but rather on how the team itself reacts to its new success and the attempts by its captain to inspire them to evergreater heights. What this slight sleight of hand does is present the idea of postpartheid attitudes in the framework of an athletic event something American audiences can always care about no matter the sport. Excellent decision by the director I think because the overall message is enhanced rather than obscured by the experiences of the Springboks.Even with the political subtext and even among sports movies which themselves are usually very evocative this is a highly emotional film. The rugby scenes are so well done so fantastic to watch that nonfans like me  who dont know a thing about rugby  cant help but let down their steely resolve and cynicism. This is a happy optimistic movie but its not a funny movie. There was hardly a dry eye in the theater today thanks to the powerful rugby scenes and I have to admit I havent teared up that much at any movie in a long long time. Eastwoods strong direction pushes the audience into the right direction but we go willingly and happily. Freeman is commanding in the role he was always meant to play Mandela himself wanted Freeman to portray him and even Damon is excellent as the South African rugby captain. This is a true winner in all aspects of film.".

Wanting to unite his country he found a way to do so with rugby and in the South African team captain Francois Pienaar.Morgan Freeman was born to play this role he knew so and that's why he produced this film. A dream project of his waiting for someone to take the job of directing his old friend Clint Eastwood steps in. Who says no to Clint? Especially Freeman who under Eastwood's direction won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. Invictus William Ernest Henley which is read by Mandela in the film is well crafted and has a strong lead role. Unfortunately the film is a by the numbers product that you seem to forget once you leave the theatre.My main problem with the film is the lack of emotion. I couldn't care for any of the characters in this film save for Freeman who as I stated does an excellent job. Matt Damon who is shown on the poster has the supporting role here. But he is given absolutely nothing to do except play rugby. His character has no story to him but aren't we suppose to believe in him? After all Mandela does. He gives him inspiration to win the world cup. Matt Damon does an alright job but nothing worth mentioning. The same goes for the rest of the cast they seem to be there just because the story is based on real life. Eastwood knows how to direct a film the Academy seems to think so too so you know going into it that it well be well crafted. This is Eastwood's first step into a semi sports movie genre. The sport is rugby and after watching the film I still have no idea how to play it. The final act of the game is in slow motion as well clichd? You know it. You can hear every grunt from every player. It is elongated to the point of annoyance. The rugby sequences did not pull me in nor did I care for who was going to win. It doesn't feel like he is trying to step out of his comfort zone either. It feels like an Eastwood movie take that as you want. The best parts of the film are when Freeman commands the screen. His presence is more interesting and entertaining than any of the rugby scenes. Speaking of a rugby scenes I must say that every 'epic' shot of the fans in the stands looked horribly fake. At some points I thought I was watching a PS3 game. It really took me out of the experience of the film. If the film were a bit shorter and more focused is it a sports film or character driven film? than I could maybe invest my interest. It seemed to balance both as nice as it could but ultimately gave out to one more than the other and unfortunately it's the weaker part. Eastwood chooses to sidestep more important things in the film. Is this because of the script? Are we suppose to want to keep watching Mandela inspire a rugby team to unite nation? The racial undertones are there at the beginning then completely forgotten. In the end I wanted more from this film.The film is not bad it's moderately good. Some scenes are actually inspiring but that's more because of Freeman and not the generic script. I guess I wanted a little bit more from this one. Everyone involved made it seem like it should have been a great success instead it comes off as something that everyone just decided to throw together. This is another film that belongs in that category of good but not good enough for me to want to recommend it to you for theatre viewing.".

	schema:headline " A marvelous film to flash us back to South Africa's most precious historical moments...";
	schema:reviewBody "Indeed a lovely and feel good movie that reminds us how a nation so stricken by apartheid and rebellions and 14000 civilians dead is able to heal and its turning point in history in reconciliation and strife for democracy. Director Clint Eastwood's film does pay tribute to both Nelson Mandela and the captain of the previously hated Springboks rugby team Francois Pienaar for the Springboks's epic win against New Zealand's All Blacks with the final 1512 score at the 1995 World Rugby Cup as well as for their initiating the first major step towards white and black South Africans living together in acceptance. And that famous hand shake we see in the film really does speak a lot. The match between the two teams at Johannesburg's Ellis Park Stadium in 1995 is so phenomenally presented on screen. Boy it does look so real that I can't help myself cheering for the Springboks as if it's a life event! Eastwood too brings humor in the film. Boy that famous moment with the All Black's gigantic superstar being tackled near the tryline by the big size Springboks defender! And the black and white Presidential guards gradually building up their trust in one another! These are so captivatingly funny. And with minutes ticking and Stransky does his amazing kick sending the ball almost 100 ft to strike the drop goal to deliver the final score for Springboks' victory is so stunningly awesome! Fabulous film direction from Director Eastwood! The scenes with Matt Damon's visit to the prison are extraordinarily chilling and fabulously crafted... reminding the viewers of the 27 yeas of prison and hard labor Mandela had to go through in his fight for his people's freedom against the NP's apartheid programs. Director Eastwood's film offers incredible spot on with facts to include the Springboks' green and gold jerseys with their Springbok and Protea emblems! And after the Springboks made their epic win over the All Blacks watching Morgan Freeman's Mandela presenting the trophy to Matt Damon's Francois Pienaar while wearing a Springbok shirt with Pienaar's own number 6 on the back it's impossible not to be touched by that scene. Indeed the many who had watched that particular match in 1995 Rugby World Cup can relate to that scene as seen live on TV worldwide. Morgan Freeman does play Mandela to a tee Mandela's frailty his gait his charm and the way Mandela talks and smiles! And Damon is also no lesser credible as an Afrikaner rugby captain! Anyone familiar with Francois Pienaar would be able see Damon and Pienaar's physical builds are pretty similar. Boy oh boy do I love his Afrikaner accent! Indeed my best feature film seen so far for the Oscar race. A true work of artistic filmmaking value that superbly unfolds South Africa's major historical events and moments! To observe the faces of hope on screen is so heartwarming. I certainly hope that this film and both Freeman and Damon would be getting Oscar nominations. I really can't wait to get all my family members and friends to see this film! Best feature film I've so far seen for the Oscar race!".

Anyone familiar with Francois Pienaar would be able see Damon and Pienaar's physical builds are pretty similar. Boy oh boy do I love his Afrikaner accent! Indeed my best feature film seen so far for the Oscar race. A true work of artistic filmmaking value that superbly unfolds South Africa's major historical events and moments! To observe the faces of hope on screen is so heartwarming. I certainly hope that this film and both Freeman and Damon would be getting Oscar nominations. I really can't wait to get all my family members and friends to see this film! Best feature film I've so far seen for the Oscar race!";

The attitudes of Damon's family help to exemplify the resistance to change. The attitudes of the South African blacks toward the mostly white South African rugby team reflects the deeply held anger of people who have suffered repression for generations.The movie is a testament to the power of courageous personal character when it is grounded in respectfulness and pragmatism to inspire others to change attitudes that are deeply held.The use of rugby as a tool to effect change is most appropriate. Clearly everyone in the country cares deeply about the sport. The sport itself is quite brutal. Clint Eastwood does a superb job of conveying this element of the sport as well as the importance of attitude in influencing a team's performance.".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Invictus";
	schema:reviewBody "In his last 2 films Clint Eastwood addressed the challenges one person faced against a corrupt established system in the Changeling and in Gran Torino took on racism head on with himself starring in the lead role. With Invictus I felt that it combined his last two films into one with another veteran actor Morgan Freeman stepping into an historical role as Nelson Mandela at a time just after being elected and faced with a deeply divided society across racial lines. This is not your usual runofthemill biopic and you can trust the award winning filmmaker to weave yet another wonderful engaging film.Set in a time just after Nelson Mandela was released from prison and elected President of a postapartheid South Africa still fresh from its racial divisive wounds the story based upon John Carlin's book Playing the Enemy Nelson Mandela and the Game that Changed a Nation traces the parallels in the challenges that Mandela had in governing a new country whose citizens still harbour deep resentful mistrust against those of a different skin colour with that against South Africa's national rugby team known as the Springboks in their uphill quest for World Cup glory having initially been written off as nohopers in the tournament. We all know how sports can bring people of all races class and all strata of society together galvanized behind a winning team and celebrating victories as a nation. In fact we've seen it for ourselves in our early days of nationhood with Kallang being the battleground in which folks come together to cheer our football team on regardless of race language and religion. The same can be said here where Mandela with so much on his plate chose to put some focus on the Springboks in their World Cup journey knowing that his plan trivial though crazy as it may seem at first had all the foresight in knowing that reconciliation as a nation is within reach. All that's needed is for team captain Francois Pienaar Matt Damon to believe he and his team can deliver.Part of what contributed to this masterpiece is that the lead actors Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon both disappear into their roles. I've said enough thus far that Morgan Freeman remains one of my favourite character actors though his role as this historical political figure takes the cake. He took great pains to study the mannerisms of the man he's portraying and the result is magnificent with what I've garnered from news reels on even his speech patterns gotten right down to a pat. As a man who walks the talk we see this through the appointment of his security detail as well as how he engages his back office team to look beyond skin colour and to focus on ability instead to do their jobs to the best of their abilities. This cinematic Mandela is as great an orator as the current US President though at times when Eastwood tries a little too hard to force the messages of peace and forgiveness through the speeches monologues or dialogues do seem a tad heavy handed.Audiences would likely be more familiar with Matt Damon's action role as Jason Bourne though he has proved his acting chops through the Ocean ElevenTwelveThirteen series and his weight gain to play The Informant! Here he converts those fats into muscle mass to play rugby player Pienaar though he had to rely on camera tricks and angles to make him look a lot bigger than he actually is. With his hair dyed blonde and new found bulk he does look believable as he is charismatic in trying to also walk what Mandela has talked to him about with responsibilities on the pitch to galvanize a team into believing they've got a shot at the largest trophy of their sport.For all the economical minimalist that Clint Eastwood is reputedly touted for in his films when it comes to the crunch he too does demonstrate that he's up to the mark in delivering epics based on history such as his WWII magnum opus seen from both warring perspectives. A remarkable thing here about the film is that there's not a single actual archived footage that was used as far as I can tell save some static photos in the end credits. Everything got recreated right down to the exhilarating rugby games against the English West Samoans French and the famed New Zealand All Blacks Check out that Jonah Lomu lookalike and that Haka! and the way Rugby got shot here will leave a fine impression on you if not turn you into a fan of the game in the shortest time possible.But what was real was a powerful scene which was set in the actual cell that Mandela was incarcerated for years where if I were to be put inside that same cell I'd probably go insane given its bareness as well as not being able to gaze outside and smell fresh air unless to perform hard labour. It's an emotional sequence and one that will allow you to appreciate just how magnanimous Mandela was when he got released versus the very human trait of wanting to seek revenge for injustice done against oneself.Language wise it may be a little difficult to listen to the South African accented English at times but don't let that turn you off. It's another World Cup this year football's that is which will be held in South Africa but before that swings by in Summer make time for Invictus and you'll be rewarded with yet another fine film from a director whose craft ages like fine wine with masterful performances and an engaging storyline. Highly recommended!".

	schema:reviewBody "Clint Eastwood was probably the only filmmaker who could produce a film on Nelson Mandela that centered on a side event that became a major initiative in the history of South Africa and the world. He chose to center the film on the Springboks and their victory in the World Cup of 1995. That was a brilliant idea since it showed Mandela as a real transformer of human beings. It also brilliantly proves man does not make history. A certain thickness of imbecility was needed to pile up in the minds of some not to see that the enslaved majority of the South African population could not remain slaves for ever. Let my people go. The choice if it is a choice and not the only logical sequel of the fifty preceding years that Mandela does was to center his own action on a sports event that could unify the people in a victory. And we can see how little it takes to attract the attention and the heart of the other a cup of tea for instance served by the President to his guest Franois like Jesus washing the feet of his disciples before the Last Supper though forgiveness is not that easy and yet easier for the victims of the bad treatment than for the people who inflicted that bad treatment. Those had to become aware of the hardship of that treatment to finally be conscious enough to forgive themselves and to forgive the victims. Clint Eastwood then adds some symbols to strike our eyes the little black boy carried by the white cops on their shoulders after the victory. The green Springboks cap Mandela is wearing at the end not as a provocation of the All Blacks but as a symbol of his support to his team and as a symbol of the unity of the country around their team. This film is first of all emotional for us who have lived these dark years and harbored for a night or several some AWOL special force soldiers who were deserting apartheid. And how many pages of ANC press releases have we translated for the whole world to know about their fight. And yet we wonder at the end who is the main character of this story. Nelson Mandela or Franois Pienaar. This appears clearly in the remarks these two exchange when Mandela gives the cup to Franois. Thank you Franois for what you have done for South Africa. No Mister President thank you for what you have done for South Africa. And the green Springboks cap Nelson Mandela wears all the time is not a provocation to the All Blacks but the sign of his support to his team and the symbol of the reunification of South Africa thanks to that sports event. Then the answer Franois makes to the journalist when this one asks him if he was encourage in his fight by the 63000 people in the Stadium is prophetic We were not supported by 63000 people but by the 43 million South Africans. That makes us very humble in front of history that no one can stop than some can only slow down and some others encourage and help in its own direction. And we will forget Henry Kissinger's answer when he refused to support Nelson Mandela the political prisoner that he accused of being a communist. One of these details in history that get lost in the pages of some encyclopedia and then is forgotten by humanity.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne University Paris 8 Saint Denis University Paris 12 Crteil CEGID".

	schema:headline " Invictus Turns The Truly Inspiring Nelson Mandela Into A Platitude Mouthing Yodalike Character.";
	schema:reviewBody "I recently celebrated a milestone birthday. As I reflected upon the day I thought about the sheer number of unlikely things that have occurred in my lifetime.Back when I was ten the idea that Great Britain and the IRA would ever achieve a ceasefire was at best a dim prospect. Likewise no one thought the USSR would ever dissolve or that the Berlin Wall would be dismantled and the idea that a black man would one day be elected President of the USA was given about as much a chance of happening as finding two identical snowflakes.The thought that South Africa a county where racism WAS the official government policy would ever end its evil apartheid ways was almost inconceivable. Adding to that the fact that the citizens of South Africa elected themselves a black president was an almost unbelievable turn of events.Then in order to prevent his country from devolving into resentment and revenge President Nelson Mandela a believer in the power of forgiveness established the Truth And Reconciliation Commission where people could admit to their past racist misdeeds and then be publicly forgiven.This showed me that the people of South Africa both black and white have achieved a level of grace and civility that we Americans can only dream about.If you don't believe me just listen to any Teabagger or wingnut religious conservative on contemporary talk radio. You won't hear more foolish hateful nonsense this side of a fascist dictator. However what the real Nelson Mandela did to avoid the potential revenge and recriminations of the people is an inspiring story that truly gives me hope for mankind.So how come Invictus proved to be one of the most annoying experiences I have spent in a movie theater in a long time? Was it because director Clint Eastwood has reduced Nelson Mandela to a supporting player in his own life and instead focused his film on a white rugby team?Was it because he turned Nelson Mandela into a Yodalike character sputtering out banal philosophy that would embarrass even the flightiest of New Age nitwits or even a serious New Age nitwit like Deepak Chopra? I mean what has happened to Clint Eastwood?How can it be that after directing about 30 feature films Eastwood still has not developed any kind of camera sense. I find it hard to accept the sloppy choices of angles and coverage in Eastwood's films especially since he usually works with very competent cinematographers and editors.Every poignant plot point is telegraphed well in advance so any chance of surprise or insight is muffed. Is this what his vast experience in the film industry has taught him?Clint Eastwood has spoken with admiration of some of the directors he has worked with in the past like the Hollywood studio trained minimalist Don Siegel and the operatic Italian Sergio Leone in fact he's even dedicated films to those two masters. Why Clint Eastwood now desires to direct films like Ron Howard is a true mystery.But there are a couple of things in Invictus that even the anemically talented Ron Howard would never have done. For instance what's with all the musical montages that serve no purpose but to slow down an already leaden pace?What's with the unforgivable instance of showing a massive jet liner buzzing the rugby stadium during the final game? Now I know that the plane buzzing actually happened but Eastwood uses this incident as a way to instantly tap into our post 911 awareness of planes flying into buildings for terroristic purposes to create a false moment of tension.I mean even the most xenophobic American who cares not one whit about what happens outside the borders of the continental United States would have at least heard about a jet liner crashing into a rugby stadium in South Africa during the World Cup game which by the way is actually played for by teams from around the world most unlike our own masturbatory baseball World Series where we even celebrate the lunacy of two teams from the same city competing with each other as if this were something culturally significant.I could have told Eastwood that he was on a fool's errand if he was specifically trying to make an inspirational movie. If an audience finds some kind of inspiration from your film that's great but they are the only ones who can do that. If you try to impose that feeling on people you will just end up sounding preachy and scolding and believe me the only thing worse than false sincerity is false inspiration.Invictus is a two hour plus scolding lesson full of inspirational haranguing that has the effect of pummeling you into brain dead but laudatory submission. But when the whole damn fool audience is cheering at the most clich of sport movie banalities it is easier to just flow with the crowd.Although not explained clearly the title Invictus is Latin for unconquered and is the title of a famous poem by William Ernest Hensly that ends with the lines I am the master of my fate I am the captain of my soul.Apparently Nelson Mandela used to recite the poem to himself during his long imprisonment to help keep himself sane. But there is a more recent use of the poem Invictus that deserves to be mentioned.It seems that when Oklahoma City Bomber Timothy McVeigh was executed on June 11 2001 he used the Hensley poem Invictus as his final statement. Why do I find that coincidence much more interesting and intriguing than this film? But hey if it's inspiring enough for Timothy McVeigh who am I to argue?".

As I reflected upon the day I thought about the sheer number of unlikely things that have occurred in my lifetime.Back when I was ten the idea that Great Britain and the IRA would ever achieve a ceasefire was at best a dim prospect. Likewise no one thought the USSR would ever dissolve or that the Berlin Wall would be dismantled and the idea that a black man would one day be elected President of the USA was given about as much a chance of happening as finding two identical snowflakes.The thought that South Africa a county where racism WAS the official government policy would ever end its evil apartheid ways was almost inconceivable. Adding to that the fact that the citizens of South Africa elected themselves a black president was an almost unbelievable turn of events.Then in order to prevent his country from devolving into resentment and revenge President Nelson Mandela a believer in the power of forgiveness established the Truth And Reconciliation Commission where people could admit to their past racist misdeeds and then be publicly forgiven.This showed me that the people of South Africa both black and white have achieved a level of grace and civility that we Americans can only dream about.If you don't believe me just listen to any Teabagger or wingnut religious conservative on contemporary talk radio. You won't hear more foolish hateful nonsense this side of a fascist dictator. However what the real Nelson Mandela did to avoid the potential revenge and recriminations of the people is an inspiring story that truly gives me hope for mankind.So how come Invictus proved to be one of the most annoying experiences I have spent in a movie theater in a long time? Was it because director Clint Eastwood has reduced Nelson Mandela to a supporting player in his own life and instead focused his film on a white rugby team?Was it because he turned Nelson Mandela into a Yodalike character sputtering out banal philosophy that would embarrass even the flightiest of New Age nitwits or even a serious New Age nitwit like Deepak Chopra? I mean what has happened to Clint Eastwood?How can it be that after directing about 30 feature films Eastwood still has not developed any kind of camera sense. I find it hard to accept the sloppy choices of angles and coverage in Eastwood's films especially since he usually works with very competent cinematographers and editors.Every poignant plot point is telegraphed well in advance so any chance of surprise or insight is muffed. Is this what his vast experience in the film industry has taught him?Clint Eastwood has spoken with admiration of some of the directors he has worked with in the past like the Hollywood studio trained minimalist Don Siegel and the operatic Italian Sergio Leone in fact he's even dedicated films to those two masters. Why Clint Eastwood now desires to direct films like Ron Howard is a true mystery.But there are a couple of things in Invictus that even the anemically talented Ron Howard would never have done. For instance what's with all the musical montages that serve no purpose but to slow down an already leaden pace?What's with the unforgivable instance of showing a massive jet liner buzzing the rugby stadium during the final game? Now I know that the plane buzzing actually happened but Eastwood uses this incident as a way to instantly tap into our post 911 awareness of planes flying into buildings for terroristic purposes to create a false moment of tension.I mean even the most xenophobic American who cares not one whit about what happens outside the borders of the continental United States would have at least heard about a jet liner crashing into a rugby stadium in South Africa during the World Cup game which by the way is actually played for by teams from around the world most unlike our own masturbatory baseball World Series where we even celebrate the lunacy of two teams from the same city competing with each other as if this were something culturally significant.I could have told Eastwood that he was on a fool's errand if he was specifically trying to make an inspirational movie. If an audience finds some kind of inspiration from your film that's great but they are the only ones who can do that. If you try to impose that feeling on people you will just end up sounding preachy and scolding and believe me the only thing worse than false sincerity is false inspiration.Invictus is a two hour plus scolding lesson full of inspirational haranguing that has the effect of pummeling you into brain dead but laudatory submission. But when the whole damn fool audience is cheering at the most clich of sport movie banalities it is easier to just flow with the crowd.Although not explained clearly the title Invictus is Latin for unconquered and is the title of a famous poem by William Ernest Hensly that ends with the lines I am the master of my fate I am the captain of my soul.Apparently Nelson Mandela used to recite the poem to himself during his long imprisonment to help keep himself sane. But there is a more recent use of the poem Invictus that deserves to be mentioned.It seems that when Oklahoma City Bomber Timothy McVeigh was executed on June 11 2001 he used the Hensley poem Invictus as his final statement. Why do I find that coincidence much more interesting and intriguing than this film? But hey if it's inspiring enough for Timothy McVeigh who am I to argue?";

	schema:reviewBody "From a close intimate encounter with one of the greatest leaders of our time to a big joyful sports event that helped shape a nation Invictus will take you on a journey of discovery of the crucial elements that inspire us in life. In the early 1990's the world went through major political changes that were coming in the wake of the walls falling in Berlin in August 1989. In 1990 Nelson Mandela was released after 27 years in prison. In 1994 he was elected the President of South Africa. Invictus takes us back to 1995 just one year after Mandela was elected president in a time when he struggled to gain the confidence of the white population and had to live up to the expectations of the blacks. South Africa is the host country for the upcoming Rugby World Cup and Nelson Mandela cease the opportunity to make this event and the nations Rugby team the Springboks a catalyst for uniting the nation. Clint Eastwood brings us into the world of Mandela and show us a man that is torn between the love of his country and the love of his family. Eastwood manages to create a good balance of personal reflections and the public difficulties that Mandela faced at this time. The overall atmosphere of the movie is quite uplifting in contrast to what is characteristic about Eastwood's movies such as the gloomy setting in Mystic River or the melancholic sports drama in Million Dollar Baby. Mandela is played by Morgan Freeman who has studied Mandela in great detail and spend much time with him in real life. His work sure paid off as he comes off the screen as the real soft spoken and yet authoritative leader we all know so well. The other important character in the movie is the Springboks captain Francois Pienaar. Pienaar is played by Matt Damon that does a good job of showing the white man's perspective and help us realize the questions that runs through his mind in his search for understanding the changes his the country is going through with Mandela as the new leader.The real life story that Invictus is based upon recorded by the journalist John Carlin's in his book Playing the enemy makes this one of the best biography movie I have seen this year. It does not try to explain all of Mandela's life but give us a glimpse into a crucial moment in his life and help us understand the qualities that made him a great leader and what ultimately made him the man elected by blacks and whites to unite South Africa.".

	schema:headline " Great work from Freeman and the story but everything else feels average or amateur at best";
	schema:reviewBody "While not exactly a biopic per se Invictus does tell an important piece of Nelson Mandela's Morgan Freeman life as President of South Africa. With the country's rugby team losing horribly match after match he looks to Captain Francois Pienaar Matt Damon to help unite the team in time for the country's hosting duties of the 1995 World Cup and in turn unite a country still reeling from apartheid.Clint Eastwood continues to defy all Hollywood conventions with Invictus his ninth film of the decade. The man is going on 80 but he is pumping out more movies than heavyweights like Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg. And with each passing film he continues to up his craft and his scope for what he is capturing on screen. While Invictus is nowhere near the epic undertaking of the twofer of Flags of Our Fathers and Letters from Iwo Jima it still stands as a very accomplished work. But much like Flags it is a very flawed work.The story itself is fairly well done. It is predictable of course but is sappy in some wrong places. It is not quite Remember the Titans for adults like I heard it described as but it borders on feeling much the same way. I find it interesting that the first real story we get about Mandela dramatized on screen is more about rugby than it is about the man but Eastwood presents it in such a fascinating way that it manages to work as a depiction of him. There is a great reverence on display from the beginning with actual TV footage digitally manipulated to add in Freeman over the real Mandela and at every turn the story stays consistent with these early images. It jumps around in focus between Mandela and Pienaar but it never feels bothersome and always feels like a well rounded tale. Unfortunately that tale does not always stay as interesting as it could.But while the story is not bad the editing is all over the place. After really beginning to hit his stride Eastwood seems to be falling back and looking more amateur in some of the scenes on display here. Some run too long others too short. Others are left far too open ended and some too preachy. Even worse some scenes have characters fading in and out like ghosts pushing a heavy handed message about the unfairness of the system too far. Having seen his previous work it is clear Eastwood knows better than this so why allow these elements to take away from what could be a fantastic piece of work? The ending rugby match that seems to run on forever has a lengthy period of time where everything runs in slow motion. While this is typical for a sports film especially for the team playing Eastwood makes everything run in slow motion the team the fans watching in the stadium the fans at home and at bars Mandela himself. And it runs for more than five minutes like this overkilling and destroying any suspense or tension the film has going for it because the audience begins to laugh at how ridiculous the scene looks. It reminded me a lot of what I can only explain as the 'Gatorade' sequence from Spielberg's Munich where one of the most intense scenes in the film is ruined by a goofy slow motion sequence. It takes you right out of the movie the last thing any filmmaker wants to see happen.The music fares even worse. While the African inspired songs that play throughout the film are very well used in their sequences there are a few Englishspeaking songs that are just wrong for the film. Thankfully Eastwood does not sing any himself unlike the hilariously bad tune that nearly ruins Gran Torino but the lyrics are just awful. Again they took me right out of the film and made me laugh more than anything. They may help describe what is going on but in the forms they are given to us they do nothing but take away from everything. While I was a little disappointed to hear another similar Eastwood score in other cases the addition of an African influence causes the score to sound all the better and more original. The man can only use a similar score for so many films before it becomes stale and thankfully it is altered to sound all the more unique.While his accent is not perfect Freeman delivers another fabulous performance. The man may be ageing as quickly as Eastwood but his technique never wavers. His soft spoken and generous nature is only complimented by how easily he slips into the character. He has just the right amount of power and gravitas in each scene that it is hard to realize it is not actually Mandela playing himself on screen. It is a very personal performance that is just as inspiring as it looks. It is not the performance of the year but it comes really close to competing with it.Damon on the other hand does not fare so well. He just does not come off as believable as the rugby team's Captain. His accent falls somewhere between Freeman's great accent here and Nicole Kidman's horrible attempt at Italian in Nine. But even despite that his character is just not compelling enough to make us really care about his struggle to help Mandela achieve his goals. When he does make it work he does well for himself. But those moments come too few and far between.I wanted to like Invictus more than I did. Freeman delivers and the story is fairly well done as well. But the rest just feels either average or amateur at best. The film is not bad but it could have been significantly better edited.6.510.".

Eastwood tells us a fantastic inspiring story and he simple asks us to go in with an open mind.Morgan Freeman as South African president Nelson Mandela and Matt Damon as Franois Pienaar the captain of South Africa's rugby team the Springboks are magnetic on the screen. Freeman is terrific as Mandela playing the role with charm and charisma. Matt Damon has done the performance of his career. His role doesn't get enough time to develop as much as Mandela but what he does he does amazingly well.Invictus is a film with some incredible heart and emotion and it was one of the best films of 2009 by far.".

Not surprisingly his supporters see this as the ultimate opportunity for pay back to the white community for all the years of oppression. But Mandela is a different kind of leader. He believes in working hard to unite all the people and forgiving those who have harmed him and his people. Everyone assumes Mandela will replace the white leadership of the struggling national rugby team with his own. However Mandela sees this as an opportunity to unify the country through sports. He commits himself to working with the existing white leadership and particularly the captain of the rugby team played by Matt Damon. He challenges Damon to rise to the occasion and capture the World Cup which they are hosting. He is taking a great risk with the future of his leadership. Based on the true story of Nelson Mandela and South Africa it is part history part leadership lesson and a moving sports drama. Highly recommend.".

This movie is a hilarious farce with the living dead which plays with the wounds of the finnish society. Some people take the symbolism very seriously and refuse to understand the meaning of it. For example it is very common for people to move out of the countryside to bigger towns and in this movie it is portrayed as zombies coming to the city and at least one of them trying to find a job and a woman. Well isn't that just life portrayed in symbolic manner? The characters are made really dumb but that is a way of portraying attitudes and prejudices of upperclass towards the laborers. The red troops who were defeated in the civil war are also resurrected from the dead. I find that idea very bold in a way because anything of the civil war is hardly ever portrayed in movies in this manner and if it is there's always only one truth.This is really an underrated gem that is hard to find anywhere. It is not to be taken seriously it is mostly comedy with very little horror elements.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a fascinating film. The story of a modern day Virgin Mary dealing with issues like human sexuality and the divinity as well as themes of intelligent design creationism are challenging for the viewer to say the least. Godard has always been way ahead of his time in terms of formal aspects of film as well as sociopolitical points of view. This film was shot in 198485 and he addresses issues that are very relevant to the contemporary resurgence of faith  especially in American society today.The fact that the professor's teachings are thinly veiled creationism as science is very revealing. It provides background and encourages the viewer question what is really going on with Mary and the idea of the creatordivine affecting her body and her life.The nudity is not exploitative. A feminist reading of the film would probably be positive since the character of Mary is shown as intensely selfaware and strong rather than victimized or exploited.The cinematography of Menoud and Firmann is excellent throughout. This applies to both the nature photography as well as the narrative composed shots. I think a lot of the shots were composed with the idea of replicating some classical paintings Giotto Fra Angelico with severe foreshortening. The sound track is multiplelayered mix of music from Bach St. Matthew's Passion concertos and Dvorak dialog and sounds of natural environment and wildlife. It's a relatively short film 78 minutes but it's amazing to see and hear how densely compact it is with a very complex relationship of sound and image. The way this film tackles the concept of divinity as it pertains to modern life is bound to cause controversy amongst conservative followers of organized religion precisely because it forces you to question what is taken as absolute. Whether you find it blasphemous or reverent is beside the point that's the difference between spoonfed mainstream movies like POTC and the engaging cinema of Godard. You will find no moralistic pandering here. If you are closeminded or easily upset about nudity then this film is not for you. If you have an open mind and are just curious to see what one of the true masters of cinema was capable of 20 years ago then you should see this interesting film. If you are willing to question the story of Mary not only from a theological perspective but from a postmodern point of view then it is essential viewing.".

The narrative is fractured much more so than even his classical films such as Breathless and Pierrot le fou and it is impossible to understand exactly what's going on. Like in many of his early films he plays with sound effects and music. It may have been clever and interesting in Une femme est une femme but it has grown old here.Still Hail Mary like First Name Carmen musters enough mood to make it well worth seeing. With First Name Carmen I was interested at the beginning and bored by the end. Here although the prologue is quite good the first half of the real film bothered me and the second half grew more interesting as it progressed. What I'm saying here is that you have to stick with it and be patient. It can be rewarding.Also Hail Mary seemed to me one of Godard's more visually accomplished films probably second to Vivre sa vie. You'll see some of the most gorgeous photographs of clouds and the sun the moon fields flowers and nude women. Some of the nudes are absolutely stunning and it never felt to me pornographic unlike First Name Carmen. They reminded me of beautiful paintings that I have seen by the likes of Lucien Freud I don't know if people know him but I was particularly struck by some of his sleeping nudes I think he is the son of Sigmund and I know he was a companion of Francis Bacon. Other more abstract photos reminded me of Picasso. 710.".

	schema:reviewBody "After checking out a couple of Godard's eighties work First Name Carmen which is a very good movie and King Lear which is one of the most fascinating carwreck adaptations of Shakespeare to come out of European cinema I knew I had to check out Hail Mary as by historical account got the kind of treatment that was almost bestowed on Last Temptation of Christ and Dogma. The religious right in America and abroad thought of the film as blasphemous many said this before seeing this and crude. I wouldn't compare Hail Mary to Last Temptation in controversy since neither one really has anything to be controversial about. Whatever a viewer might take the film as good or bad it doesn't degrade or spit on the Christian religion and its eternally 'sacred' story of the Virgin Mary Joseph and the baby Jesus. It is Godard after all and outside of Weekend a straightup satire of the 60's radicalism and revolutionary air in France at the time he hasn't tried to deliberately get people ticked off by his work. By my account though Hail Mary isn't a great movie a good movie or a particularly engrossing account of the tale despite the hype.The story is fiddled through the Godardian consciousness as such a teenage basketball player named Mary Myriem Roussel with a boyfriend who drives a Taxi named Joseph Thierry Rode is visited by a foul and entirely no nonsense uncle Gabriel Philippe Lacoste one of only two acting appearances ever and told she will conceive God's child despite never having had sex with no one including Joseph. This sparks a rage in Joseph and disillusionment in Mary who can't figure out what to do with the situation. The rest of the film unfolds in a style that reminded me of what Godard did later on with Nouvelle Vague wherein whenever images are presented that suggest that Godard in another life outside of being a newwave pioneer been more fit in his later days to be directing nature documentaries as opposed to featurelength films. There aren't many emotions outside of coldness between the supposed lovers Mary and Joseph and scenes of a compulsively naked Roussel that inspire only one really memorable shot I won't reveal it but I found it freaky in how real it might have or might have not been.There were problems I had with Hail Mary as I have stated and when the film was over the recent religious film gaining hoopla came to mind Gibson's Passion of the Jesus. The two problems I had with both films were these the first for nonChristians or non believers in HIM there is not real entry portal to really get into the sympathy of the character of Mary. She feels pain resentment love all of these things for God and the way the film presents it if you don't have or have not had before a kind of feeling or attitude towards God and Christianity the entailing symbolism Godard uses included the dramatizes of it all won't fit. The second for a film even what is supposedly a film in high regards to the great artists of the celluloid dealing with as strong a subject as immaculate conception with POTC it was the gradual torture and death of Jesus besides the point this is a highly boring and disjointed result. For all the images of nudity and skies and oceans and roads there isn't really much that it amounts to. This isn't helped by the performances either Roussel Rode Lacoste and even young Juliette Binoche either didn't get the right directions or the onthefly style of Godard didn't work with them or they just pushed the realism envelope to its limit and too beyond. Roussel's a lovely young girl and a fair actress but when the audience gets to see a supporting character Anderson's character show more emotion in her face her eyes there's trouble. Rode also creates little by overacting or not being there at all emotionally. Perhaps another minor beef I had with Godard's treatment of the subject matter was this by taking the 'His creation' story which it is at base level believe in it or not really as much of a leap of faith as is the details of Jesus' crucifixion in such a deadpan no humor morose attitude Godard tries for a kind of neorealism that backfires. Why not make the film a straight out satire or have fun with the story elements like with Gabriel's character I was hoping his would be the one cool element of the film but it's hard to keep of track of him? The short film that precedes the film by occasional collaborator AnneMarie Mieville at least has a lighthearted feeling to it and let's art combining well with empathetic characters Smith's Dogma serves as another example however more in the mainstream than here. By the time Godard rumbles and plods through his images and music a soundtrack that manages some of the few interesting parts of the film Bach Dvorak and Coltrane are some artists among others that sometimes get annoyingly sampled over and over to no effect and gets to Mary's end moment the catharsis is empty and frustrating. Here his logic is generally if not altogether a onenote concept stretched out with practically onenote emotions strung out from the watchable yet poor actors and there's one or two subplots in the film that boggles the mind. Maybe if I watched the film without sound it'd be of some interest on a misenscene level though even that wears thin. It's surely my least favorite film of the director's so far and at best I can say that like 'The Passion' you won't get it or Roussel's private parts if you're that type of person out of your head.".

Both characters are lost in dissatisfaction he unable to find joy in droll penetration she disillusioned with courtship rituals.The film then cuts to Mary Myriem Roussel a young woman playing basketball. Godard stresses skimpy clothes and sexualised bodies Mary's bouncing ball echoing the many full moons  suggestive of the human body's many mysteries  which will later appear. Next scene a classroom in which a professor talks of chance and of there not being enough time for life to have evolved on Earth. A female student  Eva pretty and on the cusp of womanhood  finds these words disturbing. Life the professor says is alien and programmed by a previous intelligence. It comes from beyond humans beyond the womb beyond Earth. The professor then bluntly states that humans are extraterrestrial. He then admits that he was persecuted for preaching this sacrilegious evangel. Eva finds him attractive.Of course on a reductive level humans are alien. All carbon comes from dead stars and so all carbon based life is extraterrestrial to the planet it develops on. It's likely that the other essential components of life and the early building blocks of amino acids RNA and DNA likewise originated outside earth. Regardless Godard isn't really interested in science. For him the life impulse the desire to breed love copulate and reproduce is an alien impulse. The subject doesn't ask for these impulses doesn't know how it acquires them and doesn't know from where they originate. Sexual desire then is something imposed and always stems from outside the body.Next scene a plane rising above forests like a UFO. A sun then sets ancient celestial bodies linked to the origins and yearnings of flesh. Mary is then visited by Uncle Gabriel a reference to the Bible's Angel Gabriel who tells her that she's pregnant. Mary a virgin is shocked her mouth drops in a parody of classic Biblical films. By whom? Mary asks. I sleep with no one! The rest of the film watches as Mary immaculately conceives a child whilst Eva has sex with the professor after biting an apple the Biblical forbidden fruit.Like the New Testament Mary's in a relationship with a Joseph reimagined here as a taxi driver. Mary reads books on Francis of Assisi Joseph reads Tomorrow Dogs about futuristic postdesire human beings. Where's the child from? Joseph asks a now pregnant Mary. The child must have come from somewhere!? Godard cuts to shots of the heavens flowers and fields. Sex is all around but Mary rejects her body. She pines for a spiritual asexuality wishes to resist temptations wishes to preserve an idealised version of romantic love but her hand creeps toward her crotch and she finds herself masturbating frenetically. All men are god's shadow she cries. God is a vampire here not to deliver us from sin but profit from pain! Later quoting St Francis she says The spirit acts on the body breathes through it transfigures it veils it to make it less disgusting than it is. But the film itself denounce St Francis' words the spirit does not ennoble flesh but is that which debases it. The Creator is in your DNA and he's a kinky little fella. From here on Mary hates god hates nature hates the earth flesh and sex itself. These are desires forced upon her a kind of rape or biological imposition.Gabriel beats up Joseph and accuses the bespectacled man of being blind. He then teaches Joseph that all desire is the Alien Other's desire but to nevertheless leave room for Mary's own wants and wishes insofar as they exist. From here on the selfobsessed Joseph learns how to touch love and penetrate Mary by pulling away from her body. To respect and love her own desire and to perceive and undercut the power relations between people. From Joseph's failures of perception springs his redemption his newfound ability to see and accept the freedom of others and accept his and their own disempowerment in the face of a lifeforce that uses and abandons. For Godard love is unconditional only when it recognises corporeal facts and Joseph's pulling away constitutes the film's only sacred act.Hail Mary abounds with reflections light always splattering across the surfaces of water. Mary talks of humans catching only the shadow of love love a reflection in which the true form of the desired object is misinterpreted. And this reflection is always deformed and not ours anyway. This becomes literal later in the film when the son Mary gives birth to is shown to not belong to Joseph. He is not my father! the child says before running off into Nature. I must tend to my father's affairs! he yells like a kid returning to daddy's embrace. Mary lets him go. Joseph still thinks personal desire semen and offspring constitute some kind of ownership.Hail Mary is arguably the best film in Godard's body quartet Slow Motion Passion Carmen Hail Mary all preoccupied with holes orifices vaginas and mouths. The rest of the film reverses Christian mythology such that instead of a virgin immaculately conceiving a god who is free from sin and who dies because he unconditionally loves sinners we have a humanity which is raped by an invisible lifeforce which perverts humans and instills in its children a desire to breed f own and control. Fittingly Mary itself ends with a shot of a vulgar hole Mary's mouth adorned with lipstick the girl attempting to claim her body or make holy and beautiful that which might not be.8.910  Masterpiece.".

	schema:reviewBody "The late Pope John Paul II said this film deeply wounds the religious sentiments of believers. It may well be that the Roman Catholic hierarchy's coverup of pedophile priests has done more to wound the religious sentiments of believers than any mere movie could. The controversy over Hail Mary like the controversies surrounding The Last Temptation of Christ The Passion of the Christ and The Da Vinci Code shows that any time a filmmaker deals with religious issues in his work he risks offending a sizable constituency. That's understandable faith is an important part of most people's lives and in a world rife with religious divisions you can't please everyone. Who knows? Maybe you shouldn't try. Hail Mary though obscure and enigmatic in Godard's finest manner is nowhere as blasphemous as most of Luis Bunuel's stuff. In updating the story of the Nativity to contemporary France he nowhere denies the historical truth of the Virgin Birth or the divinity of Christ. Hail Mary marks a turningpoint in Godard's career when he abandoned the materialism of his Maoist period for a more spiritual philosophical approach. Beautiful Myriem Roussel gives a striking portrayal of the Virgin Mary as a high school basketball player who works at her father's gas station when her thuggish boyfriend Joseph Thierry Rode learns she's pregnant he's understandably suspicious. The film is touching as it deals with two ordinary people trying to make sense of something extraordinary entering and disrupting their lives one can well believe that the historical Mary and Joseph went through just such struggles as the couple in the film. We get only a brief glimpse of the boy Jesus but his death on the Cross is clearly foreshadowed. Interestingly Godard uses some of the same music that Pasolini used in The Gospel According to Saint Matthew. Hail Mary deals with complicated themes of the meaning of life the wonder of birth creation v. evolution in an intelligent and thoughtful way far superior to the strident agitprop produced by American evangelicals. A beautiful if perplexing film.".

Mary of course can not allow herself to get pregnant shunning the boyfriend when he goes to feel her stomach. This beautiful film does feature some nude shots of Mary a beautiful actress filling the role with such innocence and independence in a film it's beautifully told tale worth the view alone for the double minded viewer.

Viewing the film also made me wonder why it was so controversial but as it continued through I got the hint to why it was the way it was and why it got a half good half bad reputation.All the film is about is it's a modern retelling of Mary experiencing life working through it and then having her baby Jesus. At first when I watched the film it was very odd out there and unexpecting.I want to say one thing about the film which was hard to understand.Every time a guy and his little girl or a blonde chick and an older guy came on screen I never understood their purpose in the film. I never even understood what they were talking about. That's the only problem I had with the film but despite that little issue I had nothing else wrong with the film and now I'm going to go through all of the keys that made this film super strong.1. I understood the story the issues that Mary  Joesph were going through the mood the themes and the dramatic moments very well.2. As I continued to watch the film The actress who played the Mary character so well was making it moving and it also made me feel emotional. That's how I felt about this film it was moving and emotional. She was a strong actress who made this film.3. I also loved the continuous shots with the moon water and the rest of the environment and the music was just a joy to listen to. I thought that set the tone for the film.4. Not too mention how weird the ending was. The ending was an absolute joy to watch. Just love the ending close up shot showing Mary's lips and then it blacking out for a second.I think that everyone who comes across this should give it a chance. It's not even a bad film and mostly everything in this film is solid as. It's just one of those films that you can't turn your back on it's a film that lightens your eyes to watch every scene and it never gets boring. It was one of those rare films that you see rarely when you can engage with the story and characters and for some reason I felt at times I engaged with the Mary character. It is a controversial classic and I love it. 8.510".

I thought the film might not really be as bad as I remembered it after all I was only 15 at the time!!! and figured for 1 what do I have to lose.  The answer was perfectly clear when I watched it last night....This movie is neither inspiring NOR blasphemous...it's just NOTHING.A movie asking the question What if Jesus was born today? could be a very interesting film.  But Hail Mary never even tried to really tell the story of The Virgin Birth.  Instead we are bombarded with countless images of teenage Mary played by Myriem Roussel caressing her nubile naked body and playing with her pubic hair.  At one point the camera is so close to Roussel's crotch the whole world became her gynecologist!  This doesn't move the story along or even come off as artistic nudity.  It's pure shock value and nothing more.The characters are incredibly unlikable.  Mary is a cold rude girl. Joseph is a sex crazy cab driver.  The Angel Gabriel is a violent bard who can only be calmed by a little girl that travels with him.  Juliette Binoche plays Juliette the high school tramp who is trying quite hard to get into Joseph's pants.  Seriously this movie is a MESS!!!There is also a pointless subplot of a college student named Eva played by Anne Gautierwho is having an affair with her older married professor played by Johan Leysen.  There is a very random nude scene involving these two that I still can't figure out.Seriously don't even bother with this film.".

	schema:headline " The story of Mary and Joseph illustrates that love is a response to the mystery of the other person's spirit.";
	schema:reviewBody "I like this film a lot but I first have to get past my reaction to the whale game. The problem is not merely that mother and son are involved in an erotic game but that they play it with such enthusiasm. She just mentions the possibility of not playing the game later on and they are both quick to play it like lovers who can't wait for nighttime and who dive into bed at the thought of sex. What it means must be connected to the scene in which Marie is bathing and talking about enjoying showing her body to God. Her son is somehow the same as God. Even at the end of the movie Joseph still isn't getting anything this is Mary's only sexuality. Of course God is spirit but her son would be spirit incarnated. Because it is just a question of exposing her body there would be no physical love. So I guess it is just Mary's way of reestablishing her relationship with God.If we were on a different planet we would all look different. As we are we would look strange to someone from a different planet. As the doctor said women are essentially mysterious. Joseph loves Marie rightly when he has that sense of her mysteriousness.There is a contrast with the affair between the professor and one of his students. He thinks that evolution requires some sort of intelligent design but sees it in terms of a more advanced race coming to earth to steer the evolutionary process. He acknowledges the girl's suggestion of the possibility of God being the intelligent designer but only as an afterthought. When he eventually leaves her he says that the world is not sad it's big. The particular is not important it is just part of this big scheme of things. The scheme of things dwarfs the particular and thus there is no sadness. On the other hand if you see the particular as coming from God the particular is of the highest importance. It becomes mysterious through its relationship with its mysterious sourcethus enabling right love.I felt that all this was confirmed by one of those bird calls. The bird for one reason or another is announcing it's presence. There is something out there over and above what our senses present to our mind's eye. That's the point of all the animal noises. On the other hand the sound of the wind represents the presence of God. The sun and the moon represent the eternal. The significance of the repeated words At that time would be that the various events are happening in the temporal world. The angels come in at the airport the landing airplanes represent the eternal becoming directly involved with the temporal.All the writhing on the bed would be Mary's effort to deal with temptation. The long shot of the fingers in the bush indicate that the temptation is that of masturbation. Hence someone can say Hail Mary! Her chastitywhich is not the chastity of do not lead me into temptationwas a real accomplishment. What she couldn't get from basketball's excitement and exhaustion was comfort. But flesh qua flesh is not comforting. It is the presence of the spirit in the flesh that allows flesh to be comforting. This spirit is suggested by the shot of Mary's open mouth at the end of the film. There is something mysterious animating this body.When the professor is talking we hear Godard's own voice repeating the word earth in a reverential way. Godard has a reverence for this mysterious world we find ourselves on.There must be some connection between the first film and the second. Marie needs the comfort that Mary finds in God. There's no comfort for Joseph though. No wonder at the end of the film he is still threatening to leave. Worse yet he has to see his wife playing whale with the child. Seeing her nakedness was all the sex that he had and now the kid is having it too. But no it's different. He expressed love in response to her nakedness and she is just telling the kid what people call various parts of the body. What is said conventionally about the body is the opposite of appreciating the mysteriousness of the body.The shots of the dog and the shots of the paired animals and the donkey at the end of the film are meant to represent the strangeness of the body. Seeing the body as a freak mutant along with other freak mutants helps give us the sense of the mysterious spirit that is housed in the mysterious body.When Mary asks the doctor whether we are spirits with bodies or bodies with spirits it is very important to her. If we were bodies with spirits then her denial of fleshly comfort would be denying what is primary.There is something going on with money. Joseph can pay in two years. The rich people make Joseph wait days for them. The second naked girl gives the professor thousands of franks. She thinks he is a zero when he acts cool about giving it back to her. He is merely thinking about his status as he leaves her. He shakes hands with some other people after saying goodbye to her. Saying goodbye to her is just one more duty.

	onyx:emotionText "I like this film a lot but I first have to get past my reaction to the whale game. The problem is not merely that mother and son are involved in an erotic game but that they play it with such enthusiasm. She just mentions the possibility of not playing the game later on and they are both quick to play it like lovers who can't wait for nighttime and who dive into bed at the thought of sex. What it means must be connected to the scene in which Marie is bathing and talking about enjoying showing her body to God. Her son is somehow the same as God. Even at the end of the movie Joseph still isn't getting anything this is Mary's only sexuality. Of course God is spirit but her son would be spirit incarnated. Because it is just a question of exposing her body there would be no physical love. So I guess it is just Mary's way of reestablishing her relationship with God.If we were on a different planet we would all look different. As we are we would look strange to someone from a different planet. As the doctor said women are essentially mysterious. Joseph loves Marie rightly when he has that sense of her mysteriousness.There is a contrast with the affair between the professor and one of his students. He thinks that evolution requires some sort of intelligent design but sees it in terms of a more advanced race coming to earth to steer the evolutionary process. He acknowledges the girl's suggestion of the possibility of God being the intelligent designer but only as an afterthought. When he eventually leaves her he says that the world is not sad it's big. The particular is not important it is just part of this big scheme of things. The scheme of things dwarfs the particular and thus there is no sadness. On the other hand if you see the particular as coming from God the particular is of the highest importance. It becomes mysterious through its relationship with its mysterious sourcethus enabling right love.I felt that all this was confirmed by one of those bird calls. The bird for one reason or another is announcing it's presence. There is something out there over and above what our senses present to our mind's eye. That's the point of all the animal noises. On the other hand the sound of the wind represents the presence of God. The sun and the moon represent the eternal. The significance of the repeated words At that time would be that the various events are happening in the temporal world. The angels come in at the airport the landing airplanes represent the eternal becoming directly involved with the temporal.All the writhing on the bed would be Mary's effort to deal with temptation. The long shot of the fingers in the bush indicate that the temptation is that of masturbation. Hence someone can say Hail Mary! Her chastitywhich is not the chastity of do not lead me into temptationwas a real accomplishment. What she couldn't get from basketball's excitement and exhaustion was comfort. But flesh qua flesh is not comforting. It is the presence of the spirit in the flesh that allows flesh to be comforting. This spirit is suggested by the shot of Mary's open mouth at the end of the film. There is something mysterious animating this body.When the professor is talking we hear Godard's own voice repeating the word earth in a reverential way. Godard has a reverence for this mysterious world we find ourselves on.There must be some connection between the first film and the second. Marie needs the comfort that Mary finds in God. There's no comfort for Joseph though. No wonder at the end of the film he is still threatening to leave. Worse yet he has to see his wife playing whale with the child. Seeing her nakedness was all the sex that he had and now the kid is having it too. But no it's different. He expressed love in response to her nakedness and she is just telling the kid what people call various parts of the body. What is said conventionally about the body is the opposite of appreciating the mysteriousness of the body.The shots of the dog and the shots of the paired animals and the donkey at the end of the film are meant to represent the strangeness of the body. Seeing the body as a freak mutant along with other freak mutants helps give us the sense of the mysterious spirit that is housed in the mysterious body.When Mary asks the doctor whether we are spirits with bodies or bodies with spirits it is very important to her. If we were bodies with spirits then her denial of fleshly comfort would be denying what is primary.There is something going on with money. Joseph can pay in two years. The rich people make Joseph wait days for them. The second naked girl gives the professor thousands of franks. She thinks he is a zero when he acts cool about giving it back to her. He is merely thinking about his status as he leaves her. He shakes hands with some other people after saying goodbye to her. Saying goodbye to her is just one more duty. He is acting as if there is nothing significant there so she honks as the bird calls I am here!";

I saw this at an art cinema back in 1985 and the audience erupted in laughter when that part came up.This movie was blasted and criticized by the Catholic Church. They objected to scenes showing Mary withering nude and alone on the bed while being impregnated by God. The pope who never saw the movie called for an outright ban and all the good Catholics staged protests at every theatre it played. As a result this became a big hit! Everyone ran to see it. That's too bad. If the pope and others had just shut up this probably would have been ignored and forgotten quickly. I don't think this film is sacrilegious but it IS boring and stupid.

	schema:reviewBody "Hail Mary 1985  12 out of 4 I guess it goes without saying but here's yet another religious film that sparked off controversy when originally released. There were mobs of protesters at theaters across the world and even the Catholic Church tried to get it banned even though God knows they should have been dealing with other issues and not a movie. With that said I'm really not sure what any of the fuss was about as the film never once offends God Mary Joseph or Jesus. In the film Mary Myriem Roussel is your typical teenager who enjoys playing basketball and working at her father's gas station. Her boyfriend Joseph Thierry Rode a taxi driver is getting frustrated because Mary won't let him touch her after dating for two years but his fears and jealous grow worse when Mary turns up pregnant. Godard retelling this story in modern times is a pretty interesting touch and I think the final message from the movie is that Mary was human like any other woman and not just a cartoon character. Pretty much the said thing Martin Scorsese did with The Last Temptation of Christ in terms of Jesus being a real human and we all know the controversy that film started. As for this film I really don't see any need for any type of controversy. Mary is seem naked throughout the movie so perhaps this is what some got upset about but I'm pretty sure the real Mary was naked at some point in her life. I think Godard handles the film fairly well even though we get several scenes of Godard being Godard with some strange edits rambling nonsense and some scenes that amount to nothing. I'm not sure what Godard's reasons where for making this film but I think the utter strangeness really helps the film and certainly makes it stand out among other religious movies. Roussel is terrific in the role of Mary and really captures the confused teenage nature of the role. I thought she was very good in the way she handles her character's thoughts feelings and emotions. The support cast also turns in fine work. Back to the nudity which seems to raise a lot of controversy. Mary is often challenged with the question that is the body a part of the soul or is the soul a part of the body. I think this wondering by Mary makes good use of the nudity and that the nude actress isn't just being shown to arouse male viewers or to be anywhere near pornographic. Godard's use of classical music is another nice bonus as are some great shots of the wilderness. I've read several reviews of this film which range from fourstars to a BOMB but I'm somewhere in the middle.".

	schema:reviewBody "51 years after the release of THE ALIVE AND THE DEAD I've finally watched that incredible masterpiece. The movie is as relevant now as it was back in 1964. The movie tells the story of a man a good man in the long infinite brutal heroic year of 1941  the first year of the darkest period in history. The director did an amazing job  the movie is visually astonishing many of the frames could be as they are framed and pinned to a wall. The actors are some of USSR's best  each one does his role in the best possible way truly amazing. Most of the actors playing soldiers in this movie are actual World War II veterans. In some scenes the eyes tell more than words could ever tell. The dialogues are breathtaking and truthful. The movie presents the true horror of this war and the UNBEARABLE weight on the shoulders of the Red Army soldiers. They fought in rain in snow in mud they went through ice and fire. They kept on fighting while being burned alive in tanks airplanes ships and trenches. They heroically fought for every hill for every village for every station for every city  for every piece of their land occupied by the most ruthless enemy in human history. They fought the Germans while knowing that their wives and families are at great danger  maybe already tortured and dead or maybe also fighting on the fronts of this forsaken war. The movie perfectly represents that the chances to survive were so incredibly small that each man understood that every day every minute could be the last. Still  they had hope still they kept on fighting still THEY WON THIS WAR. But in this masterpiece the victory is still very far  this is only 1941.. the war had just begun. With no doubt  1010".

Though the beginning of the movie is a little on the weak side it starts picking up to a nice pace and is entertaining. Some reviewers were offended by the way AfricanAmericans are portrayed in this movie as ghetto talking and jiving boneheads.  For me I don't see it that way I just see it as a comedystraight up. I can see how people would be offended though because most of the movies that came out before movies like Waiting to Exhale  The Brothers came out either portrayed the AfricanAmericans as uneducated ghetto talking airheads or gangsters pimps  drug dealers. Another thing I noticed from some of the reviews both on IMDB  other sources is that the writers think that it has set back the clock for black actors etc.  It was directed by an AfricanAmerican which I may add never received his just props in Hollywood.  In conclusion if it makes you laugh which the fine actors in this movie achieve whole heartedly it's all good.".

However the man's son Isaac appears to have more in mind that just this as the two countrified black princesses stumble their way around in a rich man's world.It's hard to believe  when watching Halle Berry collected the best actress Oscar in 2002 than only a few years earlier she was in a dog like this!  The story is almost a black Pygmalion in it's rags to riches type setting.  It's possible to see how it might have worked  but I'm afraid it didn't work at all.  The story is unimportant if the laughs come fast and thick.however I barely smiled once.  The level of comedy is aimed at an audience who laugh simply because a character talks like a guest on Jerry Springer ie squealing and yelling girrrrrrrl!' etc.  The comedy never gets above this  it's tacky and silly.Backing this up is Berry and Desselle.  Deselle is terrible  simply hamming up her blackness'  it's amazing that black audiences are happy with stereotypes and caricatures like this.  Berry tries but is poor mainly due to the material but also because she isn't a tacky country ho!  It's amazing that the makers of this film manage to make this classy lady look cheap and ugly by sticking her in gold teeth cheap clothes and tacky personality. Landau is embarrassing  at times you can see him close his eyes and just thinking of his Ed Wood Oscar!  The only one that comes off well is Richardson's Manley  although he is a white Jeffery Fresh Prince.  The list of black cameos Rodman Leon LL Cool J several MTV veejays don't actual add interest other than to make you wonder how so many managed to get involved in this.Overall this is not so much bad as just plain embarrassing for all involved. It shows Berry's talent that she came out of this and managed to further her career.  Zero laughs zero interest  a million cringes what a load of BAPS!".

The rich man's uptight butler wants to throw them out but the man's nephew assures them it's ok. The nephew explains that his uncle had a Romeo and Juliet romance with the black housekeeper and has apparently never found a woman he loved since his family got rid of her. The nephew can't find the housekeeper but to make his uncle happy in his last days he pretends Berry is the man's granddaughter. Landau recovers and really begins to enjoy life primarily because Berry's friend cooks him soul food. He plays a dying man and a party animal equally well.  The uptight butler loosens up and is particularly funny  in two places  buying rap music for Landau and relaying messages to Berry's boyfriend when Berry doesn't want to talk to him on the phone profanity and all though I saw the TV version and don't know quite how much profanity.  Berry's friend starts a romance with the Italian servant who claims to be a rich man who couldn't find a woman in Italy.  Possible spoilers here  unfortunately he and the nephew both have less than ideal motives for their actions. The ending was quite interesting  no sound other than music though you can pretty much tell what was happening.

Who gives a damn about plot or the ending in a movie like this?  It's just cheesy fun.  I laughed from the opening frame all the way to the end.  In a world of unfunny comedies BAPS really stands out as one of the few that made me laugh as much as it did.  I love a serious thought provoking film as much as the next person but sometimes you just need a movie to entertain and make you laugh.. and not many comedies these days can do that.  If you wanna laugh until you're coughing and trying to catch your breath then I highly reccomend this film to you.  DO NOT take it seriously though and constantly point out the flaws... you won't get the most out of it unless you approach it like the laughfest it is!".

He may have not played a good Phantom of The Opera but he was good in 300 and...I think Beowolf he played in too. He also plays Hilary Swank's goofy late boyfriend in P.S. I Love You.

	schema:headline " Kjell Bergkvist is amazing in this irresistible feelgood movie!";
	schema:reviewBody "r60Of all the good movies I've seen shamelessly few of them have been Swedish. Den Enfaldige Mrdaren Att Angra en brygga Nattvardsgsterna and the cult flick Frostbiten come to mind. Now I can add Den Bsta Sommaren to the short list of Swedish films which are actually worth seeing. Because as much as I hate to admit it this is a very good film. It's supremely well acted well written and effectively pulls a few heartstrings at several moments. It's a brilliant movie. This coming from a selfconfirmed hater of Swedish movies. I'm always skeptic about Swedish films because they always seem to have been written by a roomful of monkeys in five minutes directed by some talentless hackjob the producers found outside Systembolaget with neither charm nor production values. Strangely they all seem to be about angst drinking angsty lesbian teenagers rape and angst. Did I mention angst? It's like a poor man's Bergman only without the laughs.The brilliance of Den Bsta Sommaren is that none of my prejudices are confirmed in it. It is a simple but never boring story about two orphan kids who are sloppily thrown between equally uncaring foster parents. They're lonely and feel like no one loves them. When they are sent to stay at the undertaker Yngve Johansson's place for the summer holidays they discover friendship as well as love and better a few people's lives in the process.This actually starts out as a hilarious comedy despite the rather dark plot. This is where Kjell Bergqvist fits into the picture as the depressed socially challenged undertaker Johansson. I don't know why I've never seen this man in any other movies because he is positively brilliant. He's fantastic. He embodies his nervous twitchy and laughably pathetic character. Kjell plays Yngve Johansson to perfection and brings both laughs and tears as his wellwritten 3dimensional character develops throughout the film. Johansson is a character which we sometimes feel sympathy for and sometimes hate utterly which makes him as real as well a real person this is rare in film especially Swedish films nowadays.As for the kids they deliver as well. Anastasios Soulis convinces as the confused scared boy Mrten who befriends the more selfconfident but also more cynical girl Annika brilliantly played by Rebecca Scheja. It is Johansson's spoton cynicisms and questionable words of wisdom that carry the film and bring most of the humour. The cynical character saves the film from being a sappy forgettable piece of fluff and makes it something much more human and easy to relate to. Yngve is a man we can understand and eventually grow to love despite his negative and lifeless surface. As racist cynical dull and pretentious as Johansson is I still couldn't help but love him. Great acting which definitely deserved recognition.I've rambled enough. This is a great movie not just a good to be Swedish type of flick but a genuinely enjoyable very well acted and uplifting movie carried on the shoulders of Kjell Bergqvist. You should see it. It's accessible to almost anyone and a success on all levels. Definitely one of the few genuinely great Swedish movies released. Ulf Malmros if you can keep making movies as cute as this instead of trash like Tjenare Kungen you might have staying power. Great work!".

I was hoping for a good oldfashioned Italian horror and failing that a semiforgotten oddity along the lines of SWEET HOUSE OF HORRORS or HOUSE OF CLOCKS. Instead what I got was a longwinded and dull outing in which very little actually happens and the story seems to float along endlessly without going anywhere.The story is straight out of an old black and white haunted house flick of the 1960s a beautiful young bride moves into her husband's ancestral home before being disturbed by sinister events. These include strange nightmares her husband's frequent disappearances into the vast cellars beneath the house the antagonism of the housekeeper and her husband's bizarre refusal to have sex with her. As written it sounds far more interesting than it actually is not least because the pacing is so slow and the script devoid of imagination. Horror scenes are left to a couple of nightmarish dreams in which we see a skeleton with glowing eyes. Oh and one of the pipecleanerlegged spiders from THE BEYOND makes a guest appearance with hilarious results. The locations especially the cobwebbed cellars are great so it's a shame the makers of this didn't offer a better story to fill them.There's barely any bloodshed to mention  a couple of cheesy decapitated heads and that's about it  so director Gianni Martucci serves up titillation instead in terms of nudity from stars Wendel and Longo. The cast are wooden  not least lead Gerardo Amato who's completely terrible in what should be a complex and imposing role  and the only actor who really fits the part is Malisa Longo as the sultry housekeeper. The title of this film alone brought to mind memories of Mickey Hargitay's redhooded murderer in THE CRIMSON EXECUTIONER but it's a real misnomer as the red monks rarely appear and are almost incidental to the plot.".

I really hope I've already reviewed Demons 3...not sure I could sit through that one again.This one has Lara Wendel being stuck up a tree and then falling into the lap of guy who marries her in his big house that somehow has a bunch of monks living in the basement who demand the blood of a virgin namely that of Lara Wendel. If you've sat through Ghosthouse Tenebrae and other Wendel films and wondered if you'd ever see her naked then this is the film for you. Also you're not missing much.The problem with this film is down to pacing and lack of convincing fake severed heads. Pacing seems to fluctuate from kind of creepy when peeps are trying to figure out what's going on in that house and people having domestic arguments. Fake severed heads are also a problem here as the heads involved are worse than what your six year old kid can come up with using some playdough.This isn't the worst 'end of era' Italian horror film and it's nowhere near the best  check out Maya and the Spider Labyrinth but it's one you may encounter often. If you have OCD just get it put it on and let you mind drift. It's that kind of film.".

Given that it was probably shot on video everything is far too bright to bring out any kind of atmosphere. Plotwise it's ridiculous. The basis for the marriage between two vacant people hinges on her falling out of a tree because...of a tarantula...that we only see one more time. Honestly  she falls out of the tree and they cut right to the wedding. The movie plods along with clich after clich that they can't even be bothered to do properly. Sporadic use of hand held cameras and fish eye lenses only confuse the issue more. To keep the budget low there are no extras. Period. This could be used to good effect with some back story but back story isn't what this is about. That is except for a 1015min sequence towards the end where all the secrets are spilled. As noted the budgeted no money for special effects meaning no flying heads no wounds no gore of any kind unless you count the 1.50 they spent of fake blood in one scene. Sub par acting. Some nudity. No suspense. I'm happy I didn't pay to see this.".

The truth is however that The Red Monks is a fairly 'dry' film with the only carnage being a couple of crap decapitated heads to make matters worse it's also extremely boring.Martucci's dull as ditchwater screenplay sees wealthy bachelor Robert Garlini Gerardo Amato meeting a beautiful painter named Ramona Curtis Lara Wendel. After a brief romance the pair marry and Ramona moves into the family homea sprawling castle complete with dusty passageways and dingy cellarsmuch to the consternation of housekeeper Priscilla.On their first night together Robert is called away for several hours to deal with some urgent business but on his return rather than rush to his bride and indulge in unbridled passion the crazy fool rejects his virginal wife's sexual advances. This strange behaviour continues for several days and the relationship naturally turns sour. Robert has his reasons though firstly he's been getting his oats from Priscilla but more importantly he is ensuring that his wife is pure when the time comes for him to hand her over to the Satanic sect of Templar knights that inhabit the castle cellar.Despite a few fun elements including quite a bit of nudity from gorgeous star Wendel a silly skeleton with glowing eyes a guest appearance by one of the pipecleaner spiders from Fulci's The Beyond and a 'twist' ending The Red Monks is a monotonous and stuffy effort that I believe even the most obsessive of Italian horror afficianados will find hard to endure.3.5 out of 10 rounded up to 4 for IMDb.".

The film offers little that you can't get from several better devilsexploitation flicks. The film has Lucio Fulci's name attached to it since the great director has a producers credit but I don't know why that attracted me since even the films that Fulci did direct around the late eighties were mostly not up to much. This one is directed by Gianni Martucci and while the director has something of an eye for aesthetics he's not great at creating tension and it results in a very boring film. The story revolves around some ancient ritual involving a bunch of people dressed in red monk robes. The wealthy owner of a castle where this takes place meets a pretty young woman and marries her. She goes to live in the castle and soon becomes frustrated by her husband's secretive night time behaviour. People start dying and her husband's secret becomes in danger of being revealed but maybe his secret is not the most surprising. The film drones on for about eighty minutes and there's very little that's memorable about it. In fact the only sequence I can remember well is a scene with the most ridiculously fake spider I've ever seen and considering I only saw it last night  it has to be said that this film is not overly memorable. It all boils down to a supposedly surprising twist that I guessed before the film even started. Overall it has to be said that Red Monks is a big waste of time and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone!".

He has a dubbed Italian version of a meet cute with a female painter Lara Wendel after his dog trees her and he marries her after a whirlwind romance. However he has something going on in his cellar with a strange order of monks dressed in red thus the title who warn him that his new bride must remain a virgin so after their wedding night is reduced to some gratuitous breastsuckling the husband instead takes up with his severe but sexy housekeeper. The wife meanwhile discovers that her new husband is up to something in the cellar and discovers a family curse involving an ancestor who killed the head of the order of monks after he was seduced by a Gypsy girl actually it looks more like he just rapes her. The ending will surprise or confuse youmaybe both.This movie has SOME of the gratuitous material you would expect from an Italian film of this era mostly the scene where the monk chases and has his way for several minutes with a skinnydipping Gypsy girl and another memorable scene where a minor character's head ends up in a picnic basket perhaps she was attacked by Yogi and Boo Boo?. But actually at times this movie is more atmospheric more like a 60's Italian horror film even if the plot doesn't really make a lick of sense actually not unlike a 60's Italian horror film. The goofy English dubbing doesn't help though and is pretty suspect at times like when characters talk about a ritual that will occur at the next opening of Uranus They may not have been taking their jobs entirely seriously.Lara Wendel is a pretty interesting actress. She is known mostly for a small role in Dario Argento's Tenebrae and for appearances in more lowrent 80's Italian horror flicks like Midnight Killer Ghost House and Killer Birds. She also was a pretty decent actress though who had a more highbrow career with a major role as male and female twins in Salvatore Samperi's Ernesto and with small roles in Identification of a Woman and even an obscure Fellini movie. But ALL of these came out of her questionable early career as a kind of EuroLolita along with actresses like Eve Ionesco Katja Beirnert Katya Berger Susan Hemingway and a young Nastassia Kinski. Suffice it to say that while this isn't an especially sexy role it's ironically the only sexy role she did AFTER she turned 18.This movie is at times confusing and general pretty dumb but it does have a few things going for it.".

Dazzling narrative technique nearly always confusing you at the start of a scene but somehow moving the story forward at the same time. The characters in the small village are wonderfully flexible  it's almost as if they change as the film's frenetic comedy and absurd plot demand. There is a sombre undertone as well and it's that that makes some of the moments of resolution in the film somewhat awkward as if the seriousness were being shoehorned into a farce. This will either infuriate or drive you into gales of exhausting laughter.".

But in this case I think that was more positive than negative. I can't think of a better movie to watch when it's raining outside and you need some fun. This is it you have found the right movie! Really I have not seen anything this funny since 1980s. And the best is that Bengt Alsterlind from Hajk has a part in Slim Susie. This movie really shows the Swedish small town humor and when the acting seems bad remember I think it was meant that way. I am happy to say that Slim Susie is now among my DVDcollection!".

	schema:reviewBody "LANTANA  2001  out of fourLantana does not embody a story like most movies it isn't about anything in particular.  It's a movie about characters. Not largerthanlife super heroes but characters who succumb to temptation cheat on their wives doubt their spouses make mistakes and suffer consequences. In other words Lantana is about real people. Normal imperfect people like all of us. Not that everyone behaves like the characters here but few films capture transgression with such compassion and sympathy.Set in Australia a colorful pallet of characters paints a vivid coherent psychological portrait of infidelity deceit and estrangement. At the center of the film is four couples immersed in guilt and depravity for different reasons. Everybody has something to hide. The conflicts of these people illuminate the personal crisis of a police detective Anthony LaPaglia as he investigates the disappearance of a local woman.Apart from the investigation the couples have little connection with each other. They do have one thing in common however that none of them communicates with their loved ones. Lantana proves communication enforces commitment but a lack thereof results in disaster. This sincere uncompromising picture places the lack of communication at the center of family problems. The film won various Australian Film Awards for its performances screenplay and direction by Ray Lawrence. Lawrence clearly intended the titlereferring to a tropical shrub with beautiful flowers that hide dense thorny undergrowthto represent the characters' private lives hidden behind an outward appearance. He's got the wrong metaphor. These characters do not appear sunny on the inside outside front or back. They don't wear masks or attempt to cover their frowning states of mind. They are unhappy people and the movie never pretends otherwise.Those qualities make the characters absorbing. Instead of providing them with outlets and opportunities to hide their faults the film pokes prods and starves them of their happiness until they reach a breaking point. For some the breaking point results in an explosion of anger. For others it's subtle and personal. Lantana investigates real people who deal with real situations and encounter real consequences. None of the characters are model citizens yet we care deeply about each of them. When someone cries we feel sorry for them. When someone begs for forgiveness we try to forgive them. When someone questions their spouse we are concerned with both sides of the marriage. These people make big mistakes the results of their mistakes are never certain. The movie does not neatly pull things together at the end. It doesn't allow the characters an easy way out. These characters must dig themselves out of their problems.Lantana is one of the most compelling involving films of the year. It's based on a play called Speaking in Tongues by Andrew Bovell who also wrote the fluid screenplay. I want to see this play. If these characters feel so alive so real so tormented on screen think of their power in person.".

	schema:headline " Something close to a masterpiece";
	schema:reviewBody "In this starkly realistic examination of love and infidelity among the thirtysomething crowd from down under we learn that you may desire to cheat on your spouse but it's better if you don't.Leon Zat a police detective played with an original and striking demeanor by Anthony LaPaglia cheats on his wife and finds that his adultery compromises not only his marriage but his performance on the job. He becomes irritable and flies off the handle at things of little importance and becomes consumed with guilt.He is not alone. The marriage of John Knox Geoffrey Rush and psychiatrist Valerie Somers Barbara Hershey is falling apart as Knox seeks something from the outside and Somers is torn apart with the suspicion that he is having a homosexual affair perhaps with one of her clients. Meanwhile Jane O'May Zat's adulteress played by Rachael Blake finds that she needs a man or maybe two other than her estranged husband. Even Sonja Zat Kerry Armstrong feels the pressure and yearns to feel attractive perhaps with younger men.More than halfway through we have an apparent murder and an investigation during the course of which some of the adulteries come to light and cause the participants to examine themselves and their lives closely.Andrew Dovell wrote the subtle richly attired script full of penetrating dialogue and an uncompromising veracity adapting it from his play Speaking in Tongues. Ray Lawrence directed in an unusual but compelling manner in which the scenes are sharply focused and cut to linger in our minds. Again and again I was startled with just how exactly right was something a character said or did. Lawrence's exacting attention to detail gives the film a textured and deeply layered feel so that one has the sense of real life fully lived. The cast is uniformly excellent although LaPaglia stands out because of his most demanding role. His performance is one of the best I have seen in recent years. The only weakness in the film is a somewhat lethargic start partially caused by Lawrence's cinma vrit scene construction and editing. What he likes to do is lead us to a realization along with the characters and then punctuate the experience by lingering on the scene or in other cases by cutting quickly away. Often what other directors might show he leaves to our imagination and at other times he shows something seemingly trivial which nonetheless stays in our mind. John Knox's affair for example is not shown. Jane O'May and her husband's reconciliation is left to our mind's eye. Yet the scene with Valerie Somers in the lighted telephone booth with graffiti is shown at length and then what happens next is not. These are interesting directorial choices.The ending comes upon us as it sometimes should unexpectedly but then resonates so that we can see and feel the resolution. Not everything is tied up. Again we are left in some cases to use our own imagination.This original film one of the best of the new millennium I have seen stayed with me long after they ran the closing credits. It is well worth the two hours.Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote! Get it at Amazon!".

Meanwhile Jane O'May Zat's adulteress played by Rachael Blake finds that she needs a man or maybe two other than her estranged husband. Even Sonja Zat Kerry Armstrong feels the pressure and yearns to feel attractive perhaps with younger men.More than halfway through we have an apparent murder and an investigation during the course of which some of the adulteries come to light and cause the participants to examine themselves and their lives closely.Andrew Dovell wrote the subtle richly attired script full of penetrating dialogue and an uncompromising veracity adapting it from his play Speaking in Tongues. Ray Lawrence directed in an unusual but compelling manner in which the scenes are sharply focused and cut to linger in our minds. Again and again I was startled with just how exactly right was something a character said or did. Lawrence's exacting attention to detail gives the film a textured and deeply layered feel so that one has the sense of real life fully lived. The cast is uniformly excellent although LaPaglia stands out because of his most demanding role. His performance is one of the best I have seen in recent years. The only weakness in the film is a somewhat lethargic start partially caused by Lawrence's cinma vrit scene construction and editing. What he likes to do is lead us to a realization along with the characters and then punctuate the experience by lingering on the scene or in other cases by cutting quickly away. Often what other directors might show he leaves to our imagination and at other times he shows something seemingly trivial which nonetheless stays in our mind. John Knox's affair for example is not shown. Jane O'May and her husband's reconciliation is left to our mind's eye. Yet the scene with Valerie Somers in the lighted telephone booth with graffiti is shown at length and then what happens next is not. These are interesting directorial choices.The ending comes upon us as it sometimes should unexpectedly but then resonates so that we can see and feel the resolution. Not everything is tied up. Again we are left in some cases to use our own imagination.This original film one of the best of the new millennium I have seen stayed with me long after they ran the closing credits. It is well worth the two hours.Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote! Get it at Amazon!";

	schema:reviewBody "What struck me the most about Lantana was not the welllaid plot more the thoroughly realistic characters and performances. The classic 'mystery' thread was really only the setting for the several different relationships and couples featured in the film.But having said that the story itself was gutsy and twisting to keep you guessing till the end all without the need for nonessential narrative or the need to keep spelling things out. The questions were all answered so far as the story was concerned but because of the complexity and realism in all the principle characters i still left the cinema rolling plenty of the emotional issues through my mind for hours after.La Paglia was fantastic. His character though shown as an adulterer from the very beginning captured so many of the current male 'indentities' with great subtlety instead of a stereotyped 'hug session'  which most recent films dealing with the subject matter inevitably lead to. He so easily showed the internal conflicts which most normal Australian men deal with daytoday while still keeping up the brave face we all do.I also enjoyed the quirky way the relatively small number of characters were all drawn together by fairly consequential links and without a huge big statement of it in the end  no matter how many people there are on the planet it still amazes me how small and incestual problemcircles end up becoming This film has the potential to appeal to so many different audiences  works as a mystery copdrama chick flick and to anyone who could ever relate to the 'feel' of Australia which the film captures perfectly through great ambient audio and naturallooking lighting.Well written directed photographed and cast give this one an easy full marks.".

Lantana is a fine film thanks to the sure direction of Ray Lawrence and the fine script by Andrew Bovell. This was certainly a nice surprise coming from Australia which has given us a great many interesting films and that keeps telling world wide audiences there sure is life after Hollywood and the formula styled fare that has been coming from the LaLa Land in the last years.To begin with the cast is first rate. Anthony Lapaglia keeps getting better and better all the time. Aside from his work on stage namely The Rose Tatoo and A View from the Bridge on Broadway his appearances in films are always convincing. He's the kind of actor that doesn't repeat himself. He has such a presence and magnetism that we can't take our eyes from him throughout the duration of Lantana.His character here is full of anger. He's at the point in his life where a mistake will make him lose his wife and children by straying to an area where he shouldn't have gone in the first place. His wife beautifully played by Kerry Armstrong is incredible. She has an integrity and dignity that many women should envy. She's sure of herself and her life with even a husband that might have and affair but who comes running back to her when he realizes what's at stake.Barbara Hershey is another actress that always gives us a new dimension to her craft. She's never been better in her last appearances under the direction of Mr. Lawrence. Even Geoffrey Rush an actor who could go off the top in many of his roles plays the right note here. The rest of the cast is excellent. Lantana is a great film. The best thing is to relax and enjoy this well crafted drama.".

	schema:reviewBody "Australian cinema has gone through many phases  more downs than ups. Out of nowhere emerged this absolute gem of a film. The popularity and critical acclaim encouraged the director to follow up with Jindabyne  another gem but probably just didn't hit the heights of this one.As with Jindabyne this film is high metaphorical and to some degree open to interpretation. But much like Woody Allen there is a reluctance to dumb it down instead allowing the audience to discover the socalled underlying themes and messages of the film upon reflection. Really good study for high school English students in my view. Unfortunately in the pursuit of not dumbing it down many people don't get it or don't get it entirely. For this reason I just thought i'd throw you a couple of insights spoilers belowDANCING  METAPHOR At the start they are learning to dance. Now dancing symbolises unity of a man and woman in harmonious coordination marriage. The fact that they are learning to dance at the start of the film indicates that they need guidance or further development. They are unable to dance together indicating problems with marriages is a theme of this film. Perhaps love got it started but isn't sustaining it. Shortly after he starts his affair with another dancing class member. LACK OF COMMUNICATION  THEME This was the major point of the film. Relationships do not survive where communication is lacking. When he returns home with blood on his shirt following the accident during his morning jog his wife attempts to help and comfort but he doesn't say what happens and sternly brushes her off. She never tells him that she was going to allow their son to smoke pot at home. Obviously the fact that he is having an affair plays a role in their problems but as she revealed to the psychologist 'it's not that he's having an affair it's that he won't tell if he was.' Ironically it would appear that honesty and open communication will forgive his infidelity but nondisclosure is crossing the relationshipending line. Rush and his wife similarly have communication problems. His failure to answer the phone and simply listen to her pleas on the answering machine shows that communication between them is broken  as is the fact that he cannot look at her face while he makes love to her. Yet her failure to completely confront Rush with here suspicions that he's having a gay affair with one of her patients is equally paralysing to their relationship.Interestingly the gay patient plays two extremely important roles. First he indicates that his married lover tells him things about his marriage that he would never tell his wife. Again communication breakdown. Second when he speaks about the comments made by his lover about his lover's wife the psychologist interprets them to be comments made by her husband about her even though we later learn that she was mistaken. Though while she was mistaken in fact ie.. Rush was not that patient's lover it hardly matters as we come to realise that this is the sort of honesty that Rush does not provide to his wife. In fact when she mentions that she's having difficulty with this patient in the restaurant his solution is refer him one. This probably reflects the dealing of problems in their marriage if it's difficult of complicated get rid of it disregard it palm it off to someone else don't confront it or solve it yourself.... just refer him on. Then there is the issue of their daughter's tragic death. This has invariably distorted the marriage to the point where it is simply held together by grief. But again  communication becomes an issue. She felt that she had to communicate her grief to the world she wrote a book while he was very much against it and didn't tell his wife that he frequently visited the site of their daughter's death. The communication mismatch is astounding and is why their relationship is in crisis mode. Interestingly all this is contrasted with couple who live next door to the cop's mistress. HE's unemployed she works long shifts they have several children and are financially battling. All the hallmarks are there for a strained marriage. But surprisingly this is the strongest marriage in the film. They are a loving happy couple for one reason they communicate openly. He told his wife that the neighbour invited him in for coffee after she left for work. Full disclosure keeps this marriage happy no matter what external pressures are at play. In a way the director is basically saying that while most people think that financial difficulties work pressures unemployment and so on bring down marriages that isn't the case. Their communication keeps it alive and this is contrasted with the cop who has a stable homelife but their marriage is suffering due to their failure to communicate openly with each other.THE POINT The film leaves us with conflicting feelings. Rush lost his wife the cop's mistress has not repaired her marriage with her ex but the cop's marriage appears to survive. The fact that the cop confessed to his infidelity may have thrown his marriage off the rails temporarily but it forced him to open up to his wife and for his wife to openly communicate with him... and at the end it appears that they are dancing in perfect harmony  communication and disclosure of his affair actually saved their marriage.However Rush's stirring words are just as revealing sometimes love isn't enough. This is very true when relationships encounter difficulties and obscure patches. Love will get it started and keep it going for a while but communication breakdowns will eventually overcome the love that holds marriages together. This was what the director was trying to say in my view.".

	schema:headline " Australian cinema but not as we know it.";
	schema:reviewBody "Most successful Australian films are quintessentially Australian. From Walkabout in 1970 via Peter Weir's pictures such as Picnic at Hanging Rock The Last Wave and Gallipoli right up to releases around Lantana such as The Tracker Dirty Deeds RabbitProof Fence Aussie Rules The Dish and the Steve Irwin vehicle The Crocodile Hunter Collision Course. Their appeal is partly based on an exploration of Australian culture or rather a contrast of cultures either within Australia or with the rest of the world. Like much of British Cinema Australian Cinema has taken refuge in nationhood.Lantana is different. Although it is set in present day Sydney it could with the exception of the film's metaphorical title be set in any Western urban conurbation. The film does not depend on either supposed Aussie character traits or wellknown locations. Postcard Sydney is eschewed in favour of suburbia and midtown. It is also bold as although it contains a crime detection story the film is primarily about an interwoven set of relationships gone wrong. The police investigation does not begin until halfway through the film and this allows the relationships to be explored in detail before the more conventional narrative begins. Leon Anthony LaPaglia is a morose police detective whose marriage to Sonja the excellent Kerry Armstrong is failing. His brief affair with Jane Rachael Blake in the opening sequence is a symptom not a cause. Sonja confides her worries of the affair to Dr. Somers Barbara Hershey whose own relationship is soured by suspicion and tragedy. The only solid relationship is that of Jane's neighbours whose domestic circumstances are the most difficult. This background unfolds in the first half of the film and the individual relationships are then laid over the plot allowing both an intertwining and explanation. The strength of the film is that as the characters have already been well realised so their actions and emotions can be understood in the second half of the film. This is territory often reserved to a good novel and is rarely brought off in the cinema and it is so well done here that a couple of narrative coincidences can be forgiven.The lantana is a large native Australian flowering plant whose attractive and benign appearance conceals a thorny interior. The shrub is cleverly threaded into the plot and serves as a reminder that in relationships things might not be all they seem and that care is needed to prevent hurt. In keeping with the film's realistic style there are no feelgood resolutions but the emotional intensity carries it to an ending of some hope rather than desolation.".

	onyx:emotionText "Most successful Australian films are quintessentially Australian. From Walkabout in 1970 via Peter Weir's pictures such as Picnic at Hanging Rock The Last Wave and Gallipoli right up to releases around Lantana such as The Tracker Dirty Deeds RabbitProof Fence Aussie Rules The Dish and the Steve Irwin vehicle The Crocodile Hunter Collision Course. Their appeal is partly based on an exploration of Australian culture or rather a contrast of cultures either within Australia or with the rest of the world. Like much of British Cinema Australian Cinema has taken refuge in nationhood.Lantana is different. Although it is set in present day Sydney it could with the exception of the film's metaphorical title be set in any Western urban conurbation. The film does not depend on either supposed Aussie character traits or wellknown locations. Postcard Sydney is eschewed in favour of suburbia and midtown. It is also bold as although it contains a crime detection story the film is primarily about an interwoven set of relationships gone wrong. The police investigation does not begin until halfway through the film and this allows the relationships to be explored in detail before the more conventional narrative begins.

	schema:reviewBody "I'm not going to bother mentioning the acting the camera the music the script the editing or the direction beyond this. The acting is all intelligently filled with nuance and not a one steps even briefly outside the realm of believability. The camera is sophisticated without being showy. The music  acoustic picking rhythmic electric strumming sparse piano  underscores the film without ever making itself obvious or taking over. The screenplay based on a play consists of characters whose lives intersect in a way that's novel yet not unbelievably so. The editing is smooth and unnoticeable and the direction is sharp and unobtrusive.The film opens with the camera showing a dead body lying in an area of thickets. We're shown at the opening but won't need to worry about it for another hour. The first hour of the film is based solely on the relationships of its interconnecting characters.We next see Leon Anthony LaPaglia having sex with a woman who we later learn to be Jane Rachael Blake. He's married though to Sonya Kerry Armstrong and she goes to a psychiatrist unbeknownst to Leon. It seems like Leon may be trying to cover up or make seem less damaging to his marriage his affair  which he seems to get little joy from  by making sure his two sons give him a kiss on the neck before going off to school. Leon is also a cop and early in the film he takes out his aggression  which is a result of his pain  on a drug dealer by being more rough with him than he should.The psychiatrist Sonya goes to Dr. Valerie Somers Barbara Hershey has another patient Patrick Peter Phelps. He's been seeing a married man and asks Valerie what he should do. Valerie we see grows uneasy as if it hits close to home. As if she's dealt with this before. In a public speech she gives Valerie or should I say the director says that the home is a battleground for most though it's not supposed to be. It is for her as well. She's lost her daughter to a murder and her relationship with her husband John Geoffrey Rush is becoming increasingly empty. She suspects he may be having an affair as well. When someone repeats something for us Making love to her was like trying to fill an empty well we're fully aware that while one person in particular seems to take this to heart this relates to each and every one of these characters. One reviewer on this site said that the characters in the film aren't full people. And I agree with him only in a different way. They're fully fleshedout characters but they're only half full because they're perpetually bereft. Except for Paula Daniella Farinacci and Nik Vince Colosimo the couple that lives across the street from Jane. Later in the film when Paula says He told me the line has more meaning than it seems. This is the one relationship that is the exception to the film's rule.The subtle hints we're given may or may not be important later on in the story which after the halfway mark involves a police investigation and the film manages to remain a drama about its characters throughout. The investigation exists in the background as a device. It's strange that anyone would think the film is about the investigation by itself. If the film is about any one thing it's about love and the quest to repair it after it's been damaged.Valerie's own marital problems come to a head when she accosts a man on the street and accuses him of making a comment about her under his breath. The man turns out to be the exwife of Jane who we meet again later during the investigation.One night Leon comes home to find his wife not there goes to find her and discovers that she's gone to a dance club. The two have been taking dancing lessons but Leon isn't very enthusiastic about them. Leon gets progressively more angry at himself while Valerie is trying to make the best of a bad situation even if the situation at least on her side gets inadvertently worse because of it. She's not out for revenge for what she suspects of her husband.When Valerie drives down a back road and gets in an accident she walks to a closed gas station and calls her husband John and confronts him. When she doesn't come home Leon and his partner Claudia Leah Purcell who's looking for love herself are assigned to the missing persons case. There's wicked dramatic irony when John after being questioned by Leon about his whereabouts and reacting with anger asks him how he would react if his wife were to get in a car with a stranger which is what the police have suspected Valerie did. In one scene between Leon and John who is a suspect in his wife's disappearance John admits that he didn't listen to his wife's very real cries for help.By the end of the film its stance towards marriage becomes I think increasingly pessimistic as if any slight crack in a relationship would mean that both sides are doomed. But in the last segment after the investigation is resolved there's a glimmer of light for its characters. The final image suggests that the characters and Leon in particular have hope in working through their pain and transgressions and may someday be able to resume the dance.".

The characters do become embroiled in the second half however and the story is then more engrossing.  The short sequences and the quick changes of scene and circumstance particularly in the first half along with the overall filming style all flatter the audience for its intelligence.  Yet what is there in this film that is intelligent?  It offers no philosophical nor any sociological insight that is not better provided in other films.  The only thing approaching insight is the wife's complaint in the central relationship that when her husband has an affair the true betrayal is that he doesn't tell her about it.  Nothing here that you won't find in a prime time sitcom or a thousand hollywood romances.  But is it true or representative?  I doubt it. The film proudly displays ethnic diversity amongst its characters. But there is no ethnic diversity in their attitudes to marital behaviour and loyalty.  This is complete garbage.  More Hollywood via a cultural cringe from a nonHollywood film.  Southern European attitudes for example were done much better in the Godfather series. All this said the performances are strong.  They tell us to take the story and the ideas seriously.  But at that level the film is vacuous.  A great disappointment.".

I will be commenting on part of the plot and should you not wish to know about the plot read no further. In my humble opinion this film Lantana misused the talents of some very fine actors and actresses by impaling them with a thinly disguised soap opera that had characters as thin as tissue paper. Without knowing some of the culture of Australia such as the importance of having a mate which is an undeveloped theme in the movie and leaves part of the movie hanging in midair Lantana does not appeal to a broad audience.  Here's the plot spoiler bit.  One character throws a woman's shoe in a tangle of bush after a night out with his mates his wife works two jobs to keep them.  He looks after the children except when he's out with his mates.  Sorting out the who how why and what of the shoe in the tangle of bush is central to sorting out one of the tangles of a mystery. And there are some very thin in my opinion subplots in a failed attempt to flesh out the characters which actually seems to confuse things without adding anything to the movie as a whole.  Had we had several previous episodes as in a television series in which to get to know the characters they would have been more developed believable and knowable.  There were some potentially very interesting characters in Lantana.  Their lives and their actions may have made more sense to us with the whole of the film hanging together. Where I live we get films from all over the world and I have seen a number of Australian Australian films so I know they can and do make good films. So do other countries.  After I have seen a movie I usually have feelings about the movie  happiness sadness Why do we we exist? What a superb film. OK but... So bad it could be good. or Wow! but seldom do I have the feeling of wondering why they even bothered.  My purpose in writing this is simply to state how deeply disappointed I was about Lantana.".

	schema:reviewBody "Not many films get made about Louis XIV even in France.  One reason is that this is a confusing period of French history.  Yet Louis enfant roi does a good job in trying to introduce it to us.The king is a child of ten.  The nobility and the populace are rebelling. The Queen mother is a Spaniard played by a Spanish actress with the necessary accent and France is at war with Spain.  The prime minister Cardinal Mazarin is an Italian played by an Italian actor etc.  The king's relatives are demanding a share of power while behaving like a pillaging army.  Amorality abounds and no one can be trusted.  Louis XIV learned how to rule in this atmosphere. As the film progresses we see the young king turn into an adolescent leading troops in the field and learn his craft.  He loved his mother and trusted Mazarin but nobody else not even his brother.  As a child he learned to suspect everyone and this was how he ruled. This is a good film with the budget to support it unlike Rossellini's La Prise du Pouvoir.  It just requires a little knowledge to understand.".

	onyx:emotionText "Not many films get made about Louis XIV even in France.  One reason is that this is a confusing period of French history.  Yet Louis enfant roi does a good job in trying to introduce it to us.The king is a child of ten.  The nobility and the populace are rebelling. The Queen mother is a Spaniard played by a Spanish actress with the necessary accent and France is at war with Spain.  The prime minister Cardinal Mazarin is an Italian played by an Italian actor etc.  The king's relatives are demanding a share of power while behaving like a pillaging army.  Amorality abounds and no one can be trusted.  Louis XIV learned how to rule in this atmosphere. As the film progresses we see the young king turn into an adolescent leading troops in the field and learn his craft.  He loved his mother and trusted Mazarin but nobody else not even his brother.  As a child he learned to suspect everyone and this was how he ruled. This is a good film with the budget to support it unlike Rossellini's La Prise du Pouvoir.  It just requires a little knowledge to understand.";

	schema:reviewBody "In January of 1924 director Erich von Stroheim gathered a small group of friends to view his magnum opus a film which would become legendary. This was GREED  when the experience was over all there agreed that they had just seen the greatest motion picture ever created. They were the only audience to see the film in its entirety.Von Stroheim was with Griffith  Chaplin one of the authentic geniuses of the silent cinema. He had an unerring eye for what was visual and how to transfer mere words into astonishing images on the screen. He was also terribly adept at spending other people's money. A notorious stickler for the most authentic minute detail he ignored concerns for time  financial budgets.The original GREED ran somewhere between 8 and 9 hours. While that would be fine for a modern TV miniseries it is unworkable for a motion picture. The bosses at MGM had had difficulty with von Stroheim before and were in no mood to mess around. GREED was taken out of its director's control and hacked down to 140 minutes. All the excised footage was destroyed. This is the blackest spot on Irving Thalberg's memory. Von Stroheim mourned his lost masterpiece the rest of his life.The story although incredibly detailed is fairly straightforward. The corrupting influence of wealth is examined through the lives of seven individuals. The tragic marriage of Mac a fake dentist  Trina an innocent young woman is compared  contrasted to the equally horrific relationship between the mad Maria  Zerkow the Junkman and to the beatific love between Old Grannis owner of a dog hospital  Miss Baker a sweet old lady. Shadowing Mac  Trina is her cousin Marcus equally in love with her  the 5000 she wins in a lottery.The story of Mac  Trina is the main focus  it is utterly compelling. Seldom has the destruction of a marriage been seen in such detail. Certain scenes stay in the mind a long time the picnic lunch on the sewer their wedding while a funeral procession marches by below their final bloody confrontation.The movie ends as does the book it is based on in Death Valley. Von Stroheim insisted on actually shooting there in summer. The heat was terrible  it shows on the faces of Gibson Gowland as Mac  Jean Hersholt as Marcus. The ending is as stark  unforgiving as the desert itself.Mr. Gowland  ZaSu Pitts give the performances of their lives magnificent in every way. Mr. Gowland shows us the full extent of a simple man being driven insane while Miss Pitts' change from sweetness to a miserly shrew is truly frightening. Had the film not been butchered and their performances seen in their entirety they surely would had ascended to the very heights of their profession. As it was Gowland quickly descended back into obscurity spending the rest of his career in mostly unbilled bit parts. Miss Pitts became a comedienne whose vague manner  fluttery hands were seen in many comedies over the next 35 years. Von Stroheim continued with his excesses and finally met his directorial downfall a few years after GREED. He was able to continue on in films as a very good character actor mostly in Europe.In 1999 Turner Classic Movies had GREED reconstructed using hundreds of still photographs taken during production editing based on an original shooting script an inspired use of color and tints  a new musical score. The result runs for 4 hours and is wonderful. At last we have a better understanding of Von Stroheim's blighted vision  wasted genius.".

Sometimes it relies on fancy methods such as the occasional use of gold tinting which must have demanded some painstaking work and at other times it relies on flawless direction carefully chosen details and a keen understanding of what is happening in the characters' lives.  The tense finale is especially memorable a sequence you won't forget for a while.The only real questions about Greed have to do with its length.  Hardly anyone disputes the folly of the studio decision to chop the original down to a couple of hours.  The restored version uses stills and title cards to fill in the most important scenes that were left out in the studio release and from this you can also piece together what was actually included in the shorter version.  Several significant secondary characters were almost completely eliminated which took away some of the relationships that were supposed to serve as important comparisons with the central relationship between McTeague and his wife.  Even if they had been right to cut the film to a quarter of its length the choices they made left much to be desired.Would it really have been better with several more hours of material? Although there is plenty of plot there isn't anything in the story thematically that would require anything longer then the restored version. It's a gripping study of human flaws especially greed but goes no farther. It is admirable to see a director try to hold so closely to a novel but the Frank Norris novel while detailed convincing and wellconceived as far as it goes doesn't have the depth or the multidimensional characters of the greatest novels.  There is no doubt that the lost footage would have provided many more examples of fine filmmaking but most of it would not have added very much to the story itself.What would probably have been perfect is something close to the length of the restored version with the actual but now lost footage instead of the patchwork reconstruction.  Since that is impossible we are very fortunate to have the restored version that includes all of the most important parts of the story and that gives new life to one of the fine classics of silent cinema.".

The exaggerated movements and facial expressions and the overbearing music I believe turned me off.However that changed drastically when I watched von Stroheim's Greed for the first time. The film simply put is immaculate. The portrayal of McTeague and Trina is fantastic. Pitts and Gowland without using their voices mind you create depth and allow the audience to sympathize with the characters. Silence often acted as a barrier between myself and the characters here that distance is bridged by the two actors and I must assume von Stroheim's masterful direction.Yes the direction is masterful. I believe describing it as such is entirely accurate. Innovative may go too far but masterful just about covers it. The realism which shooting on locations benefited is something to behold. This is a story that Hollywood would balk at depicting in 2004 imagine the row that was had in 1924. Von Stroheim never backs away from his unrelentingly grim vision reinforcing his theme money is evil throughout. And then there is the Death Valley sequence  one of the most marvelous series of scenes committed to celluloid.All in all this is truly a fantastic film  one that has aged due to its ability to treat grim subject matter as it should much better than many of its contemporaries. Also it should be noted that this represents a fine adaptation of Norris' novel McTeague. I was a fan of the novel before I saw the film and the film does not disappoint.Von Stroheim ensured that the spirit if not the word of the novel was maintained.1010".

And then there is the Death Valley sequence  one of the most marvelous series of scenes committed to celluloid.All in all this is truly a fantastic film  one that has aged due to its ability to treat grim subject matter as it should much better than many of its contemporaries. Also it should be noted that this represents a fine adaptation of Norris' novel McTeague. I was a fan of the novel before I saw the film and the film does not disappoint.Von Stroheim ensured that the spirit if not the word of the novel was maintained.1010";

This obsession ends up destroying her life and McTeagues. There are scenes that are just uncomfortable and others that are horrible. The jockeying for position in the family with the husband willing to bend only so far leads to tragic consequences. Avarice will eventually take one down and Von Stroheim showed this to us. The scene with the two men fighting it out in the desert at the end is one of the most painful ever. Neither can ever hope to survive yet their fixation on gold goes beyond their love of life. It is so pathetic. Even with all that missing footage everyone should see this for the masterful presentation of the sick and dying characters.

	schema:reviewBody "I hate to admit how long it took me to get around to renting this from the Facets crew in Chicago in fact this was the 150th title the previous 149 including some real dreck. Now that I finally have I think it's a damn shame that Erich Von Stroheim couldn't have been around nowadays when this could've been a series on HBO. As you've all heard the original ninehour offering was mutilated in various stages down to a few hours the resulting cinematic corpse must've been downright baffling for 1924 audiences. What I've seen is the 1999 239minute reconstruction using a lot of still photos. The original gold tinting has been restored for the giant tooth etc. and some of the stills of the nice elderly couple are fully colored. There's also a new score which fits in pretty well.I haven't read the Frank Norris novel on which this is based but apparently Stroheim followed it faithfully if not fanatically. Over a period of 1520 years we follow a California miner named McTeague as he becomes an apprentice dentist then practices on his own in San Francisco then is forced to give that up and returns to being a miner after killing his increasingly crazy wife fleeing the law he winds up in Death Valley handcuffed to a corpse. Two factors show how far ahead of his time Stroheim was first the relentless grimness of his vision of humanity as slaves to their various weaknesses and second his nuances in terms of the performances he gets from his actors and in his presentation of events. Most of you have probably seen at least a few silent films you know how theatrically over the top most of the acting was to be fair to the actors of course they didn't have their voices available plus that was the style of the day. But Stroheim gets some wonderful naturalism from his cast principally from the hero Gibson Gowland a big lug who lets his inner urges both toward kindness and cruelty seem to well up from within rather than being imposed from the outside. Near the beginning and the end McTeague is seen kissing a tiny bird he's carefully holding in his huge hand the second one is his pet that he's about to set free anticipating his own death it's as poignant as a similar moment that Rutger Hauer had years later in Bladerunner. Unfortunately Jean Hersholt as McTeague's best friend and later bitter enemy is more conventionally hammy and Zasu Pitts as McTeague's doomed wife Trina plays virtually every scene with her eyeballs bulging again to be fair to the actors that maybe was what Stroheim wanted. I personally was disappointed that some downright gruesome elements only survive in the still shots such as McTeague getting his ear bitten nearly off in a wrestling match with his friend or his wife discovering the corpse of the local junk dealer's wife then having a nightmare about the latter in the dream the dead woman seems to have as many teeth as Lon Chaney in London After Midnight. But along with the viciousness and degradation there's also some genuine tenderness mostly involving the old couple who live next to each other for years before finally getting intimate and even some humor mostly of the black variety. Black humor it's an old expression not involving AfricanAmericans you can Google it. As a final modernism there's really no emotional payoff as such it's basically a bleak view of humanity carried through to the bitter end and to paraphrase the Frank Norris quote seen at the outset people will like it or they won't. But I doubt they'll forget it.I will confess that parts of Greed seem dated now such as the depiction of Trina's German immigrant parents with their KatzenjammerKids dialog cards also some vaguely antiSemitic elements the junk dealer has a Jewishsounding name and looks somewhat like the old drawings of Charles Dickens' Fagin character there's also a sign for SEMITE BUTCHER. I read that Stroheim may have been originally Jewish himself before adding Von to his name so maybe this was also a subtle dig at the goyim. The junk dealer's wife seems a stereotypical shifty Mexican. I would imagine Stroheim was again adhering to the novel. Some of Stroheim's directorial flourishes veer a little too close to German expressionism such as a recurring shot of a pair of gnarled arms caressing a pile of gold coins or a similar recurring shot of several pairs of arms clutching at a pile of gold dishes. There's a scene with McTeague's cat leaping up to attack a birdcage that clearly involved the cat being tossed into the air. I could probably think of a few other quibbles but I'm really not so inclined. As my unprecedented 10 out of 10 vote indicates I want to convey what an amazing achievement this movie is even in it's truncated form and whatever issues I may have with Ted Turner may the movie gods bless him for presiding over this reconstruction. Colorizing the classics on the other hand... Bottom line don't just see this out of a sense of duty. See it because it's relevant to us now reminding us that we have choices in life and those choices have consequences...".

	schema:headline " Heavyhanded and depressing";
	schema:reviewBody "I can't really say that I'm surprised this film was a 'commercial failure'.I see many IMDb users extolling the improvement to be made by including stills to pad out the picture with previously excised material I've heard that the existing shortened edition plays much better with the orchestral Carl Davis soundtrack. Not having benefited by either of these experiences all I can say is that the version I witnessed was one of the most downbeat heavily symbolist and thus ironically despite all von Stroheim's efforts least 'realistic' and melodramatic films I've seen to date and most definitely not a potential crowdpleaser. This has to be the original 'feelbad movie'.I seriously doubt that a further hour and a half or seven hours of footage in the same style would have made much difference. The film does indeed show signs of missing segments but the only real way to avoid this problem would have been to adapt the story more concisely in the first place in editing down any work there is a limit to how much can be achieved without summarising and reworking. Beyond a certain point in film as in written text simply juxtaposing snipped sections in all their original detail isn't effective. If von Stroheim had set out to create a twohour film in the first place he would probably have done it differently.He probably should have.Whatever else you can say for the film it isn't subtle. I had the sensation after a while of being bludgeoned over the head with the repeated 'miser shots' of Trina gloating over gold or of disembodied hands grasping at loot as if the idea weren't already driven home by the intertitles. The melodrama of McTeague veins swelling eyes whirling being tempted by the helpless panting lips of the unconscious woman in the dentist's chair  with its wordy interjection about 'the fine fabric' of his mother's influence being tainted by the deeptooted evil of his father's apparently hereditary vileness  is the sort of thing that belongs to filmmaking of an earlier period if indeed anywhere and gets silent films a bad name.None of the characters seem very pleasant and they all seem to be caricatures fired only and arbitrarily by lust for money it's possible that the editing loses large chunks of motivation here for none of the abrupt transformations seem to make a lot of sense. The state of the McTeagues' marriage in which Trina several times displays physical fear and revulsion at her husband's anticipated advances and never seems to find him attractive is highly opaque save as an exercise in selfflagellation.The final Death Valley sequence is admittedly powerful but if that were really the aim of the movie it could have been achieved without the need for everything that went before to justify it. The manhunt across the desert has become something of a Western clich now but was presumably original when this production came out I'm afraid it did bring to mind the little 'fleapit' cinema in The Smallest Show on Earth where the patrons were subjected to endless desert films with the heating turned up full in order to increase the sales of cold drinks during the intermission! And yet again it's unsubtle the point is made when Marcus catches up to McTeague and there isn't enough water to get them both back out of the desert. Their lust for gold condemns them film over. But Greed has to pile on death after death  McTeague talks Marcus into shooting his to all appearances perfectly healthy mule thus removing any possible means of escape presumably in order to get him to empty his gun. Then one of the bullets just happens to pierce the waterskin oh no! they're doubly dead. Or counting the mule is it triply? And then they fight to the death over who gets to carry the gold before he dies of thirst  more heavyhanded message. And then Marcus's dead body ends up handcuffed to McTeague thus making quadruply certain that he can't get out of the desert what with his being 100 miles from water minus transport with an empty waterskin and cuffed to a corpse he can't drag. I was waiting for him to start hacking Marcus' hand off at the wrist but apparently that was a step in realism too far even for von Stroheim. So what does he do? He sets his bird free presumably the other one symbolising the hated wife vanished during one of the missing sections. Clearly he has been carrying food and water for this delicate creature and shading it from the sun all the time he was crawling across the desert simply in order to bring it out for one last rhetorical flourish at this point. Only the bird refuses to leave him and perches on the empty waterskin. More heavy meaning... The End. I don't like to say this of a notorious masterpiece but it verges on the laughable.Some of my problems with the film are I'm sure down to the tone of the original 'wartsandall' novel. Some of them are probably caused by the editing which frankly the director would appear to have brought upon himself. Some of them  namely the exaggerated acting style the selfconscious use of arty goldy inserts  can only be laid at the foot of the choices made for the motion picture and aren't ever going to meet my taste. But the experience as a whole really doesn't lead me to seek out the 'restored' version when I so totally fail to recognise in this version of Greed the tragically butchered but sublime artwork I had seen described...".

	onyx:emotionText "I can't really say that I'm surprised this film was a 'commercial failure'.I see many IMDb users extolling the improvement to be made by including stills to pad out the picture with previously excised material I've heard that the existing shortened edition plays much better with the orchestral Carl Davis soundtrack. Not having benefited by either of these experiences all I can say is that the version I witnessed was one of the most downbeat heavily symbolist and thus ironically despite all von Stroheim's efforts least 'realistic' and melodramatic films I've seen to date and most definitely not a potential crowdpleaser. This has to be the original 'feelbad movie'.I seriously doubt that a further hour and a half or seven hours of footage in the same style would have made much difference. The film does indeed show signs of missing segments but the only real way to avoid this problem would have been to adapt the story more concisely in the first place in editing down any work there is a limit to how much can be achieved without summarising and reworking. Beyond a certain point in film as in written text simply juxtaposing snipped sections in all their original detail isn't effective. If von Stroheim had set out to create a twohour film in the first place he would probably have done it differently.He probably should have.Whatever else you can say for the film it isn't subtle. I had the sensation after a while of being bludgeoned over the head with the repeated 'miser shots' of Trina gloating over gold or of disembodied hands grasping at loot as if the idea weren't already driven home by the intertitles. The melodrama of McTeague veins swelling eyes whirling being tempted by the helpless panting lips of the unconscious woman in the dentist's chair  with its wordy interjection about 'the fine fabric' of his mother's influence being tainted by the deeptooted evil of his father's apparently hereditary vileness  is the sort of thing that belongs to filmmaking of an earlier period if indeed anywhere and gets silent films a bad name.None of the characters seem very pleasant and they all seem to be caricatures fired only and arbitrarily by lust for money it's possible that the editing loses large chunks of motivation here for none of the abrupt transformations seem to make a lot of sense. The state of the McTeagues' marriage in which Trina several times displays physical fear and revulsion at her husband's anticipated advances and never seems to find him attractive is highly opaque save as an exercise in selfflagellation.The final Death Valley sequence is admittedly powerful but if that were really the aim of the movie it could have been achieved without the need for everything that went before to justify it. The manhunt across the desert has become something of a Western clich now but was presumably original when this production came out I'm afraid it did bring to mind the little 'fleapit' cinema in The Smallest Show on Earth where the patrons were subjected to endless desert films with the heating turned up full in order to increase the sales of cold drinks during the intermission! And yet again it's unsubtle the point is made when Marcus catches up to McTeague and there isn't enough water to get them both back out of the desert. Their lust for gold condemns them film over. But Greed has to pile on death after death  McTeague talks Marcus into shooting his to all appearances perfectly healthy mule thus removing any possible means of escape presumably in order to get him to empty his gun. Then one of the bullets just happens to pierce the waterskin oh no! they're doubly dead. Or counting the mule is it triply?

	schema:reviewBody "Nearly all reviews tend to begin talking about Erich von Stroheim's film Greed in reviewing its length and its controversy at the studio and how now we either can see a version that is 4 hours long and uses some intermittent production stills and title cards or a 2 hour version that is the most complete version available that contains moving footage. It's inevitable in fact because what von Stroheim did was create a great film at any length it's important to not overestimate the value of what remains since frankly this is what people still rave about 85 years after it was produced. It could be 5 minutes and I'd want to see it again and again and maybe again. Hell just give me that final Death Valley sequence and I'm a happy cinema camper forever.What remains of that greatwhitewhale of cinematic folklore the 8hourcut is a 132 minute sliver on the corruption of the human spirit. Greed is never less than compelling it's about a failed goldminer named John McTeague unforgettable screen presence Gibson Gowland who gets a job by the prodding of his mother as a dentist in San Francisco. Enter in dogdoctor Marcus Jean Hersholt and his girl Trina equally unforgettable for better or worse Zasu Pitts who comes in to get her teeth fixed. She does and during the operation McTeague gives her a kiss. When Marcus finds out he's not happy but he relents he can have her and very soon after though somewhat reluctantly McTeague and Trina get married.But there's a certain catch Trina has by true stroke of luck won 5000 from a lottery ticket and this is five grand in 1906 money which is... a lot I take it from this film and decides to hold on to the money... and then never spend a dime of it. She has all this gold and doesn't know what to do with it except being stingy. As this may puzzle some 21st century people who wonder why a woman would hold on to her huge lot of money equatable today to hundreds of thousands the answer is only given as that it's in her nature to save  which then turns into an obsession her eyes growing wider and wickeder every day with von Stroheim inserting in vicious incredible images of skeletal arms reaching in and bony hands and fingers grasping gold coins. All of this of course doesn't bode well on Mr. McTeague especially when faced with it being found out he has no license as a dentist and loses his job.To say it gets worse from there for the unhappily married couple is putting it lightly. What von Stroheim does with his dramatic crux in Greed is to make everything authentic in the exterior sense  everything was shot on location in San Francisco and yes Death Valley  and then to make the characterizations of McTeague Trina and Marcus into such sad grotesque but very human figures that it goes beyond the usual boundaries of melodrama. Some of their facial expressions and their acting may be so very overthetop and even for a frightening but somehow cute Pitts kind of hokey but they always work for whatever scene is required be it a drunken McTeague badgering the evergreedy and obsessive Trina for the gold coins or Marcus's neverending grudge against McTeague for taking away his woman who ironically won't give his man a penny of the earnings.Like future essential chronicles on the nature of the title subject like Treasure of the Sierra Madre and There Will be Blood wealth becomes a state of mind for its characters but since these are not bourgeois people used to having loads of money it blows head gaskets. Would the characters know what to even do with it all if they could hold on to it long enough? Von Stroheim may be a somewhat crueler and definitely more pessimistic person on this matter than even Huston or Anderson the ending also makes the desert scene in The Good the Bad and the Ugly look like Care Bears in comparison and it's because the drama is at such a pitch of the maddening and bizarre and sad that it stays so pungent to this day.And all this I should say again in only a quarter of its original running time. To be more controversial than anyone else might be as a compromise it may have served von Stroheim well to at least have something of a fulllength film by the end of it all. This is not to say Mayer was the hero in this story and any given movielover will feel a sense of sympathy for the film not unlike The Magnificent Ambersons or Metropolis. But the legacy of Greed remains not on its cult status as a deformed thing but a work of artistic wonder a monumental shriek to that all encompassing bastard of the title. Anyone who loves a good silent film would do well to seek out any version save maybe for that on an Ipod.".

	schema:reviewBody "Erich von Stroheim directs Greed a classic of silent cinema. Famously shot on over 440 reels of celluloid only to have over four hundred and thirty reels slashed by megastudio Metro GoldwynMayer the film has been shown over the decades with wildly differing runningtimes some cuts running between eight and ten hours long some four hours and some a mere one hundred and twenty minutes. MGM eventually burnt most of the film's footage in 1957 supposedly to free up storage space and extract silver nitrate from Greed's filmstock. Stroheim died that same year. In 1999 American producer Rick Schmidlin reconstructed Greed using Stroheim's preproduction material and continuity script dated March 1923. Using photographs stills and titlecards his cut attempted to restore the film to Stroheim's original intentions. As Schmidlin's cut still barely resembles Stroheim's mammoth 9 hour director's cut Greed is typically classified as a lost film.Epic in scope Greed revolves around a gang of friends one of whom is failed gold miner Mac McTeague Gibson Gowland. After winning a lottery the gang progressively destroy one another some losing their minds jobs and some subjecting the others to various forms of inhumanity betrayal and violence. Sounds straightforward? The film is actually very nuanced the MGM cuts reduce the film to sensational silliness though you wouldn't know this from any of the shorter cuts of the film. Whole subplots and chunks were removed such that Stroheim's rich canvas gets condensed into a fairly mundane melodramatic love triangle. The film's longer cuts however hint at a better picture with numerous little scenes and rich details. What becomes apparent in these cuts is that the film's title refers not only to gold money and sex but to all desire which turn Stroheim's characters into grotesque little schemers. Born in Austria Stroheim skewers a very specific set of American myths  liberty independence individualism Manifest Destiny  as his film portrays masses of immigrants adsorbed by a United States which swallow identities bulldozes cultures and breeds insular pockets. Everyone here is motivated by a creed of selfinterest and selfprotection hoping and hoping and scrambling over the hopes of others. One gets the sense of a compulsive busyness but a fundamental emptiness the false promise of endless opportunity matched by a fear of being cast permanently adrift.Not strictly Expressionistic the film nevertheless contains very big expressionistic strokes which attempt to convey a kind of festering cruelty which grows and grows before consuming totally. The film ends in Death Valley two men scrambling for a gun in a desert their only witness a starving donkey. The film's heavily influenced everything from The Good The Bad And The Ugly to The Treasure of the Sierra Madre to There Will Be Blood to Seraphim Falls.?10  For silent film aficionados only. For decades and even to this day the film was mocked for being about Stroheim's own greedy need for reels upon reels of footage and film. Whether Stroheim's six and four hour cuts which he favoured play well today is unknown.".

The film ends in Death Valley two men scrambling for a gun in a desert their only witness a starving donkey. The film's heavily influenced everything from The Good The Bad And The Ugly to The Treasure of the Sierra Madre to There Will Be Blood to Seraphim Falls.?10  For silent film aficionados only. For decades and even to this day the film was mocked for being about Stroheim's own greedy need for reels upon reels of footage and film. Whether Stroheim's six and four hour cuts which he favoured play well today is unknown.";

Plus the 4hour version is simply one long slog.Why is this version  or ANY version  so long? Well I think the director is just in love with himself and can't bear to crop a 10second shot of McTeague down to 6 seconds. If you do that enough over a period of 9 hours  if you allow every frame to be retained in the editing process  you wind up with a movie that is more egodriven than goodsense driven. How many times do you need to shout at the screen Okay Erich we GET it! before you realize that the muchmaligned studio executives might just have been right? The exception proves the rule when you do occasionally witness a genuinely wellcut sequence and are understandably riveted by it. Pacing is everything but in this case even the studio hacks couldn't completely excise the excess baggage.One positive comment about the TCM 4hour version I'm often highly critical of music soundtracks added 75 years later that are pure hokum. This one however composed by Robert Israel and performed by the Moravian Symphony Orchestra is mostly excellent and I'd recommend anyone watch this version just to see how successfully it can be done. It sure made the long hard slog through the picture a whole heck of a lot easier!".

Many silent films have exaggerated acting to compensate for the lack of sound but for some reason it feels strikingly over the top in Greed. Again and again we are given the message that greed is terrible corrosive a disease... but what else is new? With megabanks like Goldman Sachs J.P.

	schema:reviewBody "I watched the 4 hr reconstruction version and I couldn't wait for this film to finally be over. I awaited the words 'The End' the way many cineastes await the discovery of the long lost original cut of this silent film. Despite all its acclaim the version I saw reveals Greed as an overlylong hamfisted melodrama 'epic' with cartoonish characters and situations clumsy heavyhanded symbolism and the overacting typical of its era. McTeague's wife Trina is a pale imitation when compared alongside Ebenezer Scrooge and seems to have a level of depth closer approximating Disney's later character Scrooge McDuck. The film reminds me in some respects to the current trend of 'serious' 'prestige' Oscarbait movies released every year just in time to receive nominations and wins during award season. It makes Capra's oftenderided films seem subtle by comparison.I can't help but wonder if the voters in various film polls who have acclaimed this film are voting on the extant 2.5 hour version or the 4 hr reconstruction which often relies on a La Jeteeesquire slide show of old onset photographs in an attempt to replace 1.5 hours of the missing footage OR if they're voting for the alleged greatness of the mythic 9.5 hour version seen by a handful of people before it was cut to ribbons by the studio. It seems like people feel so sorry for von Stroheim's loss that placing his film in the pantheon of 'great films' is an attempt at a consolation prize. Greed can't compare to achievements like Murnau's Sunrise which also took a simplistic story but through vision and artistry turned it into something much more. Unfortunately Greed doesn't succeed similarly IMO. I wish a copy of the original version would be magically discovered in storage somewhere either so we could see the greatness of this legendary film or so we could at least debunk the myth of its legendary 'greatness'.The story Hotheaded exgold miner turned unlicensed dentist McTeague proposes to his friend's girlfriend Trina after which she wins a 5000 lottery. His friend with a misplaced sense of entitlement is jealous over the loss of the girl and the fortune not knowing what a greedobsessed pennypinching goldhoarder Trina will become and how much she'll make McTeague's life miserable making them live like paupers while she stashes away her interest on the business investment she makes with her uncle not to mention the money she scrapes out of her husbands earnings. She'd be content for them to live in filth if she could hold onto her dream of someday swimming in a pile of gold. There are also parallel stories of a thieving maid woman who marries a junk dealer after her elaborate lie to him about a fantasized million  gold set of dishes that she claims to have once ownedhas buried away somewhere and a story of a couple of elderly boarders who live next door to one another and fall in love. It's astounding that the telling of this story required even 4 hours let alone 9.5 hours.If you want to watch a film about what greed can do to people and see an overthetop performance in about half the runtime I highly recommend 'The Treasure of the Sierra Madre' instead. Sitting through 'Greed' is only recommended to silent film enthusiasts and film historians yet 'tis still better than Vidor's 'The Crowd'.".

	schema:reviewBody "Greed 1924  out of 4 Landmark silent film about a happy couple Gibson Gowland Zasu Pitts whose lives slowly spins out of control and into pure hell once they win the lottery. Everyone knows the legend behind the making of this film and the fact that it's probably the most wanted lost film ever made. The 9hour cut of this movie will probably never be discovered so who knows what von Stroheim's original version was like but what remains 130minutes is quite an adventurous little gem that's really unlike any movie out there. I think what I enjoyed most is how simple the actual story was and how much the director was able to get out of it. There have been hundreds if not thousands of movies dealing with greed and this might be the simplest of them all. The plot is very simple and the director doesn't try to do anything overly difficult with it but that's what makes it so effective. We see the wife get this money and slowly begin to lose her mind in fear that she'll become poor. She refuses to use any of the money just to save it for when she needs it but as her mind begins to go she and her husband become more and more poor and yet they never touch the money that could bring them back to riches. The idea of someone becoming poor while sitting on a ton of money is an interesting idea and von Stroheim uses it to create a rather creepy film that manages to get darker and darker as it moves along. I was really amazed at both Gowland and Pitts. Their acting is terrific and I thought both really got into the roles and delivered wonderful performances. The way the two slowly begin to lose their minds was perfectly done by both and there wasn't a single second where I didn't believe they were going crazy. What was even more amazing was their physical appearance because they begin to have their looks break apart as they grow deeper into debt. I thought the way their looks changed was an interesting part of the story and one that really doesn't get mentioned much when people discuss the film. I thought the visuals of them getting poor and desperate were just as interesting as anything else in the film. Jean Hersholt is also terrific as a friend who also falls victim to the greed of the lottery ticket. The direction is flawless from start to finish. Again it's hard to tell what all this thing was meant to be considering seven hours !!! are missing from the picture but each frame has so much darkness and passion that you can't help but wonder what else is out there. The legendary ending in Death Valley certainly lives up to its hype as von Stroheim does a terrific job at making you feel the sun on your back as our characters grow more tired from the heat. You can't help but feel as if you're out in the heat with them and the final shot is pure beauty.".

It is a shame that Stroheim did not live in a time when the 130 minute cut would be released to theaters and the long version is released on DVD as the Unrated Version to try to boost sales like now days. However the visuals are some of the best in any movie ever made in the history of cinema. I am so glad that the restored 4 hour version with the stills has added the gold tenting and stenciling to the scenes as they originally were made. The acting is maybe the best in any silent cinema drama. Stroheim liked using comic actors for his dramas he felt they had more understated actions to their acting as compared to the overacting of the popular dramatic actors of the day. This is the essence of Erich von Stroheim's cinema. He cared more about realism than almost anything else. He used actual cramped apartments for the cramped apartments in the film. He even filmed in the actual locations of San Francisco and Death Valley when all could have easily been done in the studio or in another desert. Stroheim thought for his actor's to show that they were about to pass out from 120 degree temperatures in the desert that they needed to be actually be about to pass out from 120 degree temperatures. I lament over the fact I will probably never see a more complete version than what currently exists. I want to see the version that Stroheim originally planned but what we do have is not necessarily a skeleton as Stroheim referred to it. It has a great amount of flesh on it but not as much as the Director wanted. Even if only one frame of film existed it still would show an amazing achievement in the history of cinema.".

Their life together is comfortable and Michael loves her. But Claudia has dreams of life beyond her home town and is afraid that if she marries now she'll never realize them. Claudia's sister Kelly lives with her mother and struggles with good humor to care for her fatherless baby. Their mother hasn't left the house since Claudia's dad walked out on the family six months ago. No one understands why Claudia sympathizes with her renegade father. Like him she has a wild restless streak and longs for more. But she can't quite put her finger on what it is she wants.

And that is what most movies find a way to do.But you might reassess that intention and bask in a situation so simply wroughtthe houses the beach the old cars and most of all the array of people who fix cars and wait tables and hang out in ordinary working class bars. It all feels good even though it's not overall a feelgood movie. And the acting is generally spot on even the doubtful inclusion of Jon Bon Jovi as one of the two main guys.At the center of it all is the young woman Claudia played by Lauren Holly who is trying to find a way to not look back and yet finds herself trapped by the town and her devotion to her friends there. This is a slight flaw all alongthis seemingly bright and striving young woman is still working at a diner when she could easily move on or go to college or get another kind of job. But still Claudia is nearly engaged to the nice guy Michael Bon Jovi when her exboyfriend Charlie from three years earlier returns to town. Charlie is played by writerdirector Edward Burns and he might not be everyone's taste as a leading type but he works in this role for me. He's charming and unreliable even in his actions which are too coy and sweet and lovable for his sudden appearance in town. So the conflict is there and maybe it's not enough for a feature film. What fills in the gaps are small things like a past abortion and its consequences or a mother played with utter brilliance by Blythe Danner struggling with her own man issues. There are bar friends and a sister and a mechanic or two on the side and it mixes and matches and floats and often avoids high drama or deeper plot development. Even the characters are left someone simple partly because there are so many of them but they become increasingly convincing.What then makes the movie work? All of this as it is including its restraint and lack of the sensational. And most of all it's Holly's performance that builds and holds together through it all. I was surprised by the depth of what she pulled off and yet I'd never heard of her. It turns out she's been very active but in mostly smaller roles both in movies and television. This is one movie never mentioned in highlights of her career and I think it's a shame. Burns clearly pulled together people of talent for this small focused movie and as an independent movie with an independent feel it rises above its smallness. I have a feeling it will survive over the years and continue to be interesting for its honesty.".

He recreates the ENTIRE environment groups of people that graduated highschool together and never left the gossip the one and only social hangout all the intrigue and interconnected people the way they talk and interact with each other and even the music they like to listen to there are a couple Bruce Springsteen songs mixed into the soundtrack.After creating this dead on environment he tells the story. This is where a lot of people here have had problems. Burns shows the monotony of everyday life in this town. I mean he ACTUALLY shows it on camera people going to their jobs talking about mundane stuff etc. Things that other directors would have merely mentioned through dialogue or other means.This is done for a reason Burns is trying to put you in this town. As if you are one of those who has been trapped here. He makes an attempt to show you these things so that you'll understand the character's desires to leave.And if you've spent any time in one of these towns you will understand EXACTLY what he is trying to say. Sorry to say it's a sort realistic movie. The characters are imperfect they do dumb things. The awkwardly and badly tell lies to each other. They like normal people.Other than that I could have done without Bon Jovi. He showed no range of emotions if my girlfriend stayed out with another guy until 5 a.m. I would think my voice would show a little more inflection at least.Anyway if you are from this area and want to go home again rent this movie. If you aren't and want to see what it's like see this movie. If you liked any major blockbuster this year pass.".

It's very subdued and could have used some form of life injected to it.Cast is mostly excellent.

But I have one little remark maybe Ed and Jon should have switched parts because Jon has more the look to play the rebel instead of Ed. But that's just a little remark.I highly enjoy Ed Burns' movies. He is capable of making the perfect indies and I think he definitely have to continue making these kind of movies.

Claudia who is now involved with Michael still hasn't been able to forget the man who must have been the love of her life.The surprise in the film is Jon Bon Jovi in a dramatic role. He plays the kind Michael who as much as he tries can't compete against Charlie for the love of Claudia. Mr. Burns directing himself should have given the job to another actor because he doesn't appear to be objective in how to play his character. Lauren Holly tries but her Claudia is at times irritating. Blythe Danner also appears as Claudia's mother.The best thing going for No Looking Back is the great soundtrack heard throughout the movie.".

I do not know if this was a great movie or just so much a step up from all the junk being made today. bottom line burns tells a great story and does a great job acting as well. burns plays a regular joe and gets away with it perfectly which is rare for your basic overly good looking Hollywood actor. The song choice and cinematography was great and all the actors seemed realistic in their roles. BonJovi looked like he could use an acting class or 2 but if hes gona act that's the kinda role he should play. i hope ed burns and anyone else continue to make these movies where no one is blowing up buildings or killing aliens. Movies today are a joke it is all rich people getting stupid people to come see their movies to make box office . keep it up ed burns.".

	schema:reviewBody "As a movie enthusiast for several decades I've seen thousands of movies. I thought this was one of the very very best. It's the first time I've given an IMDb rating of 10. The writing was great and the 3 principals gave very strong performances. In fact I started to search to see if Lauren Holly was at least given a 1998 Best Actress nomination. However I stumbled across the movie's having been pulled from distribution before 250000 had seen it. So the selection committee would have never have even considered it. What a shame  I was stunned! I went here to IMDb to see what was the disconnect between my experience and most everyone else's. I saw that 1378 reviewers gave an average 5.7 out of 10 rating. The last time I really liked a movie the average was 8.5. I looked at the written reviews and saw a lot of people who really liked it. One suggested that if one was looking for a blockbuster or escapist fare one wouldn't like it. Maybe the writing was too good too true to life? However several Burns' slice of life films had been blockbuster hits so that couldn't be the whole story. Maybe people got so into the film that out of the 3 plausible endings 2 out of 3 were deeply disappointed by the 1 selected. However I contend the 95 of the movie that went before the ending had the value of showing people struggling with difficult emotional decisions that were somewhat beyond their control as they were intertwined with other humans struggling with their own difficult emotional decisions  so the audience could just select whatever virtual ending one wanted and be moved by the heart of the movie. There's no objective right choice just choose what's right for you and realize there's no guarantees in life. So my first few sentences notwithstanding don't go in with high expectations  the statistics seem to be against it. If you only see a few films then go with the super popular films. However if you've seen them all and are casting about for something above mediocrity and you like slice of life it's worth the gamble. I read the negatives and disagreed and they gave no insight into objective flaws  they just describe why they personally didn't like seeing that particular slice of life etc. It's a GREAT film but you might just not like it.".

It has a real feel for the ordinary lives of lower middleclass people the kind for whom losing a 20 bet in a poker game at the wrong time of the week is a disaster and it tells an interesting story. Burns plays a ne'erdowell type who blows back into his old hometown looking for the girl he left behind three years before. Only he finds that she Lauren Holly is now engaged to another old friend played by Jon Bon Jovi. At first Lauren is ready to tell this bum to hit the road but he eventually begins to win her back not simply because of his rascally charm but because he forces her to think about her limited future here in town if she does marry her boyfriend.Lauren Holly is so good here and such a joy to watch. All of her inner emotions and the turmoil she feels is there in her eyes for everyone to see each time the camera looks her way. Burns is also good in his role. He character in this film reminds me of someone Mickey Roarke would play and I think he resembles that actor a bit too. Bon Jovi was a real surprise to me and the rest of the main supporting cast do fine jobs as well. If you like reallife or sliceoflife dramas or whatever you want to call them 'No Looking Back' may suit you just fine.".

Edward Burns stars in this movie but he also wrote and directed the movie too. He plays his part well as does Lauren Holly. Jon Bon Jovi is not much of an actor but I do believe this is his best acting effort to date. I would recommend that he continues to take acting lessons in order to get better.You can't help but like Edward Burns' character Charlie as well as Lauren Holly's character Claudia. Blythe Danner does a great job of portraying Claudia's mother too and is that sad pathetic lonely woman who refuses to believe her husband that left her will never come back. Charlie is the dreamer that had the courage to leave town before and deserted Claudia in the process but failed and has come back again to try to get Claudia to come with him. With her he believes he can succeed and realizes he made a mistake leaving her.Unfortunately Claudia is together with Charlie's old friend Michael Bon Jovi and Claudia doesn't want to be with Charlie after he hurt her by leaving. However Caludia wants to get out of this town and Michael doesn't want to ever leave so they both know their relationship is not going to last.

Now I love Cary Grant but in the original Topper he is conspicuous by his absence from much of the action and it is a distraction after all he was supposed to be the star. Here however we get to focus exclusively on the wonderful Roland Young and the dropdead gorgeous Constance Bennett.Young is quite frankly great as the bumbling and often mumbling Cosmo Topper. He is so good at pretending to be pulled pushed and twisted around by the invisible Mrs. Kirby that you really completely believe unseen forces are constantly roughing him up. And he so thoroughly throws himself into dancing by himself kicking his feet around in a jig and kicking at invisible dogs that it is a real joy.Have I mentioned that Constance Bennett is gorgeous? How many marriages on the set must have been broken up by her walking around in a bathing suit for a good portion of the film? Billie Burke was also much more interesting here than in the original. The writers surely delighted in giving her so many inane and nonsensical lines which she in her wellmeaning but confusing daffiness plays to perfection.Finally Franklin Panghorn has a lovely and meaty role as a manager of a French hotel but his French accent has to be one of the worst ever. Luckily the film is filled with upset screaming Frenchmen all always yelling at the same time.I don't think everyone will agree with me but I found Topper Takes a Trip to be at least as enjoyable as the original except for the long introduction with its extensive borrowing from the original. Highly recommended.".

Topper Takes a Trip does have some major flaws however. The film opens with Young in a courtroom going through divorce proceedings from his even more befuddled wife Billie Burke. Topper explains to the courtroom how he was befriended by the ghosts of Constance Bennet and Cary Grantwho could not join his former castmates because he was now too big a star but magnanimously agreed to allow them to use footage from the original  Swell Guy!. This whole beginning seems very forced as it tries to make sure that all is explained in case you missed the first film. Once they get out of the courtroom Topper and one ghost and her ghostly dog go on a drinking binge and discover that Mrs. Topper's best friend has taken her to Paris to try and get her hooked up with a Baron there. Topper and companions follow and the laughs go from a trickle to an avalanche at times as Young does all kinds of crazy things with the aid of his spectral friend. The hotel is headed by Franklin Pangborn whose performance really is a comic treat. Pangborn made me laugh so hard with that sardonic look and witticisms. Butler Alan Mowbray follows and adds a fine turn as the Topper's butler. The rest of the cast is also suitably funny. It is important to remember just how influential these films were in this little subgenre and that the special effects used were stateoftheart at the timeOscar nominated in this case. Many scenes stand out for me as truly masterful bits of comedic timing Young dancing with a ghost on the dance floor Alexander D'Arcythe Baron being bulldozed by a huge beach ball while shortless in the sand and Young being cramped in his small room standing out particularly.".

Roland Young and Billie Burke are pure comedy gold together. No one else could do vague bemused bewildered bedevilled as well as these two. Pair them together and you have a recipe for instant success. Constance Bennett was a gorgeous blonde in an era famous for gorgeous blondes. Unlike many of the others she had talent and was a delight in a comedy. I had seen the series as a child but I didn't appreciate them until I was an adult. Roland Young's physical comedy was a definite asset to the series but his female costars and their delivery was a sheer delight. I also enjoyed Alan Mowbray who was the suave villain in a few of the Sherlock Holmes films as the sympathique butler in this little gem of a movie. He was extraordinarily talented but was woefully typecast as the heavy in many period pieces. I liked this kinder gentler side of the actor and hope to find something similar from him again. There are no missteps in this one. If you like a nice unsophisticated bit of fluff and froth you will love this movie. The only thing comparable to me for entertainment value was The Women which came out the same year. Both of the films had me laughing out loud many times and are films that I watch again and again. Spend some time with Topper and you won't be sorry but you will be holding your sides from laughter and you will appreciate the brilliant comedic timing behind the zingers and barbs that fly in this film.".

He's shown in the beginning as the film goes over how George and Marion got to be ghosts in the first place. Alas Grant's ghostly presence hangs over the entire film and puts a big hole in this movie.Constance Bennett is her usual gorgeous self as Marion. She is compelled to come back without George and soon realizes that she's there to help Cosmo once again  though the Kerby's idea of helping Topper leaves much to be desired. This time though she discovers a dog Atlas in spirit also and brings him along. Mrs. Topper Billie Burke learning that Cosmo was with a woman in a hotel has sued for divorce. At the trial Cosmo claims the woman was the late Marion and begs to tell his story.The judge understandably gets too confused and throws the case out. Mrs. T sails for France and Cosmo Marion and Atlas follow. One of the best scenes takes place in a casino where Cosmo just can't help winning thanks the ball landing on one number and then mysteriously jumping to another thanks to guess who.Very cute with another fine performance by Roland Young as Cosmo. The special effects are still marvelous".

The issue one has with the series is not its continual use of thinly stretched gags playing on the idea that only Topper can communicate with the dead but rather its obvious use of camera editing to create magical special effects. For example ghostly Constance Bennett drinks a martini that seems to disappear one gulp at a time obviously accomplished by stopping the film emptying some of the alcohol then resuming camera action. Most viewers probably see such an effect as fake and contrived. Despite the basic technology the film does retain appeal thanks in large part to the winning performances of its actors.

I would say in the context of the films Mr. Atlas made a more interesting ghost than Cary. Also the present film clearly is funnier than the original. Who said sequels never live up to the original? Not only Mr. Atlas but Constance Bennett as Marion Roland Young as Cosmo Topper and Billie Burke as Mrs. Topper. are all more animated and funnier than they were in Topper. Like the other films in this series it was shot in BW but a colorized version was later made of each. The copy at You Tube is colorized. The screen play is about Mrs. Topper seeking a divorce from Cosmo. But her friend Mrs. Parkhurst seems much more enthusiastic in pushing for the divorce than is Mrs. Topper. Whereas Mrs. Parkhurst painted Cosmo as an evil man his wife provided a much more positive assessment of Cosmo. Throughout the film I wondered about Mrs. Parkhurst's motive for promoting the divorce. Is she being paid by Mrs. Topper? Is she a golddigger hoping to wed Cosmo? This latter possibility would seem remote given the animosity toward Cosmos in the court room. Near the end she seemed to be getting friendly with the 'baron' she had picked out for Mrs. Topper to wed after the divorce whom Mrs. Topper ultimately rejected. The basic plot is rather similar to that for Topper. Marion wants to do a good deed so that she can return to heaven with her husband.Perhaps she did something naughty to be thrown out of heaven?. Namely she wants to patch up the animosity between Cosmo and Mrs. Topper which she feels partly responsible forsee Topper. She thought she had accomplished that at the end of Topper but apparently it didn't last. Since Mrs. Topper's attempt to obtain a divorce locally failed Mrs. Parkhurst arranged for them to travel to the French Riviera to try there. But Cosmo Marion and Mr. Atlas follow them to the same hotelNice detective work!. Mrs. Parkhurst finds a suitable gold digger as a possible replacement for Cosmo. Nothing is said about a divorce hearing there.

She did as much as George did but probably because Constance Bennett was available and willing and Grant went onto other projects producer Hal Roach decided to suspend disbelief and bring her back now with Asta from the Thin Man movies and Grant's two screwball comedy classics The Awful Truth and Bringing Up Baby as her companion. Prodded by her best friend Verree Teasdale at her absolute snootiest Burke is once again separated from Young and is off for a European trip where Teasdale has pushed her together with obvious gigolo Alexander D'Arcy. Young must once again rely on the ghostly help of Bennett to win his wife back and this leads to more magical hijinks which if not as classically funny as the first are often amusing and clever.There's truly a sense here that a sequel concerning Marian Kirby was not necessary and fortunately in the third and final Topper film a new ghost popped in with one contained plot line that wrapped up neatly. Bennett is still gorgeous to look at and there is one very clever sequence with invisible Bennett and the very visible Young having drinks and befuddled bartender Paul Hurst's hysterical reactions to the whole goings on. Alan Mowbray is back as the droll butler and Franklin Pangborn adds his usual picklepussed humor into his role as the manager of the hotel where Burke is staying and where Young ends up in a basement room that ain't so peaceful. Grant's scenes from the first film really serve no purpose other than to add him into the credits with a special thank you that also adds to the feeling that this really didn't serve any purpose other than to play on the success of the original. Other than that the whole premise really does turn out to be an afterthought that is truly pleasant but mostly unnecessary.".

Bennett is still gorgeous to look at and there is one very clever sequence with invisible Bennett and the very visible Young having drinks and befuddled bartender Paul Hurst's hysterical reactions to the whole goings on. Alan Mowbray is back as the droll butler and Franklin Pangborn adds his usual picklepussed humor into his role as the manager of the hotel where Burke is staying and where Young ends up in a basement room that ain't so peaceful. Grant's scenes from the first film really serve no purpose other than to add him into the credits with a special thank you that also adds to the feeling that this really didn't serve any purpose other than to play on the success of the original. Other than that the whole premise really does turn out to be an afterthought that is truly pleasant but mostly unnecessary.";

I really like Billie Burke. In fact it is Billie Burke's presence that makes the film.I always find the Topper films delightful but I am a baby boomer. This movie will never be memorable and is quite easily forgotten within ten minutes after the movie is over. Yet when comedy is combined with a little bit of romance one can always find enjoyment. Thank goodness the movie is less than an hour and a half. I think the shorter time helps keep the movie from dragging too much. Grab your popcorn. Four thumbs up.".

I wonder if that was his voice in the English dubbing? Cetainly if any film needs a good restoration this one really needs it. I think it would be a lot more enjoyable if it were.Welles does a great service to this film and I don't think there ever was a film that didn't benefit from his presence even The Muppett Movie featured Welles! Aside from the grandeur that is Orsonis some good storytelling but some of the unfortunate liberties movie makers seem to take with biblical stories.First there's David himselfwith the curly locks and and looking like a muscle bound cross between Michael Landon or Kurt Russell. Acoording to IMDb the actor who plays him passed away August 17th2006 oddly enough. David also has a first love who apparentlyaccording to a wise old manwas taken from him by a flash of lightning in a rainstorm for God's higher purpose. Of course she had dreamed the other night that she was taken far from their landquite a coincidence.As we knowDavid has been chosen by God to one day replace Saul as the King Of Isreal and tired and worn out looking Saul's not about to take it. David arrives in Isreal sees sin after sin taking place in the streets one female dancer looks like she stepped off a burlesque stage and amazingly gets the entire mass in the streets to quiet down.Just long enough for him to give a speech about their sins and basically that it's an abomination before God and how it's Saul's lack of leadership that's led to it. You'd think a young man who'd just arrived in a city and starts shooting his mouth off would get stones thrown at him butno they all cheer for him. One of Saul's guards approaches David and David gives him one heck a blow to the head with his fist! leading to David being given Sanctuary by the church.Meanwhileanother king is threatening to overtake Saul and have both his country and Isreal. The English voice for this king sounds like a guy from the tough side of Chicago!His lackey offers to draft the giant monster of a man Goliath I'm guessing 10ft. tall or moreto help defeat Saul and his armies. The lackey sounds like Ernest T. Bass from The Andy Griffith Show. In one funny scene Goliath picks him up off the ground in an obvious clay figure moment.Anyhow David is finally brought before Saul and as would happenhe takes a liking to Saul daughter and becomes Saul's ally although Saul doesn't know it yet. Then we get to the battles between the two kingdoms and what we tuned in for to begin with. To see David take out Goliath with his slingshot. A stretchy piece of material with a cradle for the rock. A good deal of this movie mirrors The Ten Commandmants but certainly isn't on that grand level. Mostly just in plot point and lookLeader trying to stop God's chosen one  sins of the people of Isreal  big sets and of course the perfect looking heroes. ..and it's only 90 minutes.Overall thoughdespite it's weaker points english dubbing is always unintentionally funnyit's a pretty good movie. I'd recommend it for younger viewers and maybe people who like biblical epics or Orson Welles devotees. 6 stars for convincing enough setsa great battle sequence and the casting of Welles and whoever chose Goliath where'd they find that guy?. Along with a well told storythen again the Bible has plenty of them to tell. END".

	schema:reviewBody "Spaghetti biblical study elevated somewhat in status by the appearance of Orson Welles playing King Saul. Ivo Payer is David the man who would be king of the Israelites but who must first defeat Asrod King of the Philistines Meniconi who's managed to lure the hermit behemoth Goliath Kronos as his secret weapon. Beginning with David's journey to Jerusalem where he quickly establishes himself as a shepherd or radical depending on your lean freeing the slaves and showing compassion for the wicked he is taken in by the Prophets and groomed as the next King. His inevitable battle to the death with Goliath is a disappointingly brief action sequence with Goliath shown in the distance to distort the height difference which is obviously far less than desirable. The bloody battle that follows is everything a sword and sandal movie promises to be again albeit too brief.Welles is essentially a peripheral character although unsurprisingly his performance towers above those around him Massimo Serato as ally turned conspirator Abner does a reasonable job and although not as buff as a Steve Reeves or Brad Harris Ivo Payer isn't as wooden as one might expect of films of this ilk. Meniconi too isn't bad as the evil Asrod although why he would bet the house on a 6 foot maybe 5 inch Neanderthal who can military press an ancient stone tablet beggars belief. But then it did happen according to the Old Testament. Goliath was probably much bigger than depicted here  cinematography tricks fail to enlarge Kronos to the necessary proportions.Colourful sets appropriate score and functional dialogue dubbed permits some standard of entertainment and unlike most biblical epics David  Goliath is compact at about an hour and a half. If you're home alone over Easter or Christmas don't have high expectations and could cop a lowkey sermon scantily clad dancing girls an unexpected bonus David  Goliath might keep you mildly entertained.".

Ivo Payer is David the man who would be king of the Israelites but who must first defeat Asrod King of the Philistines Meniconi who's managed to lure the hermit behemoth Goliath Kronos as his secret weapon. Beginning with David's journey to Jerusalem where he quickly establishes himself as a shepherd or radical depending on your lean freeing the slaves and showing compassion for the wicked he is taken in by the Prophets and groomed as the next King. His inevitable battle to the death with Goliath is a disappointingly brief action sequence with Goliath shown in the distance to distort the height difference which is obviously far less than desirable. The bloody battle that follows is everything a sword and sandal movie promises to be again albeit too brief.Welles is essentially a peripheral character although unsurprisingly his performance towers above those around him Massimo Serato as ally turned conspirator Abner does a reasonable job and although not as buff as a Steve Reeves or Brad Harris Ivo Payer isn't as wooden as one might expect of films of this ilk. Meniconi too isn't bad as the evil Asrod although why he would bet the house on a 6 foot maybe 5 inch Neanderthal who can military press an ancient stone tablet beggars belief. But then it did happen according to the Old Testament. Goliath was probably much bigger than depicted here  cinematography tricks fail to enlarge Kronos to the necessary proportions.Colourful sets appropriate score and functional dialogue dubbed permits some standard of entertainment and unlike most biblical epics David  Goliath is compact at about an hour and a half. If you're home alone over Easter or Christmas don't have high expectations and could cop a lowkey sermon scantily clad dancing girls an unexpected bonus David  Goliath might keep you mildly entertained.";

	schema:reviewBody "This Italian made sand and sandal epic would probably be long forgotten were it not for the presence of Orson Welles as King Saul. Certainly the man who played David in David and Goliath Ivo Payer certainly did not enter the ranks of screen immortals.David and Goliath took as many liberties with scripture as any good Cecil B. DeMille film but without DeMille's sense of grandeur and spectacle. For instance in this film as a result of the battle where David defeats Goliath and the Philistines are routed the Ark of the Covenant which the Philistines had captured is returned. Actually those are separate incidents that are not connected at all.Another thing is that at least I've always interpreted David to be a rather callow youth when he was doing his shepherd thing before God sent Samuel looking for him. And he's still a callow youth when he's in battle with Goliath. The old Negro spiritual is called Little David Play On Your Harp not without reason.Ivo Payer is a rather muscular young man looking like he stepped from of those Italian muscle man epics so popular at the time. Of course the sight of all that bare chested beefcake sent many hearts fluttering in the audience. In that sense David and Goliath is right in the DeMille tradition.The only reason this film is remembered if at all today is because of Orson Welles. Welles at the time was picking up work here and there to finance his own projects. Sometimes it would be something as good as Compulsion the year before more often it was something like David and Goliath.Still Welles is a consummate professional and he invests Saul with an air of tragedy about him. At the point we meet Saul God has already decided he's not the man for the job as King of Israel. But Saul is not about to accept that verdict. If he can't beat David head on he'll try and coop David by bringing him into his household and matching him up with his daughter.And of course there's Saul's son Jonathan. He's there but none of the business about a gay relationship between David and Jonathan is in this film. Jonathan knows full well that his father has lost favor with the Lord and he's aware of his father's character weaknesses. He too befriends David more out of a sense of survival than anything else.English actor Hilton Edwards plays Samuel the Prophet and he comes across as a poor man's version of Finlay Currie. He's the only other English speaking player in the cast besides Orson Welles.David and Goliath will not pass muster with either biblical scholars or with lovers of big screen spectacle. Still fans of Orson Welles will want to see this film to see how much a great talent can lift even a piece of mediocrity to a level of some respectability.".

That also means The Semites and that is a lot more than just the Jews against those from the North those who speak the IndoIranian languages of Mesopotamia of Babylon of Persia. All that is missed and a lot more. The harp is also present but not used to its tremendous meaning. The oldest harp we know in this region is Sumerian and not Israeli or whatever. Israeli music is derived from that Sumerian music of some fifteen centuries before and it is David who is going to establish the music school of the Temple of the Levites and also the singing school that will produce the prosody and the psalmody of the Ancient Testament two musical forms that are both the results of older traditions and the root of twenty centuries to come.

The actor playing Goliath simply laughs and sneers evilly in every scene he is in and it is very uncomfortable to watch Philistene maidens dancing around him in an erotic way. The actor playing David seems about a decade too old for his role and the other characters are simply too one dimensional to believe. The scene of David arriving in Jeruselem to find it overrun with corruption is interesting although a bit far fetched with the encounters he makes and the battle scenes are gratuitously bloody. It really looks like any other Italian swordandsandals trashy flick made throughout the 60's. The bible deserves better. For more interesting looks at the life of the future King David check out David and Bathsheba Gregory Peck 1952 or even King David Richard Gere 1985.

	schema:reviewBody "When George Miller's sequel to the popular and prestigious family film Babe hit cinemas in late 1998 it was squeezed into a crowded family film market having to share the spotlight with Pixar's second film A Bug's Life and the surprising popular cinematic debut of Nickelodeon's Rugrats. As a result very few people actually saw Babe Pig in the City while it played in theatres. In proportion to the film's budget so few that it lead to the dismissal of several highranking executives at Universal. While it is true that the public cannot truthfully dislike a film it has not seen I think it's fair to say that the film got an at best mixed response among those of the public that did see it both on it's original theatrical release and subsequently on video and TV with many viewers alienated by it and few finding it as endearing as the original. Yet there have been many vocal and noteworthy fans of the film ever since its release. The much missed Gene Siskel placed Babe Pig in the City at the very top of what would tragically turn out to be his last annual Top 10 list. His on screen partner Roger Ebert also found room for it on his Top 10. While not many professional critics quite shared their level of enthusiasm although the film received generally decent reviews the film nonetheless developed a kind of cult following who did among their number being acclaimed musician Tom Waits and popular internet personality the Nostalgia Critic.I saw Babe Pig in the City upon its UK television premier when I was 13 not really in my opinion still a child yet not at an age where I feel I had fully developed critical facilities that might appreciate the nuances and qualities the film's strongest advocates see in it. At the time I thought it was pretty much a fiasco. Would I keep that opinion or join the film's list of fans after revisiting it as an adult?Well I'm sorry to say I side with the public over the critics on this one and still found it to be pretty much a fiasco. I can't even really see what the film's fans see in it. Ultimately it's a pretty dull slog of a film with not enough of interest to justify even its slender running time. Granted there is some good stuff in here. The cinematography camerawork and production design are often sumptuous and far above anything you would normally see in a live action kid's movie. The early scenes set on the same farm the first film took place in do have the kind of mythical fairy tale quality Miller clearly intended the whole film to have but which didn't come across in later parts of the film. And towards the end there is a imaginatively staged and pleasingly oldfashioned slapstick romp involving a clown suit a lot of bouncing a wellstacked pyramid of wine glasses and a frustrated waiter. And... that's about it. Which is not to say I cannot appreciate the level of ambition Miller brought to the movie. I think it's ultimately failed ambition but I can certainly appreciate the effort. Pig in the City is certainly one of the more unusual big budget sequels out there and about as far away from a carbon copy of the original you can get although perhaps the mice and that'll do pig could have been left out this time. But sometimes you find failed ambition entertaining and interesting to watch in it's own right and sometimes you merely appreciate it. Unfortunately for me Babe Pig in the City falls into the later category.I also find Pig in the City to be short on the charm that its fans must see in it. After the early scenes we are treated to nearfatal injuries a thankfully offscreen cavity check an group of terminal ill children starvation and a dog facing something which comes disturbingly close to waterboarding. That's could all be fine in the right context but this time out Babe doesn't have an interesting enough adventure or a strong enough narrative to get us through it we just slog from one depressing incident to the next. Do I think kids will be adversely affected by this stuff? Not for a minute but I don't think they'll be particularly entertained either. I know I wasn't. Also I hate to say this as I know they can't talk back and are maybe even dead now and certainly didn't ask for this kind of exposure but a lot of the animals in this movie are awfully hard on the eyes. Am I alone in really not liking looking at monkeys wearing Tshirts dresses and lipstick? About the only likable animals who have considerable screen time are Ferdinand the Duck and Babe himself adorably voiced by singer Elizabeth Daily ironically perhaps best known for voicing Tommy Pickles from the Rugrats both of whom can be enjoyed in the vastly superior first film.Babe Pig in the City is well intentioned and in some areas well executed but if you want to be charmed or entertained you're probably better off watching Peppa Pig!".

AMAZING stuff.Where's the fun? Whats the morals? Be nice.....and you will survive the scary dog chase the lack of food the theiving and scheming monkey's the pignapping clowns the evil pound that takes monkey mug shots pigkilling chef's. No sorry I forgot. There are some nice people. Creepy pigmen who would give me nightmares if I was 6.Not to mention if you don't like monkey's avoid this at all costs. Most of the movie seems to be an excuse to dress up chimpanzees in dresses which is undoubtedly creepy.And how were all these problems resolved? What was Babe's solution to the absolute mess he created? Was it me or DIDN'T he fix things up? Instead the weird lady who looks like a pencil started a nightclub. And everyone lived happily ever after. Farmer Hoggit even congratulated Babe at the end........because the tap worked. And I guess maybe for bringing 50 stray animals into his home aswell. He sells the puppies in the first movie but keeps a monkey and a poodle in the sequel  logic?And for those of you who support the dark tone? A scary dog chase IS STILL a scary dog chase despite the morals in the movie. A farmer falling down the well IS ALWAYS violent and disturbing for a child despite what some people may think. Animals cruelly being captured and abused IS NEVER a nice thing to watch even if Babe saves them in the end. The closest thing to cuteness was the animals walking through a childrens hospital which still brings a tone of dying children.In short Babe earns the respect of a monkey kills a clown saves a baby monkey and introduces communism. It's the sort of movie that critics enjoy reviewing describing it as a gem while they don't realise that it isn't actually entertaining to watch. Bland pointless and disturbing. At least they achieved what they were aiming for  a different movie to the original.".

Why have so many people rejected it? Why was it on so many critics' ten best lists and the public shunned it so much? It is really rather simple. There is no place for a THOUGHTPROVOKING family film in this day and age with the exception of perhaps The Prince of Egypt.The thing that makes me laugh here is teenagers and adults alike are commenting on how violent Babe 2 is yet if I remember correctly few or no animals at all die in the film. And no big deal seems to be made when the same stuff happens to human beings in family films.To be honest I don't think they should have rated it G simply because it seems that anyone seeing this under the age of nine would be confused and perplexed by it. Most people over that age however should be able to follow it well and understand that the things happening in it are no worse than what kids and especially teens see everyday whether it's on TV's The Simpsons my favorite show or something at the multiplex a whole ARMY of people gets drowned in The Prince of Egypt a PG rated film.In the end I am truly hoping that Babe Pig in the City is given at least some Oscar nominations especially for the art direction cinematography and visual effects all of which were superb.

The kids that watched the original Babe have grown up and so did the franchise. Sure the movie may have a few adult moments than the original for instance most kids won't understand the whole Mrs. Hoggett cavity search incident. But overall this movie presents the great moral that everyone should be good to each other over everything else even to someone who might have done something wrong to you. That is a message that everyone adults and children should hear and consider. In the end Babe achieves respect and gains a whole new group of friends from his good deeds and everyone is happy including the audience.

In fact one scene involves over 300 talking animals!  The goldfish were very convincing and the cute little cat is adorable.The filming of this movie was incredible.  No one can forget the shot of his silhouette as he looks out the stainglass window at his owner.  Or the shot of Polonious holding the goldfish in the center of the room.In no way can the first Babe movie and its sequel be compared.  The two are entirely different.  And though the story may seem childish the film has so many subplots that can teach us a lot.  The one that stands out the most to me is Polonious and his Godfatherlike role.  He strives so hard to be human and when he accepts the fact that he is a monkey he comes the closer to being human then he had ever been.

But Babe 2 was the worst sort of sequel  not only was it just disappointingly bad it actually ruined the pleasure you got from the first film.One of the greatest thing about the first film was Babe's relationship with Farmer Hoggett.  In Babe 2 the formerly dignified Farmer Hoggett is only in it for about 10 minutes but in that short time he's flung down a well and then makes goofy gestures.  He's completely robbed of his dignity.  I mean did anyone enjoy seeing Farmer Hoggett's head being slammed over and over and passing out?In fact all the humans in Babe 2 are frighteningly abused for no good reason.  Mickey Rooney a very creepy clown literally just drops dead. Mrs. Hoggett is stripsearched by drug agents is doused with a bucket of glue and then is flung around a ballroom on a bungee dressed in the dead clown's costume no less.  Was this all really necessary?  In a movie that kids watch?  It wasn't funny it was just sad.  Very sad.  Abysmally sad. Not to mention completely pointless.And in the first movie Babe the pig had a unique mission making his triumph truly sweet and heartwarming.  The storyline was singularly original.  And the first movie dealt with some reallife issues at least in the animal world which gave weight to the notions of fate and destiny which was nicely intoned throughout the movie by the narrator.In Babe 2 all the obstacles are contrived and trivial so the attendant triumph becomes hollow and pointless.  And if you think about it Babe the pig doesn't actually do anything.  He just gets chased around or just acts witless and does things that everyone tells him to do.  The first movie was about Babe's courage and originality.  In this movie he's led around like... a sheep.  how very ironic.  You never root for him because he has nothing to accomplish.I was deeply disappointed.  I had to watch the first movie over again just to cleanse my palate but I'm still in mourning.".

I also remember how the one monkey lady would always call him the pig whitey thing. There were so many animal characters but yet it worked because they were all each in some way important to the story. The duck was funny too! Give us more of the duck! It was also cool how the bulldog wanted everyone to obey Babe and it was like he was Babe's protector. What was also satisfying was how at the end they told about what happened to all of the animal characters. It makes you realize how these animals all have their own communities and such. That's why I adore movies like this and Homeward Bound The Incredible Journey.I'll never forget my favorite part the scene at the end where Mrs. Hoggat was flying in those big trousers and everyone was in a frenzy to get Babe. And they made cute references like the part where Babe was giving the jellybeans Thank the pig was probably a reference to the pope I believe. I can't believe this movie has no quotes! Please don't listen to the Leonard Maltin review. I personally think the first Babe was darker than BPITC. Anyway this is truly a wonderful film. I've only seen it once I think so rent it today! A perfect 1010.".

Gone are the simple but engaging situations replaced with wacky misadventures irritating slapstick and bombast and even meanspiritedness. There is nothing funny or endearing about any of it. It is a cynical misunderstanding of what made its predecessor so lovable. The film's climax is painfully slapsticky and broad and moreover leaves our titular hero with no agency whatsoever. Not since TEMPLE OF DOOM have I seen such a disparity between a beloved film and its followup. I will praise the accomplished photography effects and animal wrangling but the content is so phenomenally disappointing. I know this movie has its champions among them Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert. I can only say that I felt no affection for it and will henceforth pretend it doesn't exist.".

	schema:reviewBody "Everyone knows the majority of sequels are rarely more than a pale imitation of their predecessors and in 'Babe Pig In The City' we have a textbook case in point.Maybe it's not fair to compare good and bad apples regardless of how similar they look on the skin. Certainly it violates Rule 2 of The Beginner's Guide to Film Criticism which says comparison is a quick and convenient but also cheap and lazy way to judge a movie. But an exception might be considered when the followup actually tarnishes the memory of what made the first movie so distinctive.In this case the original 1995 feature was one of those alltoo rare children's films that everyone except the most jaded adult could watch without shame and as close to a genuine classic as any movie can get in our strictly disposable videodevalued 21st century entertainment culture. These days no one even bothers to camouflage the fact that motion pictures are only another cog in a corporate marketing machine packaged and sold alongside a blitzkrieg of merchandise tieins each one an advertisement for the others soundtrack albums videos and DVDs toys books clothing fast and slow food so forth and so on.The working principle behind this juggernaut of commerce is a paraphrase of P.T. Barnum there's a retail market born every minute. And in the same spirit of unashamed exploitation a small Australian pig can with careful management become a lucrative cash cow.On its surface the new film at least matches the look of the original with many names reprising their roles on both sides of the camera. James Cromwell and Magda Szubarski are back playing farmer and Mrs. Hoggett the former in a sadly diminished walkon designed to simply tie the two movies together and the same teams responsible for editing photography music and production design are for the most part reunited.But director Chris Noonan is conspicuously absent his position usurped here by producer George Miller the man behind the autoapocalypse 'Mad Max' trilogy in the 1980s. An aptitude for staging car crashes might not seem the ideal training for a children's fable about an adorable talking pig but Miller clearly sees himself as a visionary fabulist in the mold of Terry Gilliam or Vincent Ward and not without some justification.Keep in mind that the physical scale of any sequel is always grossly inflated from its parent feature. And every penny of Miller's more generous budget is visible on screen notably in the utopian cosmopolis of the film's title an amalgam of every famous civic landmark around the globe from the Eiffel Tower to the Golden Gate Bridge and beyond.But with so much money spent on the often stunning art direction there obviously wasn't enough left over to afford a decent screenplay. The result is thus a near identical film but with a gaping hole where the story and characters should have been.Miller himself wrote the new script along with two other 'coauthors' the scare quotes are a warning that two or more separate screen writing credits rarely indicate a collaborative effort. Apparently none of them had the time or inclination to study the original story very closely settling instead in classic sequel fashion for an overplotted underdeveloped action adventure too complex for its own preteen target audience and supported by necessity on the usual crutch of voiceover narration.The film opens immediately after the last scene of the earlier feature with Babe's triumphant return to the Hoggett farm after his stunning victory at the National Sheep Dog Trials. But that initial silver lining is soon overshadowed by a token cloud of foreclosure. It's the same nebulous threat facing every farm on the Hollywood back lot the rural property owner's analogue to whatever killed Ali McGraw in 'Love Story' and in this case providing little more than a thinly contrived excuse for getting Babe lost never mind how in the big city at which point the savethefarm crisis immediately sinks below the narrative radar.Lost in all the subsequent heavy spending is the innocent organic charm of the original film reimagined by Miller and company as a novelty animal act straight out of a Ringling Brothers circus tent with the title character reduced to just another sideshow attraction in a menagerie of real and robotic talent. These include in no special order of importance a pack of wild urban dogs who naturally become allies after Babe rescues their leader from drowning a family of performing monkeys assorted other wayward pets and a gratuitous cameo by Mickey Rooney in heavyduty clown drag.A cast like that doesn't really need an actual plot leaving not much else to look at besides a lot of frantic pointless and surprisingly violent action with an acrobatic mock bigtop demolition derby climax. There's a telling disclaimer buried in the end credits reassuring viewers that no actual animals were injured during the production a moot point given the sometimes alarming realism of the animatronics. Maybe an apology should have been offered instead for spreading cynicism and disillusion among impressionable younger moviegoers and their longsuffering parents.In the end it all boils down to the inevitable theme song a transparent bid for an Oscar nomination composed by the ubiquitous Randy Newman and performed by erstwhile progrocker Peter Gabriel regressing to the level of his former Genesis backup vocalist Phil Collins. You might recall the song's title 'That'll Do' as the final line of dialogue from the original film and a model of expository understatement all but extinct in an industry now geared more toward attentiongetting superlatives and sledgehammer subtlety. It's a sad thing but altogether typical of the mercantile nature of the entire film to hear such precious nuance so crassly deployed as a less than memorable soundtrack sales pitch.".

Great way to start a kids moviesee a character we like getting seriously hurt. Mrs. Hoggett Magda Szubanski has to go to the city to save the farm from being sold and takes Babe with her. That's when the movie just goes out of control.The city is a mishmash of all famous buildings from other cities around the world. Some may think that's cleverfor me it was disorienting and annoying. Babe meets other animals and here's where it gets really disturbing. At one point Babe picks up a fish in his mouth to get it back into water. The way its shot u think Babe is going to eat the fish. At another point a dog's leash gets tangled on a bridge. He falls over into the water. Because of the way the leash is tangled and he falls he can't get his head out of the water for air! We get a nice shot of the poor animal trying to get some breath. At ANOTHER point a baby monkey is clinging for dear life from a chandelier. Also the human characters aren't treated much better. Mrs. Hoggett is ordered to be strip searched early on! I caught this at a matine in 1998. I have never forgotten some kids crying because of what they were seeing and outraged parents storming out of the theatre and complaining LOUDLY that this film was not a kids film. The original had dark moments too but nothing like what we see here. This movie seems to enjoy putting humans and animals in danger and shoving it in the audiences faces. THIS has a G rating?

	schema:reviewBody "Babe Pig In The City is captivating a triumph. It's right up there with other subversive surreal masterpieces like Delicatessen and The Cook The Thief His Wife And Her Lover but in spite of what you might have heard Babe 2 isn't too dark for children or for any older human. It's full of many wonderfully melancholy moments but it's not nasty. Above all Babe Pig In The City is a triumph for gentleness and a plea on behalf of the marginalised the weak in our community. It's one of the best films yet made and an ideal film for children to see.What did Hollywood expect? Writerdirector of Babe Pig In The City Australian George Miller couldn't be expected to roll over and produce a sweet read merchandisable sequel to the original Babe. He's far too human and thoughtful for that.George Miller for heaven's sake has been intimately involved with The Mad Max Films Lorenzo's Oil Flirting Dead Calm Bangkok Hilton TV The Year My Voice Broke and The Dismissal TV a list that has no hint within it of a thoughtless panderer to the consumer society. The Witches Of Eastwick was the only aberration and Miller reportedly hated that experience swearing to never work with Hollywood again not on their terms anyway.But then there was the phenomenon of Babe which made a fortune. Miller consented to do a sequel but demanded final cut and dismayed the toy makers when they found that Babe 2 didn't fit in with the money machine. So Babe Pig In The City was dumped with bad reviews generated probably from people who haven't even bothered to see it.Babe Pig In The City sees James Cromwell as Farmer Hoggett dumped down a well early in the film and the famous sheeppig heading off to the city with Mrs Hoggett Magda Szubanski to earn some money to save the farm. The Pig gets separated from Mrs Hoggett and becomes aligned with a set of urban frightened animals who are threatened with being evicted from their homes. Babe saves the day by means of his sweet giving nature.This film looks wonderful. The same digitalised mouth movements to match speech are used as in the original movie. Similarly amazing animal training has the stars doing wonderful things as they tell the story and the sets are simply superb. The city is a composite of Sydney New York  Paris London and others with the copperplate ETERNITY graffiti well known by older Sydneysiders sitting gently above it all an appropriately sensitive emblem for the world Miller has created.Babe 2 is about innocence about children. Some would say that the film is concerned with Animal Rights but I don't think it's drawing too long a bow to say that the film is commenting on the loss of power and self determination many millions are feeling in the western world as their jobs are disappearing. The lost threatened animals in Babe have an aura of hopelessness or at least helplessness before the bright and brave Babe shows them the way to assert themselves.Babe Pig In The City is also often very funny very human even if animals are the stars. It's an absolute must see for all animal lovers of any age. And if you think it's too dark well grow up. That's life.".

Despite a predictable plot and an ending anyone can spot a mile away the overall ensemble acting and dialogue are surprisingly fresh and sometimes poignant. The conversion of Tom from a conniving con who thought of every angle to profit himself to a dogooder is gradual and quite convincing avoiding a common pitfall of many feelgood movies. Jaded cynics may sneer at the religious tone but it is actually not about any religion but about the uplifting experience one can gain by helping each other. The cast of Kinnear Metcalf Pitillo mixed with old pros like Conway Elizondo and Browne really deliver. Conway is especially enjoyable a scene stealer up to his old tricks and Metcalf is deliriously wacky. A special mention goes to the director Gary Marshall using subtle yet funny touch to parody the American media and court system.   Overall this movie is very delightful for everyone who is not a total cynic. Rating 810.".

So a job it is for him. Tom has his eye on a pretty lady named Gloria anyway so it might help his image with her too. Strings are pulled to get him into the postal service's dead letter office. Once there surrounded by kind and interesting people he begins to turn his life around. He even reads some of the letters addressed to God and performs random acts of kindness. What could be wrong with that? This movie leaves the viewer with feelings of great joy. Kinnear is a charmer in every way and with cast members such as Maria Pitillo Tim Conway Roscoe Lee Browne and Hector Elizondo he is in great company. The script has a buoyant message to give about helping others only to receive kindness back in return. How nice the settings and costumes are too. A love story develops quietly for any viewer who longs for comedies with romance. This film is recommended for individuals or families who need their faith restored in humanity but who also enjoy laughter and nonsense along the way.".

	schema:reviewBody "Dear God is the rare example of a movie that starts abysmally but slowly gains its stride. Most films these days are the opposite. They grab you right off then run out of steam. To be fair Dear God never fully grabs you or has much steam. But it gets to the point where it becomes worth watching eliciting several pleased chuckles while still falling far short of outandout funny.Greg Kinnear plays a twobit hustler whose honest face and convincing stories allow him to con working joes out of their money. He has a gambling debt to repay to Junior an overweight thug who teaches him a lesson or two about horses and stables at a disastrous visit to the track. Kinnear's Tom Turner is arrested while trying to scam two undercover cops disguised as foreign sightseers and in a ridiculous plot convenience is sentenced to find a paying job for one year. Most criminals should be so lucky. But of course Turner has that honest face.Anyway he ends up at the post office where he's assigned to a dead letter office filled with whacko postal castoffs played with sufficient nuttiness by Laurie Metcalf Jon Seda and Tim Conway among others. Conway's character once memorized the entire layout of the city of L.A. but was demoted when he lost it and bit a dog. Metcalf plays a former lawyer who needed a less stressful job. You get the idea.Through a series of accidents this motley crew begins answering letters to God and through their limited means they begin making minor miracles happen throughout L.A. The press picks up on it which draws the attention of the U.S. Postmaster General played with his usual rabid energy by the director Garry Marshall and brings heat on the dogooder crew whose activities are technically illegal. Opening the mail is a federal offense. Meanwhile Kinnear's Turner remains on the run from the gangsters and tries to woo a single mother played by the adorable Maria Pitillo whose character has no function in this film other than as a weak romantic interest.Extraordinarily lamebrained from the getgo Dear God actually gets on course as the relative uniqueness of its storyline manifests itself in some sweet quiet moments and as the ensemble group of veteran actors really begins to relish their roles. Metcalf is always funny although she's a little over the top here and Kinnear is notable for his ability to play a likeable everyman. Conway has a veryfunny apology scene with a dog and is otherwise likeable in his eccentricity.The movie ultimately only reaches the level of soso  but I guess the fact that I felt compelled to write about it means that it made some impact on me and that I can marginally recommend it. 5 out 10.".

He gets a job in the dead letter office at the post office where undeliverable letters are sorted by category.  When trying to steal valuables to help pay off his gambling debts he accidentally puts them in a envelope in reply to a Dear God letter.  When the money helps some people to fix problems with their block of flats and improve security his colleagues think he did it on purpose and begin to answer some other Dear God letters.  However how far can they go without being discovered as the media begin to pick up on the miracles.This is a very gentle comedy that struggles with being overly sentimental in the second half.  The story is quite unlikely but the film is gentle enough that the slight plot is not really a major problem.  Nor is it very unlikely  you won't be surprised to learn that every learns important lessons about life at the end.  The comedy is also very slight it has some laugh out loud moments but outside of this it also has an overall funny feel to the film that is quite nice.Greg Kinnear is not a leading man but he does a reasonably good job here. Out of his colleagues Metcalf is good and John Seda of HomicideLOTS gives a different performance!  The cast is also fleshed out by some nice cameos from Larry Miller and Jack Klugman better known as Quincy.  Elizondo has the best small role as the Post Officer manager who slips quietly away midconversation unnoticed.Overall a gentle comedy that eventually gets bogged down by being too sentimental.  It really could have benefited from having a more cynical edge.".

Greg Kinnear plays a likeable con man who is sentenced to find and keep real job for 1 year. He lands one with the postal service in the Dead Letter office working with a bunch of endearing misfits played by Hector Elizondo Tim Conway and Laurie Metcalf among others. Kinnears character Tom starts to secreatly answer the letters addressed to God and without realizing it he begins to care about humanity. By the time the film is over you end up rooting for Tom and just feeling...good. That in essence is really what this movie is all about. This movie is not meant to make a political religious or artistic statement its message is clear  mankind has to take of its own because God works through us and one person CAN make a difference. The soundtrack is better than average featuring an outstanding version of Dear God by Midge Ure which alone is worth renting the movie for. Cynics need not bother but everyone else sit back relax and forget your cares for awhile.".

In Dear God we learn that he answers mail too. Or at least he uses others to do so. It is a comedy about God's power through prayer with fraud Greg Kinnear arrested and given opportunity to hold a job. A job at the postal outlet is pretty routine until Laurie Metcalf and himself address these strange letters to God. They answer the letters thus rendering life more pleasant for others but Kinnear is arrested and taken to court which results in a totally contrived conclusion. Director Garry Marshall brings an ominous appeal to the mail room but isn't backed with a screenplay worthy of the subject matter. He previously made Pretty Woman another film about second chances. Kinnear is well cast and likable throughout his dilemma but he was funnier as a con man. Metcalf takes a rather standard role and provides comic relief particularly when she represents Kinnear in court. Hector Elizondo is unreadable as his boss. He seems to disappear in a half wit manner as if to suggest he is God. Maria Pitillo also appears although her role is cardboard. Could have been better yet sustains some charming moments. Theme of reaching out to others may appeal to those who experienced answered prayer. Score 6  10".

	schema:reviewBody "I could say that 'Dear God' strains hard to be Capraesqe if I ever felt that the movie was straining to do anything at all. This is the kind of movie written at the level of a fourthrate sitcom by people trying to hurry up and write something  anything because they had big plans for lunch.What disappoints me most is that it begins very well. I always love movies about small time con men who try every trick in the book to separate suckers from their money and here Greg Kinnear plays such a guy who tries everything from selling phony airline tickets to making a phony accident claims to pretending to be a burn victim wrapped in bandages. Eventually his scams land him in front of a judge who issues him community service by working the Los Angeles Post Office.This is where the movie goes flat. Kinnear ends up in the basement of the dead letter office which is populated by characters who seem to have been rescued from failed sitcoms. They are types instead of people. We meet a former lawyer Laurie Metcalf a disgrunted postal worker Tim Conway a man very close to his retirement Roscoe Lee Browne and a Russian immigrant Hector Elizondo. Nobody acts like themselves but instead spout inane oneliners which seem all the more stilted without a laughtrack.Kinnear's job is to sort out letters to Santa Claus The Tooth Fairy the Easter bunny Elvis and of course God. He begins reading the letters and we don't have to guess that next he begins answering those letters and doing good deeds for everyone.The movie is all sugary sweet as the office workers keep a man from committing suicide and give a woman the day off and help someone with their housework. The good deeds capture the attention of the media who dubs them 'The Postal Miracles' and has late breaking news reports to report the progress.I could have won side bets that the movie was going to end up with a painfully unfunny courtroom scene but I swear I could never have guessed the moment the Metcalf begins gyrating in the aisles. Thinking it over I really can't remember the last time a good comedy that climaxed in a courtroom.'Dear God' establishes a promising premise. Putting a small time con artist in the post office means that there are all kinds of comic possibilities to be had. But 'Dead God' isn't written with possibilities in mind it's written at the level of a fourth rate sitcom that would have been cancelled.".

It's just that this movie tries to tackle a subject matter far bigger than itself. And it does it well badly. Let me walk you through itTom Turner is some professional scam artist who has a gambling debt. He is conning poor innocents out of their cash until he gets busted by completely unbelievable undercover police officers more triggerhappy than Dirty Harry. He gets the completely unbelievable court order go to jail or get a 95 job for a year. He gets a job through two completely unbelievable happenings involving his cousin being the policeman dragging him out of a post office cue presumably for noticing the deadly secret of the post office that even though there are huge lines in the post office there is one register open with nobody using it which Tom just walks up to.He gets a completely unbelievable job in the 'Dead Letters Office' which is a huge messy office filled to the brim with letters with 56 fulltime workers. These work on the mail that has been adressed wrong so it can't be sent on. We're supposed to believe that there are so many sloppy letter senders? Oh never mind. Tom discovers a place with a lot of left over jewellery sent nowhere and he pockets it ALL even though he's been told he's watched. Sadly he's rumbled so he puts it ALL into a FedEx package and mails it. Not to himself oh no but to some random adress he found on a letter to God. You know for a professional conman he's pretty stupid. The only guy more stupid than him is the mail sorter that doesn't notice a fully grown man sliding down his mail chute one foot away from him. Watch the movie you'll. No on second thoughts don't.So inevetably they start reading letters from God and want to help the people themselves. Tom totally forgets his character AND his gambling debts and starts acting...you guessed it...completely unbelievable. In one particularly completely unbelievable scene they save an old man from walking into the ocean on a crowded beach. Ah yes. That's the most efficient way to kill yourself isn't it. Anyway they fish him out he's completely dry and he gripes a bit and then that bit goes absolutely nowhere. They build to this moment for 20 minutes and then it fizzles. Bah.It escalates as it would do and it ends with Tom being a bigger man and we all learned a big lesson about helping others. No wait. Sorry. It ends with a ludicrous outofplace courtroom sequence where two dogs are interviewed for no reason. It's a rollercoaster. Avoid it like the plague.The short review This movie was boring. I picked up my guitar after seeing the Sylvia Plath part and practised playing Superstitious by Stevie Wonder as badly as I could. I don't know why this movie just made me want to....".

The premise was cute and it could have been a decent film I think but the script was just too cheesy not to mention that Greg Kinnear was absolutely miscast as a heartless con. He just looks too much like a nice guy and I found it far to difficult to believe that he was cynical and cruel even if he does change later. It's a shame but this film was terrible.".

Let me just say that I could not even finish watching it it was so bad. It was the first time I have ever turned off a movie in the middle. I was extremely disappointed. The premise was cute and it could have been a decent film I think but the script was just too cheesy not to mention that Greg Kinnear was absolutely miscast as a heartless con. He just looks too much like a nice guy and I found it far to difficult to believe that he was cynical and cruel even if he does change later. It's a shame but this film was terrible.";

I am big fan of Laurie Metcalfe but this is not a shining moment for her. Ellen Cleghorn's attempt at an accent fails miserably and Greg Kinnear is not believable as a bad guy.

In order to impress her Curt swipes his dads clearance card and the two lovebirds sneak into the high security testing facilities of the military base. Curt's dad a high ranking military official is involved in some pretty sick experiments which center around the reanimating powers of the chemical known as 245 Trioxin. After witnessing a gruesome resurrection Curt and Julie flee have sex and find out that Curt's dad is being transferred. Rather than be torn asunder the two run away together. But a terrible motorcycle accident cuts their plans  and Julie's life  short. Now it's back to the base to reanimate his beloved but even though the resurrected Julie seems normal it's only a matter of time before her dead body rots and her human emotions are replaced with an insatiable hunger for living human brains.This third installment in the ROTLD series avoids the campy black comedy of the first film and the utter stupidity of the second. It falls somewhere right smack between the two and ends up being halfway decent. There's some great scenes of cutting scarification and body mutilation as Julie discovers that self inflicted pain can temporarily curb her nasty appetite. Whether or not this was an intentional comment on the habits of GenX teens to mutilate themselves to curb feelings of depression I don't know but it's quite effective and considering that this came out in 1993 rather timely as well. Julie ends up resembling a Cenobite rather than a zombie decked out in leather chains and broken glass but I'm not complaining. There's a LOT of gore most of which takes place in the military labs as zombies are fitted with harnesses lobotomized with power drills held together with metal exoskeletons and in general end up resembling an SM orgy gone horribly wrong. It's pretty nasty graphic stuff but the zombies themselves are pretty cool looking especially one who ends up looking like a freaky bipedal giraffe. The story isn't anything new but some of the acting especially that of Mindy Clarke as Julie is pretty good and the zombie effects are impressive. The ending is a downer but not as grim and disheartening as it could have been.All in all it's fairly enjoyable. It's much better than Part 2 was anyway.".

Grief stricken and severely sprung the kid takes his girl to the army base where his dad works and takes her to a secret lab and revives her. Sadly the boy doesn't know what he's unleashed and this young frankenstein has to destroy his little creation. If you're going to watch this movie please avoid the rated version. As in all of Brian Yuzna's films he likes to make his flicks over the top and very gory. The family rental companies carry the rated version so look out for the unrated label. If not then you'll be treated to a bunch of freeze frames and badly cut scenes. A sad tale about true love.Recommended.Let's hope this ends the series. If it does then it'll end on a high note.".

As usual in many low budget horror movies moronic teenagers decide to break into a top secret military facility for fun.... sigh and naturally accidentally release whatever the base is trying to contain. I was prepared at that point for the worst and settled myself in for 90 minutes of frustration. Return of the Living Dead 2 was one of the worst sequels I had ever seen so I really wasn't expecting much from Return 3. But then something happened and Return 3 got better and better. There was a real story! The director actually tried for some character development! There was suddenly plenty of extremely well done gore! There were some moments of real horror!The scenes where Julie starts cutting and impaling herself were difficult to watch that's how well done they were. The movie moves from a cheap horrorcomedy into a well put together love story with incredibly gory effects. I actually really felt for the main couple even though she was slowly turning into a zombie! Normally one of them would get whacked which would give the remaining person a few lame Arnoldtype lines and an excuse to obliterate whatever or whomever is supposed to be the bad guy. However this movie doesn't follow that formulaic path. It takes a very weird turn halfway through and never looks back. When Julie makes her transformed appearance in the sewer it is truly an aweinspiring site! They actually managed to make her look both incredibly repulsive and very sexy at the same time. This film reminded me a lot of the Ginger Snaps movies in the type of character development pursued within the confines of a horror movie. Very pleasant surprise.810".

	schema:headline " A great gory twist to romance!";
	schema:reviewBody "The third part in a series of movies usually is nowhere near the original however Brian Yuzna's take on the Return of the Living Dead makes the third installment in the famous comedyhorror series a very different and special movie. Getting away from the slapstick comedy aspect of the previous films director Yuzna  writer John Penney unfold a tale of doomed love and gory violence spiced up with very dark humor. Quite a change from part 2 in fact the only thing this movie has in common with the previous chapters is the inclusion of the reanimating gas.Penney's script is like a bizarre twist on Romeo  Juliet Curt Reynolds J. Trevor Edmond is an angsty teenager in love with rebel Julie Walker Melinda Clarke. While sneaking in the military base where Curt's father Kent McCord works they discover that the project his father has been working involves reanimating corpses. After a tragic accident where Julie dies Curt decides to bring back Julie using his father's experiments with the infamous chemical 245 Trioxin.Right after Julie is revived the action starts and never stops with the couple running away from both the army and a gang that wants them dead. To make things worse Julie's increasing urge to eat human flesh and Curt's own anxiety and family troubles collide and make the trip harder for the lovers.Brian Yuzna really created something special with this movie the characters are very rich and are the backbone of the movie. The acting is top notch something quite different from the typical bmovie. In fact the movie is so well done in those aspects that its flaws in SFx and overall production are easily forgiven.The movie has a lot of heart and the credit for that must go to Yuzna's direction and Penney's script. The couple of lovers must really grow to face the situation and to face each other's troubles. The acting is very good for the most part but is Clarke who gives the performance as Julie. The transformation from self confident daredevil to fearful victim of the circumstances and then to ruthless killing machine is very believable and one cannot avoid to feel sympathy for her character. A really remarkable job.Sadly the movie is not perfect the low budget hurts the production a lot and the sets look a bit fake However it's worth to point out that the makeup effects in the zombies and the gore are quite good for the budget.By far the best movie in the series and among the best and most creative horror movies ever done. Director Brian Yuzna has not been able yet to come up close to this achievement but he earned his place in history with this movie. 810. A modern classic.".

Brian Yuzna's Return Of The Living dead 3 is one of those miraculous exceptions. A simple story of love parenthood and zombies turns out to be one of the best horror films of all time making the genre move forward both in quality and in innovation. There are some excellent performances but the goreeffects take the lead role in another job well done by FX wizard Screaming Mad George. It's hard not to be captured by the movie's unique sense of humour allied to some ultraviolent scenes of pure horror and fantasy that combine to tell the tragic story of a young man who sees his beloved girlfriend turned into a flesheating creature that still loves him but will sooner or later have to eat him! Brian Yuzna really got it once more proving that he is one of the most promising horror directors for the future. Don't miss this one!".

He was very upset with me and told me that it was his favorite move that he had already seen 10 times. I'll have a word with his best friend's parents tomorrow for allowing this to happen.After he went to bed I had trouble sleeping and being the closet horror film fan ended up watching the movie...twice.Return of the Living Dead 3 seems to fall to the shroud of a long line of Bhorror films I remember from that period of time. Warlock Hellraisers Dead Alive and Friday the 13th part...whatever and so on.As a Living Dead movie it holds it's own by incorporating the franchise respectably. But ROTLD3 has merits that make it stand on its own. Most notably the departure from standard horror formula and taking some risks. Rather than camp it up too much the film makers attempted to bring the TrioxonBrain eating fair down to earth. Pitting star crossed lovers VS the zombies. No matter what you may think of the film you have to admire the risk.This is really a love it or hate it film I suppose. Judging by the reviews that I've read it holds true. Yuzna the director is effective with his obviously very limited budget. I was disappointed with some of the special effects considering the money this team DID have probably all went in that direction.The actors were unfamiliar to me yet interesting. J. Trevor Edmond Curt I think I remember him from Beverly Hills 90210 is a believable and charismatic lead and Julie Mindy Clark is a sultry and seductive counterpart. Kent McCord and crew were a bit week but hey it is a low budget horror film afterall.I felt particularly bad for Curt as the story progressed as he was unpredictably flawed. Normally young actors try to play this type of character cool but Edmond delivers a sensitive and frenzied performance stressing the love is blind metaphor'. I really thought this brought something extra to the movie. Clark is equally up to the task and ultimately steals the show with her transformation into a  pin cushion zombie nymph. The performances are even more impressive when you equate the weaknesses in the script. Considering the shameful dialog and the lack of sophisticated character development..I was impressed what these two unknowns pulled off.Overall it was a nice change of pace from the standard run of the mill splatter fest. A Golf clap for those responsible for making Return of the Living Dead 3 in Bhorrormovieland. ....who knew my teenage son had good taste!".

More than anything this one's best feature is the different methods of behavior attributed to the zombies' behavior in here which is quite drastic in some cases. While it does feature the traditional models as well the fact that these ones not only behave like normal people in the regard of speaking talking and interacting with people rather than being mindlessfleshcravingghouls which makes for quite a nice time here. This one still gets quite a bit of fun out of those traditional zombie works as the rampaging creatures in the sewer confrontations lends this one it's best feature as she manages to take out the gang after them as her victims mutate and continue the assault which helps the action here considerably. The earlier scene in the lab showing them bring the zombie back to life is where this one starts paying with those mutations for great cheesy action and plenty of fun zombie gore. That cheesiness includes the film's iconic image of her cutup and filled with spikes nails and broken glass impeded in her body that looks quite impressive as well as the finale where the zombies and mutants coming into the picture makes for quite a fun time with all the main gore brought into play here for the film's positive marks. Among the flaws here is the fact of it being too overthetop in regards to their relationship which is barely developed and then quickly delves into the extreme behavior of her turning that's on the whole quite lame as there's very little given about why she would turn into that kind of being instead of the ravenous mindless zombies that were seen as the only turning from exposure to the gas so on the whole this itself is very flawed as for why he would turn her into such a creature. The other flaw here is the rather lacksidaiscal attitude displayed for the military who routinely ignore clearance checks fail to secure highly secure areas in their facility and butt heads with each other over command issues instead of going after the loose zombies which really lowers their effectiveness. While the cheesiness might also be a factor those are the true flaws here.Rated R Graphic Violence Language Brief Nudity and a short sex scene.".

Soon the army arrive and contain all the Zombies including Julie.In the base again Curt discovers that they are going to place an exoskeleton on all the Zombies as a new weapon Curt breaks Julie out and with the help of the Riverman zombie they escape from the room but all the Zombies break out and soon chaos happens in the base.The acting is good and the zombie make up is good the gore effects are a nice touch too. Return of The Living Dead III isn't a comedy but it is full of gore and horror to make this a great entry to the series.";

This one is a lot different from the first two and under a different title i would have never known it was even related. This one must have had a substantially bigger budget as well because it looks very well done or maybe that's because it came out 8 years later than the original. Unfortunately i saw the R rated version rather than the unrated but it was still a good zombie flick that delivered a fair share of gore. The zombie effects were top notch too which is always a major factor when deciding the coolness of a zombie film. It was a little too romantic for my taste but other than that it was tight. Most horror fans will enjoy this one especially if you dig zombies".

Even though they were both pretty entertaining and outrageous I wanted the third one to bring new life to the series. I didn't want the same old thing because when you make sequels that cover no new ground it's just a waste of time. I had low expectations for Return of the Living Dead 3 so I was in true disbelief as I watched it for the first time.I don't really understand why it's a sequel to Return Of The Living Dead because the only similarity the two films have is that zombies dominate each of them. Even with that the two movies couldn't be any more different. The first two Return of the Living Deads spoofed horror movies and didn't take themselves seriously at all. They were made to make you chuckle at the lame acting unbelievably corny dialogue and monsters with a sense of humor. Whereas the third one held nothing back and tried to captivate the viewers with a touching story great acting fantastic directing a clevar script and special effects like you've never seen before. Against all odds Return of the Living Dead 3 is definately one of the most impressive horror movies of all time.It's not an uplifting movie at all for there is constant suffering from start to end. But it's very refreshing to have a zombie movie that can be as serious as heartbreaking dramas and that can show you how many horrible things there are in this world. The images are horrifying and ugly and will indeed stun you. The last twenty minutes include some of the finest special effects and lead to one amazing conclusion. The ending is perfect!!!! It was one of the greatest endings I've ever seen. You don't need to see the previous entries of the series because they share nothing in common with this. I would recommend it to everybody especially those who love a good scare...".

	schema:reviewBody "I was reluctant to watch the third part of the series I have no interest in the second as I knew the character of Burt would no longer be joining us. The death of Burt in the first ROTLD is one of the most unfortunate things in all cinema and had me depressed for weeks. I had further reservations when the logic of the first one was changed significantlypeople in this movie are turned into zombies when bitten by one which was not part of the original at all this was also not the case in Night of the Living Dead but Romero put it into the sequel. It seems to be a weird detail that was obliquely added to the zombie genre and is now taken for granted. There is also some uncertainty as to why the resurrected character Julie even wants brains. In the first one the zombies can feel themselves decomposing and only brains can relieve the painin this one she is just inexplicably hungry and brains... make her full or something. This leads to a rather hilarious scene in which she's stuffing all sorts of food into her mouth at a gas station and had me wondering if the movie was going to be idiotic but at that moment the director hits the clutch and the plot veers into full throttle awesomeness. And in retrospect it's not that big a plot hole maybe she can't feel herself rotting yet but her body knows it's happening and desires brains. We begin following Julie and her boyfriend Curt weird side note these are the names of my aunt and uncle! as they aimlessly run through the streets while pursued by a gang with Julie becoming more insatiably hungry by the minute. It's topnotch horror. A lot of horror movies have you wondering Why don't they just get HELP or something but here it is clearly impossible for the police or medics to do anything and you're as stumped about what the characters should do as they are. There's no feeling superior to them a hard trick to pull off in a horror movie. Eventually Julie attempts suicide and is rescued by a black man dressed like a Jedi Knight and here I was no longer sad that Burt wasn't around because this new fellow actually outawesomes Burt. He takes them to a room in a sewer which he has converted into some sort of temple and announces YOU CAN CALL ME... RIVERMAN whereby I was able to conclude that if I were somehow put in charge of the MPAA rating system I would rate every movie based on whether or not Riverman was in it Riverman being played by cult actor Basil Wallace best known as Screwface from the badass action movie Marked for Death. It is while in Riverman's lair that Julie discovers extreme pain can take her mind off brains leading to the famous scene wherein she mutilates herself beyond recognition some may see this as another plot hole since the original ROTLD zombies needed brains to take their minds off pain but I believe Julie still has enough of a conscience that she prefers the pain to killing. The astute viewer will realize here that all this eating and cutting on Julie's part seems to be referencing some actual reallife issues although I'm not entirely sure what the point of it is. It might be just a joke but the tone is dark enough that it makes a sobering addition to an already depressing story. There's more awesomeness that I don't want to spoil hereI will only say that the freaky zombies from the first movie make an appearance at the end bringing it all to a chaotic conclusion. Mindy Clarke is AMAZING as Julieshe makes a believable performance out of a role that is far different than the usual teenhorror scream queen. The doomed bond between her and Curt works as both straight horror and tragedy and the slick direction and elaborate set pieces make this a fine action flick as well. It's not quite as fun as the first in the series but it's definitely impressive on its own and I can honestly rate it as one of the better movies of the 80's. Check it out. 710.".

One day they sneak into Dad's base to see just what is going on there and are they in for a show! A dead man is brought back as a zombie by good old Trioxin and proceeds to attack and chow down of course. They leave before they see how this gorefest all turns out but Julie Clarke can't get it out of her mind.Kurt's father comes home and announces that he is being transferred. Kurt however refuses to leave because he doesn't want to leave Julie although his father says that getting away from that girl would be the best thing that ever happened to you. The two young lovers go tearing off on Kurt's motorcycle and are in an accident helped by Julie's Roman hands and Russian fingers LOL and Julie is killed. Unable to bear the loss Kurt decides to sneak her back onto the base and use the Trioxin on her. Of course we know where this is going  Julie is going to become a braineating monster! Almost immediately after being brought back she begins to complain of feeling terribly hungry so the two stop at a convenience store. She begins to randomly grab various snack cakes etc. off the shelf and unwrap and eat them right there but nothing satisfies. Meanwhile a group of thugs hold up the place. In the ensuing scuffle Julie bites one of the said thugs and gets a taste of what she's REALLY been hungry for all along. The ownerclerk is shot. Kurt and Julie manage to escape with him and take off in his van with him in the back. The only problem? Julie gets a craving again and this time she knows EXACTLY what she wants. She heads straight to the back of the van and our poor dying shopkeeper. Kurt is treated to the sight of his ladylove feasting on brains for the first time but this being a horror movie is not freaked enough to dump her right there.The two escape and meet River Man Basil Wallace an eccentric shall we say who lives in the sewers. He takes them in not knowing that lovely Julie is rapidly becoming ZOMBIE Julie. Julie has however discovered that she can distract herself from her craving for human fleshbloodbrains by inflicting pain on herself. We are treated if that's the word to shots of her stabbing herself with pins deliberately cutting herself etc. Our young lovers have been followed by the gang of thugs from the store who do not intend to take one of their members being bitten lightly. They show up and threaten River Man and Kurt. But unbeknownst to them Julie has fully transformed into SUPER SEXY ZOMBIE JULIE!!! She appears and is a sight to behold. Kudos to Steve Johnson who I understand did ZombieJulie's makeup. It's scary sexy realistic and allaround brilliant. Anyhow ZombieJulie proceeds to make mincemeat out of  and infect  our gang of thugs as well as River Man who Kurt makes the fatal mistake of leaving alone with her. The calvary arrives  I should mention someone I forgot earlier Sarah Douglas who is great  and Julie and the other zombies are captured. But Kurt STILL can't let go. There follows zombie mayhem escape and an ending I won't describe although the comparison the R  J might have clued you in.Well worth watching if you're a horrorzombiegore fan. Cheers.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's amazing to see how many good reviews this movie has on here. I would rate this down near the bottom of the barrel as far as zombie movies go and nowhere near a good horror film in any way. The gore FX are done well for the most part but the story is ridiculous and makes me cringe just thinking about it. Trying to stick a love story into a zombie flick could have been done well but it isn't here. The acting is awful in every scene especially the Riverman characterwho yells all his lines to show he's crazy I guess? and the ridiculous Latino stereotypeswho of course have to rob a liquorstore to stay in character. The movie starts off with a pretty good scene in the military base with the idea taken from DAY OF THE DEAD to use zombies as combatants in warfare. But from there on it's just one awful dumb scene after the next.".

The gore FX are done well for the most part but the story is ridiculous and makes me cringe just thinking about it.

In the first two you had a whole graveyard of zombies wreaking havoc.  In this one you have some guy's exgirlfriend and then a few mutations.  This movie had a more serious tone than its predecessors but it failed to be scarier. And I'm sorry although the female lead was a fairly attractive galto start there is nothing sexy about watching her suck someone's brains out.  Maybe a sexy vampiress going in for the kill can work now and then  but not this gal.  I hear they are finally working on a fourth one and I look forward to it.  It's wishful thinking but I hope that not only do they go back to what worked in the first two I hope they bring back James Karen and Thom Matthews.

Before the conference the lead known protesters vow that their demonstrations will be peaceful while Seattle Mayor Jim Tobin promises that if that be the case that no arrests will be made and no aggressive action such as the use of tear gas will be issued.

From the breathtaking opening sequence to the exhilarating ending we were on the edge of our seats.There were some outstanding performances  Andr Benjamin as Django from the band Outkast and Michelle Rodriguez as Lou bestknown in Europe for the TV series 'Lost' in particular were superb as two of the demonstrators. Andr injected an unfailing sense of humor and light relief into this serious topic and managed to turn his unusual headgear into a clever statement about endangered species. Michelle gave her character exceptional depth and feeling and handled a complicated emotional subplot with a mixture of both detachment and passion that worked so well on screen.Charlize Theron played an innocent bystander Ella who was trapped in the violent maelstrom with horrific consequences for both her own character and her character's husband.During the QA with Stuart and Charlize at the end of the movie an audience member stood up  an employee of the World Bank. She began by saying how cautious she was about coming to a movie about the WTO but that she had to applaud Stuart for handing such a difficult subject so fairly. Her comments were echoed by a Trade Advocacy officer from a wellknown Irish development charity who congratulated him on creating a movie which managed to be both factually accurate and entertaining.For anyone who has ever wished that this world was a better place this movie is a mustsee. For everyone else this is a heartwarming movie about the power of the human spirit to overcome to work together and to forgive.And as a footnote Stuart gave free passes to the screening to protesters from the Campaign to Save Tara who are still demonstrating against the construction of a new highway the M3 in the historical valley at the Hill of Tara in Ireland.

We follow everyone here from the ground up the protest groups the cops on the street their commanders city officials a news reporter and innocent bystanders. Maybe the scenes with the news reporter are the least fleshed out but that's a fairly minor complaint for a movie that is very involving and entertaining and thoughtprovoking. Woody Harrelson and Charlize Theron are very good as usual and Michelle Rodriguez is perfectly cast. One of the big surprises here is Andre Benjamin from Outkast fame who delivers a fine supporting performance he's irreverent but very smart. Ray Liotta is very effective as the mayor and the film does a great job of seeing the complexities in elected officials as he struggles to please all sides he is looking for the protesters to behave while also wanting the WTO to address important issues.The audience I saw this with at the Toronto Festival gave it an ovation that lasted all through the credits. In terms of pure audience satisfaction this movie was up there with Juno and Body of War and Eastern Promises as the fan favorites.".

This film uses fictional characters to give perspective on the events both for legal and entertainment reasons and the result is amazing. I watched this film as part of the opening night celebration for the Seattle International Film Festival with nearly 3000 other Seattle area residents and the response was simply astounding. Afterwards in both the QA session with the director and part of the cast and the party following I had the opportunity to hear from some others who were involved in the WTO incidents and no one voiced any disappointment with the way the film handled the issues. I would encourage everyone to see this film as soon as possible American release is scheduled for September 2008 and I'm sure international release dates will be around the same time.".

Afterwards in both the QA session with the director and part of the cast and the party following I had the opportunity to hear from some others who were involved in the WTO incidents and no one voiced any disappointment with the way the film handled the issues. I would encourage everyone to see this film as soon as possible American release is scheduled for September 2008 and I'm sure international release dates will be around the same time.";

	schema:reviewBody "There are many that will dismiss this film as boring lame or whatever and I myself was a bit dubious as a Seattle native and somebody that worked downtown during the riots. However after seeing Battle in Seattle last night in Los Angeles I must say that I really enjoyed it. Working within the reality of the film business the need of star power dramatization distribution and financing I thought Stuart Townsend did a great job of telling a fictional story about people within the historical context of the WTO Seattle Ministerial. He was also able to connect the film to what is happening today through some factual statements in the prologue and epilogue that reminded the audience that the WTO is still a presence in everybody's lives whether they know it or not. The film's website also exists to educate viewers on the WTO. There were a lot of subtle details that I remember from that week that he included that I was able to appreciate especially the PineBroadway riot which I was an observer of from the Bauahus Cafe on Pine. Stuart Townsend Charlize Theron and Martin Henderson were also at the screening and talked for about 30 minutes about the film. Stuart said that he was not trying to make a documentary about the WTO since three already existed one of which I've already seen 30 Frames a Second The WTO in Seattle and wanted to make a film about people. Overall I think he did a great job. The only minor personal beef I had was the casting of Tzi Ma as Governor Locke. Locke does not speak with any trace of an accent and hearing Ma ranting on screen with a slight accent was just weird for me being very familiar with Gary Locke...but nobody else will even bat an eye. A lot of people complained that the entire film wasn't filmed in Seattle but that was the reality of financing. He mentioned that if he had to film in Vancouver to get the film made so be it. Most of the key sceneslandmarks were shot in Seattle so you never really lost track of the Seattle vibe believe me I recognized every landmark on screen. Stuart mentioned that he learned a lot about the film making industry from the point of a first time director and how brutal it can be.The WTO is obviously a topic most of Hollywood would not touch with a 10 foot pole. He also said that of the six or so years he spent on the project only 29 days were actual filming days with the rest spent on research production editing etc. I have to give a lot of credit to Stuart for tackling this topic and seeing it to completion and fighting for distribution. It would be the equivalent of me trying to make a film around the Inniskillin Bombing which I do not remember when it happened back in 1987 but have heard of. I was able to shake Stuart's hand afterward and he was a very cool guy and tried to talk to everybody even as his publicist tried to drag him away after the screening.".

These actors are put into narrative situations that a 16yearold would come up with if he were asked to jot down a bunch of scenarios that he thought would have a dramatic impact on his audience.

It would have been better if it had remained that way.You don't get real idea of what the protesters were protesting about. Very much like the real protesters who were a mish mash of anarchists dropouts raversparty goers manic depressives attention seekers show offs chancers and total dreamers. None of whom have any idea of reality because they cannot use logical thought processes.Anyway Charlize Theron spends most of the movie crying in bed ignoring her husband Woody Harrleson who plays one of the riot police officers. I had high hopes for Theron when I first saw her years ago but she sure knows how to pick bad scripts and I do think her career is suffering from it. Woody like Theron will have been drawn to the project because of his environmental background and on paper he must have thought it would be a good move to accept the role. He and Theron are both lucky the movie didn't finish their careers off. Ray Liotta plays the Seattle Mayor. The Mayor seems like a decent trusting guy but is essentially betrayed by the protesters rampage. Liottas performance as well as Theron and Harrleson were mediocre at best. I don't blame them though. Clearly the director has absolutely no idea how to coax a performance from actors and if I were to hedge a bet I would say the director was personally caught up emotionally due to his obvious political views. Nothing wrong with putting your case forward in a movie but you have to do it right and provoke a reaction from the audience make them think. This completely fails to do that. The man completely forgot he was making a movie and like most extreme leftists the idea is always better than the reality. As you watch you will care nothing for any of the characters in the movie. Your constantly hoping something will happen it never does because quite frankly very little actually happened in Seattle over those few days. A few protesters running around smashing windows will not give anyone the ammunition to make a full 90 minute movie.Its quite telling that since the movies release two years ago it only has around 40 reviews on IMDb. Just goes to show that no one not even the protesters give a damn about this movie. They are probably to embarrassed.The favourable reviews of which there are far to many can only be from a few dreamers and those with an agenda. But seriously pay them no attention because this is a really bad movie no matter what side of the political spectrum you come from.Avoid at all costs.".

There are shots which have been recreated and even quotations by some of the protesters. One for instance is when one of the proenvironment protesters compares the crowds to people coming out of nowhere like in the Michael Jackson 'Thriller' video Yet this is a good movie with some wonderful acting. Harrelson and Liota stand out in their roles as a riot cop and the mayor of Seattle. Although I was most struck by Martin Henderson as Jay a protest organizer whose brother was killed in a forestry protest and has two strikes against him and could spend a long time in jail if he gets arrested again. Having been to protests in Seattle and in Ottawa against globalization I recognized his character as a common person we see in this movement. The romantic plot line with another protester did almost feel forced at times. It wasn't necessary but for the most part this movie wasn't necessary.If the movie accomplishes anything I hope it will bring younger people who were too young to be politically aware at that time into the fold and fight against corporate and state tyranny.The movie definitely captured the feeling of these antiglobalization protests and how they represented a multitude of voices from environmentalism to labour leaders. I just wish they had focused more on the anarchists who seemed to be the only ones to get the short end of the stick in this movie. Why not show their story and who they are? Are hippie leftist protesters more interesting. Perhaps next time when someone makes a movie out of the 2001 protests against the FTAA in Quebec City. Battaille en Qubec.".

Told me all I needed to know.See this movie if you want to understand where the antiglobalisation movement really kicked off and the messy but important case it was trying to make.";

It's so bad that even a gripping true story of mass human conflict and political protest decent directing amazing archival protest footage and the attempts of Woody Harrelson Ray Liotta Charlize Theron and Andre from Outkast couldn't save it. Woody nearly saves his character and turns him into perhaps the most interesting human character in the movie  and he's a friggin' riot cop! The rest of the poor actors just can't pull it off. The man and woman who are the supposed main characters are a joke  badly written plotted in a way that makes no sense acted poorly and woodenly clichd utterly uninteresting and unsympathetic  it seems like the film makers thought the fact that they were white and the man had a strong chin and the woman had big breasts would somehow carry them through.It's truly truly unfortunate since the makers of the film clearly wanted to tell a complex story about one particularly important event of unrest in the process of human social change and evolution that I lived through and still find important even though I have little interest in reliving and recreating it. They wanted to show people coming to a better understanding and empowerment in their shared humanity through the outcome of mass protests against inhumane international trade policies on the streets of Seattle. But they made some awful mistakes. As others have pointed out they'd likely have been much better off making a straight documentary  or doing much MUCH better research about what really happened in Seattle and from that writing a drama that actually had believable characters acting in realistic ways and saying things real people would say.Hopefully next time they'll find a way to send a message of hope and change in a way that is aesthetically appealing enough to get out to more people.".

	schema:reviewBody "I just finished watching the Battle in Seattle feature film. I wanted to like it more than I did. I was aware of David Solnit's one of the Direct Action Network's organizers concerns about it see www.yesmagazine.orgissuespurpleAmericathebattleforreality for a summary an interview with the director and Solnit at www.democracynow.org2008918battleinseattlewithalist and a participatory historical website at httprealbattleinseattle.org before I started watching. The film had a great dramatic even potentially epic subject and a noble idea to tell the story from multiple points of view. I applaud its ambition and I'm glad I saw it. The minifilm essay by Stuart Townsend labeled The Making of the Battle of Seattle included on the DVD is actually quite great describing the film Townsend wanted to make. He wanted to make a film fictionalizing and personalizing through the eyes of multiple characters the struggles that converged in Seattle during the WTO conference. It's an ambitious goal and Townsend deserves praise for attempting it.Unfortunately however Townsend didn't succeed in making that movie. There are so many characters that they got lost in the crosscutting and remained schematic and two dimensional. The film doesn't portray the activists either as fullblooded people nor does it at all accurately portray the organizational structures used. It refers to affinity groups a couple of times but fails to actually show any actually discussing anything. The scenes outside the jail at the solidarity rallies for those inside come alive but inside the jail instead of a hubbub of discussions debates singing and workshops Townsend repeatedly portrays a group of silent sullen defeated arrestees. The exception is Django an upbeat AfricanAmerican proturtle activist who gets one of the best moments in the film when trying to cheer everyone else up he says that now everyone will know what the WTO is but then instantly amends that claim to say Well they probably won't know what it is. But they'll know it's something bad.The attempts at portraying a budding romance between two apparently heterosexual activists is not written well enough to be at all believable. And to mention just one of potentially many political concerns there were no gays or lesbians in Seattle protesting?And we're supposed to believe that a cop whose pregnant lover has just been attacked by a police officer mistaking her for a protester and causing her to miscarry is going to take out his anger by chasing a lone demonstrator a key organizer of course and personally beat him bloody? And then the same police officer is going to enter the jail and apologize for doing it?There's two ciphers of character who could potentially have been quite fascinating a Doctors Without Borders activist who gets one good moment when he asks the trade representatives how they'd feel if their children were the ones who were going to die because they couldn't afford medicines because of the policies they were making who is trying to pressure the WTO from within and a trade minister from an unnamed African country. But we never see them as anything but cardboard standins for a position never see them struggling with a decision and never hear them articulate any kind of point of view about the protests and the impact they are having.The direction at times was quite good but I'm not sure it was such a good idea to mix in the real footage because the real footage is so much more dramatic and powerful than the fictional watching it just made me wish I were watching a documentary instead of a docudrama. Townsend in his Making Of segment voices the hope that the film will motivate folks to want to learn more. The movie has motivated me to want to watch This is What Democracy Looks Like httpwww.imdb.comtitlett0265871 and 30 Frames a Second The WTO in Seattle httpwww.imdb.comtitlett0315734 so at least to that extent the Battle in Seattle succeeded.".

The correct overview of the ensuing five years of the convention at the end of the film points to the fact that no significant gains were made. That and work with young people not old to get them thinking and about and acting on the problems of our world.

All in all a very good film which does make people feel as well as think.";

More to the point is EllaCharlize Theron guilty of being American? Born into a consumer culture and raised on oblivion Ella's hermetically sealed world of ruined Brazilian vacation plans and other middleclass related angst is shattered like that display window in the department store she shops at for baby clothes. The selfrighteous rabblerouser admonishes Ella for alienating herself from the world atlarge he lambastes the pregnant woman because she doesn't see the bigger picture i.e. the children in third world sweatshops who will clothe her second trimester fetus for life. Without that transparent safeguard for protection Ella asks her equally apolitical friend What the hell is going on out there? as she is no longer able to live in blissful ignorance. Instead of engaging with the body politic of WTO protesters however her ignorance refashions itself as arrogance since the cop's wife continues to abide by the status quo. Back at work Ella's boss sends his employees home when a bloodied political dissenter staggers into his store. Out on the streets unable to hail a taxi or catch a bus Ella is peeved since now finally the riot has a tangible effect on her life she can't get home. While chaos prevails Ella ignores the teeming masses and squeezes her way through huddled congregations without the least bit of curiosity. The political charge has no cling. Ella of Battle in Seattle far from being a subordinate character might be its most important as the filmmaker places the American woman in a dialectical relationship with a delegate from the African caucus.Battle in Seattle is too diffuse by half were its agenda to portray political activism as an effective weapon of discourse to use against the WTO's unwritten and almost sociopathic policy to miscarry justice in the name of profit over people. Peter Greengrass' Bloody Sunday immediately springs to mind as an exemplary film about an insurgency as the 2002 film about the British army's attack on Catholic marchers at a nonviolent civil rights demonstration in Ireland focused solely on the Gaelic hippies. Conversely this filmmaker undermines his supposed attempt to present civic disobedience in a positive light every time it's the mayor's turn in the film's multinarrative approach. An inference is made by showing how incompetent Jim TobinRay Liotta was in preparing for the WTO conference the inference being that maintaing order should always be the main objective in which shrewder administrative decisions would have resulted in a vacuum of people on the immediate city blocks and wellattended symposiums. Contrary to the film's subjective approach towards the anarchy in Seattle a riot is sometimes necessary especially in this case as a means of alerting the politically uninformedElla for example about the carte blanche style of the ruling partieswho maintain their hegemony over the third world countries by the will of their bigger GNPs in the WTO. In plain sight the third world caucus gets the shaft when AbassiIssache De Bankole is informed by a WTO official that their interpreters are being yanked for matters more pressing than medicine reaching the populations of underdeveloped countries. Interrelated to millions of transoceanic lives is one American life in the film's overruling scene where Ella an innocent bystander seemingly absorbs a blow to the stomach delivered by a policeman's club. At first glance the baby seems like a sacrifice a punishment for Ella's disinterest with Abassi's main concern but as it turns out the cop's wife is neither guilty of being white nor American. In another overruling scene Abassi distraught over the treatment he and his delegates receive from the governing body walks to a window and draws inspiration from the crowd gathered outside a largely stateside one. In a sense Abassi's activism is colonized by America. Even though Ella's miscarriage can be summed up as a karmic convergence due to her apathetic stance towards global matters the film's diffuse approach allows Ella's tragedy to superimpose itself over Africa's loss therefore putting Battle in Seattle in perfect harmony with the mindset of the great nations in which the film like the WTO handles third world concerns as if they had less value than first world ones.".

The film mixed archive footage of the massive demonstrations with modern reconstruction around the various story lines several professional protesters and their reactions to the violence they were unwittingly but not unforeseeably responsible for the civic and police authorities confronted with overwhelmingly hostile demonstrators out to break the law the policeman on the front line whose pregnant wife inadvertently gets caught up in the riot is beaten by a passing policeman and loses her baby the professional demonstrator bent on wilfully damaging property the camera crew who go from being neutral to siding with the protesters as the civic response gets tough. The start of the film portrays the WTO as being some shadow organisation devoted to making the rich richer and the poor poorer whilst raping the planet. As usual with protect movements truth does not matter. The fact that the WTO is there to try and provide a framework for policing international trade and what would the situation be like without it are of no concern to the protesters the WTO is bad and must be smashed. This is a selfevident truth so ordinary people should get out of the way whilst those who care take the law into their own hands. When it comes to defeating what protesters do not like the law does not come into it. The film also makes it clear that a the demonstrators have nothing positive to offer and that as usual b they take no responsibility for the consequences of their actions. On this point the protester's lawyer who should no better has no realisation of what she is doing. Generally all the people the film seeks sympathy for are the demonstrators who by their own ignorance and irresponsible refusal to accept the democratic process puts a heavy burden on those paying through taxes for their right to be stupid. To be fair the response to the demonstrations was affected by political rather than practical considerations of crowd control leading to ugly confrontations and use of force but this was not the fault of the police.This is the sort of film which should provoke debate but sadly from the evidence of the demonstrators their only response is to shout slogans and cry foul as they have nothing else.Here endeth the lesson.".

	schema:headline " A selfserving effort with bows to a few directors";
	schema:reviewBody "Alain Delon has always been one of my idols. It might be because my Mother found him the most handsome of all actors and in my teens I tried to copy a few of his mannerisms so I have tried to track down and watch all his movies and Le Battant was one of the few that I had not watched yet. Alas it is a selfserving movie in which Delon's name appears twice in the initial credits before being credited as director. He kills with no song the movie's soundtrack is worse than torture and certainly not softly and he has enemies everywhere even among the women he seduces so easily but amazingly for such a thorough killing machine he is easily duped by his most evil and yet trusted nemesis and he makes basic mistakes like walking openly into possible lines of fire standing by windows with open curtains and placing the gun too close to the enemies he subdues before dispatching them. He is also fabulously good at moving diamonds to Rio de Janeiro while everyone else believes they are in France.In terms of acting my idol falls very short of his quality performances in ROCCO AND HIS BROTHERS THE LEOPARD THE SAMURAI LES FELINS and even PLEIN SOLEIL. And his direction is aimless throwing in all kinds of bows to directors like Ren Clment JeanPierre Melville Jacques Deray and others.

	onyx:emotionText "Alain Delon has always been one of my idols. It might be because my Mother found him the most handsome of all actors and in my teens I tried to copy a few of his mannerisms so I have tried to track down and watch all his movies and Le Battant was one of the few that I had not watched yet. Alas it is a selfserving movie in which Delon's name appears twice in the initial credits before being credited as director. He kills with no song the movie's soundtrack is worse than torture and certainly not softly and he has enemies everywhere even among the women he seduces so easily but amazingly for such a thorough killing machine he is easily duped by his most evil and yet trusted nemesis and he makes basic mistakes like walking openly into possible lines of fire standing by windows with open curtains and placing the gun too close to the enemies he subdues before dispatching them. He is also fabulously good at moving diamonds to Rio de Janeiro while everyone else believes they are in France.In terms of acting my idol falls very short of his quality performances in ROCCO AND HIS BROTHERS THE LEOPARD THE SAMURAI LES FELINS and even PLEIN SOLEIL. And his direction is aimless throwing in all kinds of bows to directors like Ren Clment JeanPierre Melville Jacques Deray and others. He even borrows the cage of the bird in THE SAMURAI and a few musical notes to go with it in a snippet of a scene that is totally meaningless to anyone who did not watch that JM Melville masterpiece.The supporting cast is largely anonymous in light of Delon's almost continuous presence on the screen.

The action and stuntwork in this film is almost the eighth wonder of the world. The things Jet Li does with his fighting and acrobatic skills are truly amazing. Great story too. Very humorous in places also being a spoof of the Once Upon a Time in China series in general. Since many of the stunts are rather large scale the widescreen really helps also.

This is a shame because Jet Li and Xin Xin Xiong are amazing martial artists and their talents are completely wasted here.  Which brings me to the other problem.  The villains are...bank robbers?  Jet Li fights the English and corrupt officials in the first two films and now he's got to fight bank robbers?  Besides that minor spoiler the main villain doesn't even put up a fight.  Wong basically kicks his  all over town. There is no dramatic intensity whatsoever. end spoilerOn a side note the Tai Seng DVD release has terrible subtitles.  They're out of synch with the dialogue and the only get worse as the movie goes on. At the end of the film they show up a good 67 seconds after the person has spoken making things a bit confusing.

This time around Tsui Hark stands in as producer and brings surehand director Sammo Hung on board to lens the proceedings. Sadly it appears that Hung's artistic vision was somewhat constrained on this movie which has a kind of bland glossy look and is far from the nittygritty action seen in his '80s offerings like MILLIONAIRE'S EXPRESS and EASTERN CONDORS.Jet Li who only made one more Chinese flick Hitman before upping sticks to America is good value for money as always but he does look a little bored with the material. Things do tend to get rather silly especially when he joins a Native American tribe who nickname him 'Yellow' a little racist perhaps?.You get the impression that Li was looking for a little more substantial material which is fair enough. Others returning from the third film in the series include Xi Xi Xiong as lightningfast as ever and Rosamund Kwan who looks a lot older and is pretty much unrecognisable from her glory days in the '80s. The only other recognisable cast member is Richard Ng better known as 'Sandy' who seems to have aged about twenty years since we last saw him.The storyline is definitely episodic with one or two engaging stunts including a spectacular carriage crash which has to be seen to be believed. The final drawnout battle with a gang of bandits is a lot of fun especially Li's showdown with Joe Sayah a really weird looking guy who gets bottles and all sorts smashed over his head. Although the film never reaches the heights to which it aspires it passes the time amiably enough if you're in the mood for nondemanding fare.".

That isn't the end of their worries though the mayor of the town is making life difficult for the Chinese population and frames them when the bank is robbed to prove their innocence they will have to survive hanging and fight the real robbers!.If you are looking for a serious western then this isn't the film for you however if you want some laughs and over the top kungfu action then this is a lot of fun. Clich is piled on clich as we have marauding Indians amnesia corrupt officials and diabolical villains the leader of whom just happens to know kungfu! The action scenes are well choreographed for the most part although occasionally they look hilariously fake the early wagon crash being most notable. When I watched this I had no idea that it was actually the sixth instalment in a series of films but that doesn't really matter the cast are introduced in a way that means you don't have to have seen earlier instalments the only real confusion was the title as we never see them in China! The Chinese cast do well as one would expect Jet Li's action scenes are great as are those of Xin Xin Xiong who plays Seven Rosamund Kwan is also likable as Aunt Lee. The western cast aren't so great though they aren't terrible but it is of no surprise that none of them are well known or known at all for that matter. Overall this is a lot of fun if you want plenty of action and plenty of laughs sometime unintended laughs!.These comments are based on watching the subtitled version of the film strangely everything is subtitled including the English dialogue which sometimes doesn't match what is said!".

The acting was appalling from the Red Indians and the weird looking blonde guy and the storyline was all over the place. The music sounded like it was done on one of those old small casino organs but some of the fighting scenes weren't that bad. I'm glad that I didn't have to read subtitles through the movie because the script was really bad and the dubbing wasn't much better.

The sad thing is that Jet Li actually isn't that bad in it. I do wonder how people can watch the screening of a movie and think that it's OK to release utter rubbish. I also can't see were all of the budget went. Anyway I will just put this down as a bad day at the office for Jet Li.Budget 12million Worldwide Gross HK30millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their Jet Li movies about a group of natives trying to make a new life for themselves in the Wild West. 110".

The shooting of the film is excellent with the locations adding much to the feeling of the film. There are enough twists and turns in the plot to keep you guessing even if you think you have it worked out within the first half as we both did you'll doubt yourself from then on in.My one criticism is the start of the film. It feels somewhat piecemeal and directionless perhaps on purpose to mirror the main characters state of mind but it just doesn't seem to gel and the scoring feels the same however don't let that stop you watching this film as once past the first few scenes you will be tripping over yourself trying to figure it out.All told this was a well produced well filmed well acted movie and don't believe any of the 'horror' tags it's more suspensethriller and very good to boot!".

	schema:reviewBody "Half Light is one surprise of a movie. The film is about a writer Rachel Carson Demi Moore who tragically loses her young son when he drowns by the dock near their house in England. Devastated from the event Rachel's friend rents her a secluded island cottage on the Scotland coast so she can relax and recover in the comfortable atmosphere and conquer her current writer's block. But when she arrives to the little old cottage on the edge of the ocean weird things start to happen. She has strange visions of her son she spends time with a man living in a lighthouse who has supposedly been dead for seven years and the townspeople are also quite strange. Real life terror and supernatural events drive Rachel into hysteria from there as she tries to unravel a complex mystery.This was a surprisingly chilling little thriller film the atmosphere of the whole secluded ocean village was unique and neat the little village set itself sitting right on the sandy beach. There are a lot of dark gray and foggy tones in the film which add even more to the atmosphere. I liked the whole feeling the film had it was isolated and eerie. It's kind of hard to explain I can't really put my finger on it but the whole atmosphere was foreboding and spooky. Demi Moore was great she's a pretty believable actress from what I've seen. Her performance was realistic and fit the film well. The settings are great and really spooky on many occasions particularly the small cottage and the old lighthouse. The story was rather original and very subtle with overall good writing. The ending was a bit of a twistending blending reallife horror with a supernatural addition but it fit well and I wasn't disappointed with it like some twistendings leave me. Overall Half Light is a good little thriller film that caught me off guard I was expecting something along the lines of cheap straighttovideo garbage. It's quite the contrary though. The Gothic seaside atmosphere was excellent and well puttouse in the film and the creepy little story was well written with a satisfying conclusion. Fans of supernatural thrillers will definitely want to check this one out it's a good one for sure. 710.".

I do question some of the scenery. The village looks authentic Scottish with plaster and stone houses. However the cottage looks pure Appalacian mountain cabin  certainly not able to withstand hard weather in that part of the British Isles. Also the lighthouse looks more USA than Scotland. The rest of the scenery looked genuine. I loved the musical score and the GREAT twist at the end. It really leaves you wondering about some things and that's why I watched it again the next day.

Movies seldom turn out well when moviemakers mix styles and elements like that. One somehow wants to know what to expect  roughly at least. I for my part had hoped for a traditional ghost story  and I was disappointed when it turned out that the culprits were human. And also by all the dead people violence and gore. It did not have any good scares either.I think the plot was also wildly improbable. A husband and the wife's best friend falling in love with each other and cooperating about killing the wife and living off her money. Yes I can buy that. It has happened. But their plot was too extreme and improbable. There are thousands of ways to kill a person and make it look like an accident or a suicide. Especially as this woman already had a big grief and a lot of bad conscience after her son died. No one would have doubted her reasons to kill herself.But to involve a third person who wanted his share of the inheritance and who could blackmail them later...? And to have this person act as a ghost  a very virile fleshy ghost at that..? And to take the trouble to clean up and furnish the old lighthouse  and then take everything away again and make it look as if no one had lived there for eight years..? The longer they stayed in the neighbourhood the greater the risk that somebody should see them and recognize them later... Another question how could they even know of the tragedy in the lighthouse eight years earlier..? They were not from there.No this movie was a mistake I think. I still give it four stars for the craggy nature scenery from Scotland and some fine lovescenes and motherchildscenes.".

Fast Forward and the viewer becomes aware that she is now separated from her less than successful husband also a writer and she decides to hermit herself away to finish her next book. Her dearest friend finds the perfect charming cottage for her across the bay from a lighthouse.She begins to seehearfeel creepy and downright scary things like toys turning on horrible nightmares visions and the like. Then... a wonderful handsome man comes into her life  Angus the lighthouse keeper. He lifts her spirits making her think maybe life is all good again. He wines dines and romances her until she finds out he is a ghost well not really. Supposedly he died some years ago in a local scandal  which the local psychic had foretold. Rachel's mental state degrades and the locals think she is a loon. Then in true 1940's fashion it becomes clear that all the whole thing was some plot by her soontobe ex and the friend that rented her the cottage who is the ex's mistress now. They plotted  using a felon actor to play Angus to make her death look like a suicide and thereby get all her money. Things really start to unravel here. The conspirators are picked off one by one... ostensibly by the real ghost of the lighthouse keeper... and the odd messages from her son are never fully explained.Overall  great start out of the gate and plot thread. I was quite taken with the spooky feel of it until the odd turn to an old 1940's favorite theme noir  with the modern bloodlust at the end. Excellent locations with beautiful scenery. Demi Moore kind of floats through the whole movie and the only actor that really stood out was Hans Matheson who played the dashing sensitive yet very dangerous Angus.".

Then in true 1940's fashion it becomes clear that all the whole thing was some plot by her soontobe ex and the friend that rented her the cottage who is the ex's mistress now. They plotted  using a felon actor to play Angus to make her death look like a suicide and thereby get all her money. Things really start to unravel here. The conspirators are picked off one by one... ostensibly by the real ghost of the lighthouse keeper... and the odd messages from her son are never fully explained.Overall  great start out of the gate and plot thread. I was quite taken with the spooky feel of it until the odd turn to an old 1940's favorite theme noir  with the modern bloodlust at the end. Excellent locations with beautiful scenery. Demi Moore kind of floats through the whole movie and the only actor that really stood out was Hans Matheson who played the dashing sensitive yet very dangerous Angus.";

	schema:reviewBody "I love a good oldfashioned mystery  thriller and Half Light deliciously qualifies as one with a generous touch of the supernatural thrown in. It is the story of Rachel Carlson who is trying to recover some semblance of normalcy after the drowning of her young son. She is a famous author who has understandably been blocked since the tragic event. To try to remedy her situation she moves to a remote community in Scotland where she occupies an idyllic seaside cottage.Rachel is welcomed in a conservative yet not unkind way by the local townsfolk but is shocked by one woman who seems to know about her dead son. Being told that the woman is the local nut she at first dismisses the woman's cryptic statements but is soon thrown into an emotional whirlpool when her son begins to appear in and about the cottage.Just opposite her cottage is an island lighthouse she plans to use in her new novel. She goes by boat to explore the island and finds that the lighthouse rather than being automatic is run by a keeper. Angus is the descendant of the original keeper and takes great pride in his family history and his quiet lonely life. Love blossoms between Rachel and Angus but there are signals that all will not be well.There is nothing unique about the story line of Half Light. As a matter of fact it's pretty easy to figure out early on into the mystery how everything is going to evolve. There are some good shocking moments as events unfold and all in all it's a satisfying tale.The acting scenery music and general mood of the film are what raise it to a level higher than the runofthemill effort in this genre.Demi Moore plays a Rachel with whom it's easy to identify. Ms. Moore  an excellent actor not given nearly enough credit for her achievements  provides a portrayal of an intelligent woman with a strength of spirit and mind who is determined to go on with life even though she has been dealt a tragic blow.Several supporting performances are also notable. Angus is played by Hans Matheson in a a sensitive performance as the enigmatic lighthouse keeper who is able to renew Rachel's passion for life. Matheson has an uncanny ability to delineate the different personalities of his character.James Cosmo plays the local law officer who is skeptical of the occurrences reported to him by Rachel but Cosmo does not fall into that clich role of the doubting lawman that we find in so many movies of this type. Instead he gives a generally sympathetic performance as a compassionate man of sensible thought.The local nut is played by Joanna Hole who also demonstrates a restrained interpretation of a woman possessed of unique powers who is well aware of their effects upon others. All of the actors in the film must have benefited from excellent direction so as to keep the story in the realm of reality.Probably for me the most outstanding features of Half Light are the scenery and locations. They were perfect choices to promote the moods of the film. We first see Rachel in an expensive house in London where everything is perfect  just as perfect as her life before her loss. In Scotland  in reality Wales  Rachel is in a setting that is lonely mysterious and filled with the power of nature. I was overwhelmed by the beauty and power of the scenery of this seaside location.For me  thankfully  the tragedy that Rachel experiences in Half Light is foreign so how I would react or a close friend would react is unknown. I do know that Demi Moore caused me to believe Rachel and all that happens to her in contrast to the response that often comes when we see women in films of this sort shown as almost insane and hysterical. Half Light instead provides us with solid characters extraordinary views and a good story  pretty good for two hours of entertainment.".

I agree completely with all the reviews that the scenery with the light tower is wonderfully done. What I liked the most is that the director mixed many ingredients of the genre romance psycho and thriller all in one worthseeing movie. I am surprised why this film didn't get out in the US theaters and in Europe. I think they missed a great opportunity here but for all DVD fans of this genre I recommend highly to see it. At the end my wife had even some tears and me too. A great one that deserves a solid 810 and that is too underrated on IMDb. If you liked it you may also try MURDER BY NUMBER with Sandra Bullock.".

	schema:reviewBody "Everyone has a real motive to be hyped about this great little thriller. It was the film Demi Moore chose to do one year after her comeback in the overdone Charlie's Angels sequel. After constant scripts and offers knocked on Moore's door like it was 1996 it is VERY obvious why Moore chose a film like this. This film was approached in the very manner that her earlier films were and this film shows that she hasn't lost her judgment. It is also obvious that she was careful about what to do after America went banana's over her stillhot looks and a strange fascination with younger guys. To me this was the best possible decision she could have made.When novelist Rachel Carson looses her small son to the devastating nature of water she also looses her life. Her marriage is failing and she is suffering a severe case of writers block. To ease the pain of her son's death she takes a leave from her home in England to a quaint island with a beautiful village. There she starts what she could call a better life while it is anything but Illusions Betrayal Fear of Insanity etc.. As she begins to see her son she hears him tell her things involving people she knows.Such a great choice made by Moore as I said is very evident by the way the film opens subtle and soft with just a touch of eeriness. The films charm comes not only from appealing writing and likable cast but also from as earlier stated the approach. This is what moviegoers want to see when they go to the theaters. This film is painted with bucolic shots and scenery of the European countryside. Hauntingly depicted in long shots and pacing in light of a film released in the early 1990's much better than anything released today or in the last five years. Director Rosenberg seems to know what his audience is looking for and weaves the story as if he were writing a book. It is all quite poetic and still not all violence is mindless.Such high quality frames and stunning imagery make this one a film you love to watch. You also love to endure the presentation of the characters and the story through the impeccable pacing. It moves along very surely but never too quickly and the tactics it uses keep you in tune with all that is happening on screen or not. We get to know Rachel Carson as Demi Moore still enchants the screen with charisma and presence. Other characters are drawn out well in the same style and the fact that we Americans haven't the best familiarity with the actors really helps. Why this film was passed onto video is not clear but one thing is for sure it isn't a viable reason whatever it be. For all my reasons I can only conclude that it was TOO good to be seen in American theaters. Most US audiences are used to fastpaced action crud that only appeals to little brats who spend the day lounging at the cinemas anyway because they're so useless they have no lives. HalfLight is a great example of modern day thriller. It was unexpected it was natural it was eerie! Most of all it was REAL! What is not to like? Answer that America if you can!".

	onyx:emotionText "Everyone has a real motive to be hyped about this great little thriller. It was the film Demi Moore chose to do one year after her comeback in the overdone Charlie's Angels sequel. After constant scripts and offers knocked on Moore's door like it was 1996 it is VERY obvious why Moore chose a film like this. This film was approached in the very manner that her earlier films were and this film shows that she hasn't lost her judgment. It is also obvious that she was careful about what to do after America went banana's over her stillhot looks and a strange fascination with younger guys. To me this was the best possible decision she could have made.When novelist Rachel Carson looses her small son to the devastating nature of water she also looses her life. Her marriage is failing and she is suffering a severe case of writers block. To ease the pain of her son's death she takes a leave from her home in England to a quaint island with a beautiful village. There she starts what she could call a better life while it is anything but Illusions Betrayal Fear of Insanity etc..

	schema:reviewBody "I watched this on video last night. It wasn't even a blip in the movie schedule in Japan although Bowling for Columbine was in most theaters when it came out. There are obvious reasons for the lack of attention Liberty Stands Still received.Some spoilers follow.First it was tedious. The drawn out disclosure of why Joe is doing this is supposed to be intriguing but there is no tension to sustain the intrigue. Ironically the realism of the offhand way he kills a few of the victims works against the drama of the movie by releasing some of the tension without a buildup to that release. There is another source of tension in the bombs but since we never actually get to know Russel that well we don't really care too much about him. He's been committing adultery with someone else's wife so most people wouldn't have that much sympathy with him from a moral standpoint anyway. The other potential victims of the bombs are either people Skogland portrays unsympathetically or a faceless crowd. It makes it hard to care about whether the bombs go off or not.That leads to another problem with the plot there are no sympathetic characters. Again this complexity is one of the things that works against it as a movie. Even Liberty who is in the role of Joe's main victim is shown to be unsympathetic at the beginning she's cheating on her husband she's indirectly responsible for gun running and so is supposedly aiding and abetting wars at home and abroad yet we are somehow supposed to grow to like her at least a little bit by the end of the film. The only admirable things about her were that she tried to find a way out of her predicament and kept trying to help others even if she was putting herself in danger.A final major flaw was that the ending was anticlimactic. Obviously Kari Skogland could not make her villain into a demon without undermining her message so some of Joe's threats are bluffs. He is made to appear serious by killing people earlier in the film but the people he kills are people that no one could really care aboutin many cases we don't know them well enoughor could not support without some ambiguity.This movie's blatantly obvious message is antigun. Unfortunately Skogland displays a very poor understanding of the complexities involved in the question of guncontrol. Joe states that the gun industry is huge while in reality most manufacturers function barely in the black. Profits for the entire firearms industry in 1999 amounted to about 200 million. The CEO of a major corporation makes a median salary of 13 to 14 million and the highest paid make around 180 to 190 million. That's the amount that a single employee of the company makes versus the profits of an entire industry. Making guns is hardly the most profitable of businesses.The line of reasoning that Joe follows is tenuous at best. By his logic car manufacturers should be held responsible for the accidents they cause drug manufacturers responsible for deaths from side effects accidental overdoses and suicides and the power company for deaths through electrocution. I fully agree with one of Joe's statements that Americans have forgotten about responsibility. Where he and I disagree is that I would not hold the manufacturer of a hammer responsible for a murder committed using the hammer I would blame the murderer. In addition we never find out for sure if the death he lays at Liberty's feet was intentional or accidental. He seems to think that issue is not worth considering and this allows him to skirt the issue of personal responsibility in his quest for justice. While his blindness to the complexities of the situation could be seen as Skogland's presentation of a flawed narrator given the overall treatment of the film it is likely that the overt message and tortured logic are the writer's own not just the character's.While this movie had some potential it falls flat in many areas. The logic of the plot is forced the characters are not developed to their full potential and some of the virtues it does have are undermined by mistakes in pacing. If the promised complexity and ambiguity of the characters had been more fully developed if the logic and facts of the plot had been more believable if Skogland had built the dramatic tension in a more adept way this could have been a better than average movie.If you want to watch good movie about the issue of gun control rent Bowling for Columbine. You may not agree with Moore's message but if you actually think about what he is saying you have to admit that he raises some legitimate points. His approach is to ask questions to find the root causes of the problem. Moore raises more questions than he answers and by doing so invites the viewer to help find a solution for the very real problems to which he draws attention. It's not drama but it is a decent treatment of the central issue in Liberty Stands Still.".

There are obvious reasons for the lack of attention Liberty Stands Still received.Some spoilers follow.First it was tedious. The drawn out disclosure of why Joe is doing this is supposed to be intriguing but there is no tension to sustain the intrigue. Ironically the realism of the offhand way he kills a few of the victims works against the drama of the movie by releasing some of the tension without a buildup to that release. There is another source of tension in the bombs but since we never actually get to know Russel that well we don't really care too much about him. He's been committing adultery with someone else's wife so most people wouldn't have that much sympathy with him from a moral standpoint anyway. The other potential victims of the bombs are either people Skogland portrays unsympathetically or a faceless crowd. It makes it hard to care about whether the bombs go off or not.That leads to another problem with the plot there are no sympathetic characters. Again this complexity is one of the things that works against it as a movie. Even Liberty who is in the role of Joe's main victim is shown to be unsympathetic at the beginning she's cheating on her husband she's indirectly responsible for gun running and so is supposedly aiding and abetting wars at home and abroad yet we are somehow supposed to grow to like her at least a little bit by the end of the film. The only admirable things about her were that she tried to find a way out of her predicament and kept trying to help others even if she was putting herself in danger.A final major flaw was that the ending was anticlimactic. Obviously Kari Skogland could not make her villain into a demon without undermining her message so some of Joe's threats are bluffs. He is made to appear serious by killing people earlier in the film but the people he kills are people that no one could really care aboutin many cases we don't know them well enoughor could not support without some ambiguity.This movie's blatantly obvious message is antigun. Unfortunately Skogland displays a very poor understanding of the complexities involved in the question of guncontrol. Joe states that the gun industry is huge while in reality most manufacturers function barely in the black. Profits for the entire firearms industry in 1999 amounted to about 200 million. The CEO of a major corporation makes a median salary of 13 to 14 million and the highest paid make around 180 to 190 million. That's the amount that a single employee of the company makes versus the profits of an entire industry. Making guns is hardly the most profitable of businesses.The line of reasoning that Joe follows is tenuous at best. By his logic car manufacturers should be held responsible for the accidents they cause drug manufacturers responsible for deaths from side effects accidental overdoses and suicides and the power company for deaths through electrocution. I fully agree with one of Joe's statements that Americans have forgotten about responsibility. Where he and I disagree is that I would not hold the manufacturer of a hammer responsible for a murder committed using the hammer I would blame the murderer. In addition we never find out for sure if the death of a loved one which he lays at Liberty's feet was intentional or accidental. He seems to think that issue is not worth considering and this allows him to skirt the issue of personal responsibility in his quest for justice. While his blindness to the complexities of the situation could be seen as Skogland's presentation of a flawed narrator given the overall treatment of the film it is likely that the overt message and tortured logic are the writer's own not just the character's.While this movie had some potential it falls flat in many areas. The logic of the plot is forced the characters are not developed to their full potential and some of the virtues it does have are undermined by mistakes in pacing. If the promised complexity and ambiguity of the characters had been more fully developed if the logic and facts of the plot had been more believable if Skogland had built the dramatic tension in a more adept way this could have been a better than average movie.If you want to watch good movie about the issue of gun control rent Bowling for Columbine. You may not agree with Moore's message but if you actually think about what he is saying you have to admit that he raises some legitimate points. His approach is to ask questions to find the root causes of the problem. Moore raises more questions than he answers and by doing so invites the viewer to help find a solution for the very real problems to which he draws attention. It's not drama but it is a decent treatment of the central issue in Liberty Stands Still.";

Trust me. The plot is about Liberty Fiorentino who is the wife of a gun manufacturer Platt. She is held hostage outside in a Los Angeles park by Joe Snipes who is blaming his daughter's death on her.How heavyhanded could this movie get? This is subtlety at it's worst. In a nutshell don't blame the person who pulled the trigger blame the manufacturer. Besides that the performances are strong. Snipes is always good. Fiorentino puts some energy into her role but it still looks like she's sleepwalking. Overall it's for Snipes fans only.For more insanity please visit comeuppancereviews.com".

	schema:reviewBody "While a somewhat interesting drama at times it is often ruined by the preachy tone it takes with guns. In this film the root of all evil is the second amendment. All the other ones are good but the founding fathers blew it on the second one. It is Hollywoods attempt to help spur gun control. The problem with the film is that it mentions nothing about personal responsibility and this was done on purpose. If the matter of personal responsibility were brought up then Hollywood would be one of the biggest offenders. With the high body count films....including this one Hoolywood is selling violence gun violence for profit. If personal responsibility were brought up Hollywood would have to asks to many questions of itself. So it was dropped from the film entirely. So we have an exCIA sniper blaming everyone for his daughters death..despite the killer nevermind the he was the killer of many many people...it was his job.We also get the blurring and distorting of the second amendment which means that because our government has guns we should as well lest we become under the thumb of another tyrant. Much like King George was to the colonists. It does not mean only a militia should have guns which is what some would have you believe. When constitution was written nearly all citizens had guns...they had to they need to put food on the table by hunting for it. Gun violence is by and large committed by those who do not follow the law or have personal responsibility. That said I am all for gun locks. If you have kids in the home and your kid dies because you did not use one you should be punished.I think if this film would have added personal responsibility into the mix it would have been a much more interesting film. Instead Hollywood will not have anything to do with personal responsibility it is bad for the bottom line and looking in the mirror they my find that they are the biggest offenders when it comes to gun violence. Funny how when Oliver Stone was called on this very fact he brought up personal responsibility. Tickets please!".

It is however very annoying from start to finish because the premise is totally unrealistic and lacks any intelligence. I don't like movies where a bad guy or eventually not just bad Wesley the sniper has godlike control over his victims. Judging by the presence of a lot of comments with pro firearms opinions some people tend to think this movie tries to make a political statement against firearms. That is just foolish. Of course godlike control handed by a gun is THE ultimate way to market guns. Therefor rather than being an though original but failed attempt at an action movie without action or a thriller without thrills this is a far far far to long commercial for guns I say. Mabey there is some cleverness in this crap movie for passing as the opposite.It gets two stars because just one star is reserved for ultimate crap.".

Except Leonard Part 6 don't ask.I liked this movie not because of its actors who did better than I could have done or its script and dialogue that was better than I could have written or its overall production quality that revealed no amateurish mistakes which I'm sure I would have made. I liked this movie because it clearly did here in IMDB exactly what Joe wanted to have happen  we're debating the wisdom of the Second Amendment amongst other things only we're carefully wording our positions to sound like a critique of the movie or its plot or the script.To all of the other commentators out there please stop whining about whether it's Yet Another Liberal Film From Hollywood. You have as much right to say what you want as they do. I think even the nonliberals are a little desensitized to the everything in the mediamovie business is slanted to the left hew and cry. I know I am and I'm not a liberal but merely a thinking man or so I hope. Just make your case and stop worrying about Them.WARNING  SPOILERS AHEADJoe wants many things not just the second amendment debate. I don't know if my daughter was shot by a punk with a gun that I knew was almost handdelivered to him by another man that I knew was corrupt... I can't say that I wouldn't feel some desire to make the corrupt man pay for his sins with his life. True two wrongs don't make a right and it still wouldn't have brought back my daughter yet having the desire and acting on it are two different things. I'm sure I would want revenge though I may not act on it. Joe wanted revenge and clearly he was willing to act on it.Did nobody catch the subplot you know the subtle one that was sort of shoved into your face with the dialogue? That Victor Wallace was heavily guarded and a difficult target? That Liberty was the one that had the predictable schedule whereby Joe might use her to draw out Victor? That Victor wrote his wife's life off from the first moment and that Joe knew he would? That the only way Joe could get to Victor was to accuse him of being less than a man  NOT by using his love for his wife during her time of greatest peril.So why not a simple hostage scene which would have given us the paying audience even if you watched on Cinemax you paid for it with the desired FiorentinoSnipes combustion? Because Joe wanted his daughter's death to mean something more than simple revenge I guess. Liberty suggested to Joe would your daughter want this? But then would his daughter want another little girl to be the victim of another punk with a gun if there was something  ANYthing  that could be done to change it?Or for another reason had Joe merely kidnapped Liberty then Victor's henchmen and the henchmen of the people in Victor's back pocket would have eliminated Joe and Liberty and the supervisor of the building and the neighbors and anyone else standing too close... and the police who Joe alleged were corrupted by Victor would have blamed it all on Joe.Whether you agree with gun control or think that Joe was right when he said I'm could be just another legal gunowning American fighting the government's oppression of my freedom or think that the answer lies somewhere a field this movie regardless of it's overall viewability value should inspire thoughtsJoe hit where he could where it would hurt and where it would make a difference. He knew it would also cost him his life too many powerful people would want him dead anyway. But as he said It's a start.So the debate has been going on anyway. True it's people that kill people not guns not bullets not pits not your heritage to your murderous ancestors not teachers failing to enact safety measures or anything else ourselves.It's merely a sad truth that there are people who will kill other people using any means they can. What we have to do is find a way to better teach a wouldbe killer that they let themselves down the most if they kill whether by violating their own values or by letting down the people that matter to them.Joe took the violent man's way out. Funny thing  so did the American colonists when they decided to set themselves free. That second amendment was awfully important back then.So did the end justify the means? Joe said yes. What do you say?It's a movie without a definitive answer even if you think there was one but one with a definite result after the fact. I have to admire it for that.".

I know it's not right to compare the two but I can't help but draw on the similarities between the two.  Kiefer Sutherland was a psycho too but he tended to lose his cool once in a while where Snipes did not.  Not only was he in control of the situation but he was in control of himself as well.

	schema:reviewBody "Liberty Stands Still even though it wields considerable talent due to having starts such as Linda Fiorentino and Wesley Snipes is one of those kinds of projects that happens too frequently in Hollywood. The storyline is a blatant ripoff of the plot of the movie Phone Booth. It is very common given the lack of secrecy and discretion in Tinseltown and the necessity of promoting and publicizing scripts for there to be competing projects with the same or very similar plots. The plot for Phone Booth had been much publicized especially since Will Smith was originally pegged to star in the movie. Even with Smith not making the movie and Colin Farrell becoming the lead the plot was novel and well known enough for someone to write something very very similar.Both movies involve a lead character who spends nearly the entire film stuck on the telephone as a prisoner to a sniper who threatens to shoot the lead if they move. In Phone Booth Farrell plays a PR guy who is as cuddly as a piranha. His caller is obviously seeking revenge against him personally. In Liberty Stands Still Fiorentino plays Liberty the wife of a notorious arms dealer. Her tormentor played by Snipes is seeking revenge for the loss of a child killed by one of Liberty's husbands' guns. The only major differences are 1 we see Snipes throughout the movie while Kiefer Sutherland who plays the corresponding character in Phone Booth is unseen and 2 Snipes is using Fiorentino's character to get back at her husband not seeking revenge against her personally.Phone Booth is a much better movie although on its own Liberty Stands Still has some merit. But if you have to choose see Phone Booth first or only.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's not hard to believe why Liberty Stands Still' flopped on the big screen.  The techno music soundtrack was painful to listen to the plot was excessively boring and the anti2nd Amendment message that the movie attempted to convey was downright nauseating.  I will disregard the tedium of the film and the truly annoying techno music and focus on the film's ludicrous message.SPOILERS  Snipes's character Joe had a daughter who was killed by a fellow classmate with a gun.  Instead of going after the boy who killed his daughter Joe is able to forgive him and go after the real' villains the evil' gun manufacturer who in this movie is a megacorporation that has every politician in the USA in its pocket.  Joe terrorizes Liberty the wife of the president of the evil gun manufacturer with a military issued sniper rifle.  All Joe really wants is a national debate on the 2nd Amendment something that he and the director of this film clearly do not understand but he ends up murdering Liberty's husband a police officer and a reporter before killing himself.There were some truly laughable lines though.  After the media arrives Liberty tells Joe You know the NRA is going to spin this and say 'it's because people like you that justifies the rest of us in needing guns.'  Joe replies I was a law abiding citizen.  By their definition I have a right to own a gun.  I'm choosing to exercise that right.' I honestly have to say that this is the stupidest and most pathetic argument against the 2nd Amendment.  Sure as a law abiding citizen and I have the right to own a gun knife golf club and utilize such tools in a LAWFUL MANNER. However once I start shootingstabbingbeating people to death I cease to be a law abiding citizen' and turn into a CRIMINAL.  I guess the director of this film fails to understand this most obvious point.  In addition it's not the knife club or gun OR THEIR MANUFACTURERS that commits the crime It's the person who wielded these weapons.  The objects mentioned above are not capable of committing a crime inasmuch as they are inanimate.  The manufactures certainly should not be held responsible for crimes committed with tools that they created because doing so would impugn the whole concept of individual responsibility.  If I trip over my own untied shoe laces and crack my head open on a tiled floor it is certainly not the manufacturer of the shoes or the contractor who installed the tiles who is to blame.  Still the film completely ignores these most elementary facts and equates the gun manufactures as responsible for the death of Joe's daughter.  Sadly such demented logic is all too present in today's society smokers suing cigarette companies for getting lung cancer fat people suing fast food restaurants for getting obesityrelated health problems etc and this film just coaxes such idiocy.Pitifully it is an all too common theme among radical leftwingers to attack the 2nd amendment.  Movies like this demonstrate the unintelligent logic of such antigun's rights arguments and the fact that this movie did so poorly in the box office sheds some light that the public is not dumb enough to buy into such nonsense.".

The techno music soundtrack was painful to listen to the plot was excessively boring and the anti2nd Amendment message that the movie attempted to convey was downright nauseating.  I will disregard the tedium of the film and the truly annoying techno music and focus on the film's ludicrous message.SPOILERS  Snipes's character Joe had a daughter who was killed by a fellow classmate with a gun.  Instead of going after the boy who killed his daughter Joe is able to forgive him and go after the real' villains the evil' gun manufacturer who in this movie is a megacorporation that has every politician in the USA in its pocket.  Joe terrorizes Liberty the wife of the president of the evil gun manufacturer with a military issued sniper rifle.

He excelled in the Waterdance along with Eric Stoltz and William Forsythe and he does a pretty good job in this film as well.The reason why I think many of my friends were disappointed with this film is because it was labeled as an Action movie by the film company. Nothing could be more wrong. It's a political drama. I actually think it would work extremely well as a stage play given the fact that it's set with a few exceptions in a secluded area with very few people in the cast. A funnysmartcreative thing is that the main characters never really have a direct dialogue face to face.

Note the lack of violence and the theme that the most improbable pair of people may just be able to find that they have something in common.  It's not Oscar materialaccept it for what it is and have a laugh. Oh yes Nick Scotti ain't bad to look at either.";

	schema:reviewBody "KISS ME GUIDO Aspect ratio 1.851Sound format UltraStereoWriterdirector Tony Vitale's comedy of gay manners is lightweight inoffensive stuff distinguished by vivid performances and smart dialogue but the film refuses to take risks and almost succumbs to blandness as a result. Ultracute Nick Scotti is the ultramacho ItalianAmerican stud who due to circumstances beyond his control finds himself rooming with ultragay Anthony Barrile. Thereafter the film basically examines the ways in which these two disparate personalities attempt to reconcile themselves to one another and how friendships are formed under duress. Gay viewers attuned to Vitale's sensibilities will find themselves laughing out loud at regular intervals while everyone else will probably smile politely admiring the witty oneliners while never really 'getting' the joke. Everything hinges on the appeal of the central characters and they're a bit of a mixed bag Despite his roughhewn exterior Scotti's character comes across as too much of a nice guy to really pose a threat to anyone  gay or straight  but his performance is so natural and strong that he simply acts poor Barrile right off the screen! Scotti also has the distinct advantage of being devastatingly beautiful which Vitale exploits in several amusing ways especially a dream sequence inspired by THE SOUND OF MUSIC!. Anthony DeSando plays Scotti's brother with an even greater degree of exaggerated studliness like a firecracker going off on the 4th of July while Craig Chester enjoys himself as Barrile's camp best friend. The film is charming safe and very watchable  and Scotti's only 'gay' kiss in the entire picture is with the one person you'd least expect. Enjoy...NB. The movie inspired a shortlived TV series Some of My Best Friends 2001 with Jason Bateman as the gay guy and Danny Nucci as his ultrahunky straight roommate.".

All these negatives still do not outweigh the fact that there is a good movie here waiting to be snazzed up into something played more into the galaxy of LA CAGE AUX FOLLES or PRISCILLA . As a low budget NY gayish camp Italian comedy it is simple and funny but seems like a first draft that was made instead of reworking and reinventing and then snaring a better budget and bigger mindset. I like KISS ME GUIDO enough to give it a peck not a smooch. Maybe Tony Vitale can do as I suggest and boost the whole thing up a few octaves and make it bigger and louder and funnier and genuinely raucous.

	schema:headline " Kaurismki's hilariously absurd surrealist romp";
	schema:reviewBody "Calamari Union 1985 was the second featurelength film from Finish auteur Aki Kaurismki following on from his somewhat dour contemporaryset adaptation of Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment 1983. Right away Kaurismki is showing his extraordinary range as a filmmaker moving away from the low key minimalist realism of Crime and Punishment to the surreal improvisational black and white playfulness of the film in question. This sense of imagination and ability to move from one stylistic reference point to the next  all the while retaining his deadpan style and coolly ironic use of character and dialog  would be further reinforced over subsequent films such as Shadows in Paradise 1986 Hamlet Goes Business 1987 and Leningrad Cowboys Go America 1989. Though Calamari Union lacks the more refined and iconic Kaurismki style of those particular films it does show his early interest in surrealism broad absurdist humour and an ensemble setting.Like many of his films such as the aforementioned Leningrad Cowboys and his underrated masterpiece Ariel 1988 the plot of Calamari Union is episodic and picaresque following the misadventures of fifteen men fourteen of them named Frank Merciless and an idiot manchild named Pekka who one day decide to leave behind the hopeless working class world of Eira and quest to the nearmythical borough of Kallio. As you can possibly deduce from the description Calamari Union is not necessarily a film to be taken entirely seriously with Kaurismki taking the silliest plot and the most bizarre of caricatures and creating this wandering tale filled with strange scenes disconnected vignettes slapstick humour and even a rock n' roll performance piece! In the past Kaurismki has claimed that this is the only film he's ever directed whilst being either drunk or hungover which does makes sense. Then again knowing Kaurismki's fondness for exaggeration and selfdeprecation it would be best not to read too much into this. Although the film is obviously not intended to be taken on a completely serious level that's not to say that it isn't open to deeper more analytical interpretations.For me there's a definite air of Luis Buuel here  both in terms of the plot and I suppose some of the more subtextual ideologies  not to mention the clear influence of Bertrand Blier's fantastic film Buffet froid 1979 which follows a similarly episodic tale of strange men having strange adventures. Calamari Union perhaps isn't as great as that particular film though it does show Kaurismki and his crew to be on top creative form filming in luminous black and white as a nod to the French New Wave and creating a great atmosphere on an obviously limited budget. In fact it feels more like a first film than Crime and Punishment with the highly original idiosyncratic story small cast of central characters inventive use of sound location and cinematography and low budget production all adding to its rough and unpolished charms. It's still unknown what Kaurismki's actual intentions were with this film whether he simply wanted to produce something quite silly and outlandish as a bit of fun with his friends or whether there is some hidden depth to the film just waiting to be discovered and reinterpreted.Obviously I have my own ideas. To me the film can be seen as a representation of the cycle of life with the characters emerging from the womblike warmth of their local pub and beginning their bizarre journey into life before breaking away meeting new people forming relationships making decisions and finally dropping dead.

	onyx:emotionText "Calamari Union 1985 was the second featurelength film from Finish auteur Aki Kaurismki following on from his somewhat dour contemporaryset adaptation of Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment 1983. Right away Kaurismki is showing his extraordinary range as a filmmaker moving away from the low key minimalist realism of Crime and Punishment to the surreal improvisational black and white playfulness of the film in question. This sense of imagination and ability to move from one stylistic reference point to the next  all the while retaining his deadpan style and coolly ironic use of character and dialog  would be further reinforced over subsequent films such as Shadows in Paradise 1986 Hamlet Goes Business 1987 and Leningrad Cowboys Go America 1989. Though Calamari Union lacks the more refined and iconic Kaurismki style of those particular films it does show his early interest in surrealism broad absurdist humour and an ensemble setting.Like many of his films such as the aforementioned Leningrad Cowboys and his underrated masterpiece Ariel 1988 the plot of Calamari Union is episodic and picaresque following the misadventures of fifteen men fourteen of them named Frank Merciless and an idiot manchild named Pekka who one day decide to leave behind the hopeless working class world of Eira and quest to the nearmythical borough of Kallio. As you can possibly deduce from the description Calamari Union is not necessarily a film to be taken entirely seriously with Kaurismki taking the silliest plot and the most bizarre of caricatures and creating this wandering tale filled with strange scenes disconnected vignettes slapstick humour and even a rock n' roll performance piece! In the past Kaurismki has claimed that this is the only film he's ever directed whilst being either drunk or hungover which does makes sense. Then again knowing Kaurismki's fondness for exaggeration and selfdeprecation it would be best not to read too much into this. Although the film is obviously not intended to be taken on a completely serious level that's not to say that it isn't open to deeper more analytical interpretations.For me there's a definite air of Luis Buuel here  both in terms of the plot and I suppose some of the more subtextual ideologies  not to mention the clear influence of Bertrand Blier's fantastic film Buffet froid 1979 which follows a similarly episodic tale of strange men having strange adventures. Calamari Union perhaps isn't as great as that particular film though it does show Kaurismki and his crew to be on top creative form filming in luminous black and white as a nod to the French New Wave and creating a great atmosphere on an obviously limited budget. In fact it feels more like a first film than Crime and Punishment with the highly original idiosyncratic story small cast of central characters inventive use of sound location and cinematography and low budget production all adding to its rough and unpolished charms. It's still unknown what Kaurismki's actual intentions were with this film whether he simply wanted to produce something quite silly and outlandish as a bit of fun with his friends or whether there is some hidden depth to the film just waiting to be discovered and reinterpreted.Obviously I have my own ideas. To me the film can be seen as a representation of the cycle of life with the characters emerging from the womblike warmth of their local pub and beginning their bizarre journey into life before breaking away meeting new people forming relationships making decisions and finally dropping dead. You could also see the film as a treatise on the notion of individuality with the earlier scenes showing the group to be very much of a singular union  both anonymous to themselves and to the audience  and all with the same goals and desires. Eventually as they continue their journey they discover individual interests and passageways through life until they finally come to form their own unique personality. Failing that it really could be just a simple work of surrealist fun with no greater meaning or interpretation hidden beneath the madness and often hilarious scenes of ridiculous frivolity.Regardless of this Calamari Union is still something of a great film perhaps not as good as later films by Kaurismki such as Hamlet Goes Business Ariel I Hired a Contract Killer 1990 and The Man without a Past 2002 but nonetheless a good place to start for those new to his particular blend of bold unique and always eccentric world cinema.";

	schema:reviewBody "The others do a good job gushing about the movie. Sure we're fans and bound to like the movie more than the usual fare but those looking for an original and thrilling movie experience this will shock and amaze. The Firefly world introduced a fantasy home for many of us with characters we truly cared about and dilemmas we could get behind. The best way to describe it is to take the best aspects of the Han Solo elements of the original Star Wars and build a world around that. There's no grand theme or clear cut good and evil. There's just a band of fugitives trying to make their way in a dangerous sky. It's something folks can relate to although most of us won't be in a space battle or fighting psychotic creatures anytime soon. The point of the name Serenity is the name of the ship though in a deeper sense that's what our characters are in search of. Finding freedom and a home and that's what the ship represents to them and to the fans. So you understand why so many are so excited about this dinky little scifi flick. The movie captures that beautiful feeling but takes us on a ride that there's no turning back from. In my opinion the one thing that makes for a truly GREAT movie is if you walk out of the theater a different person than when you walked in. This movie takes you on such a journey I didn't know if I would leave the theater at all. Sure the visual effects are stunning but even the unfinished effects I saw meant nothing to me because it was the characters I cared about and note that the digitally created ship itself is one of them and I cared just as much for that than any of them. The humor is probably better than anything in the theaters this year and the action is even greater. My screening actually came a week after Episode 3 was released and I immediately washed my hands of Mr Lucas and months later when I saw Fantastic 4... well let's not even talk about that one.This movie really does have something for everyone and even in the core of the geek fandom the range of people is total  men and women split it at least 5050 ubergeeks and cool types and a surprising amount of attractive people of all ages. Seriously though don't trust the rants of the fans. Check out the movie for yourself. Give it an honest chance and I promise you will be taken on a journey that will turn you into a fan as well.".

The plot may be confusing at first but when the second half of the film starts there are no lingering questions and a pantload of great action bits and oneliners.

I'm a huge fan of Joss Whedon's work was a loyal follower of 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' and 'Angel' and really got into 'Firefly' on which this movie is based and the whole browncoat phenomenon as well. So I was you might just say pretty much predestined to like this movie. But not so. Whedonfans are a pretty critical bunch most of the time and no one went into this thing with higher expectations than us. And to have those expectations be met in such a way as Serenity does is very special indeed.The movie itself has all the elements that make Joss Whedon's work so very unique. The sense of humor the wonderfully realized characters and their strong interpersonal bonds masterful dialogue and emotional pain everything is present. I laughed I cried I pretty much went through the entire emotional spectrum watching this movie and that's not something you might expect from 'just another scifi movie'.While I'm writing this the release of Serenity is still a few weeks ahead but I got to see the finished version of the movie with a selected group of Dutch Firefly fans in an exclusive prescreening. Afterwards the atmosphere was strange subdued. It was almost as if everyone had survived some kind of big disaster together and we were too stunned to really say much. And I say that in the kindest possible way. Honestly.If you're not into Whedon's work or even if you're not into scifi in general this is gonna be a movie worth watching. Ignore the whole 'geekmovie' hype that'll undoubtedly surround the release. Ignore the hype created by Whedonfans such as myself. Simply go see it with an open mind and be prepared to be blown away. Because when Whedon works his magic everyone has to pay attention.This movie is truly a leaf on the wind. Watch it soar!".

I think this was necessary within the movie and part of an evolution from the TV show to the big screen the movie takes place 6 months after the last episode Objects in Space. Things have changed.There is a higher action and violence level in this duh it's a movie not on TV and we get some major revelations about the world which some who saw it with me already don't like. There are some MAJOR events that affect the characters and I wasn't totally happy with them  shocked is the word. But this is Joss's world and his characters and he tells the stories he wants to tell. He doesn't get bound up in hurting our feelings he just tells it like it is. I believe he did say that this was the hardest thing he'd ever had to write.At least one person at our screening was a Firefly virgin and he said that he liked it. I hope people who have no exposure to the show will be able to see this and enjoy it. Our big damn heroes come across well and I hope this will get them some welldeserved exposure. This is a noholds barred bigtime actionadventure scifi story bold and raw and set in a world unlike anything portrayed in SF before well except for Firefly.

We thought the oneliners were kind of cheesy the acting a bit poor and we weren't at all impressed except for maybe the fight scenes with River. The cowboy theme music didn't sit well with us either.However I have heard only excellent things about the series Firefly and the following movie Serenity. Were we missing something? We even watched Serenity again giving it a second chance. It still didn't click with us. I was very confused.We were going to give up when a friend loaned us the Firefly DVDs. OK I'll give it another shot since clearly we must be missing something! And that did it.After just a couple episodes I was really enjoying myself. When I rewatched Serenity again after seeing the TV series I thought it was excellent. I really appreciated it. The characters were more 3D the oneliners were amusing the music didn't bother me a bit I was starting to like it and I really liked all the nuances from the actors I changed my mind  not bad acting. I felt like I knew the characters and story so much better and I really loved how they tied some loose ends together. It was also nice to see the characters again after the series ended even on DVD.So bottom line  if you didn't watch Firefly you probably won't get it may not like it very much and you might be confused why there are such great reviews.

	schema:reviewBody "I watched the whole DVD set of Firefly a few months ago and was hoping that this movie would be an improvement in terms of scale and effects. Sadly I was disappointed. Firefly aka Serenity is a TV series and should remain a TV series.The first hour was so slow and uninteresting that I nearly walked out.

Unfortunately the movie didn't live up to the trailer and was mediocre at best. None of the elements that made the series so enjoyable are present. Gone are deep character development and the lively interaction among the crew members. Book and Inara are really just cameoswhile Kaylee Wash and even Simon have little to do. The heart of FIREFLY was the relationship between Simon and River but it's little explored here. Humor and hints of romance are for the most part absent. The plot is actionheavy and really is just the crew trying to escape from Reavers. The entire rationale behind the Alliance's desperate need to eliminate River Tam is uninteresting and the explanation for the existence of the Reavers is truly lame. It was much more interesting to have the Reavers be humans who'd gone wild on the outer rim. I kept waiting for the twobytwo handsofblue creeps to show up but they never did. Finally the operative's bizarre aboutface at the end makes no sense. Seeing this poor feature film makes me love the FIREFLY series even more. I was hooked at the end of the first half when Mal opens up the crate carrying River. There will be no trilogy here.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm a fan of the original Firefly series and had high hopes for Serenity based on the reviews. Sadly it was not nearly as good as I expected.What rubbed me the wrong way?  Waaaaay too much emphasis on combat starting with the opening scene. The fun of Firefly was always in the decisiveness and determination of Mal and crew in the face of a hostile universe. The movie reduced that spirit to a series of action movie clichs  the worst of which being the revelation that River is not just a troubled psychic but is also Jr. Kickboxing Champion of the galaxy. By the time the climactic battles rolled around I was thoroughly bored with the fighting. River singlehandedly slaughtering a horde of Reavers was just silly. Mal against the assassin was marginally better but still clichd and unbelievable. Actions were too hypedup and extreme. I understand that the characters have to be punched up a bit to make the leap from TV to a movie but it was taken too far. Mal threatening to kill his crew if they don't help him travel through Reaver territory? River kicking her brother in throat because she thought he might deactivate her? Please. And Wash's death was just ridiculous and unnecessary. Even the special effects were overdone  they would have been better off just burning half the FX budget for this film in a big bonfire. Plot holes galore. It's easy to overlook plot holes if a movie is good enough but in this case the holes threatened to unravel the whole ball of yarn. The Alliance knows that Mal will seek shelter with Book or at other safehavens so they wipe them all out... but they don't stick around to greet Serenity when it arrives! How stupid is that? No really. The Reavers all live in a small clump of ships in the middle of nowhere but Mal can't detour Serenity a few kilometers around them in order to get from A to B? Space is a big place folks but the makers of this movie don't want you to think about that. Half the plot elements that weren't full of holes were just incomprehensible. Can anyone tell me what exactly killed Wash? It seems to be the remains of a Reaver ship but there's no way to tell. Or is it an Alliance ship? I had trouble caring. When Mal brings the entire Reaver fleet to Mr. Universe's planet is he doing it on purpose? Did he expect to find the Alliance waiting for him? The answer to such key questions seems to both yes and no. Much of the movie was in such a frenetic hurry to move forward that it couldn't be bothered to make sense. Simplistic. After the failure of Firefly the movie was obviously dumbeddown for mass consumption. The revelations about River the Reavers Miranda etc. were all disappointingly straightforward. The interesting relationship between Kaylee and the Doctor was reduced to a series of sex jokes. The only character who held up well through the entire movie was Jayne since he still works well in a straightforward shootemup like this. The buildup of the secret of Miranda was matched in lameness only by the tooeasy revelation of the same secret about 15 minutes later.I really wanted to like this movie but I walked out feeling that I had watched something that was 1 part Firefly mixed with at least 2 parts conventional Hollywood movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have to say while reading all of the negative reviews here I was merely confirmed in my observation that most people are idiots. Quite frankly if you don't get this movie good on yer go back to watching the standard monosyllabic fare. What this movie provided was a nonstandard shadesofgray character study. The focus was not on bigbudget effects or glitzy bits of teenybopper fluff. It was about a story. It reminded me of how I felt when I watched the REAL Star Wars not the fake stuff that is out now. People have different ways of handling things that challenge them mentally. Some are able to incorporate the new perspectives into their lives while others call it boring or seen it when all they are doing is protecting their two fragile brain cells from expansion.How can I make such bold perhaps even abrasive statements? Well let's look at the movie itself. It starts off with a brief recap to get those people that had not seen the TV series up to speed. This was brief and incorporated a look at River's past which was well done. It then moves on to show the rescue seen from the perspective of the Operative. I will concur with those that argue he is not a cookiecutter villain. He is not a black and white archetype. He is a believer but is also exceptionally selfconsistent with his beliefs. He is doing what he does for an altruistic in his mind goal completely devoid of ego. There is no room for selfaggrandizement we see no hubristic monologues just a singlemindedness of purpose to create what he is told will be a perfect world.That brings us to the crew themselves. Let's get one thing straight though many have said they are by default good because of their eventual choices what makes them interesting is that they are for the most part amoral. They are Privateers exsoldiers from a cause that was just true and pure and that lost to the good guys. Each of them is a part of the crew because of their past Mal who used to have something to believe in now just believes in his ship and his crew. The vacuum of space is cold and there is no room for anything that does not keep his crew alive. Some have argued that he is good because he did not kick River and the Doc off on some backwater in the beginning but I think it was mostly pragmatic. Here he has a doctor that can patch his crew a valuable skillset and a girl that is obviously worth something to the Alliance worth keeping on general principles. This is not to say that he is not conflicted. Mal is someone who WANTS to do the right thing and we see that when he can he does. But he is not some goodietwoshoes paladin bunniesandduckies character that will ALWAYS do the right thing.The interactions of Mal and the Operative are interesting because they ARE both very similar. They are both living in the interstices of society the Operative realizes that he has no place in the polite fairplay world that he is striving to resurrect while Mal is a scofflaw neither are fighting or living for normal motivations. It also shows that both are capable of change which pretty much knocks the normal Hollywood plot line off the tracks in most movies people will never change and good defeats evil then comes home and snogs the prom queen. Mal and his crew are given a choice and have to each come to terms with what they are really fighting for. It requires them to strip off the veneer of being privateers and allows them to recapture their original selves. I am simplifying greatly here.Ultimately when Mal defeats the Operative he spares his life showing us that Mal is not the typical hero and that he also recognizes the bigger picture the Operative is not the villain merely another dupe of a huge machine that wants to control people because it knows better. This is another nontypical outcome and delves into another level of complexity.In closing I want to acknowledge that this is not intended to sway those that don't like this movie. Barring a serious shift in perspective they never will like it. And that is fine wonderful actually. This movie did not compromise its core message to appeal to a wide audience it did not focus on flash over substance. It simply told a story that makes you think.".

But he is not some goodietwoshoes paladin bunniesandduckies character that will ALWAYS do the right thing.The interactions of Mal and the Operative are interesting because they ARE both very similar. They are both living in the interstices of society the Operative realizes that he has no place in the polite fairplay world that he is striving to resurrect while Mal is a scofflaw neither are fighting or living for normal motivations. It also shows that both are capable of change which pretty much knocks the normal Hollywood plot line off the tracks in most movies people will never change and good defeats evil then comes home and snogs the prom queen. Mal and his crew are given a choice and have to each come to terms with what they are really fighting for. It requires them to strip off the veneer of being privateers and allows them to recapture their original selves. I am simplifying greatly here.Ultimately when Mal defeats the Operative he spares his life showing us that Mal is not the typical hero and that he also recognizes the bigger picture the Operative is not the villain merely another dupe of a huge machine that wants to control people because it knows better. This is another nontypical outcome and delves into another level of complexity.In closing I want to acknowledge that this is not intended to sway those that don't like this movie. Barring a serious shift in perspective they never will like it. And that is fine wonderful actually. This movie did not compromise its core message to appeal to a wide audience it did not focus on flash over substance. It simply told a story that makes you think.";

Just wish I knew what they were saying when they speak Chinese! Watching this got me into Firefly. It's such a shame it was cancelled. Love the crew the universe joss Whedon created and the little details like their slang. The ship is not too slick and perfect which adds a great deal of character and really enables viewers to identify more with the crew a group of underdogs in a tumbledown ship trying to evade the authorities. The Reavers are frankly rather scary. Overall this film comes off very well you really feel the chemistry between the crew as well. Brilliant!".

From the opening sequence to the last frame this is a perfect movie. Citizen Kane watch your back. This is flawless. It should be studied in film school and buried in a time capsule with the original Brylcreem formula. The recycling of an already perfect ensemble cast from Firefly was expected but the addition of Chiwetel Ejiofor who steals every frame of every scene he is in was inspired.

There is even a brief intro that catches up those who haven't seen Firefly. Great movie. What I really liked about this movie is that the characters are all so colorful and textured I believe this universe that Joss Wheedan has created could become the next big franchise like Star Trek. My recommendation is see it at least three times and take all your friends with you each time that way we can get the trilogy made.".

	schema:reviewBody "I tried desperately to avoid getting my hopes elevated beyond reason but it was to no avail. I have watched the entire Firefly series twice over the last two years and had always hoped that it would somehow return. Firefly was one of the most recent examples of an intelligent challenging scifi show getting mismarketed and canceled by network TV. Firefly was a western adventure set in space with a compelling plot and bold very likable characters. Serenity is its reprise in a fullfeature film. Still Serenity endeavors to introduce nonfans to its characters and major story arc in a very clever and subtle way so that fans and nonfans alike can appreciate it completely. Those familiar with the saga of River and her alliance pursuers will enjoy the consistency with which the characters are portrayed and the development of her character into what she could have realized had the show been permitted to fully mature.Before I go much further I should state that I am no Joss Whedon fan  as I have found most of his TV work trite and overhyped. Firefly earned my respect for Joss within a few minutes of the first episode and I now watch him in my peripheral vision  just in case he does something this original and clever again.Serenity is a Firefly class space transport ship operating illegally on the outskirts of Alliance civilization  the lawless edges of a solar system with many inhabited terraformed planets. Captain Malcolm Reynolds is stuck between reavers  cannibalistic semihuman sociopaths who prey on unsuspecting ships in this outer realm and the alliance from which he and his crew have been running for months.The focus of this movie is the resolution of a story arc first developed in Firefly  that of River Tamm and her brother Serenity's ship doctor though it focuses on the entire ensemble cast in much the same way the TV show did  allowing each to fully and complexly develop. I will give a bit of the backstory here though you don't need it to appreciate the film.Mal is an internally conflicted man with a strong sense of justice and a big warm heart which he shields with a frigid philosophy and an attempted stoicism. He and his first officer Zoey were part of a defeated rebellion against The Alliance a federally organized empire of fascist urbanites reminiscent of the society of Gattaca. With the war lost Zoey married to his pilot Wash a thug Jayne a young prodigy engineer with limited social graces Kaylee an aristocratic prostitute Inara and a few mysterious fugitives Shepherd Book Simon and River he has set out to smuggle and thieve his way through the outer territories disrupting and avoiding the alliance all along the way. The crew of Serenity have given up civilization as the cost of freedom.River and Simon had begun as passengers but Simon's medical skills and the fact that the Alliance seemed to have an irreversible interest in either killing or kidnapping Simon's sister River gave Reynolds reason to become interested in them. After a while it became clear that River had been the subject of a variety of experiments involving violence and telepathy conducted by The Alliance. First appearing to be dangerously insane River became more and more recognizable as a weapon.The characterizations in Serenity are very strong and the cast is topnotch. Although I was never entirely thrilled with her in Firefly though I always respected her talent Summer Glau River really steals the show with her powerful evocative performance. The script and story are excellent though I felt the pace of the dialog could have been slowed a bit for the sake of dramatic quality. There is plenty of action in this film though it does not fall into the trap that most recent scifi has of losing its plot intelligence and characterizations in boring and absurd action sequences. The cinematography though not as revolutionary as that used in Firefly is excellent. My only disappointments  and they are mild at worst  are that I thought the plot could have been a little more complex original and intelligent giving the film the intense drama that some of the best episodes of the series had such as Bushwhacked and the fact that excellent original theme song for the show did not appear anywhere in the film.. The villain of the film was interesting and well developed but I would have preferred a few minutes less action and a little more character development for him.Nevertheless I recommend Serenity highly to sci fi fans  particularly those who want more of a human story than Star Trek has offered lately and might be looking for something less soapy and intense and more fun than the excellent new BSG. it really does not matter if you have seen the series. This film stands on its own.".

After seeing the preview however I turned away from the little pirated copy on the little TV turned to my cousin who was with me and said I have no idea what that film is about but I want to see it. Unfortunately I was a little busy that summer and didn't get around to seeing it until a good while later. I saw the first 10 minutes of it on Youtube and was hooked. I was obsessed and so excited to see it I could have used a change of shorts.I Netflix'd it immediately and got it a few days later.From beginning to end it's not only amusing and entertaining but it is a beautiful film to look at. It's a flawless little bit of visual stylings that you believe. The style and world or rather universe is created so perfectly that you believe that in the future people will live like it's the wild west.This frontier lifestyle just makes so much sense and is a fresh new look at the future. With the regional colloquialisms and lingo Joss Whedon really has created an entire universe for us to enjoy.The story follows Malcom Mal Reynolds and the crew of the Firefly class ship called Serenity. Mal and his crew of questionable reputation Especially Jayne Cobb Adam Baldwin who is more or less a mercinary who will take any job they can find throughout the 'verse both legal and illegal.The government refered to as The Alliance or Parliament sends an Agent with no rank or name to hunt down Simon Serenity's resident Doctor and his sister River who is the real target. Why is River Tam the 16 year old sister of a Brilliant alliance Doctor gone fugitive such a threat to the worlds of the alliance? What could this little girl have that's so important that they'd ruthlessly kill anyone in their path? The story is just filled with unpredictable twists and turns. Every time you expect them to go in the usual direction that action movies go they turn tail and run the other way.One of the men Mal works for put it best You're unpredictable Mal. You run when you ought to fight fight when you ought to deal. While this may be a spoiler I'll leave you this hint. The amazing thing about Joss Whedon is he's not afraid to cripple maim or kill off characters. With the entire alliance fleet after this one unarmed cargo ship how many of the Serenity crew will make it out alive? Fans of Firefly will love this Sci Fi western and people new to the franchise had best get their copy. When you're done with the movie there's a whole series you didn't know about called Firefly which I also highly recommend. Hell pick up the series and then watch the movie as it was meant to be! It'll not be time wasted.".

Thats all i really knew.WHat Joss brings in Serenity is a vision of the future not quite like any other. I mean we've all seen the evilfuturegovernmentversus cool rebels plot but what he haven't seen or realized is that in the future people will still have the same struggles particularly emotional ones. Maybe we wont have aliens or teleportation or lightsabers. Maybe people will still have trouble telling the people that we love how we feel or trouble with marriages struggles with faith maybe even have the same personality quirkstraits. The dialog is beautiful and crackling and the characters are extremely well developed. The film shows how genre bending can be done and if you saw the series the film is likely to make someone cry like i did the first time i saw it.I think that if i hadn't seen this movie which confirmed my status as a serenity fanatic called a browncoat i would be a completely different person. I would look at movies i watch or write very differently look at drama and acting very differently speak very differently and would just be a different thinker and person. Kinda like what the muppets did to my imagination and sense of entertainment and life.This movie is one of the coolest smartest wittiest most exciting movie in a long time and will appeal to any fan of movies or the TV show but you might want to watch the TV show first.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a stark dark unconventional and unsettling story film. But in the context of that chaos what it means to be human is beautifully developed. The story revolves around a single French family thrown into the countryside in some postapocalyptic period. The producer uses an almost documentary approach to the story. This reveals to us the rather drastic and desperate nature of their circumstances but unexpectedly also reveals things like kindness to strangers forbearance with other's weaknesses fortitude and reaching out. These positive human traits are contrasted with those of the stubborn uncaring adolescent boy who would rather hang off in the wood and venture in only to steal what he wants... the lone Wolf. Its a very engaging and moving work. At one point I found myself in tears at one particularly heartrending scene. Humanity at a time of great stress is poignantly pictured both in its strengths and in its Sin. The acting is simply incredible especially the mother and her younger daughter. Unlike the Hollywood films this film offers no magic solutions no instant fixes no easy outs. Goverments have failed and now common people are paying the price. Society has been reduced to the lowest common denominators. But the film seems to conclude with the idea that recovery is possible through cooperation and sacrifice. There is some closure to the family's immediate straits. This film has the power to make us think about what we are doing to each other and what might possibly happen if we let them go over the edge............".

The plot is totally different from the postapocalyptic view of Hollywood movies and there are scenes hard to be seen. Isabelle Huppert and Anas Demoustier have extraordinary performances.

It seems they feel that this movie shows us decadent westerners what living in more impoverished and exploited parts of the globe is like. Well it's a very fine film but that certainly not what it's about. To reduce every artistic expression to world affairs is a rather shameless exposition of western selfguilt and political correctness. Now there is enough to be ashamed about but why should that always be connected to artistic expressions of western artists. Please stop politicizing everything. Le Temps du Loup is not about the third world anyone who thinks that third world countries look any thing like what is happening in Haneke's film is out of hisher mind. News flash people in the third world actually life daily relatively stable lives notwithstanding rampant poverty and high levels of violence and unsafety. What we see in Le Temps du Loup is what Hobbes means by State of Nature a lawless nondominated society. What Haneke shows in minute detail and in that lies his greatest accomplishment is that human connection trust and intimacy is always in some senses based on dominating practices that stabilize the uncertainties and risks of interacting and competing with others in a shared social environment. The ambiguous status of the Koslowski character is a case in point are his actions justifiable or is he just an exploitative oppressor? Same for the horse but now in a more confronting way because the line between fact and fiction is crossed. So Temps du Loup is an analysis of human cohabitation of any human society.

	schema:reviewBody "If at the start of Time of the Wolf you are aware of Michael Haneke's 1997 shocker Funny Games you may believe that this film will be treading similar grounds. Opening the film the 2 point 4 children Laurent family arrive at their holiday shack in the wilderness of an undisclosed location. On entering they are confronted with a man holding a shotgun towards them his own family peering from behind him. After demanding that they hand over any goods they have he shoots the father Daniel Duval dead. However unlike the familial hostages of Funny Games the remaining Laurent's make their way to a local for help and the audience is startled by the matriarch Anne's Isabelle Huppert admission that they had buried the father. We are certainly not in the regular world this place is different a point that is further exacerbated when Anne is asked if she is aware of what is going on.Time of the Wolf is unfamiliar territory concerning its central concept of a postapocalyptic landscape. Whilst the catalyst for this disaster ? is never revealed there is no indication of the generic science fiction tropes of disaster. No zombiealien or natural catastrophe's are highlighted. The ambiguity of the nature of the devastation creates a tension that is completely absent from the ordinary explicit films of this nature. As the family trudge their way through the countryside they cross the distinct furnaces of bonfires sometimes the only light source in the darkness  at one time the legs of burning cow carcasses protrude from a fire. Their final stop a building inhabited by survivors waiting for a train that may never arrive.Perhaps Time of the Wolf states more about the consumer society we live in today. The shackles of consumption and the artefacts of the modern world become useless in this context. Jewels and watches are pointless commodities whilst lighters water and clothing are worthy of exchange. Maybe the apocalypse is the result of dwindling resources a reality that Earth will have to face in the future perhaps the near where agriculture manufacture and natural fuel have all but disappeared. With this lack of resources comes the desperation of the people bringing out the worst in humanity. The strong male figures take control whilst women are often reduced to trading in sex and are largely marginalised in the fold. Our natural affinity as pack animals falls apart and xenophobia erupts targeting anything that might break the monotony and fraught situation.With a distilled colour pallet often only lit with fire and the bleak wilderness of fog Haneke creates a realistic world heaving with pain and anxiety. His precise camera movements and compositions frame the disaster as beauty. Time of the Wolf would probably not suit the regular scifi frequenter of postapocalypse it does not present itself with the same signifiers and does not portray the Hollywood hero or saviour and it absolutely does not offer the resolution that most would need to be satisfied with. This is the hopelessness of humanity in all of its desperation with the modern luxuries obliterated and reduced by the lack of necessities. But with this bleakness comes horror and the complexities of humanity. It is a hard view but one that rewards in aesthetics and the confluence of characters.www.thewrathofblog.blogspot.com".

Some sort of cataclysm has occurred  all we really know is that most water supplies are tainted  and we follow a mother and her two children the father is with them when the film opens as they vie for survival. Life now is all about the few material possessions you have preserved. You try to hold onto a semblance of your values but they seem mostly vestigial. Isabelle Huppert returns as Haneke's star. She and her children are the point around which everything happens but they are just three people amongst many. The young girl who plays her daughter Anas Demoustier gives a particularly amazing performance. We talked ed on the Classic Film forum of IMDb last week or perhaps the week before about the directors influenced by Hitchcock and those influenced by Bresson and Huppert in an interview explains how both directors have influenced Haneke. It's definitely true. Haneke uses suspense in a much different manner than Hitchcock but the devices are surprisingly similar.".

	schema:reviewBody "A French woman Isabelle Huppert and her two young children struggle for survival shortly after an unidentified apocalypse. This is a very different sort of postapocalyptic filmit is very minimalist and dramatic. The most fascinating aspect is that whatever happened to the world is never explained or even discussed by the characters. The only thing they know is that uncontaminated water is scarce and personal belongings are very valuable. They are living in the present fighting for survival. The characters are often devoid of extreme emotion during the crises they face in the film so the viewer assumes that whatever happened that changed the world must have been graphic and brutal.Haneke is an exceptional filmmaker and has quite an eye. The combination of lingering camerawork and lack of score create an uneasy tension. Some might argue that the movie is boring because there isn't much action but I thought it was visually stunning. The movie attempts to be about postapocalypse social struggle and powerincluding conflict between different nationalities and gendersbut it could have been more successful in doing this. The acting is outstanding especially by Huppert and the actress that plays her daughter. Even though she gets cobilling Beatrice Dalle is only in the film for a bit but she does have a Betty Bluestyle freakout. I recommend this to anyone who likes postapocalypse movies and is interested in seeing a hauntingly realistic one.My Rating 710".

	schema:reviewBody "If you want to believe that you are a superior form of humanity watch this film and then tell everyone you know that they must see it that it will move them deeply and that they will never be the same thereafter. When those who do watch it tell you how bored they were act shocked and say oh my goodness how is that possible? This is a great example of what I'd call an antifilm. Imagine going to a contemporary art gallery for a reception and you are the first one to arrive. You come upon a construction that features a small catapult. As you get close to it the catapult is set off and a small pile of feces is flung in your face. Wasn't that great art? If you think so this film is for you no doubt. I enjoy dark disturbing films but it still must be a good film. To provide examples of my tastes I'll cite The Beloved A Clockwork Orange Dogville and Stalker though not nearly as good as these I'd much rather watch American Psycho than TotW.Perhaps the idea was to create a didactic experience. Does this film teach us anything? Not if you've ever seen a documentary on Nazi atrocities. For me there must be something intriguing. The characters can all be detestable for instance but then something else has to step up. There could be humor black for example. In The Rapture there was a sociological element that was effective though I'm not suggesting this film was excellent  again at least it was a film!. I really like the idea of an antihorror film actually. Rather than having zombies pop up every so often and chase the leading characters around why not show the quiet desperation people feel when they know that there are forces about to destroy them but they don't understand those forces and don't know exactly how or when they will be destroyed which could mean actual death or a psychological meltdown.I was hoping this would be the case for the film Blindness which I saw before this one but instead experienced a bland rather conventional construction that was not compelling on any level. However at least Blindness was a film and not an insult to the audience. As I was watching it I could hope that it would develop into something interesting. When it was over I could imagine a better ending that might have made it work. In contrast Time of the Wolf has so many flaws that it is simply not worth the mental effort to consider in depth. As some of the ancient Greeks realized a work of art requires a central focus. Otherwise it is decorative ornament at best. Basically this is an antihero version of The Omega Man. Again this is a good idea but it's essential to execute it well instead of creating a snide sophomoric pointless mess.".

	schema:headline " Detached and somewhat annoying crack at an apocalyptic drama which forgets the drama and often feels as if it's forgotten the apocalypse as well.";
	schema:reviewBody "It is bizarre to watch a film as relentlessly gloomy as impeccably shot and as seemingly brim full the notion that great danger might very well be lurking around the corner just hit the wall and die in the way that Time of the Wolf does. Here is the postapocalyptic movie wherein we do not get the feeling the apocalypse has actually happened here is the film depicting the fallout to a great terror wherein we actually feel unthreatened unthreatened by not only what this newfangled world looks like but additionally by the very item that brought everything to what it now resembles. It is a strange thing indeed not anything that transpires within but how relentlessly dull Austrian director Michael Haneke actually makes the end of civilised life in France actually look. To think that the likes of thenrecent French films La Haine and Irreversible actually set themselves within functioning societies as we know they exist yet still managed to construct what felt like a bubbled universe of decay and hatred is extraordinary.In its purest of forms the film is barely much more than a cluster of people bedded down in a single location for its entire duration  during this time people sit stand speak argue walk around and wait for a train to arrive. This was fine when it was Sydney Lumet's 12 Angry Men. Ah yes the train the reason for the likelihood of a train coming and going is that these people occupy a railway side signal booth a small but large enough structure in the remote ruralness of somewhereoranother which they all inhabit as the skies cloud over the grimaces on the characters' faces tighten and everyone lives in fear of........some wild dogs.The lead is Isabelle Huppert's Anne Laurent a woman whose husband is killed in front of her and who must flee a holiday property with her two children Ben and Eva when what appears to be a group of squatters ambush them upon arrival. Aghast they are sent away into the gloomy new world of death and terror without supplies or any clue as to what's happening. Seven years before John Hillcoat's The Road itself an episodic and somewhat patchy postglobal catastrophe flick in need of some serious revisions in regards to its ending they wonder around varying country streets and dirt roads unaware of what's happened. It is around this point that they meet a young woman who outlines the severity of the situation and invites them along to that aforementioned signal box. En route at night sheep are heard in the nearby proximity of the Laurent's and then found eerily mangled the following morning whereas a measure of the newfound world we're all now living in is exemplified when the stumbling across of a dead individual induces the taking of said corpse's jacket on account of the fact they no longer need it. It is very much dogeatdog or rather dogeatyouifyouaren'tcarefulenough. I think.Some will take to it as a gloomy pent up and claustrophobic masterpiece churned out by one of modern cinemas more exciting auteur's via a film industry in the French who rarely put a foot wrong when Luc Besson isn't involved. I say it's the same scene peddled over and over for the sort of cheerless thrills which wear thin after about twenty minutes. Time of the Wolf's greatest sin perhaps lies with its inability to be able to purvey the required amount of fear linked to the scenario nor indeed provide us with enough in the form of reasons to empathise with anyone involved. Where Haneke bites off a solid chunk of this postapocalyptic genre infused approach he decides to spin it in a way which is ambitious although ultimately flat and unaffecting. When lined up against the frighteningly distanced tone found in 2002's 28 Days Later or that immense sense of hopelessness and confusion omnipresent throughout Night of the Living Dead Time of the Wolf trips over its own skyhigh aspirations and dulls the senses when it ought to be stirring them. Haneke was much more pleasurable if that is the correct word when he subverted traditional codes of a certain branch of the horror film in Funny Games.In terms of characterisation at least Hillcoat's aforementioned The Road had this often quite touching central bond between a father and son as the elder readied the younger for the day he may no longer be around. There was a depressing air of inevitability about the exchanges as if there was something deep down that was acknowledged although ultimately unspoken between the two of them and we felt the intensity of their plight between not only the odds but one another. It is films like Time of the Wolf you might say are fabricated to catch the viewer out a film one watches and takes note as its air of pomposity becomes more obvious a film very gradually insinuating that it is illegal and stupid to take to something like Synder's remake of Dawn of the Dead over that of Time of the Wolf as if watching a horror film such as this one in which the threat is off screen and unspecified is good or correct whilst a bit of on screen splatter and cutanddry zombies being the clear antagonists for idiots. There is a patronising overly confident tone to Time of the Wolf a false distanced attitude to its proceedings which is unpleasant and stiff  as if it were continuously making a point on how bad most films of Time of the Wolf's ilk usually are and how intelligent and mediative this one is. Regardless I'll happily spend time trapped in a shopping mall over there with those guys in that Romero flick than that of the signal box with these people any day.".

Ah yes the train the reason for the likelihood of a train coming and going is that these people occupy a railway side signal booth a small but large enough structure in the remote ruralness of somewhereoranother which they all inhabit as the skies cloud over the grimaces on the characters' faces tighten and everyone lives in fear of........some wild dogs.The lead is Isabelle Huppert's Anne Laurent a woman whose husband is killed in front of her and who must flee a holiday property with her two children Ben and Eva when what appears to be a group of squatters ambush them upon arrival. Aghast they are sent away into the gloomy new world of death and terror without supplies or any clue as to what's happening. Seven years before John Hillcoat's The Road itself an episodic and somewhat patchy postglobal catastrophe flick in need of some serious revisions in regards to its ending they wonder around varying country streets and dirt roads unaware of what's happened. It is around this point that they meet a young woman who outlines the severity of the situation and invites them along to that aforementioned signal box. En route at night sheep are heard in the nearby proximity of the Laurent's and then found eerily mangled the following morning whereas a measure of the newfound world we're all now living in is exemplified when the stumbling across of a dead individual induces the taking of said corpse's jacket on account of the fact they no longer need it. It is very much dogeatdog or rather dogeatyouifyouaren'tcarefulenough. I think.Some will take to it as a gloomy pent up and claustrophobic masterpiece churned out by one of modern cinemas more exciting auteur's via a film industry in the French who rarely put a foot wrong when Luc Besson isn't involved. I say it's the same scene peddled over and over for the sort of cheerless thrills which wear thin after about twenty minutes. Time of the Wolf's greatest sin perhaps lies with its inability to be able to purvey the required amount of fear linked to the scenario nor indeed provide us with enough in the form of reasons to empathise with anyone involved. Where Haneke bites off a solid chunk of this postapocalyptic genre infused approach he decides to spin it in a way which is ambitious although ultimately flat and unaffecting. When lined up against the frighteningly distanced tone found in 2002's 28 Days Later or that immense sense of hopelessness and confusion omnipresent throughout Night of the Living Dead Time of the Wolf trips over its own skyhigh aspirations and dulls the senses when it ought to be stirring them. Haneke was much more pleasurable if that is the correct word when he subverted traditional codes of a certain branch of the horror film in Funny Games.In terms of characterisation at least Hillcoat's aforementioned The Road had this often quite touching central bond between a father and son as the elder readied the younger for the day he may no longer be around. There was a depressing air of inevitability about the exchanges as if there was something deep down that was acknowledged although ultimately unspoken between the two of them and we felt the intensity of their plight between not only the odds but one another. It is films like Time of the Wolf you might say are fabricated to catch the viewer out a film one watches and takes note as its air of pomposity becomes more obvious a film very gradually insinuating that it is illegal and stupid to take to something like Synder's remake of Dawn of the Dead over that of Time of the Wolf as if watching a horror film such as this one in which the threat is off screen and unspecified is good or correct whilst a bit of on screen splatter and cutanddry zombies being the clear antagonists for idiots. There is a patronising overly confident tone to Time of the Wolf a false distanced attitude to its proceedings which is unpleasant and stiff  as if it were continuously making a point on how bad most films of Time of the Wolf's ilk usually are and how intelligent and mediative this one is. Regardless I'll happily spend time trapped in a shopping mall over there with those guys in that Romero flick than that of the signal box with these people any day.";

That the horse died seems to have made them feel in some sense authentic. To me it's the action of a moral imbecile. It's fiction. A movie. Nothing needs to die to make a movie.I've admired this director's films in the past  particularly 'Funny Games'  but this piece is badly thought out and incomprehensibly acted. It's really just 'Stagecoach' without a coherent narrative. Its vision of some kind of disaster is only credible if you don't think about it. I should add that I saw no more of it after the death of the horse. But by that time the script when it could be understood had already veered off into some kind of parable. Which tends to be what people write when they're reaching for Big Thoughts but don't have anything to say. Plus it's all so dark it's extremely difficult to tell what's going on. Perhaps it's easier on the eye in a movie house. But then they kill the horse.This is the kind of nonsense that gets art films a bad name. It's also a retread of the much better Bergman film 'Shame'.You'll have guessed by now that I did not have a good time watching this tripe.".

Although the story of people trying to survive in the aftermath of a disaster is nothing new Haneke's bleak vision of an imploding society packs not only a punch but also a long increasingly unbearable squeeze. The cinematography lends a stunning realism night shots really look like night the fog shots are eerily beautiful  these all conspire brilliantly to drag you further into the nightmare. Rhythmically Haneke is masterful and the acting  especially by Isabelle Huppert  is excellent.

A stranger holding your son hostage conflicts occurring within the only established society even a father being shot and killed all these are engaging moments but i could not have been much more bored than i was when i saw them. Like i said far too many loooooong shots with not a lot happening in them. It did not keep me interested at all.However the cinematography was great. The actors for their part did well. The script was pretty solid. The main family characters were sort of interesting it's a shame there wasn't more done with them.I only recommend this if you have a lot of patience and have the attention span to stay with it's extremely slow pace 510 not great but not terrible".

And yet there is still a core of basic decency in some people the desire to help others to pull together even when the darker side of humanity is brought into focus by the need to survive.It has an almost Becketian refusal to opt for an ending let alone a happy one.

The interesting thing is that this is not hammered home by corny plotlines but comes out of the way the film is shot  no alltooobvious lighting effects we squint to see what's going on as much in the dark as the characters. The medium is indeed the message. We fade out on a train going through the countryside but whether or not it has picked up our wanderers or whether we are seeing the passing woods and fields from their viewpoint on the train we don't know. We do know that bigotry and prejudice continue  the villagers blame the foreigners and their brood for anything that goes wrong some people profit from the misery of others shades of Vichy France and that superstition and suspicion will always afflict people under stress  the religious mumbo jumbo of a belief in The Just or the human sacrifices by fire which nearly claim Isabel Huppert's son. We could be back in prehistoric times. All the horror and fear is generated by the way people interact once the fragile framework of society breaks down. While Hollywood relies on computergenerated special effects to frighten audiences the subtle Europeans let us do it for ourselves by reacting to the emotional and intellectual turmoil clashes on screen. A Hitchcockian touch. Great performances all round from a terrific multinational ensemble cast. Can you image Hollywood or even New York being able to assemble a cast like this? Highly recommended.

For three years after being forced from office Nixon remained silent. But in summer 1977 the steely cunning former commanderinchief agreed to sit for one allinclusive interview to confront the questions of his time in office and the Watergate scandal that ended his presidency. Nixon surprised everyone in selecting Frost as his televised confessor intending to easily outfox the breezy British showman and secure a place in the hearts and minds of Americans as well as a 600000 fee. Likewise Frost's team harbored doubts about their boss' ability to hold his own. But as cameras rolled a charged battle of wits resulted.";

	schema:reviewBody "The FrostNixon interviews are fascinating. Not every second of them especially not when Nixon rambles on and on avoiding questions by offering anecdotes in place of answers. Yet they are an invaluable historical document which allow us the rare privilege of seeing a major politician as a human being and nothing else. As interesting as the interviews themselves is the leadup to them the circumstances surrounding them and the characters involved particularly Frost and Nixon of course. One could say that you only need to watch the actual footage but there's ample room for a great dramatization but it needed an evenhanded approach and certainly needed no political preaching.I have a personal dislike for Ron Howard as a director a result of my sensibilities mainly I suspect. Howard strikes me as a particularly heavyhanded didactic director who has wasted many great concepts on mediocre films out of 18 films I've seen by him I only genuinely liked Apollo 13. I was expecting the worst with FrostNixon but instead was met with one of the most entertaining films in a while and a remarkably wellacted evenhanded quality character study. I suppose I should have been prepared for a quality screenplay given the success of this Peter Morgan play in New York and London but I was hardly expecting something this good. It's glib funny wellpaced expertlystructured clever observant and intelligent. It creates a fascinating Nixon played brilliantly by the great Frank Langella though this is not quite up there with the likes of Oliver Stone's sadly underappreciated Nixon or Robert Altman's endlessly fascinating Secret Honor. The film is almost surprisingly welldirected although there is a bit of the old TV trick of shaking the camera a bit panning too often to give the illusion of motion and energy when there's really just people in a room talking. The conversation's interesting enough there's no need for that. Oh well I suppose I am nitpicking.As far as Nixon movies go this is lightweight entertainment with plenty of comic moments largely leading up to two or three scenes of real human vulnerability. Aside from these scenes which are truly truly excellent Peter Morgan conceives the meeting as something of a chess match with the unpredictability of a boxing match. To use J. Hoberman's words 'a prize fight between two comebackhungry veterans only one of whom could win'. On paper this could have been very heavy on amateur psychoanalysis and low on entertainment value but Morgan and I suppose Howard as well are clever enough to have some fun with the idea. This is not a criticism at all the film has moments of surprisingly real depth and intellectualism but overall the nature of the script works in its favor makes those scenes more interesting more ultimately rewarding.FrostNixon is an entertaining exciting film around as populist as I expected but in a very different way. This is the sort of writing we don't see enough of particularly not in today's films. It's vaguely reminiscent of a particularly good BBC television drama. The cast is certainly good enough for that. Langella and Michael Sheen are outstanding both manage to accurately portray the reallife men they are portraying while still adding some characterization and mannerisms of their own. Langella's Tonyaward winning performance might be up for Oscar consideration soon but Sheen's Frost almost upstages him at times. No heavyhandedness no political 'messages' just a fun clever script and a great cast in a wellmade film.".

	schema:reviewBody "I had the pleasure of watching this gripping movie at the opening night of the British Film festival. Ron Howard's direction and story telling ability are in top form with this effort. From the very first scene a carefully crafted and very credible 70s's atmosphere sets a solid stage for the superbly cast film and quickly transports the viewer into the political jungle that was Tricky Dickey's playground.The acting duo of Frank Langella  Micheal Sheen Nixon  Frost are set on a collision course that finds two deeply passionate personalities at the mercy of their insatiable desires. Both actor's portrayals are a study of affectation and body language pleasurably accurate and yet not simply an impersonation. Indeed the film never strays from the distinct Howard format that breathes so much life read intimacy into this familiar and yet mysterious relationship that exists for so many people who lived through the exceptional event.Make no mistake this is by no means a two man show quite the contrary. In fact the wealth of supporting roles is perhaps the finest feature of this production. Bacon's devoted and stalwart marine practically glints of gun metal and polished shoe leather. The trio of Gould Platt and Rockwell portray effortlessly the roles of the men who brick by brick constructed the platform from which Frost so successfully and serendipitously elicited one of the greatest unspoken confessions of all time. Rebecca Hall is delicious and demure constantly filling scenes with her elegant presence.Perhaps the richest praise should be reserved for Peter Morgan who has without question penned a truly captivating and insightful story that delivers not only a satisfying comprehension of a complex time in US history but captures a generation's struggle to come to terms with the frailty of leadership that still echoes today.Not to be missed this film can be enjoyed on multiple levels and will undoubtedly be regarded as seminal for it's engrossing insight and expert depiction.".

Both actor's portrayals are a study of affectation and body language pleasurably accurate and yet not simply an impersonation. Indeed the film never strays from the distinct Howard format that breathes so much life read intimacy into this familiar and yet mysterious relationship that exists for so many people who lived through the exceptional event.Make no mistake this is by no means a two man show quite the contrary. In fact the wealth of supporting roles is perhaps the finest feature of this production. Bacon's devoted and stalwart marine practically glints of gun metal and polished shoe leather. The trio of Gould Platt and Rockwell portray effortlessly the roles of the men who brick by brick constructed the platform from which Frost so successfully and serendipitously elicited one of the greatest unspoken confessions of all time. Rebecca Hall is delicious and demure constantly filling scenes with her elegant presence.Perhaps the richest praise should be reserved for Peter Morgan who has without question penned a truly captivating and insightful story that delivers not only a satisfying comprehension of a complex time in US history but captures a generation's struggle to come to terms with the frailty of leadership that still echoes today.Not to be missed this film can be enjoyed on multiple levels and will undoubtedly be regarded as seminal for it's engrossing insight and expert depiction.";

	schema:reviewBody "Ron Howard's competent film adaptation of Peter Morgan's play who also scripted and coproduced here dramatizes the famous FrostNixon interviews from 1977. At one point in the film Kevin Bacon's character explains to Frank Langella's Nixon that a portion of the interview will focus on Nixon the man. To which Nixon retorted As opposed to what? Nixon the horse? Of course what was on everyone's mind at the time was Watergate and how American was never able to give Nixon the trial they so desperately wanted. Through the unlikely Frost interviews the American people finally heard the truth behind the scandalstraight from the horse's mouth.Morgan's source material translates smoothly onto film. Much as he did with The Queen he mixes a behind the scenes look at the immediate time period leading up to the historical event and closes with an almost wordforword dramatization of said event. Also like The Queen we have the excellent Michael Sheen on board who after playing Tony Blair now takes on the mannerisms of the legendary British talkshow host and manabouttown David Frost. Director Ron Howard nicely interweaves archival news footage fauxpost interviews with the secondary players and the dramatic reenactments of the actual FrostNixon interviews. Howard's studied but pedestrian style of direction lends itself well to this type of docudrama as he allows the actual events to speak for themselves and the fine performances to shine on their own. Though it takes quite awhile to get where it's going the final interview where Frost takes Nixon headon about the Watergate coverup is a payoff well worth the wait.Of course the most fascinating aspect of the film is Frank Langella's portrayal of a shamed and swollen Richard Nixon. He plays him as a fallen man desperate for an act of contrition but still in too deep with his old trickery and slick ways. His performance and the way it connects with the audience is wonderfully layered. On one level we have an aged actor thought to be well past his prime firing back on all cylinders in a renaissance role that will likely lead to a showering of award nominations. The way the film reduces his performance to that one lingering closeup after being steamrolled by Frost on the last day of the interview leaves a lasting impression. But it also works on another level as it is meant to represent the reduction of Nixon's political life to that one lingering closeup on the television monitor when he realized it's all over for him. The audience members who remember watching the interviews and can picture the actual closeup they saw on their TV screens are now allowed to share a communion with the audience members who weren't even born yet and now only have a memory of Langella's face on the silver screen. In that sense Langella truly became Nixon and his performance will not soon be forgotten.".

	schema:reviewBody "It didn't seem so in the runup to the event but British talk show hostinterviewer David Frost's 1977 series of four on screen encounters with the disgraced exPresident Richard Nixon was great historic television. This movie directed by Ron Howard successfully transfers the Peter Morgan play about the event to the big screen. Arguably the story belonged here all along. The paraphernalia of a Hollywood production enables Howard to gussy up this claustrophobic event with such acoutrements as the luxury suite of a 747 Nixon's smart seaside villa La Casa Pacifica at San Clemente and the impressive downright menacing sight of a presidential motorcade. As the train of glittering dark limos approach the Nixon friend's house where the interviews were shot it feels like a battalion of tanks and Caroline Cushing Rebecca Hall the British socialite Frost chats up on the plane and makes his consort for the duration of the exploit seems the more slinky and glamorous for emerging from a posh airplane rather than a bare stage. Lighting tricks and artful camera angles help make Frank Langella morph more successfully into Nixon than his physicality would otherwise permit. Michael Sheen as Frost already seems to look and sound like his character and the monkey suit blue blazer outfits add the final touch. His task is easier we don't know so well or care so much what Frost was like. In the film version both performances take on more nuance. Langella's performance on camera brims of with dyspeptic melancholy aggression and selfpity Michael Sheen's as frost glitters with a muted hysterical cheer mixing infantilism and fear. The extra visuals of a film also help to show Nixon's comfort and loneliness and Frost's sleazy playboy side.It's important that the fakery should work well because the movie must provide lots of closeups that those in the balcony didn't see. So long as it works the feeling of TV interviews is better achieved in the film and the actors don't have to yell. The camera sometimes annoyingly jerky but in the best moments simply direct and relentless does their yelling for them.So I'm saying this is a winner. Peter Morgan after all did the screenplay and he's no stranger to such effortsnotable examples of his film writing are in The Last King of Scotland and The Queen a rather less notable one is The Other Boleyn Girl. The flaws are simply in the events. For three of the interview parts till it gets to Watergate in the fourth Nixon seems to be winning. Despite a dramatic intervention by Nixon support staffer Col Jack Brennan Kevin Bacon to prevent an abject breakdown Nixon does buckle under in part four. But his admissions still remain in the realm of generality and there is the question does anything said on TV really matter? The audience for a West End or Broadway play is a bit different from the popcorn crowd and how appealing this film will be to the mainstream is uncertain. Needless to say it's all talk and minimal action. For students of contemporary American history nonetheless the topic is thrilling. Frost used his own money for down payments. In need of cash and highly mercenary Nixon used the celebrity agent Swiftie Lazar Toby Jones to get 600000 for the interviews. Frost lost sponsors and the US networks refused to come aboard. He made down payments from his own funds and borrowed. He hired two journalists Bob Zelnick Oliver Platt and James Reston Sam Rockwell to do support research. Reston was a firebrand opponent of Nixon. He refused to participate unless there was a commitment to shame Nixon and get him to admit he did wrong in Watergate and betrayed the country's trust.The issue was whether Frost had the depth to tackle a job like this. He wanted a Watergate confession too but he let Nicon play him with small talk despite the man's claim that he was no good at it and temporize with lengthy selfserving reminiscences that blunted most of Frost's pointed questions. This is where Zelick and especially Reston come in to give a sense of urgency. Again the film excels where the play couldn't in showing Nixon's walk out to his car after each encounter jubilant at first pathetic at the end.Ultimately both in the play and the film Frost's victory seems a hollow one of little significance to morality or history. This is above all a story about television. In that arena this was a coup. and there is great drama in how close Frost's project came to failing. As the encounters got under way he was losing every sponsor and later he lost his Australian show having some time earlier lost his American one. The film tells us they all came back and then some. Frost never really seems to have reentered the world of American television but he has had many projects in England and is said now to be worth 20 million with a live weekly current affairs program on Al Jazeera English. Nixon is dead and though he may have won three rounds out of four in the Frost interviews his legacy is tainted.The show belongs to Sheen and Langella but Bacon is excellent as the stiff loyal Col. Brennan and Sam Rockwell strong in an unusually serious role for him. As Nixon's somewhat lost wife Pat the child star of The Bad Seed Patty McCormack is touching. There are lots of other actors far more than in the stage production and the best thing is they don't get in the way. San Clemente also plays a significant role. The brightness and beauty of Nixon's oceanside estate helps dramatize his depression by contrast. There were doubts about putting Howard in charge of the screen version but they were groundless.".

	schema:headline " Howard redeems himself with a truly compelling film that leaves its theatrical roots behind";
	schema:reviewBody "It is a testament to Peter Morgan's humility and skill as a writer and Ron Howard's ability to take a based on real events story to which the outcome is widely known and create a compelling what will happen drama as he did with Apollo 13 that FrostNixon succeeds as a film.This is a film based on a play that neither felt trapped in staginess nor weakly expanded with just the stage dialogue delivered exactly but in a variety of outdoor locales. I have to give Peter Morgan a lot of credit here. I saw the play in London and wondered throughout production of the film how they would escape its theatricality. Many recent films from plays like Proof Closer The Producers have failed to throw off the shackles of stage feel. Not that all bad films many served as a good way to see the play if you hadn't had the chance but they weren't necessarily compelling films in their own right. What is so impressive about Morgan's work here is that in adapting his own play he has not been precious he has not tried to enforce his already successful stageplay onto a film director  he has wholly reworked it from beginning to end and yet retained all the gravity and drama that the play elicited. If you saw the play everything key is here and yet you can feel the difference  the pacing is changed the power achieved in different ways.For this Howard also deserves credit. To have filmed the play as it was would have been disastrous on film  one long twohander scene after another duelling narrators. And given the reverence the play has enjoyed a less experienced director could have fallen into this trap or that of simply changing the settings but Howard knows when we need quick cuts when a long drawn out piece that worked on stage needs to be reduced to a couple of lines and a postscene reaction and when he needs to hold with a scene and let it play between the two leads. This happens in several impressive moments in the latter half of the film.For some this might constitute the films biggest flaw however. Morgan and Howard can't escape the fact that in the final stages of the film it is the headtohead scenes of Frost and Nixon that are key and they must stay with them more. This is necessary but it sadly means that the supporting players so well established and broadened out to expand the scope in the first half fall be the wayside. A superb Toby Jones as Irving 'Swifty' Lazar Matthew Macfadyen as John Birt and always reliable Oliver Platt as Bob Zelnick all but disappear and only Kevin Bacon and Sam Rockwell play any significant role beyond the two leads in the final stages. This is a shame. It may best serve the story creating the sense of claustrophobia necessary to keep you gripped but it does feel like a film of two halves because of it and it noticeable.Frank Langella and Michael Sheen are superb as they were on stage and Langella will take a lot of beating for the Oscar this year. There are many moments here when I was so involved I forgot I wasn't watching the real Nixon. It's not that he looks that like Nixon but he is so real you believe it completely and have to remind yourself you're watching an actor.Platt is reliably Platt. Bacon is also his typically understated solid presence doing a lot with little. Toby Jones is fantastic in a small role  instantly memorable and Rebecca Hall builds on a series of strong performances. But in the supporting cast it is Rockwell that stands out. Sure he has the most to do but he is completely in this role he manages to sink into the role which is something he rarely does. He matches the skill he showed in Lawn Dogs and Confessions Of A Dangerous Mind here and it is great to see him back at his best.I thoroughly recommend this film.".

A superb Toby Jones as Irving 'Swifty' Lazar Matthew Macfadyen as John Birt and always reliable Oliver Platt as Bob Zelnick all but disappear and only Kevin Bacon and Sam Rockwell play any significant role beyond the two leads in the final stages. This is a shame. It may best serve the story creating the sense of claustrophobia necessary to keep you gripped but it does feel like a film of two halves because of it and it noticeable.Frank Langella and Michael Sheen are superb as they were on stage and Langella will take a lot of beating for the Oscar this year. There are many moments here when I was so involved I forgot I wasn't watching the real Nixon. It's not that he looks that like Nixon but he is so real you believe it completely and have to remind yourself you're watching an actor.Platt is reliably Platt. Bacon is also his typically understated solid presence doing a lot with little. Toby Jones is fantastic in a small role  instantly memorable and Rebecca Hall builds on a series of strong performances. But in the supporting cast it is Rockwell that stands out. Sure he has the most to do but he is completely in this role he manages to sink into the role which is something he rarely does. He matches the skill he showed in Lawn Dogs and Confessions Of A Dangerous Mind here and it is great to see him back at his best.I thoroughly recommend this film.";

With film credits like And God Created Woman 1988 Masters of the Universe and The 12 Chairs I hadn't seen very much from him that was outstanding in any way. However here in FrostNixon he demonstrates that my preconceptions was definitely wronghe is a darn fine actor. His performance as Nixon was wonderfulespecially when it COULD have come off as a parodylike Rich Little doing a Nixon impersonation. But he was able to capture the man very welland provide a bit of insight into a very enigmatic man.As for Michael Sheen who costarred and played David Frost he was excellent as wellbut he did not dominate the movie like Langella and really couldn't due to his character. Making Frost any different would have been unrealistic and the viewer is naturally drawn more to the Nixon charactereven if they dislike him.As for the movie it's a film that is probably going to appeal to you more if you know a lot about the Watergate affair. This means that younger folks who didn't live through and remember the 1970s will get less out of it unless they know their history well. As for me I'm a retired history teacher so even if I was only a kid when Nixon resigned I understand what had occurred and the figures involved. So when names of the various people involved are mentioned or what exactly Nixon's involvement was in the coverup are discussed it would sure help to know the basics. If you are fuzzy on this reading through Wikipedia or another website wouldn't hurt.Looking at the film's box office receipts I could assume that because Watergate is a rather distant memory is why the film made so little money. After all the acting and writing certainly were not at issuethey were topnotch. And I must also admit the film was quite cerebral and there aren't a lot of things to appeal to teens or someone who likes explosions or raunchy comedies you do get to see a gratuitous butt near the end but this isn't enough to appeal to this crowd.

The performances are admirable and the writing is very good but I was not overly impressed compared to other movies I have seen.The acting was good throughout the cast. Frank Langella was good but not spectacular as Richard Nixon. In my mind I will have Anthony Hopkins as Nixon not Langella. In Nixon strange emotions were brought up towards the man himself in here Nixon seems to be quite a very good man. This I had a problem with I liked the approach of him not being shown as an evil man but I did not like the fact he appeared to better than he was. I felt that Michael Sheen stole the show from Langella and in fact played better than him. His performance was more diverse and versatile and of course the movie is about him interviewing Nixon not Nixon interviewing Frost.The directing was solid as usual of Ron Howard. Yet with the character of Nixon he seemed to be pushing the idea of sympathy upon us for Richard Nixon. When it comes to feeling emotions such as sympathy it should not be pushed upon you. Many scenes though were quite intense but this movie was carried by the writing of Peter Morgan. The nice quick dialog between the characters is what really set the tone of the film above all.I liked FrostNixon but it is not a powerful movie. It sets a good tone at the beginning and stays with it throughout. Like other Ron Howard movies it doesn't take a giant leap of greatness. It does have moments of greatness and a few memorable scenes but not enough to really stand the test of time. I do not believe it deserves its best picture best director or best actor nominations as other men and movies have had more powerful and affecting influence this year.".

I didn't get a he said it!! moment.The film implied that Frost had gotten Nixon to admit to something noone else could i.e. something illegal thereby condemning himself to political wilderness. However instead I was left feeling that Nixon was an OK guy  an intelligent quick witted sincere and strong guy who did what it took to get things done. Whereas Frost came across as a chancer who was a bit lucky. At the end I wondered what the purpose of the movie was.I have now seen the actual footage of the interviews and can only conclude that the movie's purpose was to show Nixon in a much more favourable light than he would've come across in the real interviews  because in the real interviews he stinks. In the real interviews you can see the panic in his face you can see the often painfully contrived shows of friendliness in his mannerisms and you can hear the uncoordinated logic of his answers. Whereas in the movie he's smooth with his answers and his mannerisms.Any Brits out there should liken Nixon to our very own Gordon Brown  a man as bereft of any social attractiveness as Nixon. By getting Langella to play Nixon it's like getting Alec Guiness to play Brown. I.e. a brilliant actor but a million miles away from the truth.And THAT'S the problem with these recent real life movies that focus on people in high offices of state  The Queen The Special Relationship and now FrostNixon. The films make the people in high office appear to be totally articulate very quick witted sincere at times funny and always strong in character and determination. Whereas the truth is anything but that. We've seen footage of a supposedly eloquent Clinton and he is anything but. We've seen the Queen deliver her speeches and sincerity is never a word you'd associate with her.I know the counter argument is that it is only a movie and we shouldn't take it literally. But that's just it by giving the film real characters and real story lines the film makers are implying it is real. In fact it is the very suggestion that it might be factual that draws the audiences in. Otherwise where would the attraction be of seeing a film about a fictional President's relationship with a fictional Prime Minster? Or a fictional queen's reaction to the death of a fictional daughter in law? There would be no attraction.

	schema:headline " David Frost vs. Goliath Nixon ...";
	schema:reviewBody "There's a brief but memorable moment in FrostNixon where one of Nixon's most ardent haters a researcher played by Sam Rockwell is about to confront for the first time the man he holds responsible for the destruction of American ideals. This is his time to shine and honor his opinions by not shaking the 'Shakers' hand. Yet despite a brief hesitation he gives both hand and respect. That says it all there's the politician there's the man and one of the greatest tricks a corrupt one ever pulls is to hide behind the mask of friendliness.No one can resist it much less a TV audience. In my student's essay about the power of media which is the film's essential theme I wrote that the camera not only changes perceptions but actions too. As long as there is an instance of mediation between two people something will cease to be natural and the talent of those who control the media is to make it imperceptible. So when Frost Michael Sheen decides to interview Nixon with his own money because no American channel will accept to pay a British interviewer he gives the fallen President a golden opportunity to talk to American people. Nixon Frank Langella advised by Swifty Lazar Toby Jones accepts the challenge a TV show will reach the people quicker and simpler than a memoirs book.It all comes to this  either Nixon shows a new shining image three years after the Watergate and his disastrous resignation the only one in History or Frost confronts a man to his responsibilities and forces him to admit his guilt. That's what Frost's partner John Birt Matthew McFayden Bob Zelnick a TV journalist Oliver Platt and James Reston Jr. Rockwell expect from the interview anything but making Nixon sympathetic. With these opposite challenges the premises could be that of a boxing match. And FrostNixon is indeed a duel the slash is relevant with no holds barred between huge and flawed egos starting with Frost a cocky womanizer trying to forget that he was basically exiled in Australia to host forgettable entertainment shows the refusals from TV studios to sponsor his project will finish to teach him lessons of humility.But Nixon plays in another league being the epitome of 'unpopular culture' a tragic figure who destroyed what were left of American dreams including his own. In 1995 Oliver Stone offered a remarkable view on Nixon with no concession. Still we couldn't help but feeling sympathy for a man entrapped by both his ideals and demons. The movie was remarkably served by Anthony Hopkins' performance but now I wonder if it doesn't have something to do with the personality of Nixon himself ambivalent to the best with this mix of fascination and repulsion only great men achieve to inspire. Maybe he was the last 'largerthanlife' President. Anyway he's not an amateur and during the interview he's like Goliath ready to frost David.Goliath Nixon also has a redoubtable righthand man Kevin Bacon who works as an adviser and he knows himself the traps of TV he whose sweating under the upper lip cost him the Presidential campaign in 1960 so he wouldn't make the same mistakes. David Frost IS the rookie and when the first interview we might as well call it a round starts Frost bluntly opens with the Watergate why didn't you burn the files? Nixon is startled first but uses the question to pose as a victim of a system supported by his predecessors. Trying an uppercut Frost was literally knocked down tasting the toughness of an opponent who meant business. And as viewers we're satisfied to see Frost put in his place for a moment before he could recover.The measure of the thrills provided by the interviews is because both have everything to win yet so much to lose. Nixon is in a deadend and any attempt to gain his popularity back is welcome and by throwing himself in that crazy project Frost lost his show 600 000 dollars and jeopardized his career maybe more and I'm not sure his newly conquered girlfriend Caroline Cushing Rebecca Hall would've stayed longer with him. In her one shining moment that doesn't rely on her distractingly beautiful looks she notices that Frost doesn't like being questioned. And that weakness shows with Nixon's offensive remarks before the interview destabilizing him on his effeminate shoes or his 'masculine attitude' with Caroline. No holds barred indeed the two men bet a lot in this interview and it's like two destinies crossing one another.The remarkable thing about Ron Howard's movie is that we all know it ended with a heartfelt confession from Nixon one of the most memorable and defining TV moments of the 70's. But it's all in the process on how Frost will finally take the edge over Nixon and find the vulnerable spots or use his adversary's weapons against him not through cynicism or aggressiveness but the true belief that his project is fair and for once the variety show producer must act like a journalist. A man who failed as journalist must not interview the one who failed as a President. And this is why they were so close yet so different from each other.It is between the two men and the others are only spectators filling the film with many interesting comments about the evolution of the match and what lessons they learned from the confrontation. A man should feel important enough to believe in his rightness but never such as he can escape from his responsibilities. The lessons served both men and the ending is twice happy as each one seemed to have triumphed over his demons. Sometimes truth hurts but how relieving it can also be!".

That's what Frost's partner John Birt Matthew McFayden Bob Zelnick a TV journalist Oliver Platt and James Reston Jr. Rockwell expect from the interview anything but making Nixon sympathetic. With these opposite challenges the premises could be that of a boxing match. And FrostNixon is indeed a duel the slash is relevant with no holds barred between huge and flawed egos starting with Frost a cocky womanizer trying to forget that he was basically exiled in Australia to host forgettable entertainment shows the refusals from TV studios to sponsor his project will finish to teach him lessons of humility.But Nixon plays in another league being the epitome of 'unpopular culture' a tragic figure who destroyed what were left of American dreams including his own. In 1995 Oliver Stone offered a remarkable view on Nixon with no concession. Still we couldn't help but feeling sympathy for a man entrapped by both his ideals and demons. The movie was remarkably served by Anthony Hopkins' performance but now I wonder if it doesn't have something to do with the personality of Nixon himself ambivalent to the best with this mix of fascination and repulsion only great men achieve to inspire. Maybe he was the last 'largerthanlife' President. Anyway he's not an amateur and during the interview he's like Goliath ready to frost David.Goliath Nixon also has a redoubtable righthand man Kevin Bacon who works as an adviser and he knows himself the traps of TV he whose sweating under the upper lip cost him the Presidential campaign in 1960 so he wouldn't make the same mistakes. David Frost IS the rookie and when the first interview we might as well call it a round starts Frost bluntly opens with the Watergate why didn't you burn the files? Nixon is startled first but uses the question to pose as a victim of a system supported by his predecessors. Trying an uppercut Frost was literally knocked down tasting the toughness of an opponent who meant business. And as viewers we're satisfied to see Frost put in his place for a moment before he could recover.The measure of the thrills provided by the interviews is because both have everything to win yet so much to lose. Nixon is in a deadend and any attempt to gain his popularity back is welcome and by throwing himself in that crazy project Frost lost his show 600 000 dollars and jeopardized his career maybe more and I'm not sure his newly conquered girlfriend Caroline Cushing Rebecca Hall would've stayed longer with him. In her one shining moment that doesn't rely on her distractingly beautiful looks she notices that Frost doesn't like being questioned. And that weakness shows with Nixon's offensive remarks before the interview destabilizing him on his effeminate shoes or his 'masculine attitude' with Caroline. No holds barred indeed the two men bet a lot in this interview and it's like two destinies crossing one another.The remarkable thing about Ron Howard's movie is that we all know it ended with a heartfelt confession from Nixon one of the most memorable and defining TV moments of the 70's. But it's all in the process on how Frost will finally take the edge over Nixon and find the vulnerable spots or use his adversary's weapons against him not through cynicism or aggressiveness but the true belief that his project is fair and for once the variety show producer must act like a journalist. A man who failed as journalist must not interview the one who failed as a President. And this is why they were so close yet so different from each other.It is between the two men and the others are only spectators filling the film with many interesting comments about the evolution of the match and what lessons they learned from the confrontation. A man should feel important enough to believe in his rightness but never such as he can escape from his responsibilities. The lessons served both men and the ending is twice happy as each one seemed to have triumphed over his demons. Sometimes truth hurts but how relieving it can also be!";

Ron Howard directs FrostNixon a thrilling story with the behind the scenes of one of the most famous broadcasts ever presented in television and that is the meeting between Former President Richard Nixon Frank Langella and English TV host David Frost Michael Sheen after the President's impeachment.

Allied with a magnificent screenplay there's a highest quality of the performances. Langella might sound and look like a Nixon caricature but he manages to portray the President in his emotional and darker sides a figure that needs to be doing something useful other than just be a retired politician always in the arena even if that arena is a TV show where he might get trapped with his demons face to face with the American public. Sheen makes of his Frost a entertaining man who gives a leap into a whole new field a serious interview with a former president where he needs to find a way to survive or win what could be the battle for his career his reputation but more than that he wants to be a star in America making the interview of the Century. Two men without their masks in front of a whole audience trying to win a battle where the winners are us the viewers delighted with such incredible moments.

That caused me to have to take breaks in my viewing of it and I have to say it was not easy to do so. It is simply put immensely gripping and the ending is pitch perfect. I haven't seen the play but I understand that this expands upon the people around the two who were engaged in the verbal boxing match especially Cushing. The two leads are the same and I can get behind getting them to do both versions. They are immensely talentedthey had the material so committed to memory that they only flubbed once each and Sheen is an absolute chameleon disappearing entirely into what he portraysI can just barely believe that he played Lucian in the Underworld trilogy... great job in those by the way. The cast is fantastic and everyone really delves into their credible and swiftly developed characters. This manages to not paint anyone as a onenote good or bad guy and I have to admit I did not feel any sympathy for the former president before this film. The acting is amazing. Dialog is excellent. A little of it was improvised so was most of the camerawork and it helps make it feel dynamic and natural. This builds tension rather well. The drama is compelling. There is a short sequence of disturbing content infrequent strong language and brief nudity in this. The DVD comes with an informational commentary track by Howard a welldone 23 minute behindthescenes production 22 and a half minutes of deleted scenes and two wellmade featurettes of 7 and a half minutesabout the real interview and six minutesabout the Nixon library respectively. I recommend this to anyone interested in the subject. 810".

	schema:headline " Entertaining and Rich Howard's Best";
	schema:reviewBody "Movies centered on politics are often interesting on an intellectual level but never has a film of such an ilk been so thoroughly entertaining. Director Ron Howard's adaptation of the stage play of the same name manages to both stay loyal to the true events that served as inspiration yet infuses it with life and achieves the utmost level of satisfaction without compromising the rich and weighty subject matter. Infused with sensational performances throughout Howard has delivered what I think is his best film yet.Beginning with President Richard Nixon's Frank Langella reprising his role from the play resignation following the Watergate scandal the movie jumps to a few years later where the expresident has been demoted to giving talks at luncheons and interviews for money. Meanwhile down under in Australia a wildly popular talk show host named David Frost Michael Sheen comes up with the ultimate publicity stunt winch out the confession the American people never got from their former president. Nixon has other plans however seeing only easy money for answering some fluff questions over a four day period. Frost assembles a team of researchers and experts including Sam Rockwell as James Reston Jr. Mathew McFayden as John Burt and Oliver Platt as Bob Zelnick to ensure his suave defeat of his opponent and secure their place in infamy.FrostNixon succeeds in overcoming a number of hurdles. It flourishes even if you have no knowledge of the events of Watergate or have no interest in American politics but will thrill those who do. From what I understand certain liberties were taken with the facts surrounding the endlessly notorious interviews but more often then not FrostNixon is less of a political film then it is a sword and shield bout to the death an intense duel between these two intellectuals and how their confidence and overconfidence sways the interviews in both their favours before the gripping final outcomeFrank Langella is sure to get an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of the infamous president but Michael Sheen should by no means be overlooked. He is equally solid and to some extent has the more difficult role in keeping his own against the veteran stage actors larger then life embodiment of the president. We also get fantastic supporting work from Kevin Bacon as Nixon's aid who's twofold admiration and quiet pity and embarrassment is tragic and very affecting. From a visual standpoint Howard's film is glossy and superbly shot without feeling to large in its scope. It is intimate and immediate with a keen sense of the times. Perhaps the biggest achievement of the movie is the handling of the Nixon character. Howard manages to capture both his corruptness and smug pompousness while showing him as a true human with some sympathy but mostly just not as a faceless monster and without a blunt bias. So don't be turned away simply because of the films 'political' backbone because FrostNixon is some of the most simultaneously intelligent and entertaining filmmaking of the decade. 9.5  10.0 Read all my reviews at  httpsimonsaysmovies.blogspot.com".

	schema:headline " Frost Nixon When Finished Serve With Ice Cream!!";
	schema:reviewBody "This film focused on the infamous Watergate break in of the Democratic National Committee during the summer of 1972!! As it turned out the whole Watergate fiasco wound up being much to the revelation of the American people something which the Nixon administration was peccant for. When the Watergate incident hit the media the principle bone of contention was that television was after showmanship and that the major deception with T.V. was that the news anchors merely simplified disaster. When an onslaught of scandalous theatrics occurred with the Nixon White House such culpability on the Nixon Administration's behalf was labeled as illicit and nefarious! These actions that the Nixon Administration engaged in were a total exploitation of executive power. Nixon and his cabinet were initially nonchalant about Watergate eventually as trouble with the Watergate breakin began to escalate the Nixon Administration responded accordingly. At best Richard Nixon and key aids of his expected no higher than a grade of a D for political containment. When the final verdict of a resounding red F was issued to the Nixon White House for their reprehensible breach of trust with the American people impeachment proceedings began immediately. The intransigence with the U.S. voters about the Watergate break in resulted in Nixon having to resign from his post as President of the United States. This is something no other President was ever forced to do in the history of our nation. As a result Richard Nixon acquired a peptic ulcer. The resonating aftermath with the American people was one whereby they wound up delving in dirges of shame and self righteous indignation for a protracted period of time and the rest as they say is history!!. For David Frost however this was merely the beginning of his bloodthirsty agenda!! The Watergate scandal was perceived as an instance of espionage and political corruption that the United States citizens were totally ashamed of. The Watergate affair was perceived by David Frost as a potential for a pique in publicity and soaring ratings for his talk show career. What was identified as pejorative for the American public's codes of decency became an auspicious endeavor for nationwide television notoriety!! Complications with the Richard Nixon interview were dealt with in an insidiously successful manner. These were the ground rules simply circumvent the BBC and as far as sponsors were concerned SO WHAT!! Oldsmobile and Honeywell will not sponsor this event but Alpo Dog Food will!! Bottom line The show mustand will go on!! Once the interview with David Frost and Richard Nixon commenced Nixon enjoyed a preliminary advantage. Richard Nixon was very elusive as a result he was perpetually caricatured as well as extremely underestimated in terms of his knowledge of the prevailing political arena!! Both Frost and Nixon shared the unnerving proclivity of being afflicted by compulsive behavior. It was the final interview which opened up an ideological metamorphosis pertaining to the purpose of this entire string of interviews. David Frost's intrepid disposition during this interview now made Richard Nixon the private citizen capitulate to a heinous admission of guilt yet another time thus making Nixon the fall guy once again!! The entire string of FrostNixon interviews was initially perceived as an ersatz replacement for other ideas such as a banal discussion about male menopause with some Columbia chancellors. Ultimately these Frost Nixon interviews became transformed into a harsh exposure of the myriad of character discrepancies which lurked in the Oval Office while Richard Nixon was President!! This final interview with Nixon was the pinnacle of David Frost's days as a talk show host. This long dissertation about this entire affair was what the movie FrostNixon centered around. So how was such a disgraceful event in American history depicted by the producers writers directors and actresses and actors in the movie? The answer is brilliantly!! The visceral portrayal of the seventies went into relentless detail particularly with regard to the abhorrent facade in fashion which the seventies possessed!! The accentuated diamonds on Richard Nixon's ties was conspicuously deliberate. The Neanderthal mops which the seventies referred to as hair styles were unfortunately realistic!! As far as the suits are concerned!! Put it this way I can't hear you with that sport jacket you're wearing!! Surprisingly enough the film FrostNixon was directed by Ronny Howard. This is surprising because Ronny Howard via his role as Oppie Taylor comes across as the twentieth century version of Hucleberry Finn. The screen writing of William Perry was excellent! As far as the acting goes Michael Sheen was so believable as David Frost that he got the part of Frost in less than ten minutes. Oliver Platt did a remarkable job in this movie!! Kevin Bacon was excellent as Jack Brennan. the shunned general I always thought that having disdain for soldiers who fought in Vietnam was a very convoluted line of logic anyway!! Frank Langella Who was brilliant as William Paley in Good Night and Good Luck was simply spectacular as Richard Nixon in this film!! Frank Langella seemed to have a very cogent recognition of Nixon's dubiously painful plight!! Langella's agitated responses invoked a very genuine temerity and insolence this is a very authentic rendition of Richard Nixon's attitudes!! Movies such as these cannot be noted for original dialog as they are merely paraphrasing the actual events which occurred. It is about how powerful the delivery on these events is. I feel that this film delivered these ominous events with the Nixon Presidency in an absolutely flawless manner. The challenging approach with the film FrostNixon puts this movie in a category by itself. The itemization concerning the Nixon Cabinet's penchant for volatility was graphically prolific. The correlation to dire circumstances involving doom and despair with the movie FrostNixon were extremely gripping!! The directing screenplay writing and acting in this movie is emphatically first rate I definitely recommend seeing this film!! Tremendous films such as FrostNixon raise the bar on an intensified intellectual awareness in the cinema today!! FIVE STARS! NO QUESTION ABOUT IT!".

The Watergate scandal was perceived as an instance of espionage and political corruption that the United States citizens were totally ashamed of. The Watergate affair was perceived by David Frost as a potential for a pique in publicity and soaring ratings for his talk show career. What was identified as pejorative for the American public's codes of decency became an auspicious endeavor for nationwide television notoriety!! Complications with the Richard Nixon interview were dealt with in an insidiously successful manner. These were the ground rules simply circumvent the BBC and as far as sponsors were concerned SO WHAT!! Oldsmobile and Honeywell will not sponsor this event but Alpo Dog Food will!! Bottom line The show mustand will go on!! Once the interview with David Frost and Richard Nixon commenced Nixon enjoyed a preliminary advantage. Richard Nixon was very elusive as a result he was perpetually caricatured as well as extremely underestimated in terms of his knowledge of the prevailing political arena!! Both Frost and Nixon shared the unnerving proclivity of being afflicted by compulsive behavior. It was the final interview which opened up an ideological metamorphosis pertaining to the purpose of this entire string of interviews. David Frost's intrepid disposition during this interview now made Richard Nixon the private citizen capitulate to a heinous admission of guilt yet another time thus making Nixon the fall guy once again!! The entire string of FrostNixon interviews was initially perceived as an ersatz replacement for other ideas such as a banal discussion about male menopause with some Columbia chancellors. Ultimately these Frost Nixon interviews became transformed into a harsh exposure of the myriad of character discrepancies which lurked in the Oval Office while Richard Nixon was President!! This final interview with Nixon was the pinnacle of David Frost's days as a talk show host. This long dissertation about this entire affair was what the movie FrostNixon centered around. So how was such a disgraceful event in American history depicted by the producers writers directors and actresses and actors in the movie? The answer is brilliantly!! The visceral portrayal of the seventies went into relentless detail particularly with regard to the abhorrent facade in fashion which the seventies possessed!! The accentuated diamonds on Richard Nixon's ties was conspicuously deliberate. The Neanderthal mops which the seventies referred to as hair styles were unfortunately realistic!! As far as the suits are concerned!! Put it this way I can't hear you with that sport jacket you're wearing!! Surprisingly enough the film FrostNixon was directed by Ronny Howard. This is surprising because Ronny Howard via his role as Oppie Taylor comes across as the twentieth century version of Hucleberry Finn. The screen writing of William Perry was excellent! As far as the acting goes Michael Sheen was so believable as David Frost that he got the part of Frost in less than ten minutes. Oliver Platt did a remarkable job in this movie!! Kevin Bacon was excellent as Jack Brennan. the shunned general I always thought that having disdain for soldiers who fought in Vietnam was a very convoluted line of logic anyway!! Frank Langella Who was brilliant as William Paley in Good Night and Good Luck was simply spectacular as Richard Nixon in this film!! Frank Langella seemed to have a very cogent recognition of Nixon's dubiously painful plight!! Langella's agitated responses invoked a very genuine temerity and insolence this is a very authentic rendition of Richard Nixon's attitudes!! Movies such as these cannot be noted for original dialog as they are merely paraphrasing the actual events which occurred. It is about how powerful the delivery on these events is. I feel that this film delivered these ominous events with the Nixon Presidency in an absolutely flawless manner. The challenging approach with the film FrostNixon puts this movie in a category by itself. The itemization concerning the Nixon Cabinet's penchant for volatility was graphically prolific. The correlation to dire circumstances involving doom and despair with the movie FrostNixon were extremely gripping!! The directing screenplay writing and acting in this movie is emphatically first rate I definitely recommend seeing this film!! Tremendous films such as FrostNixon raise the bar on an intensified intellectual awareness in the cinema today!! FIVE STARS! NO QUESTION ABOUT IT!";

	schema:reviewBody "The relevance of this film today may be sadly overlooked. As the current President of the United States George W. Bush ends his tenure with his country disillusioned in debt at war and in disarray one cannot help but compare him to the late Richard Nixon. Strangely the older politician now dead and buried for over a decade seems much more the intellectual statesman. Nixon has always seemed the darker man the loner in the Oval Office as compared to Bush the happygolucky Texan. While the former suffered from the same malady of selfimportance at least he would ponder positive foreign affairs decisions before creating his political enemy's list. The latter would rather snap celebrity photos with endearing fans than answer tough questions about foreign policy. Leave that to Cheney. Both Nixon and Bush seemed to suffer from the same kind of selfaggrandizement that put the country and the world at tremendous risk. One lost the presidency for his flaws the other lost nothing personally except the wellbeing and respect of his nation.FrostNixon filmed in semidocumentary style by Ron Howard is about the elder statesman Nixon revealing himself and his enigmatic heart of hearts to his country and the world via a relatively lightweight British interviewer David Frost. Overnight Frost has to remake himself from a chatty interviewer like Jay Leno into a tough interrogator like Mike Wallace. Both men have a lot at stake. According to the film Frost's career has stagnated and he desperately needs a large breakthrough in media to be taken seriously. And he has shoved most of his personal capital into the project. Nixon was never tried for Watergate and therefore never had a platform from which his case was heard. The Frost interviews becomes Nixon's witness stand and the television his courtroom.The acting in this film is some of the finest of all the Oscar contenders of 2008 probably because Sheen and Langella reprised their roles from the Broadway and London stageplay of the same name. For well over 30 years Frank Langella has been quietly forging an acting career that has had sparse recognition for the quality of his work. In short he is one of the most overlooked and underappreciated talents in Hollywood films until now. This film has allowed Langella's acting range and versatility to glow into THE performance of 2008. Langella literally becomes Nixon shaping his subtle mannerisms and guttural tone. And yet Langella does even one better. He somehow shapes Nixon's attitudes as if he understood who Nixon was on the inside as well as the outside. Good actors can mimic facial expressions. It takes a superb acting of uncommon ability to portray the inner qualities of hisher subject. Langella brings forth the inner Nixon in the same way that the real David Frost did 30 years ago.Equally superb is the portrayal of David Frost by Michael Sheen. Similar to Langella Sheen also brings forth the inner Frost the sort of sexy rock star interviewer who must turn into something he has never been a tough journalist probing the inner meat of his interviewee. The film very slowly shows us the transition of Frost into the kind of journalist he had to become in order to face Richard Nixon. No American president is easily knocked down and left bare by the likes of a journalist and Nixon was no exception. Frost had to have an arsenal of not just tough questions but tough responses if he was going to be able to bring out the inner soul of Nixon. Frost had to discard the chatty sensibility of a Jay Leno or David Letterman and transform himself into the passionate journalist of a Mike Wallace or Christiane Amanpour. A superb film and relevant to the current state of American politics. Nixon had to come clean and Frost was both his judge and his confessor partially because the former president had resigned. The current president as of 10709 despite eight years of abuse of power leaves the office without the stain of impeachment. He will probably never have to answer to a David Frost or a Mike Wallace. What a pity.".

Langella's portrayal captures the insecurity and paranoia of Nixon but also reveals a more intelligent and engaging aspect of him during his post Watergate years. I suppose this will automatically disqualify Langella from any chance of an Oscar nomination. I hope this isn't the case because Langella's performance is on par with Helen Mirren's in The Queen maybe even better. Ron Howard deserves kudos for directing this excellent movie. He's become one of Hollywood's best Directors of historical dramas. The supporting cast was great Michael Sheen as David Frost was outstanding and everyone else was excellent.A truly outstanding film and for anyone with an interest in recent American history not to be missed.".

	schema:reviewBody "WARNINGSPOILERS THROUGHOUT!!One in awhile a motion picture comes along that while not Oscar material makes it's mark as unforgettable. This was definitely such a movie.The story centers on AprilSherilyn Fenn a rich southern belle engaged to a preppy southern boy who then meets Perry a driftercarnival workerplayed to perfection by Richard Tyson and falls head over heels for him. There are thousands of movies made every year with a familiar theme like this. But there is something special and really unique about 2 moon junction that makes it a cut above the rest.Besides having two absolutely magnificent looking stars two moon junctionalso has atmosphere sensuality and a great supporting cast including an appearance by Kristy Mc.Nicol. Never boring the movie is set in a small southern town and manages to capture to a tee the luminous beauty of the south. Besides it's lovely southern feel the film has an electric sensuality about it that coupled with a certain dreaminess a mystery in most every scene makes the picture irresistible. I'm not a major fan of movies like this but two moon junction was an amazing pic that never received much recognition beyond the it's hot type.I don't know why Fenn and Tyson never became big stars. Both were made for these roles and have an on screen chemistry that contributes a lot to making this movie unforgettable. In fact they are so believable and the chemistry so apparent early on that the audience is rooting for them from their first meeting. The rest of the castparticularly an amazing sassy Christy Mc.Nicol and a scheming Louise Fletcher were great too. There is a type of dream like quiet to this movie every scene is pivotal to the ultimate ending the only gripe I have is the ending which while alright was to quick and could have been expanded on a little. Still this movieeasily gets a 10 of 10. Through the years whenever myself and my fellow movie goers turn somebody on to this film inevitably the same thing happens. They at first don't want to watch it then after viewing it like it so much that they want to see it again. Says a lot about the picture....Anyone who has ever loved with a kind of mindless passion will be able to relate to this. The magic of the film is also in turning everyday things into objects of mystery. Look at what they do with a simple carnival!Many may not agree with me but I give it 10 of 10easily. They took a subject matter that has been done over and over again and turned it into something with mystery and intrigue.".

	schema:reviewBody "Okay let's take this movie for what it is  a bodice ripper romance novel put on the screen for you to enjoy.  It's hardly anything more than that but does it have to be?  The film is set in the deep south but the faulty accents and inandaround LA locations sometimes give it away.  It's a highly stylized exercise in melodramatic erotica.  There's no mystery here  even the ending can be seen coming a mile away!  Basically the plot is a Southern Belle sows her wild oats before her wedding and finds herself torn between sensuality and stability.  She meets a carny who offers her one last hot fling before she marries her boring college sweetheart.  Which one will she chose?What's to like?  Sherilyn Fenn is radiant as April and overcomes most all of the bad dialogue. She's a great actress! Kristy McNichol steals the few scenes she is in with a flair for comedy and easy earthy sensuality!  Why is she not doing more?  Richard Tyson plays a rough and tumble drifter carny who gets to pout and preen as a male himbo who is justly portrayed as good at one thing.  The plot is silly and you even get an overthetop Louise Fletcher appearing as the matriarch who knows all too well that lust fades but financial security is worth everything!  I love this movie though.  It is charming in its own way and sensual without being too graphic.  Nothing is subtle but it pays off as one of the most enjoyable Zalman King outings ever!  Notice the almost ALL WHITE costumes!  These people spend a fortune on bleach.  Notice the hottest scene seems to be when Sherilyn Fenn and Kristy McNichol dance together on a deserted jukejoint floor.  Notice the great soundtrack!  Let yourself go and enjoy an oldfashioned pot boiler romance filmed and acted better than it ever had a right to be.".

Both were sexy sensual and desirable and played their part perfectly. I loved the chemistry between these two characters and I thoroughly enjoyed the storyline so much so I wished it was longer. I found each character brought a little something to the story but not enough to detract from the central focus of the plot. The soundtrack I found to be very haunting and although I knew it was pure instrumental when I bought it I still wish there were the other few songs that weren't included from the movie. I would love for there to be a special edition DVD of the movie perhaps with extra footage of deleted scenes and other bonus features. The ending was great but what would have really made it better was if April didn't marry Chad which I assume is what she did due to the wedding ring that we saw on her finger at the end of the movie in the shower scene and instead ran of to be with Perry. At least that's what I would have done!".

Having said this I let the film be what it wants to be erotic. Nothing more nothing less. If you watch Two Moon Junction having preconceptions about how erotica HAS to involve bad acting or a lame script you won't let its passion take over your film experience. I have to admit I wasn't particularly interested in the acting as much as the chemistry between the characters. I felt the acting fine and chemistry topnotch   Not many people have seen In God's Hands a film about three nomadic surfers but just in case you either have or are planning to see this other Zalman King great After seeing it you will appreciate what King was trying to put forth in Two Moon Junction after seeing In God's Hands. Passion. Sensuality. The difference is TMJ is erotic wheras IGH was about the surfer mentality and spirituality. In both films however what you see and think are not as important as how you feel while you're watching them. The whole is greater than the sum of their parts.   Richard Tyson as the lead may or may not be adequate for guys although attractive to most of us women. But whether you're a chick or not you will find Sherilynn Fenn outright gorgeous point blank. She's beautiful sexy sultry seductive mischievous etc...not to mention a platinum blonde with a charming Southern accent. Watch for a few tiny but ohsoprecious Milla Jovovich scenes    Overall this film obviously isn't an Oscar contender because there is no category for most sensual film. But the fact that this is a littleknown gem with a LOT of sex appeal no taboos no manipulations or even morals to shove down your throat is what gives this film its unique appeal and the sky is the limit sexual power the less preconceptions you have the more you will enjoy the film        Did I mention the soundtrack perfectly complements the eye candy and captures the mood of the film?

The supporting cast including Louis Fletcher Nurse Rachet! and Burl Ives does an outstanding job!I've been watching this film since if first came out and I still watch it every time I get the chance. Can't wait to get a DVD player so I can see the widescreen version.  This movie definitely ranks in my top ten favourites. Make sure you rentbuy this movie  it's well worth it.

I can pretty much guarantee that seeing Burl Ives in this piece of crap softcore erotica will be unlike anything you've seen pop up in a film before. Unfortunately Ives neither gets naked nor sings Have a Holly Jolly Christmas in this movie which would have made it a must see for bizarre cinema. Instead you have to settle for seeing Sherilyn Fenn naked a guy who could be Fabio Jr. suffering from what has to be premature ejaculation and a topless Kristy McNichol giving the best performance in the whole thing.April Sherilyn Fenn is an Alabama rich girl fresh out of college and soon to marry her rich preppy fiance Chad Martin Hewitt. After masturbating in the shower while seemingly reenacting a scene out of Porky's April takes her sisters to a nearby traveling carnival. There April comes to the sexual attention of shirtless carny Perry Richard Tyson who spends most of the movie alternating between jerk and a slab of beef. They have sex which Perry videotapes with the camera that belongs to April's family. When Perry gets himself thrown out of the carnival after a scene that could have been lifted out of an old episode of The A Team or Matt Houston April Perry and a hyper cowgirl named Patty Jean Kristy McNichol hang out for a while.After some Sapphic undertones between the two women Patty Jean just leaves for no particular reason and we get another sex scene with April and Perry. Then April's grandmother Belle Louise Fletcher has the sheriff Burl Ives run Perry out of town. Perry comes back however and even though he's a penniless drifter who lives in a semi and is a foultempered drunk asks April to run away with him. Well he doesn't really ask her but I think we're supposed to assume that's what he wants.Does April run away with Perry? Does she marry her completely inoffensive fiance? Why does Perry's dead dog get a viking funeral pyre? How could any woman go through as many different hairstyles as April in just two weeks? If you're anxious to find out the answer to these or any other possible questions about Two Moon Junction you really need to get a hobby or a prescription for muscle relaxants.This movie has a lot of Sherilyn Fenn in the buff along with the aforementioned topless Kristy McNichol and the oddity of seeing Burl Ives in a softcore erotica flick. If any of that intrigues you and you can get it at a discount price go ahead a rent Two Moon Junction. If you want anything at all more than that forget about it.The sex scenes in this movie are short unmemorable and finally conclude with the camera spending an uncomfortably long time fixated on a nude and crying Fenn. McNichol's Patty Jean is the only interesting character in the entire story and none of them behave in a remotely believable or human way. The film doesn't even try and come up with a reason why April would screw around with this Fabiolike carny and it ends with a hilariously melodramatic action scene and a romp in a shower that makes you question if even these filmmakers thought there was a point to this story.Two Moon Junction was largely writerdirector Zalman King's big break. He went on from this to become the king of late night cable erotica with Red Shoes Diaries. I think his time and talent would have been better spent sacking groceries at HyVee.".

The point of this movie is to provide visual and aural candy for the eyes and the ears. TMJ has two very attractive and sexy leads in Sherilyn Fenn and Richard Tyson and the soundtrack nicely compliments the action. No it's not Shakespeare but it's fun.Zalman King loves to show beautiful women in his movies without worrying too much about a plot or dialogue that makes sense. All my women friends that have seen this movie love it because we as women all love looking at hunky Richard Tyson. Enough said.Another erotic movie to check out is Delta of Venus also by Zalman King. It does actually have a plot along with lots of sex. Anais Ninn the author of Delta of Venus would be proud of Mr. King's effort on this one.This is one I have viewed many times because it is such a great fantasy and a kick. Kristy MacNicol and the rest of the supporting cast is great too. I think this film will appeal more to women than to men. Just don't take it too seriously...".

TMJ has two very attractive and sexy leads in Sherilyn Fenn and Richard Tyson and the soundtrack nicely compliments the action. No it's not Shakespeare but it's fun.Zalman King loves to show beautiful women in his movies without worrying too much about a plot or dialogue that makes sense. All my women friends that have seen this movie love it because we as women all love looking at hunky Richard Tyson. Enough said.Another erotic movie to check out is Delta of Venus also by Zalman King. It does actually have a plot along with lots of sex. Anais Ninn the author of Delta of Venus would be proud of Mr. King's effort on this one.This is one I have viewed many times because it is such a great fantasy and a kick. Kristy MacNicol and the rest of the supporting cast is great too. I think this film will appeal more to women than to men. Just don't take it too seriously...";

Following Cannibal The Musical the duo of Trey Parker and Matt Stone satire the world of Adult Entertainment.The story follows the exploits of a Mormon missionary named Joe Trey Parker who by accident becomes the industry's biggest star Orgazmo. A sleazy producer makes Trey an unwilling indentured servant. Joe's life is also plagued by his religious devotion to the mother church and his fiance. Can Joe resolves these problems by the movie's end? Matt Stone costars as a set still photographer. Dian Bachar also costars as Orgazmo's sidekick and friend Choda Boy. Lloyd Kaufmann founder of Troma Studios and many stars of the Adult Entertainment make cameo appearances as well.I enjoyed this movie. It was real funny and highly entertaining. Trey Parker did a great job of writing and directing this movie. The movie is even better if you're familiar with the porn business or know some of the stars. Too bad this movie was barely released and it seems to have been forgotten about on video. If you love South Park or enjoyed Cannibal The Musical then I advise you to pick up a copy of this movie. You will not be disappointed.Highly recommended.".

Those who didn't enjoy this flick are either so religious that they shouldn't have watched it in the first place or are overly selfimportant and humorless people. That being said I really enjoyed Orgazmo. Parker doesn't just make fun of Mormons adult entertainment and superheroes as always he makes fun of himself and his own movie. How could he possibly do such a thing? Well it's easy when you have a sense of humor. The great Don Rickles once said Laugh. Laugh at other people and laugh at yourself. Believe me you'll like yourself a lot more when you can do that. As for Orgazmo see it yourself if you have a sense of humor. And if you don't then stay away from it. Or get really high and watch it.

Along with a funny cast of supporting characters this may not be Parker and Stone's best achievement yet matter of fact in a way it lacks the polish that their first collaboration Cannibal the Musical had it's still a worthy effort with enough laughs to make it worthwhile. If only once as a teen. B";

	schema:headline " Silly crude humor that isn't very funny  makes South Park look sophisticated";
	schema:reviewBody "Although I am not by any means obsessed with South Park I do think it's a very funny show and the film adaptation was hilarious. Trey Parker and Matt Stone can be quite funny and I thought certain scenes of Team America were genius. And others... not so much. But their second film outing Orgazmo has to be their weakest effort. I expected a clever and crude satire of the porn industry  instead I just got stupid crude humor without many laughs.I did chuckle a few times at some jokes that were so obvious and overthetop and juvenile that they hit the funnybone if you're in an amiable mood. But this is very selective taste and I'm sure most people wouldn't even find the silly jokes funny.Joe Young Parker is a Mormon who is recruited to star in a series of porn films called Orgazmo. Essentially the film is a kick in the face to religion and caused a lot of controversy when it was released. The MPAA tagged it with an NC17 rating and it flopped on release.It has a weak cult following now due to the success of Parker and Stone's reputations as funny troublemakers but the fact is that Orgazmo really is just controversial for the sake of being so. It's not nearly as funny as it thinks it is.On top of that the new DVD is a huge disappointment also. The cast commentary track is inaudible and barely distinguishable. The Wild commentary track is similarly hard to hear and pretty poor. When I read that Kevin Smith and Weird Al Yankovic were on the track I thought Wow. Little did I know that they are split into separate groups and only on the track for about ten minutes each. Yankovic is the funniest but most of his jokes are lame. Smith has never seen Orgazmo and only relays a story of how he used to hate Trey Parker and Matt Stone and his audio is recorded from a telephone conversation.The documentaries are stupid and poor and the rest of the special features are just plain lame.Overall a really disappointing experience.".

Oh look it's Ron Jeremy oh look it's Chasey Lain Shayla LaVeaux Serenity Juli Ashton Barocca Jeanna Fine Jacklyn Lick etc etc. It's not funny but it's distracting.  I'm sure the guys had fun with so many porn actresses around but that doesn't mean the jokes are funny.  And personally I think putting people like Max Hardcore up on a pedestal is in very poor taste even if porn is mainstream  watch some of his stuff and you'll see what I mean.The cast are silly  although I do like Parker's wide eyed performances but here he had little to work with.  The porn cameos are diverting for those who know but don't help the film.

Since all I knew about the film was that it reeked of Trey Parker's childish brand of tasteless banal humor I didn't think it would be on par with some of the funnier movies of the nineties. Man I hate being right all the time. During the first three quarters of the movie that's all my friends and I could stomach before turning it off I think I might have chuckled once. I can't believe Parker had actually improved on his mediocre juvenile body of work with South Park and Team America World Police. This film didn't even have shock value a seemingly musthave for Parker. It chronicles a Mormon missionary's transformation into a male porn star. Sound stupid? It actually plays out worse than it sounds. But it's not the plot that drives a decent comedy it's the humor right!? I wish it did. The jokes in this movie are so witless it makes South Park look like Frasier. Running gags that aren't funny the first time are rehashed again and again in the same pointless manner. Instead of making satirical jabs at the porn industry or the Mormon religion Parker makes dimwitted toilet jokes and calls his sidekick Choda boy. That's not even funny! Which brings me to the other downsides of this movie. Other than an unfunny trite script and a stupid story the cinematography is horrible even for a comedy flick the characters range from annoying to detestable and the poor production quality makes this movie even worse than it already is. The only thing shocking about this movie is that Trey Parker wasn't lynched for making it. If I could I would give this movie negative stars. Avoid at all costs. Rent Billy Madison Wayne's World or Tommy Boy instead. Don't waste your money on this witless wonder.".

	schema:reviewBody "In my opinion House of 1000 Corpses is a fan movie. Fans of both the horror genre and Rob Zombie are likely to love it. Though I do not count myself a fan of either I do like both at times and I am quite familiar with both. Those familiar with Rob Zombie are likely to be the only ones who completely 'get' this clever little film  appreciating its depraved sense of humor and nihilism. Zombie's themes are fairly consistent  evil without the usual religious connotations and clichs murder sex insanity and stereotype hillbillies. Zombie's world is not a place for people who are terribly concerned with reality but for Zombie himself it seems to supply endless muse for a prolific and interesting commercial creativity.Two couples traveling across country and working on a book on bizarre roadside attractions stumble across a filling station  theme park run by a vaguely evil clown with a bad attitude  Captain Spaulding. Spaulding teaches them of a few local legends including a mad surgeon who worked in a local insane asylum and came to be known as Dr. Satan for the grotesque surgical procedures he applied to mental patients in secret. They pick up a pretty blonde hitchhiker on their way to see the tree where Dr Satan was hung and run into some car problems so the hitchhiker invites them to her family house. The family apparently headed by the phenomenally weird Karen Black makes The Addams family look like the Brady Bunch.My narrative has described the first 20 minutes or so of the film and at this point the film much like RZ's songs is so campy that it seems a straightforward horror comedy. However once our protagonists are in the house the plot takes a decidedly more sinister spin and never lets up from that point forward.This film successfully and entertainingly portrays all of RZ's themes in about the same proportions as his music. Of them all sex is the least explored and I for one am thankful for that. The film also walks a delicate line between Hannibal Lector grotesque art realism and supernatural forces. For example at one point one of the bad guys turns on a cassette player with low batteries so that the voice recorded on it sounds extrasatanic.If you have problems with blood and other bodily fluids and utterly repulsive surgically induced variations on the human body you might want to avoid this film. If you don't have any great objections to standard hardcore horror imagery or if you like it you might want to see this. It is masterfully visualized and does a much better job of making horror into art than the standard Hollywood horror fair. This is Rob Zombie's art and he does it much better than most. This first major effort in film bodes well for his future use of the medium and I will look forward to his next.".

If you're idea of a horror film is I know What You Did Last Summer and you consider Scream and The Exorcist to be the most shocking films ever made this is not a film for you. If you havent seen I Spit on Your Grave Evil Dead Texas Chainsaw Massacre Dawn of the Dead or Last House on the Left this is not a film for you. If you've never listened to Living Dead Girl or Superbeast this is not a film for you.Now having said that this is a film for me. It is a film for true horror fans the kind that stay up and watch Dawn of the Dead and The Beyond who know who Lucio Fulci and Dario Argento and George Romero are. This is a film that was meant to be seen by people like this and will only be enjoyed by people like this. This is not exactly mainstream stuff here. Only a small percentage of people enjoy this stuff and for those people this film is a true rivival of classic exploitive horror.Rob Zombie has created a homage to 1970's exploitationhorror films and he has been extremly successful in achieving that goal. The film borrows largely from Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Last House on the Left with his own little bits of original demential thrown in and an assortment of other horror film references. The film tells the tale of four teenagers who are terrorized and tortured by a bizarre southern family living in a remote farmhouse in 1977. The film uses all sorts of camera tricksnegative colouring splitscreens and seemingly random inserts of grainy snufflike footage of various SM and gore images the offthewall effect is similar to what Oliver Stone did in Natural Born Killers. The film is not about plot or about characters. Its purpose is to shock and disturb to serve no other function than to entertain through exploitation and disgusting and bizarre violence. Just as you think the limits of weirdness are approaching Zombie takes the film a step farther and before long you surrender yourself to the mercy of the film and just accept things for what they are. The film has the feeling of an out of control freight train being piloted by a madman and the climax of the film is truly bizarre. The reviewers who wrote the film off as overlysadistic with little in the ways of character development plot or suspence have come to see a different kind of film perhaps more at home with titles like The Sixth Sense or Silence of the Lambs. The have no busineness debasing a great film like this.Rob Zombie has created a film that is both a homage and derivative at the same time most things in the film have been done before in one shape or another and the level of gore is a fraction of what was intended due to its shameful Rrating. To see the inevitable Unrated Directors Cut on video is going to be a true horror experience.But this film is something has hasnt been seen in decades and it has been made with the utmost care that only a true horror fan could provide. It is a film made by horror fans for horror fans a true labor of love by Mr. Zombie despite some flaws. If you arent sitting the theater going hey theres Bill Mosely from TCM 2! or hey that shot is a homage to the cover of Evil Dead! or hey he wears peoples skin like Leatherface! then you probably arent meant to be seeing this film. But for those who are the film is a true gem and a rarity it is a kind of film that hasnt been seen on the screens in over twenty years and probably wont be for another twenty years. Get out there and enjoy this rare experience while you still can.An instant culthit.Grade AFor true horror fans only. Everyone else just wont get it.".

Some of the sequences in this film are so damn close to brilliant that I can't possibly figure out why I didn't love them right away!! The executionscene guided by the moody I Remember Yousong for example is amazingly atmospheric and quite unsettling.

	schema:reviewBody "I love that line!  I remember hearing that line in a cool trailer I saw while watching Urban Legend 2.  Obviously this was a way better movie!!! Besides Scream and Funny Games this is the best horror film in the past 15 years!!!  We wanted blood and we got it!!! Whoa that would have been another great line in this uber celebration of depravity as those lame Universal execs so succinctly called it.  This flick was definitely worth the wait!!!First off the directing Rob Zombie gave this film a unique visual style I had never seen in a film before.  It was well made and very well edited. I loved the splitscreens filters stock footage use of color and that infamous slow motion shot I loved that scene!.  Although he borrowed a little from Natural Born Killers Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Last House on the Left what great horror film doesn't nowadays?  Seriously!! So Mr. Zombie brought something new to the table and will hopefully make a great contribution to horror he has already in my opinion.Secondly the acting Sid Haig and Bill Moseley totally stole the show!! They made horrifying creepy and relentless screen sickos and gave me hope for the screen villain again as opposed to lame efforts by thugs in cheap masks.  Mrs. Zombie or Sheri Moon was totally insane as well as hot! Also genre veterans Karen Black Micheal J. Pollard and Irwin Keyes brought creepiness to their insane roles!  Tom Towles was also good in a good guy role!  The late Dennis Fimple was hilarious as Grandpa Hugo! Newcomers Matthew McGrory and Robert Mukes were disturbing in their roles as Tiny and Rufus. As for the victims Chris Hardwick's Jerry was the only one I reasonably liked.  The other three made lame efforts at acting and need lessons from Marilyn Burns and the cast of The Hills Have Eyes!! So it was hard to root for them which was another twisted feat that Zombie accomplished.  I actually rooted for the villains!!!!Thirdly the music I loved the music!! It fit well with the atmosphere of the film!  I own the soundtrack and I loved it!  My favorite song was the title theme of course!  I was expecting songs from Black Sabbath The Stooges Sex Pistols Alice Cooper Deep Purple King Crimson Blue Oyster Cult and other creepy bands but oh well.  I was satisfied.  I also loved the film's score.Lastly the atmosphere at the theater I was at It was totally insane!!! People were screaming jumping laughing walking out and commenting loudly on how awesome it was!!!  I was surprised there was such a packed audience and it was barnone the best theatergoing experience I had ever had!!!Overall this film is a creepy intense amazing disturbing and darkly funny attack on the senses!!!  I definitely can't wait to see it again in the theater and to buy the DVD!  Finally a real horror movie with balls the size of Canada has hit the masses!!!  This gives me great hope for the new wave of horror the 70's throwback horror film!! There's plenty this year with Irreversible Cabin Fever Wrong Turn Jeepers Creepers 2 Highwayman and the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake!!!  Out of Five Stars FIVE STARS!!!!!  See this movie!! All Rob Zombie fans metal music fans horror fans or people who want to see a hardcore horror film should go out and see this movie!! If you like it you're awesome!! If you don't I guess you're not ready for hardcore horror.".

	onyx:emotionText "I love that line!  I remember hearing that line in a cool trailer I saw while watching Urban Legend 2.  Obviously this was a way better movie!!! Besides Scream and Funny Games this is the best horror film in the past 15 years!!!  We wanted blood and we got it!!! Whoa that would have been another great line in this uber celebration of depravity as those lame Universal execs so succinctly called it.  This flick was definitely worth the wait!!!First off the directing Rob Zombie gave this film a unique visual style I had never seen in a film before.  It was well made and very well edited. I loved the splitscreens filters stock footage use of color and that infamous slow motion shot I loved that scene!.  Although he borrowed a little from Natural Born Killers Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Last House on the Left what great horror film doesn't nowadays?  Seriously!! So Mr. Zombie brought something new to the table and will hopefully make a great contribution to horror he has already in my opinion.Secondly the acting Sid Haig and Bill Moseley totally stole the show!! They made horrifying creepy and relentless screen sickos and gave me hope for the screen villain again as opposed to lame efforts by thugs in cheap masks.  Mrs. Zombie or Sheri Moon was totally insane as well as hot! Also genre veterans Karen Black Micheal J. Pollard and Irwin Keyes brought creepiness to their insane roles!  Tom Towles was also good in a good guy role!  The late Dennis Fimple was hilarious as Grandpa Hugo! Newcomers Matthew McGrory and Robert Mukes were disturbing in their roles as Tiny and Rufus. As for the victims Chris Hardwick's Jerry was the only one I reasonably liked.  The other three made lame efforts at acting and need lessons from Marilyn Burns and the cast of The Hills Have Eyes!! So it was hard to root for them which was another twisted feat that Zombie accomplished.  I actually rooted for the villains!!!!Thirdly the music I loved the music!! It fit well with the atmosphere of the film!  I own the soundtrack and I loved it!  My favorite song was the title theme of course!

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this first on cable channel in early 2004. Wasn't that impressed as a horror fan. Rob Zombie's debut is a throwback to the horror films of yesteryear. Stirring in elements of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. He did an awesome Devils rejects bad Halloween remakes n waiting for his new flick 31. His debut is a throwback to the horror films of yesteryear. It offers nothing new. It was not scary gory suspenseful or tension filled. It was full of clich n just painstakingly obvious. A real stand out is the use of color. The photography is surprisingly good for a horror effort. Another big reason to watch is Sid Haig who acted in many 70s classic exploitation efforts. His recent Bone Tomahawk was awesome. Agreed he had a very small role. The film contains stylistic references to just about every 'cuttingedge' horror technique of the seventies shakycam pointofviewcamera negative exposure etc. The dark humor was the best thing about the film creating an interesting atmosphere. Sid Haig as Captain Spaulding was definitely this movie's highlight. Also it has horror veteran Bill Moseley.".

	schema:reviewBody "Now let's not get carried away here is this the best horror flick ever? Not that I've seen.  Does it sometimes trip over the fine line between scares and laughs?  Sure.  Will it remind people of certain other movies? Probably.  But bottom line is this movie a blast?  Absolutely.Writerdirector Rob Zombie's music has always had a kind of comic bookhorror movie sensibility which he translates into his screen project a tribute to the pioneering takenoprisoners classics of the 1970's like The Hills Have Eyes and Texas Chainsaw Massacre in fact a prominent role is played by Bill Moseley of TCM II.  We're informed at the outset that it's Halloween Eve 1977 in some onehorse town in an unspecified region of the country which of course allows each actor to use any accent he or she likes even within the same household.  The chief attraction of this town seems to be a horror museum run by a Captain Spaulding who bears no resemblance to Groucho Marx played by veteran Bmovie stalwart Sid Haig whom I recall from way the hell back in Busting as the big menacing bald guy.  He's still big and bald but not so much menacing as jovially deranged with undercurrents of menace and lots of makeup.  After a delightfully overwritten robbery sequence involving a couple of local yokels four freshfaced young people with one foot in the grave show up at the museum setting in motion a series of unpleasant events.No particular reason to dwell on the plot especially if you've seen Texas Chainsaw Massacre andor it's sequels.  It's the triedandtrue damsels and their boyfriends in distress.  We even get a pack of cheerleaders thrown in as a bonus.  Apparently people have been going missing in this town but back in the Seventies the term serial killer was waiting to be invented so no squads of Feds and profilers have arrived.   For movies like this to work the actors have to be on the same page in tone aside from Haig and Moseley I barely knew anyone except Walt Goggins from TV's The Shield and of course Karen Black whose performance is the only one that doesn't quite click.  It's like she's playing a whack job where the others are just being whack jobs.  But if they ever wanted to remake Whatever Happened to Baby Jane  there's your girl!   In terms of direction Zombie takes a kind of kitchensink approach some of it reminded me of Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers and others of that ilk with the eyeblink jumping to and from videotape color variations flashback andor fantasy etc.  Some of the editing's a little too jumbled in the modern trend of trying to obscure what's happening although not to the Darkness Falls degree of complete chaos.  I'm oldfashioned I still think the best way to scare you with something in a movie is just train the camera on it so you can see it coming at you with no way to escape.  But Mr. Zombie has a nice feel for where to put the camera and how to move a scene along. Some of his sequences have a kind of sinister poetry to them like when the two deputies go checking out the homestead from hell the kind of setup we've seen in how many shlock items I just saw one in a recent victim of the Mystery Science Theater 3000 crew but in this case Zombie replaces all sound with a Slim Whitman tune we recall how Whitman's voice was enough to slay bigbrained Martians a while back and holds the final crane shot an audaciously long time.  Then once the coffin gets lowered into the water towards the end House kicks into overdrive and from then on if there's nothing in the movie that spooks you then maybe you're unspookable.  I know a lot of that imagery will be lingering with me for a while such as Fish Boy.....Ordinarily I try to ignore a movie's external circumstances and go by what's on the screen in front of me but in this case it's pointless to pretend this movie has not been in limbo for three years due to it's supposedly violent content.  I've read it had to be cut to make the R rating although I really can't see how an NC17 would've hurt it people will go see it partly because it's by Rob Zombie and it's said to be gory and for those put off by such factors an R rating won't make them less put off.  Hey honey it's an R nowforget the babysitter let's bring the kids!   I've also read Zombie was satisfied with the released version.  As released there's really nothing there you haven't seen before in some form or other some gore fans may even feel let down but of course there's always the DVD.  I think that had it been released as made three years ago without all the hype with the chance to sneak up on us it would've been even more effective.  But maybe that's what the studio feared?  Well Mr. Movie Mogul if you're going to commission the guy from White Zombie to do a horror flick what exactly do you anticipate as a result?  Please either defecate or get off the toilet....Hard to nail down a favorite moment with this one but it's hard to resist picking the youngsters getting abused in their bunny suits.  It's visually striking it's unusual it's blackly funny and also somewhat unsettling the more you think about it.  When we watch a horror flick what exactly are we anticipating?  Is the onesided nature of the conflict overwhelming villain hapless or helpless victim part of the appeal for us?  Do we identify with the chaser or the chasee? Should we feel a little ashamed of ourselves afterwards?  Or as Captain Spaulding put it are these just a bunch of jackass questions?Great soundtrack I may have to buy it....".

They are a bizarre and sadistic backwater family of serial killers .The motion picture mixes a deal of gore  terror  screams  and spooky atmosphere . The storyline has got certain likeness to Texas chainsaw massacre  along with Ed Gein and 2000 maniacs. The film's script was constantly changing throughout filming leading to an entirely different ending at one point . The actual house is the same used in The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas1982 which can be viewed during Universal Studio's tram ride. However during filming Universal refused to cease the tram tours which delayed filming during many scenes .There isn't interpretation of the actors because they only kill and shout . However  the cinematography by Alex Poppas and Tom Richmond is nice to difference Texas massacre which was granulated and wornout . There are some black and white flashbacks upon killers  it is the most interesting bit of the film . This is Rob Zombie's directorial debut  and was filmed in 2000 but wasn't released until three years later. Rob Zombie has said that he was constantly shooting two versions of the gorier scenes to appease Universal. For instance a shot at the start of the film in which the robber who was stabbed with the Axe is on the floor was shot two ways with blood and without blood . The movie will appeal strong emotions enthusiasts and gore fans. Rating 510 average .".

People were understandably a little sceptical of Rob Zombie's debut as a director but knowing myself that the man is a scholar of the modern horror movie and a raving fanboy himself I had high expectations of House. I was not disappointed. From the demented and hilarious opening sequence through to the surreal and terrifying ending Zombie's first foray into direction and writing gives the world of cinema a much needed boot in the pants.Is it gory? Well yeah it is but it's never gory in an absolutely horrific fashion. What's such a pleasant surprise is that the movie despite being a homage to the bleak and nihilistic 70s horror boom is full of wellpainted fullbodied characters and rich dark humour. House of 1000 Corpses is an absolute blast to watch never wallowing in darkness and only really becoming a terrorride toward the very end meaning it's a movie that while not for all the family could well put a smile on at least some of their faces.The movies combination of goresoaked serialkiller horror Tim Burtonesque visuals and Evil Dead's sense of humour is a fresh turn from a genre currently stuck largely in bleak apartment buildings full of longfaced pouty heroines and even longerfaced pouty ghouls. Yeah it isn't that tense but it's wickedly funny wonderfully psychedelic and chock full of demented setpieces. To be honest I'd almost forgot what it was like to be entertained by horror before I watched this.A lot of people love to dissect this movie and venerate it's influences but the bottom line is unlike Kill Bill which relied on you being as nerdy as Tarantino to enjoy it Zombie's movie is fun whether or not you've seen the movies he doffs his threadbare circus hat to. It's a warped psychedelic delve into mania that'll make you laugh out loud and keep you on the edge of your seat. Watch it. Watch it ASAP.".

Throw in Texas Chainsaw Massacre add a little Eaten Alive and a dash of FunHouse and you'll get the flavor of this film. Four twenty somethings are riding along the back southern roads when they come across a roadside carnival run by an eccentric clown named Captain Spaulding. He gives them a personnel tour of his fun house of horrors and tells them the tale of a local ghoul named Doctor Satan. Inspired by phantasmagorical tale of the good doctor they decide to search for his grave. Captain Spaulding draws them a map and gives them directions to an area where the Doctor allegedly died. On the road they meet a pretty blond hitchhiker who also knows about the legend of Doctor Satan...and a little more! What happens next? You'll have to visit House of 1000 Corpses!A great film that does what it sets out to do. I'm so glad to see old school grind house horror is back in the mainstream. A sequel is out and it's even better! I have to strongly recommend this movie. You won't regret it!".

If not do yourself a favor and go watch it and then come back and treat yourself to Rob Zombies wonderful homage House of 1000 Corpses. The film is all homage and humor but it would be wrong to call it parody. The film is really lovingly done.Now mind you this isn't in the same class as movies like Apocalypse Now and Citizen Kane. It is however still beautiful. The style is almost in overkill and is where most of the entertainment is derived from. The story is secondary. Like many a horror film it's about a group of young people who go where they shouldn't and pssoff I can't believe I had to censor this word some creepy hicks. In this case they are looking for Doctor Satan a local legend who might just be real. From there it follows the Texas Chainsaw Massacre formula pretty closely but far better than any of that films sequels ever did. The film is very inventive and keeps from being very boring or very predictable. I was able to guess at a few things but then I watch a lot of horror films.A real stand out is the use of color. The photography is surprisingly good for a horror effort. Another big reason to watch is Sid Haig who acted in many 70s classic exploitation efforts. The guy has always been fun to watch and is really funny here.After this I'm really looking forward to Zombies's The Devil's Rejects".

This movie seems to be a pandering attempt at teenagers who simply desire some sort of shock and gore with an almost elitist feeling of trying to seem as a homage but just comes off as a cheap bootleg version.

House of 1000 Corpses is a throwback to old school horror movies such as Texas Chainsaw Massacre but succeeds much more. It is about  four friends who are driving cross country and are returning home after a long trip. Late on Halloween eve they stop by a sleazy gas station and next to it is The Museum Of Monsters And Madmen owned by Captain Spaulding Sid Haig. Interested and curious they check it out and end up riding a murder ride inside the museum learning a bit more about a local legend Dr. Satan. They then head for the road and pick up a strange hitchiker Baby Sheri Moon. Their car then breaks down and Baby takes them to her house not far up the road. They then are pulled into a world of torture and violence as they are captured by a family of insane lunatics who want them dead.I have to say congrats to Mr. Zombie! He has created a horror masterpiece that may become a historical landmark in film history such as others have done before. Zombie's directing debut is wonderful and had some uniqe and unusual touches to make the film that much more bizarre and spooky such as the split screen effect I mean I haven't seen that used since the movie Carrie! The movie also had strange flashbacks and flashforwards. I recommend this movie to any horror fan! You won't be disappointed! I'm surprised it took 3 years to get a company to buy this movie! I can't believe Universal turned it down! I give House of 1000 Corpses a 1010.".

That place would have been crawling with cops my suspension of disbelief doesn't go that far.I don't mind downbeat endings sometimes I find them preferable but this ending just took the cake I think mostly because it wasn't presented as a downbeat ending again I get the feeling that RZ views this as a happy ending. Also if they were going to end it that way couldn't at least one of the villains have gotten their comeuppance? I would have loved to see that evil annoying but very pretty blond bimbo get whacked. But of course I think the director saw them as the heroes of the movie.I felt dirty after watching this movie.".

Though most of the group is wary of the stranger they find within Bill is enthralled for he is penning a book of offbeat roadside attractions. When Spaulding invites them to take in the Museum's premiere attractionthe Murder Ridethey embark into a world of darkness where Life and death are meaningless and pain is God. But for these four travelers this strange ride is just the beginning. The plot may not be original but it does sound like it has some potential. It didn't work out so well as the film isn't very good. I was expecting a good horror film that would be fun to watch but I didn't really get that. Rob Zombie directed and wrote the film and he apparently watched a lot of old horror films. The film just felt like a collection of old horror clichs. House of 1000 Corpses also gets really ridiculous at times and the film seems like it wants to achieve cult status which it probably will. The acting was average with some performances being scary and others being terrible. The best was Bill Moseley and his performance was effective. The film is very disturbing as some scenes and images were defiantly very creepy. Its also very gory but that doesn't mean its scary. It also sometimes goes over the top on the gore. The running time is only 88 minutes long though it does get boring at times. There were a lot of horror flicks that were released in 2003 and this one is probably at the bottom of the list. There's a sequel coming out soon that I'll probably end up watching and hopefully they will improve. In the end this is a predictable unoriginal horror flick that's worth skipping. Rating 4.310 horror fans and everyone else should skip this film.".

That's what makes a film truly bad the fact that despite its overbearing weaknesses it isn't even entertaining!Many people look back at the sixties and think with obvious resentment for today's cinematic output that they don't make them like this anymore!. Watching Manos... would cure any breed of hardcore nostalgia.In the end I can not advise against this strongly enough.

It is also painfully slow. this film makes might barely last 70 minutes but you will feel like you've aged ten years by the end of it. That's what makes a film truly bad the fact that despite its overbearing weaknesses it isn't even entertaining!Many people look back at the sixties and think with obvious resentment for today's cinematic output that they don't make them like this anymore!. Watching Manos... would cure any breed of hardcore nostalgia.In the end I can not advise against this strongly enough. This is for the masochist in you or the sadist if you insist on showing it to friends. Any other part of your person can only feel pained or offended by such extreme trash!";

Not because it's poorly done because there are movies like Monster AGoGo that are more poorly conceived acted directed filmed and edited. But Manos stands out because it is so incomprehensibly bad. It is SO bad that it is hard to imagine it was done by accident. It often seems like they film is supposed to be bad and that the director is actually brilliantly creating a horrible film because this kind of badness doesn't usually come from apathy or a lack of talent and money. This is worse.The film is also very icky and very dull. Almost nothing happens certainly not anything interesting and if you survive the first ten minutes of driving around the countryside you'll just want everyone in the film to die.However because this movie is so brilliantly and incredibly bad I suggest everyone watch it just to know it. Everyone should see Citizen Kane because it is the watermark for all good movies. Everyone should see Manos for the same reason. It puts all other bad movies to shame. I do suggest though that it be watched ONLY as the MST3K version since the team does a good job riffing the film. Even they seem to be too caught up in the film's reeking badness at times that they are just stunned but they still do a good job. I also doubt you would find a regular version of this movie since I doubt anyone would be crazy enough to have one.Interestingly the guy who plays the mean stupid and totally useless husband wrote directed and produced the film and the guy who plays The Master did the art direction. They both failed in all their work. No one in this movie has ever done anything else. Thank God.".

What I find sort of amusing is that after a third or fourth viewing yes I admit it I'm a masochist is that it's sort of grown on me a bit. Like a fungus!Manos is about a small family of yankees who get lost in the southwestern US and end up in a place from which nobody can leave in an Inn overseen by a twitching humangoat hybrid named Torgo who steals the show and owned by the enigmatic Master  a worshipper of Manos who collects wives through trapping them at his inn. I guess you can figure the rest of the film out pretty easily. This ends up being a horror film with virtually no horror an action film with the most poorly shot action sequences I've ever seen and an artsy jazz vehicle with such poor acoustic sound quality that it would have been much better with just the groovy soundtrack and no dialog.The biggest problem with Manos is what we call Production values. To cut to the chase there are none.There is too much wrong with this film to list it all out so instead I will list what's right with it. The acting is not entirely awful  but the sound editing pacing and camera work are so bad that the actors all look totally ridiculous at all times. The script is not the worst I've seen but it is lost in the jerks and irks of the pace dramamine recommended and finally the plot is no worse than some of the recent Hollywood horror catastrophes I have seen but it to is swept up in the maelstrom of maleficence emanating from the director's chair.The result would make a great object example for a film production class in what not to do. Most people will find this film tedious idiotic and unwatchable. The average person I think will turn it off after the first 5 minutes of countryside pans during the opening driving scenes.Some would argue that my rating of 2 is too high. I won't argue that point but I will explain that I reserve 1 for those truly aggravating films which do more harm then good serve no purpose and do nothing to expand the boundaries of contemporary filmmakers' and cinemagoers imaginations. Most of these are commercial Hollywood romantic and sex comedies and horror films. Manos at least occupies an important place in filmmaking history and should really be seen by wouldbe filmmakers and participants. At least it didn't cost much to make and at least it does no real long lasting harm. Can't say the same for for example American Pie. For these reasons I reserve the rating 1 for such truly harmful films. The distinction is best made through an analogy. If you buy a refrigerator for 3000 and it breaks down immediately upon the expiration of the warranty that refrigerator has done you some harm. If you buy one for 300 and it does the same you should count yourself lucky.".

I lost count of the number of times I was beaten over the head with a totally obvious point. I lost count of the number of times completely random stuff just happened with no genesis or consequence. I certainly didn't lose count of the number of locations used or the number of musical cues you could count those on one hand after a circular saw accident. It baffled me that they never realised that you can't shoot film at night without some form of lighting. And the music itself... oh God. I don't need to warn you about spoilers there's plenty to complain about without resorting to inconsequential detail. Like the way that every time it cuts to the family they're just standing for no reason in the same spot waiting to talk to the camera. Like the absolutely shocking and disgraceful editing. People jump from awake to asleep and back from one spot to another from happy to sad instantaneously. The awful acting... I don't know its like everyone was given a piece of paper with some emoticons for happy sad scared and angry and told to learn them off. The dialogue... well technically it is dialogue in the same way that McDonalds is food. Well some people might enjoy McDonalds. See I can't think of a parallel awfulness Manos is to bad as... you can't finish that sentence.Good Lord I could go on and on and on but I won't. This film cannot warrant anything but a 110 on IMDb.

This is not.Seriously you really really need to be in a masochistic kinda mood to see this out. I had to leave the screen timer on after 45 minutes just so I could keep reminding myself that second by second it would end. Because Hell itself might just be neverending Manos.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I watch a film for the first time it is generally quite easy for me to establish an initial opinion of the film at hand. At times I will come to this very website and submit a rating of the given film or perhaps I will turn to a friend and give my thoughts of the film which tend to be quite clear. Well after reading quite a few extremely hyped reviews and discussions throughout the internet I decided to try my luck and buy the alleged worst film of all time ''Manos' The Hands of Fate'. Let it be clear that this review does not pertain to the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version of the film rather it applies to Hal P. Warren's original cutanddry El Pasoborn version of the film. ''Manos' The Hands of Fate' may very well be one of the only films of which classification is painstakingly difficult to nearimpossible. The film leaves a quaint surreal and indecisive effect upon the viewer which is what leads to the formulation of this strange conclusion.Warren's film opens on a vacationing family traveling through El Paso Texas. The family consists of little Debbie Jackey Neyman Margaret Diane Mahree and Mike played by our very own Hal P. Warren. Surely enough the travelers are soon found lost on the way to their vacation site. They eventually turn onto a long dirt road marked by a sign promising a Valley Lodge. After a great deal of aimless meandering throughout the backwoods of El Paso the vacationers come across a mysterious Lodge run by an awkward and deformed Satyr named Torgo John Reynolds. Seeing as it is getting late the visitors ask about staying the night only to be deterred by Torgo's ominous words The master would not approve. After some pressure from the family Torgo folds and allows the newcomers to stay. As the visitors enter the lodge they are welcomed by a mantel full of strange handlike pagan icons and sculptures accompanied by a strange portrait of presumably The Master and his hound. As Michael and his wife Margaret observe the strangeness of the portrait and their surroundings a strange howl is heard from outside in the desert. Soon strange happenings begin around this lodge of sins as Michael and his family's fate is determined by the hands of fateTo be blunt the film is simply quite technically limited. Supposedly the film was shot entirely on one camera which was only capable of shooting 60 seconds of film at a time. To say that this hurt the film would be an untrue if anything it helped the pacing of this little lowbudget flick. Hal P. Warren was a director with literally no experience or conceived directorial abilities he had no knowledge of pacing or camera work if he had any it was most likely limited to home videos. The acting for the most part is quite dismal the only exception being a wonderful character conceived by Warren named Torgo. Reynolds' portrayal of Torgo is supreme although having no professional training or profession acting experience in cinema he creates a one ofakind character which has been quite unparalleled in cultcinema. No matter how much one hates this film they will always remember the timid and tormented Torgo uttering his infamous line The Master would not approve. The music featured in the film is quite repetitive and amateur although at times it does add to the feel aid the pacing and promote the overall campfactor of the film which was sometimes delightful. The cinematography is certainly not noteworthy nor is the lighting. The editing seemed to have been done with haste and is one of the key factors which seems to have earned this film its reputation. One thing however which is not widely criticized by viewers is the plot. It is a plot with great potential that was realized by Warren at the time it would have been quite fresh. Interestingly enough it could vaguely be seen as a blundering early version of 'The Texas Chain Saw Massacre' not to say that Tobe Hooper drew any influence from ''Manos' The Hands of Fate'.Well this is widely considered to be the downright worst of the worst  the bottom of the bottom. As stated earlier I cannot place this film on a scale of one to ten yet I can argue that this is a false statement. Almost every aspect of the film is done poorly yet as odd as it sounds the movie generates a charming and enjoyable little atmosphere it simply does not feel like the worst one out there. There are plenty of films which are far less enjoyable to watch than Manos. Technically speaking the assumption can be made that it is the worst but then again there are films with far more dismal lighting far more sloppy camera work and far worse pacing. One could contend that the acting is downright dismal and corpselike in every respect yet there are films with worse acting and absolutely no memorable or quotable Torgo  whether it be mocking or homage characters. Hence in many respects Hal Warren's single 1966 production isn't the worst piece of celluloid out there yet at the same time it possess many if not all of the qualities which could be attributed to the worst film of all time. However the goal of this review was not to debunk the position in cinema history ''Manos' The Hands of Fate' has achieved but rather to offer a little insight into what this film has to offer. In all fairness I enjoyed it in a wonderful campy and surreal sort of way... after all what other film is out there like this? What film is there that was made on possibly the lowest budget of all time featuring the work of the most cinematically inept individuals yet despite these obvious flaws has kept people talking about it for years to come?".

At times I will come to this very website and submit a rating of the given film or perhaps I will turn to a friend and give my thoughts of the film which tend to be quite clear. Well after reading quite a few extremely hyped reviews and discussions throughout the internet I decided to try my luck and buy the alleged worst film of all time ''Manos' The Hands of Fate'. Let it be clear that this review does not pertain to the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version of the film rather it applies to Hal P. Warren's original cutanddry El Pasoborn version of the film. ''Manos' The Hands of Fate' may very well be one of the only films of which classification is painstakingly difficult to nearimpossible. The film leaves a quaint surreal and indecisive effect upon the viewer which is what leads to the formulation of this strange conclusion.Warren's film opens on a vacationing family traveling through El Paso Texas.

Manos is morally the true winner here in that respect.Not much can be said that has not been said already about this movie.

Not since the days of the triple bill dusktodawn drive in have there been so many craptastic movies clamoring for the viewer's attention.Still even in this new era of Troma productions and legions of Z level horror movies Manos is the champ. Sure there are worse written and directed and performed horror movies available Rock And Roll Nightmare II The Intercessor and Existo come to mind immediately but Manos is special. Manos is different.Manos The Hands Of Fate isn't so much a bad movie as it is an antimovie. Not one scene not one shot not one line of spoken dialog works as cinematic entertainment. To put the metaphor another way it isn't even that the photography writing costumes etc are incompetent...it's more like the whole film was done by people who didn't seem to realize they were supposed to be making a film instead of an 8th grade dramatic production of Helter Skelter.Again there have been flatter performances and worse actors captured on film Roger Corman alone is responsible for 30000 lines of dialog that ring more false than what we hear in Manos. But there is a decent spooky film trying to get out from under the ruins of the screenplay here and that dissonance makes the experience even worse for the viewer. For instance the actor playing Torgo truly looks emotionally damaged like someone you'd find on the floor of a bus station rest room but his speeches are circular exasperating and delivered in a shaky badly mixed alto that makes me wish he'd just SHUT UP. There's a nasty little moment where Torgo is sacrificed so his master can create a totem device called the Hand Of Glory...but it's staged with all the panache of a salon washandset. The whole movie is like that. I feel badly for the director  he obviously had a nice little LovecraftDerleth style horror story he wanted to tell and some evocative Satanic ritualistic vibes he wanted to convey. But every single artistic judgment he made here  how long to hold the shots how to pace the speech rhythms of the actors how to stage the lingerie wrestling scene with the wives how to mix the dubbed vocals how to end the film...every single aspect of the film was wrongheaded and bad and irritating.Every student and connoisseur of bad horror films should see Manos and get their horizons broadened about how wrongheaded and illadvised it is possible to be when it comes to making a film. You may see films that are technically worse but I can guarantee than it is Manos that sticks in your memory long after you've forgotten the others.".

The Master and his hellbeast are as much evil personified as Margaret is the embodiment of goodness and chastity. In a way this is the definitive modernday equivalent of Goethe's Faust though even more sublime in the simple poetry of its dialogue. When Torgo describes his master as being not dead the way you know it' and with us always' he is speaking for all of us how we truly live on through the memory of our words and deeds in the minds of those who follow us be they righteous or malevolent.Hal Warran not only changed the face of the Texan film industry by encapsulating such a grand story in less than 75 minutes it also helped usher in a whole new perspective of looking at film discovering different forms which never would have been conceived. Also it's obviously a very personal film for Warren who allows us to share his love and devotion to the project and it is a truly moving cathartic experience.It will make you laugh it will make you cry and maybe  just maybe  you'll learn a little bit about yourself.".

As a fan of terrible movies I bought a DVD of the original version however I was disappointed with the high quality of this movie.Why isn't this the worst movie ever? It makes a few classic mistakes Firstly it's obvious from the start that this movie is utter tripe an excellent terrible movie will start out with great promise and dig a bottomless pit. Secondly one actor in the film is reasonably good an excellent terrible movie will be sure to select untalented individuals of the same caliber. Thirdly some scenes are so terrible they are funny an excellent terrible movie has no funny scenes and should lead to feelings of resentment and anger. Finally the plot stranded family spends the night with a cult group is somewhat consistent an excellent terrible movie will have no plot forget it's plot or jump incongruously from scene to scene. In all fairness Manos has a number of irrelevant scenes but the main plot is consistently maintained.Some general shortcomings of this movie It suffers from extremely poor editing some of the worst I've seen Most of the movie is boring It is not scary this is supposed to be a horror film The acting is poor with the exception of Tom Neyman who was decent The music is repetitious.I'm afraid that I can do no better than lump this movie in the worst top 5 I've seen which still earns it a solid 1  10.Movies that I consider worse than this Ironheart the only movie that makes me furious for wasting time watching it overall worst movie Glen or Glenda excruciatingly boring worst plot Delta Force Commando by far the worst acting worst special effects Starship excruciatingly boring".

I couldn't tell if the actors were purposely repeating this over and over or if the editing was just so bad they forgot to take out the second line.4Acting The acting is one of a kind. In this case that is not a good thing. The acting is extremely forced especially in the case of Torgo. All of the actors are incredibly phony. Torgo's repetition of his lines the delayed reactions and Torgo's drunk motions are simply awful.

Coherence is the film's greatest foe bizarrity and incompetence its watchwords. This is it bad movie buffs. This is Manos Hands of Fate.Years ago in the dusty desert outside El Paso an unknown fertilizer salesman decided to craft a horror film with the assistance of friends throughout the El Paso area and a legend was born. Armed with 19000 dollars a cheap 16mm camera and absolutely no knowledge of the art of filmmaking whatsoever Hal P. Warren set out upon his masterpiece.There is absolutely no redeeming quality about Manos. There is no directing the editing appears as if it was done by a blind member of some mudcrawling insect species the artwork is a stain upon the name of art the script is a poorly cluttered and illogical joke masking the director's fantasies the dialog will have you tear out your eardrums with your fingernails and the acting is so atrocious you will feel as if the movie has violated you. It isn't as bad as MonsteraGoGo but it almost manages to snatch the sorry laurels of worst movie ever made from that Lovecraftian abomination.Manos must have put good directors like Kubrick or Capra in convulsions during its production so powerful is the elemental force of badness flowing from every stinking pore of its perverse form. It is the polar opposite to the good movie the parameters of its illogicity and nonacting existing to defy the borders of taste and ultimately sanity. Every grainy scratchy blurry frame of the muddy color palette and every sound byte of the poorly synchronized and terribly dubbed dialog offers an entrancing glance into a deeper darker world of madness that is Manos the Hands of Fate. It is not of this earth. It is not of our dimension. Surely Hal P. Warren was some malfeasant alien god from a realm far removed from our own hurtling across the icy chasms of space with a vile mission in store for the unsuspecting members of the cinematic world.Its legacy however lives on in the form of Mystery Science Theater. The acidtipped barbs flew fast and furiously striking the venerable beast in its countless weak points crafting from the chaos a comedic gem that approaches cinematic perfection stamped into the world of movies in its own stinking ichor. This is Manos Hands of Fate. This is the purifying baptism of fire that scourges the detestable vestiges of mediocrity and normalcy from the mainstream viewer and forever makes them a member of the cult world the world of bad movies and weirdness that cannot be imagined. It is the cornerstone the figurehead the mighty totem representing everything that Mystery Science Theater and the legions of bad movie sites across the Web hold dear to their hearts.Rejoice connoisseurs of bad movies! Fall upon the dark altar of Manos to pay homage to Torgo and the Master and forever remember the twisted legacy they wrought from the tangled celluoid! Imitate Torgo's stumbling walk and highbrained drawl until it fuses with the very core of your being!".

	schema:reviewBody "Directing The direction in this film reminds me of one of those people who simply cannot for the life of them hang a picture straight on a wall. The problem is not that the person is too close to the picture and therefore cannot see the mistakes he's making. The problem is also not an inability to make necessary adjustments after stepping back to look at one's work. The problem with this film's direction is much deeper. Do not be fooled into thinking that this film was bad on purpose because if there is a God this cannot be true. In the history of the world no manure salesman has decided to make a crappy pun intended movie for the purpose of defining the crappiest movie. No. The problem here is about the complete and utter failure of humanity. The word never had not yet been defined until this movie was made. In the end there's no reason to consider that this movie had a director.Editing When you were a child you probably tried to shove two mismatched puzzle pieces together  I admit I've even tried this  but you and I eventually learned that this is wrong. The editor of this film did not learn this valuable life lesson. The credits at the end of the film are the centerpieces of the editing. I only now understand that quite possibly editing did not occur in the production of this film.Writing This movie despises its writer hates him in fact. In truth there is no reason to think that this movie was actually written. I babysat an autistic child once. Even HE couldn't have written this tripe.Acting I understand that some people don't really get what it means to be in front of a camera. This is not the problem here. Although they have human faces and voices all dubbed of course these actors are unable to even imagine themselves as being in a film. The uniqueness of their ineptitude is overwhelming at times.This is a horror flick. The actual film isn't the horror the horror isn't even filmed in fact. The true horror is this movie's sweeping destruction of the elements of film  direction editing writing acting etc. Even the title which translates to Hands The Hands of Fate would baffle the Sphinx. I know that Duran Duran named themselves twice but this title is something else entirely. It is a sucker punch to everything linguistic and meaningful.Why this movie took 2 and a half months to film is beyond me. This movie is 74 minutes long. There is no reason to believe that this movie took more than 74 minutes to film. After all without a director editor writer or actors it's truly difficult for me to say that this is a film. There are those who want to find genius in such a deconstructive expression. Make no mistake this movie is not smart is not clever. The deepest meaning one can glean from manure is to never again step in it. If you value anything even remotely artful you will keep yourself oblivious to this movie. This movie will scar you and shape the rest of your life I guarantee it.".

Although they have human faces and voices all dubbed of course these actors are unable to even imagine themselves as being in a film. The uniqueness of their ineptitude is overwhelming at times.This is a horror flick. The actual film isn't the horror the horror isn't even filmed in fact. The true horror is this movie's sweeping destruction of the elements of film  direction editing writing acting etc. Even the title which translates to Hands The Hands of Fate would baffle the Sphinx. I know that Duran Duran named themselves twice but this title is something else entirely. It is a sucker punch to everything linguistic and meaningful.Why this movie took 2 and a half months to film is beyond me. This movie is 74 minutes long. There is no reason to believe that this movie took more than 74 minutes to film. After all without a director editor writer or actors it's truly difficult for me to say that this is a film. There are those who want to find genius in such a deconstructive expression. Make no mistake this movie is not smart is not clever. The deepest meaning one can glean from manure is to never again step in it. If you value anything even remotely artful you will keep yourself oblivious to this movie. This movie will scar you and shape the rest of your life I guarantee it.";

Dr. Ben Stone is leaving DC for a job doing plastic surgery for celebs in LA when he runs into a picket fence in a small Southern town and has to do 3 days of community service at their clinic as penance. His fancy sports car is totaled anyway and he has to get it fixed. Miffed at being waylaid in such a hokey place he tries to get through the next few days in time for his new job.He meets a wide cast of characters  and to their credit not everyone in a small town is so goshfriendly. Some are mean some are troubled some are nice  like any other array of people. Ben meets Lou a single mother who drives the ambulance as well as Nancy Lee Nicholson a confused beauty who wants him to take her to LA. This movie is great because it is about many people deciding for themselves how they want to live  whether in a big city or in a small town  and why they value what they do. It is also about an epiphany for Ben Stone and changing of his ways internally.".

	schema:reviewBody "Doc Hollywood is an underrated comedy that was pretty much passed over by critics when it was released in 1991. Nearly twenty years later now it has aged well and is a prime example of why Michael J. Fox was such a huge star of his era. Here he plays an egocentric yuppie doctor named Benjamin Stone who is headed for a big payday as a plastic surgeon in Beverly Hills until he's waylaid in a small southern town Grady Georgia after a minor car accident. The judge Robert Blossoms of this municipality is convinced that Stone is at fault for plowing through a fence that the judge built himself and sentences him to do a week's worth of community service in the town. At first Stone is totally aghast at the prospect of staying in this rural hicksville but after catching sight of gorgeous Lou Julie Walters emerging from a pond without a stitch of clothes on he begins to see the advantages of living and working in the country. The citizens of Grady also see the obvious plusses of having Fox around. It seems that the town's only physician Barnard Hughes is on his last legs and young doctor Stone is the perfect man to step into his shoes. Thereafter an assortment of townsfolk do their best to convince Stone that his future is in Grady. They include the mayor David OgdenStiers the town sexpot Bridget Fonda and Lillian the Welcome Wagon lady Frances Sternhagen. They needn't bother however. Doctor Stone and Lou are really the perfect match for each other and the audience knows it from the start. The only question is whether they get married in Georgia or Los Angeles.Doc Hollywood is the perfect vehicle for Michael J. Fox's talents and he carries this movie with ease and selfassurance. His character never mocks the constituents of Grady and he handles his role with just the right amount of humility and selfeffacement. Fox's Doctor Stone fits right in with these people and the film smartly avoids cheap shots and easy laughs. It's actually a serious movie disguised as a comedy and is firmly grounded in reality. As for the love interest Julie Walters is excellent as Lou and she provides plenty of depth to her character enhancing the movie with her mere presence. Why she didn't become a major movie star after this film is a Hollywood mystery that will never be solved. The rest of the cast is uniformly excellent including Woody Harrelson playing the local insurance salesman. His only dilemma is whether or not he should punch Doctor Stone in the face or sell him a term life policy. The directorial duties are handled capably by Michael CatonJones. For a Scotsman he sure knows a lot about your basic Americana. Doc Hollywood may get a welldeserved reassessment one of these days. Until then it will remain one of the more underappreciated films of the 1990s.".

First the mayor David Ogden Stiers welcomes him with open arms and the town folk make a big fuss over Stone too hoping he might stay since their resident physician Doc Hoag Barnard Hughes is old. Then a hotshot mechanic Mel Mel Winkler fixes his precious car. Most importantly a local gal who drives the hospital ambulance Lou Julie Warner is a lovely divorce with looks and smarts. Almost before they can believe it these two are in an undeclared love. Will Ben be making the trip to California after all? This is a lovely and funny romance from over 20 years ago that is still fresh and appealing. Fox naturally is a charming comedian and the other cast members listed above as well as Woody Harrelson and Bridget Fonda are most delightful. The small city and its surroundings are rustic beauties while costumes photography script and direction are most worthy. Make an appointment with this Doc y'all you will be glad you did.".

He is sentenced to 36 hours community service at the local practice and it isn't long before he meets sexy ambulance driver Vialula Lou played by Julie Warner and gradually he starts to realise that love friends and community spirit are more important than the material things in life. It's an highly enjoyable feelgood film that's sweet and humorous without been sugary or over the top. The plot is nice and simple and basically depends on Fox's charisma and likability to hold it together which he's more than capable of doing and he's surrounded by a great bunch of costars for support.Warner in particular is great and makes a great love interest for him. She's sexy and feisty and they both make their characters' interaction and gradual relationship believable. And the scene where they dance to Patsy Cline's Crazy is touching. It's an heartwarming and funny film.".

That's where the fun begins and the Doc gets tested in a way he was unprepared for. Naturally there has to be a love interest and she is played by pretty petite Julie Warner 25 as Lou the ambulance driver. We as well as the Doc first meet her as she walks out of the water bare from the waist up in a daring scene for this PG13 movie. But the nudity never seems gratuitous but is in character for this realistic young woman who has a 4 year old daughter.One of the best scenes is when Lou and Ben are making a house call his car was damaged and she suddenly stops. She spotted red marker ribbons on trees guiding the way to a deer stand. So she drops her pants squats and begins to relieve herself on a bush. Explaining that the smell of human urine will spook the deer away soon both of them are scenting all the nearby areas. It sounds very hokey on paper but comes across as very fitting and very funny for the situation.SPOILERS Lost in SC Ben is trying to read a map when he comes upon a person with cattle in the road he swerves and in a scene very similar to BTTF 1 his car runs off the road through some bushes and over a white picket fence. The owner happens to be the judge in this very small community and sentences Ben to 36 hours of community service in the hospital. The ulterior motive was to keep him there to replace the very old doctor but Ben just wants to get to Hollywood. he finally does but realizes he would rather be back in SC with Lou and returns there. Good supporting cast too  Woody Harrelson David Ogden Stiers from Mash Bridget Fonda as the girl looking for a way to get out of town and George Hamilton as the slick Hollywood plastic surgeon.".

Unfortunately for him his accident demolishes the picket fence belonging to Judge Evans Roberts Blossom and he gets sentenced to perform 32 hours of medical care for reckless driving. In no time at all the sly mayor of Grady Nick Nicholson David Ogden Stiers is leading a campaign to get Dr. Stone to take up permanent residency. What follows is a funny yet wistful story that involves a bunch of amusing characters. I really enjoyed the performances of both Michael J. Fox and David Ogden Stiers. Also quite amusing was the mechanic named Melvin Mel Winkler and Nurse Packer Eyde Byrde. Along with that both Vialula Julie Warner and Nancy Lee Nicholson Bridget Fonda were quite pleasing to the eye as well. In short for a romanticcomedy this one is definitely above average.".

He's going into plastic surgery much money to be made there and nobody dies. Usually the only thing that approaches a dearth in fatality like that is dermatology. But a traffic jam on I95 and a couple of stray cows on the back road he's traveling gets him into a gentle jackpot of an accident. It just happens that he plowed into a freshly put up fence by the local judge Roberts Blossom.For the first offense in the town of Grady Florida Fox is given community service in the local hospital where crotchety old doctor Barnard Hughes is ready to pack it in. In their own hospitable ways the good citizens of Grady set out to make the man Hughes calls Doc Hollywood welcome. There's one particular citizen played by Julie Warner who wants to offer the ultimate in hospitality even though her ever present steady boyfriend Woody Harrelson is around.In many ways Doc Hollywood is an updated version of the Paramount classic Welcome Stranger with Bing Crosby Barry Fitzgerald and Joan Caulfield. In that one however the town folks don't take to city boy Bing right away here they're going out of their way to make Fox welcome as they know that Hughes will not be there forever.One of the really nice things about Doc Hollywood is the impeccable casting of some of the rustic characters you might find in the Florida wilds. Two of the best are Eyde Byrde as Nurse Packer who runs the hospital like a drill sergeant a kinder gentler and black version of nurse Ratched. And it took me a while to realize the actor playing the rustic southern mayor was David Ogden Stiers formerly Charles Emerson Winchester of Hahvard and the 4077 MASH unit. For those who best remember Stiers as Major Winchester this performance will come as a very pleasant shock.If you saw Welcome Stranger than you have a good idea of how Doc Hollywood turns out. I think it was one of the best films of the previous decade a pleasant and gentle diversion of entertainment.".

Two of the best are Eyde Byrde as Nurse Packer who runs the hospital like a drill sergeant a kinder gentler and black version of nurse Ratched. And it took me a while to realize the actor playing the rustic southern mayor was David Ogden Stiers formerly Charles Emerson Winchester of Hahvard and the 4077 MASH unit. For those who best remember Stiers as Major Winchester this performance will come as a very pleasant shock.If you saw Welcome Stranger than you have a good idea of how Doc Hollywood turns out. I think it was one of the best films of the previous decade a pleasant and gentle diversion of entertainment.";

	schema:reviewBody "To most people this movie is about a small town in the South. To me that one small town street is the place where my husband and I used to day dreaming about buying antique furniture after he would finish graduate school at the University of Florida in Gainesville Florida.  The movie location the one street town of Micanopy is just a few miles away from Gainesville.  They show the entire downtown!  As I have watched Doc Hollywood umpteen times  I love to see the corner store which was a jewelry store called the Strawberry Bank specializing in antique jewelry about seventeen years ago. I would put stuff on layway as graduate students could not afford the luxury of buying something faster. Then we would drive around those back roads full of trees and Spanish moss and eat an early dinner fried cat fish fried okra rice and whatever fresh thing they had that our small stomachs could contain.  It was such a great time in our lives! That area is surrounded by students. I guess we did not realize how little we had as graduate students since we were even able to afford an offcampus apartment!  Everybody else had about the same youth and enthusiasm and we were looking to our bright futures. I would go to the library and get books on antiques furniture old lace and antique jewelry. I would audit French classes take classes in jewelry making techniques  such as lost wax and casting. I learned so much about life in that town and biked until I ended up tan without ever sitting in the sun.Like Michael J. Fox The American President Dr. Benjamin Stone I was fascinated with the big city. Coming from one of the largest cities in the world  I just wondered what I was going to do after I finished my classes as a Visiting Student at the UF.  Well after living there for about four years I learned much more than what graduate school could ever teach. Like Dr. Stone I fell in love with the place I would not mind having a pig named Jasmine I fell in love with the quilt making the silence  the southern hospitality and how they all thought I had an accent. I can even do a pretty good southern accent now myself!  Every once in while a celebrity would come to town like Sally Fields Forest Gump raising support for a project that her brother a physics professor at UF was working on. Those college folk they sure come up with strange ideas. That was so cool!Julie Warner Mr. Saturday Night Lou was so adorable with her down to earth attitude.  I loved to see the Mayor dressed like a squash. That is the South! This is an excellent movie. It has values. Ben Stone realized that being a Doctor in a small town might even mean having to read to your clients personal letters to them because they could not read. He in the end realizes that being needed is far more important than money. My favorite quotes  Watch your language Doc  you are in the belt of the Bible belt. Stone There were cows in the middle of the road!  I told you my insurance company will be happy to pay for that fence.  JudgeI built that fence myself. Neither you  nor  your insurance company can pay for a fence that I built myself. My favorite scenes the one street in Micanopy the cute wooden cabin the little old ladies quilting and arguing.  Ben Stone and Lou driving around on that old huge ambulance and acting like real animals demarcating their territories by scent. They would urinate and distribute the liquid around to detract deer that would attract the hunters. My husbands favorite scene is Julie Warner slowing rising from under water when she was skinny dipping. Not lewd but enchanting. Well we are going to visit all  the relatives down south and eat fresh catfish in some back road ma pa restaurant.  I guess  you all  have to go buy or rent this movie.".

It was actually quite a good movie. It may not win an Oscar or anything but it's amazing to see Agent 47 up on the big screen. Timothy Olyphant does a surprisingly good job of portraying him too.The love interest is a bit awkward to anyone who knows Agent 47's nearly complete lack of emotion in that department but despite what the trailer may lead you to expect it really doesn't go very far outside of what you've come to know in the games and what happens when she tries to seduce him is absolutely hilarious and very much in the Agent 47 tradition.It is indeed a violent movie and 47 is as coldblooded as you'd expect him to be. Seeing it tends to make me wish other movie heroes had the same level of guts just to shoot the bad guy in the face instead of letting him live or anything silly like that. The fight scenes with the other assassins from the Agency are also very well done and quite a treat to see.All in all it's quite a good movie. Definitely worth paying to see in the theaters. Hopefully there'll be another one!".

Luckily we live in a world where adapting stories and characters from mindless action video games is commonplace and the creators of the Hitman movie have gone to great lengths to showcase plenty of the blood bullets and babes requisite of a proper translation of the popular assassin adventure.Raised to be an elite assassin Agent 47 Timothy Olyphant carries out jobs for a mysterious organization and for a price. When his employer sets him up in a political assassination attempt the hitman must uncover the leaders behind the conspiracy while simultaneously protecting a sassy prostitute and being hunted by both the Russian Secret Police and two determined Interpol agents.Wasting little time with a tedious back story and thankfully straying from contrary religious tones as suggested by several trailers Hitman jumps right into the plot full of political conspiracies secret agency machinations police investigations and other reasons to have a gunfight in a crowded location. While those unfamiliar with the source material may question Agent 47's origins it's actually rather commendable and practical to forego such setup and just plunge directly into current events with only the accepted knowledge that our antihero is the most skilled of killers. That being said the story does convolute itself with excessive setting changes and rehashes of political thrillers mixed with revenge mysteries but the plot never interferes with that which is most important  the action.Several unique scenes of bloodshed find their way into Hitman and as expected the body count reaches an impressive sum. While not overloaded with meaningless violence a few sequences stand out as attaining just the right amount of machismo cool most notably the decimation of a drug lord's domicile and a fourway elite assassin duel apparently inserted to mimic the combat abilities present in the game. At a few points throughout the actioner it becomes evident that everyone involved is trying a little too hard to evoke awe but some fast handheld shots and a few guns pointing at the screen later all is forgiven.Though Timothy Olyphant is likely not the first actor to enter one's mind on hearing of a Hitman movie he accomplishes the surprising feat of impressing upon the audience that he is indeed Agent 47. Plus the sharp black suits with red ties don't hurt. Relative newcomer Olga Kurylenko who exhibits an appearance resembling a cross between Catherine ZetaJones and Sophie Marceau was also a wise choice especially to tease the viewer with another staple prominent in the Hitman games.Hitman successfully retains the necessary seriousness inherent in the subject matter and while it rarely covers new ground in the actionadventure genre it also never slips into silly mockery and it still provides plenty of references to its video game roots. Sacrificing story for style and bloodshed is much appreciated here and entertainment of this nature is a rare treat over those that try too hard to be that which they are not. Hitman doesn't indulge itself in such a charade and the result is a fun and sexy romp through the world of professional carnage.The Massie Twins".

	schema:reviewBody "I found this solid and competent. The curious thing is that what it did well it did not because of what it is but because it did not stick closely to the world of the video game. This is also why the fan base rejected it.Apparently the agent in the game is one of the 47th generation of clones where the movie has him as the best of a collection of specially trained orphans. Instead of a name he simply has the number 47. I also liked the mashup conventional as it is Russian mafia secret supercapable murder enterprise worldwide conspiracy of priests. Its the spice of the priests that matters after the Dan Brown conspiracy to make it seem ridiculous and taking the style out of it. It is easier somehow to believe a cabal lead by a Moscow Patriarch instead of the inept Rome.The girl does what the girl is supposed to do claim that she is sexually exploited and then proceed to be exploited by us in much the same way. The assassin does what he is supposed to and does it well show us unexpected ways that he can manipulate the world anticipating coincidences and odd subplots. Our designated watcher the typical American detective also does his job watching at a distance.Why this film deserves a comment and others I see do not is the way it ends. The form here is reverse noir. In noir we have a hero an everyman who is manipulated by the world of the viewer. He is subject to cosmic coincidences that come not from any natural unfolding but from our need to have a structured narrative. The watcher unconsciously manipulates the character.In reverse noir the character somehow can control the world so that minor coincidences are anticipated even controlled by a plan he has that we do not know. We the viewer are placed in the thing to be befuddled as we end up as the manipulated soul. I am not sure when this reversed form first appeared I am hoping a reader can advise. But the form is common enough now to have some endemic problems the most challenging of which is how to end the film.This film does that admirably and it can be said that all the automatic stuff in the middle of the film is arranged to set up this satisfactory ending. The film starts with the beginning of that ending with the remainder an implicit flashback meaning only that the story is recalled and not repeated aloud. The ending is set up emotionally as our hit man is incapable of controlling the world so far as a mate a family. We see him tortured about this.

So while for 90 minutes our detective has been our surrogate watcher giving us expected thrills and surprises we reverse once again at the end now the hit man is the watcher of love and family. We know he will never approach 'the girl' or the detective again but that he will watch which we see him doing through the only instrument available a rifle sight.This is good writing my friends where the screenwriter understands the form well enough to manipulate it and us.

	onyx:emotionText "I found this solid and competent. The curious thing is that what it did well it did not because of what it is but because it did not stick closely to the world of the video game. This is also why the fan base rejected it.Apparently the agent in the game is one of the 47th generation of clones where the movie has him as the best of a collection of specially trained orphans. Instead of a name he simply has the number 47. I also liked the mashup conventional as it is Russian mafia secret supercapable murder enterprise worldwide conspiracy of priests. Its the spice of the priests that matters after the Dan Brown conspiracy to make it seem ridiculous and taking the style out of it. It is easier somehow to believe a cabal lead by a Moscow Patriarch instead of the inept Rome.The girl does what the girl is supposed to do claim that she is sexually exploited and then proceed to be exploited by us in much the same way. The assassin does what he is supposed to and does it well show us unexpected ways that he can manipulate the world anticipating coincidences and odd subplots. Our designated watcher the typical American detective also does his job watching at a distance.Why this film deserves a comment and others I see do not is the way it ends. The form here is reverse noir. In noir we have a hero an everyman who is manipulated by the world of the viewer. He is subject to cosmic coincidences that come not from any natural unfolding but from our need to have a structured narrative. The watcher unconsciously manipulates the character.In reverse noir the character somehow can control the world so that minor coincidences are anticipated even controlled by a plan he has that we do not know. We the viewer are placed in the thing to be befuddled as we end up as the manipulated soul. I am not sure when this reversed form first appeared I am hoping a reader can advise. But the form is common enough now to have some endemic problems the most challenging of which is how to end the film.This film does that admirably and it can be said that all the automatic stuff in the middle of the film is arranged to set up this satisfactory ending. The film starts with the beginning of that ending with the remainder an implicit flashback meaning only that the story is recalled and not repeated aloud. The ending is set up emotionally as our hit man is incapable of controlling the world so far as a mate a family. We see him tortured about this. Yes it is a juvenile portrayal of such an emptiness but we get it. So the only way he can get the pleasure of a family is the same way we get the pleasure of killing scads of bad guys by watching.

Not to mention they captured the personality of 47 near perfectly. When I went to see this I didn't think I would like it because Timothy Olyphant played such a convincing geek in Die Hard 4 but he did an incredible job of changing roles. The basis behind the movie is that the hitman is sent to assassinate someone but it goes bad which results in him picking up Olga Kurylenko. Now they tried to add some jokes in and he does do some things that are completely out of character such as smiling but for the most part he plays the part very well. Now the hitman games aren't known for the best plot of all time but since the movie focused more on plot then on actual action it feels a bit refreshing since the games are basically Target Money Kill. I'd like to see the next Hitman game focus more on the plot.Anyway it's got a great story 47 is for the most part played as he should be and there is enough action to keep you from getting bored.Ranking wise it's definitely no Die Hard 3 or Big Fish but it is probably one of the best videogame to movie transitions thats been done in a long time.".

However this is reasonably well handled in this movie and thankfully we don't get a serving of love interest cheese.Dougray Scott's detective in pursuit character is another overused good cop against the establishment device although again this is handled in a way that doesn't unduly distract. The fact that Dougray repeatedly pulls out a cigarette that he never once lights does become slightly distracting. If Dougray is an ardent nonsmoker why bother with the cigarette prop at all?

If I was to watch this without any connection to the original material I would probably be more entertained.This is really my problem with this movie and many other adaptations. I'd rather if any other name was used my suggestion Agent Hairless Bourne because this movie is just a big 100minlong clich that tries to profit from Hitman's fanbase at the same time with just enough game references. I prayed this wouldn't be another Doom  The Movie but it wasn't too far off.As I said before if you're not into the games and just want to watch a Jason Bourne clone then this is your movie.Now if you're a series fan read on. When I heard an adaptation was under development I wasn't too excited but I had some hope. Hope because there could be something new that could be done in the movie industry. Now what's new about 47 that could make him a whole new animal than all other cold blooded killers and secret agents out there? What makes that character 47 different? 1st He's a clone. The result of a gene enhancing research program that turned on his creator and became a professional freelance hitman. They've scrapped all that and rewritten his origins completely. Now how can they still call him by the same name after that? I mean if someone asks me what's the story behind this character I will now have to answer with another question Which one? The movie hitman or the game's hitman? The adaptation dies right there in my opinion.2nd Agent 47 is the result of a genetic experiment and post training aimed at creating a superior human being in strength and mind with no conscience. That's exactly what he is in the games but as I feared it would get knowing how filmmakers tend to think of what people want to see onscreen he shows too much of a conscience in the movie with an alltooexpected female role that he shows affection to that he even promises to visit after they part on the train.3rd One big difference of the Hitman games from other action games is the fact that agent 47 is rewarded for being as silent as possible a ghost as he's referred to in the movie. A big gun fight in a crowded room is a big nono leaving witnesses alive is not his thing too and usually targets tend to die from strange accidents rather than in a bathroom filled with bodyguards with bullets on their heads. The movie tells a story of a whole different character... I mean what's up with that scene to kill Udre? I will go see a Rambo movie if I want to I will not go watch a Hitmanbranded movie to see that overused matrixclich royal mess. Oh and the countless female witnesses that survived that scene? That would be called a restart mission in my book.4th Another distinctive mark of the Hitman game brand is his proficiency to disguise of all types of people after he properly disposes of their bodies in the course of each mission. I remember him doing this once in the end of the movie. I can't be bothered to watch it again so I might be wrong on the number of times he's done this but the fact that I can't remember that happening is a good indication of how overlooked that feature was.So this is what made me hate this movie. Not because the movie is bad in essence but because of this horrible trend of people trying to profit from a welldeveloped brand with welldeveloped characters and rewrite everything that makes them what they are. Had this movie been given a different name I would have enjoyed it a lot more.Other slightly bad points 1 Realism. This one I start to overlook on these movies... as much as it pisses me off it's so common that my expectations are lower right off the bat. The scene with the 4 hitmen is a good example of that. Why on earth would those coldblooded killing machines decrease their chances of completing their contracts by holding fire closing in on each other and then just stand there to successfully stare at each others ugly faces for all that time until agent 47 breaks the ice? And why on earth were those agents pointing their weapons at each other instead of completing their assignment by ventilating 47? If it was argued that they were rivals between themselves then why didn't they kill each other with the blades too? But that's OK it's a scene made to look good and stylish and mindless. Now just wait until someone figures out that a scene can look good stylish AND make sense at the same time! 2 Olyphant. Looks too young and not so ruthless as the game model. His voice isn't anywhere near David Bateson's 47's game voice coldness and lowtone power. The acting wasn't bad though it probably wasn't a very demanding role emotionally but still he delivered what it would take for his role. The problem is that even though he did well I feel that the choice could have been much closer to what the game offers.So this is it the score of 3 represents the view of a huge series fan that had his expectations higher than the casual action movie fan. 3 is for the satisfying acting performances and the action scenes that would probably result in a higher score from someone unaware of the original material.".

	schema:headline " Unsatisfying action and a largely incoherent story makes this a movie not worth watching";
	schema:reviewBody "A disturbing trend that seems to have no end in sight is the constant making of movies based upon video games. The fact of the matter is that these movies largely end up being horrendous misinterpretations of the source material. As evidenced by such cinematic horror shows like the Resident Evil movies Street Fighter Super Mario Brothers Tomb Raider and every movie by Uwe Boll. Of course there is the occasional movie that proves the maxim wrong I for one enjoyed the Final Fantasy movie The Spirits Within. Granted it had next to nothing to do with the game series apart from the name but I was able to enjoy it. There was also the Silent Hill movie that was great due to the fact that it was able to maintain a majority of the atmosphere from the games and the plot was largely consistent with the mythos of the Silent Hill series. Unfortunately the latest movie to try to adapt a video game has largely failed to take even the smallest modicum of what made the games enjoyable.Hitman a movie based on a good action series isn't exactly a bad movie. If you go into the movie without having played the games by IO Interactive then you'll in all likelihood be entertained by the action this movie has to offer. Fans of the games however will most likely be left feeling cheated by the movie and it's radical changing of the main character of the series. In the movie it explains that 47 and the other bald headed assassins were chosen at birth to become guinea pigs of a topsecret plot to breed trained killers who feel no remorse. Now if this reminds you of anything you're a nerd and yes it's totally ripping off part of the plot for the old TV show Dark Angel. I don't mean to go all nerdy video game fan boy on you but in the games 47 wasn't chosen at birth to become the bad ass assassin he is today. He's a clone of four major criminals and a scientist to make a flawless human. Not once in the entire series of games do they state whether or not 47 has a childhood. If they had felt the need to do an origin story for 47 why not just base it off the story elements of the original Hitman Codename 47 game? And throw in bits of the missions from Contracts.Before I continue on with the review I would like to state the fact that this movie was written by Skip Woods. The man that brought us the terrible movie Swordfish. While I had nothing overly against that film it bears mention due to the fact that at times the plot of that movie was positively horrid and as such Woods needs to be beaten with an oar.The movie starts out with an Interpol agent returning to his home 47 is there sitting in his chair. Aiming his gun at fearless Dougray Scott. The movie then keenly informs us that the bulk of the story takes place three months prior to this scene. 47 has been hired to take out the Russian prime minister Mikhail Belicoff. The hit goes off with seemingly no problem but Diana 47's handler for the Agency called The Organization in this informs him that there's a witness he needs to eliminate. The witness Nika is played by the wonderful Olga Kurylenko when 47 goes to eliminate Nika another hitman from Agency arrives to kill 47 and Nika. 47 escapes and confronts Diana about how Nika wasn't a witness and whether or not someone at the agency double crossed him. While this is happening the Russian police is sending in its crack squad of cops who look like they were stolen from the anime JinRoh The Wolf Brigade to capture or kill 47. Dougray has a problem with this as he wants 47 alive for questioning as he's wanted for multiple hundreds of murders across the globe. How he was to establish it was only 47 I'll never know.After a moderately decent action scene 47 kidnaps Nika and takes her to a St. Petersburg train station where he's attacked by a cadre of Agency trained hit men. The problem I have with this part is the fact that the assassins are fundamentally working toward the same goal kill 47. At this point when 47 is outgunned by three other assassins instead of just ventilating 47 they aim their guns at each other. At which point 47 proposes that they die with honor and brandish some wakizashi swords and proceed to fight. The fight scene is decent enough but it was just pointless. Where was 47 hiding those little buggers and why didn't 47's wouldbe killers just kill him and then go knock off for a while at the nearest bar? I would go further into the plot but really I don't feel like spoiling it any more than I already have. Suffice to say that I didn't exactly enjoy the story to the movie. It took far too many liberties with the character of 47 and far too much of it seemed implausible from the perspective of realism. Also there's the questionable choice in casting Timothy Olyphant as the cold steely eyed assassin Mr. 47. I don't hate the guy it's just that I think he's a highly inappropriate choice. Granted he was a decent enough actor in that atrocious show Deadwood. He just looks too young and not at all what a ruthless killer should look like.Overall the movie is a mediocre action film that people who've never played the games will most likely enjoy. Fans of the series however would probably hate it due to the large number of liberties they take with the character and source material. Overall the movie is not worth the time to watch it.".

	onyx:emotionText "A disturbing trend that seems to have no end in sight is the constant making of movies based upon video games. The fact of the matter is that these movies largely end up being horrendous misinterpretations of the source material. As evidenced by such cinematic horror shows like the Resident Evil movies Street Fighter Super Mario Brothers Tomb Raider and every movie by Uwe Boll. Of course there is the occasional movie that proves the maxim wrong I for one enjoyed the Final Fantasy movie The Spirits Within. Granted it had next to nothing to do with the game series apart from the name but I was able to enjoy it. There was also the Silent Hill movie that was great due to the fact that it was able to maintain a majority of the atmosphere from the games and the plot was largely consistent with the mythos of the Silent Hill series.

	schema:reviewBody "As Agent 47 played by Timothy Olyphant aims his gun at Interpol's Mike Whittier Dougray Scott he asks How does a good man decide when to kill? That is the paradox of Director Xavier Gens's slick Hitman. The screenplay by Skip Woods is based on the video game Hitman. I am unfamiliar with the game. Movie genesis from video games usually does not bode well. However Hitman surprises with narrative and visual style and the charismatic Olyphant as Agent 47. Olyphant recently seen in Live Free or Die Hard has a decidedly dark air about him and wisely underplays the role. Also a surprise is Olga Kurylenko who plays Nika the woman 47 must protect in the enveloping conspiracy. Kurylenko is stunning naked and surprisingly she is a genuine and compelling actress. She embodies vulnerability and smarts in what could have been a one dimensional victim. Analogous to The Fugitive narrative pretext director Gens expediently overlays the origins of the mysterious 47 as a youth bred and trained to become the perfect assassin in the opening credits. Is he really a good man? Hitman is puzzling in that the movie trailers appear more polished than the actual movie. Perhaps Gens was a music video director? Or Hitman is resourcefully produced on a medium budget? Some of the action sequences in Hitman are breathtaking. There is the automatic weapons orchestrated mayhem in the Russian night club. The deadly fight scene with 47 and assassins from his own Agency is an amazing martial arts displayknife fighting joint locks and close in boxing. Olyphant may not be a trained martial artist though he is a graceful athlete. The slow motion and slick editing evoke the dramatic. On a very basic level Hitman delivers with its darkly powerful hero beautiful women spectacular action and engaging story.As played by Olyphant 47 is the classic enigmatic heroin the sense that we really don't know if he is really a villain from the start. 47's paying client hires him to assassinate Russian President Mikhail Belicoff Ulrich Thomson. Belicoff is a merciless despot. 47 completes his mission however he has been set up. His employer informs 47 that there was a witness to the assassination attempt the President's prostitute Nika Kurylenko. She must be eliminated. Investigating the assassination coup is Interpol Agent Mike Whittier Scott. Hindering the Interpol investigation is KGB Agent Yuri Marklov effective Robert Knepper claiming KGB jurisdiction. Whittier believes Belicoff's assassin is the ghost killer he has been tracking across the globe.47 distinguishes the conspiracy and becomes the inadvertent protector of the vulnerable Nika. Their relationship reveals the more human side of 47. Humorously awkward and touchingly believable Olyphant and Kurylenko's partnership is an undeniable strength. They have a sublime chemistry that works. And 47 emerges as a hero and a man of honor.Hitman is solid entertainment that benefits from Gens's stylish direction and starmaking performances from Timothy Olyphant and Olga Kurylenko. Hitman is a great hero story about an essentially good man vanquishing great evil and protecting the innocent. The movie is engaging fun.".

	schema:headline " Unsurprising and expected...";
	schema:reviewBody "Being a longtime fan of the games I was pretty excited to hear that they were planning on making a film based on them. I knew that it would be a challenge to depict a rather 1dimensional character like 47 in an honest and objective manner while still making it entertaining for the public. That was when my optimism about this project faded knowing Hollywood would take the easy way out converting the rather complex and serious games into a very predictable and regurgitated action flick.Later in the year I read the script that was floating around the internet. It confirmed all my predictions and I knew I was going to hate the movie. However I am a glutton for punishment and I decided to see the movie yesterday knowing well that I was going to end up with the stale taste of regret in my mouth.I think there are two aspects to look at here. The first is how the movie stands up compared to the game. The second is how the movie stands on its own as a film.To address the first point I am utterly baffled by the reviews that state that this movie is faithful to the series and how it won't disappoint fans of the games. I can only conclude that these reviewers have never played the games and know nothing about the backstory of the series. This movie is only related to the games by name and the fact that there is a bald guy with a bar code on his head wearing a suit in it. The relation ends there.Olyphant's 47 portrayed as cold as Olyphant could muster is warm and fuzzy like Elmo compared to the original Mr. 47. He jokes he smiles he awkwardly flirts with skimpy dressed Nika and he spares the lives of our nice Interpol buddies. You don't have play the games for long to understand how this is a deviance from the original Hitman concept. What really bothers me is that Olyphant's 47 destroys the fundamental concepts behind the Hitman games which are what have made that franchise so popular and unique stealth amorality professionalism moderation restraint and in a sense nonviolence. This movie doesn't remain faithful to any of that. It contains a bald guy shooting a bunch of dudes and saving a mistreated woman with a low tolerance for alcohol and a high tolerance for pain.The second point whether the movie stands on its own or not is fairly evident from what I have already mentioned. They could have named this Die Hard Jr's Soviet Escapades and no one would have been surprised. As an action flick it follows the same formula that has been used for decades. Tough guy weak chick persecution explosions and gunshots. The action scenes are nothing special but not terrible either. The plot isn't well put together and some pieces don't make much sense. Little back story is presented about the characters and I didn't feel any sympathy for any of them.Lastly it appears that they dulled down the violence and edited out some of the background info from the script that I read. If the script was bad a chopped up version of that script is an abomination.To summarize this movie falls flat on its face as an action flick and is an insult to the Hitman franchise. The acting is relatively poor with miscast actors a terrible script mundane action scenes and strung together plot elements. I had originally rated this film 4 out of 10 but all considered it was lucky to end up with my 3 out of 10 rating.".

However I am a glutton for punishment and I decided to see the movie yesterday knowing well that I was going to end up with the stale taste of regret in my mouth.I think there are two aspects to look at here. The first is how the movie stands up compared to the game. The second is how the movie stands on its own as a film.To address the first point I am utterly baffled by the reviews that state that this movie is faithful to the series and how it won't disappoint fans of the games. I can only conclude that these reviewers have never played the games and know nothing about the backstory of the series. This movie is only related to the games by name and the fact that there is a bald guy with a bar code on his head wearing a suit in it. The relation ends there.Olyphant's 47 portrayed as cold as Olyphant could muster is warm and fuzzy like Elmo compared to the original Mr. 47. He jokes he smiles he awkwardly flirts with skimpy dressed Nika and he spares the lives of our nice Interpol buddies. You don't have play the games for long to understand how this is a deviance from the original Hitman concept. What really bothers me is that Olyphant's 47 destroys the fundamental concepts behind the Hitman games which are what have made that franchise so popular and unique stealth amorality professionalism moderation restraint and in a sense nonviolence. This movie doesn't remain faithful to any of that. It contains a bald guy shooting a bunch of dudes and saving a mistreated woman with a low tolerance for alcohol and a high tolerance for pain.The second point whether the movie stands on its own or not is fairly evident from what I have already mentioned. They could have named this Die Hard Jr's Soviet Escapades and no one would have been surprised. As an action flick it follows the same formula that has been used for decades. Tough guy weak chick persecution explosions and gunshots. The action scenes are nothing special but not terrible either. The plot isn't well put together and some pieces don't make much sense. Little back story is presented about the characters and I didn't feel any sympathy for any of them.Lastly it appears that they dulled down the violence and edited out some of the background info from the script that I read. If the script was bad a chopped up version of that script is an abomination.To summarize this movie falls flat on its face as an action flick and is an insult to the Hitman franchise. The acting is relatively poor with miscast actors a terrible script mundane action scenes and strung together plot elements. I had originally rated this film 4 out of 10 but all considered it was lucky to end up with my 3 out of 10 rating.";

	schema:headline " Hitman Misses The Mark Completely!";
	schema:reviewBody "You'd think Twentieth Century Fox would have shot the works on their cinematic adaptation of the popular video game Hitman. Instead these corporate clowns have succeeded only in shooting themselves in their feet with a flat formulaic standardissue thriller that has neither a shred of suspense nor a sense of style. Initially xXx star Vin Diesel had planned to star in this preposterous pabulum. In a lastminute casting shuffle however babyfaced Timothy Olyphant replaced the burly blunt Diesel. Olyphant managed to menace Bruce Willis in Live Free or Die Hard but he isn't as intimidating as Diesel. Basically with his Lex Luther look i.e. Olyphant is as bald as Diesel but he is rarely as bold as Diesel. Olyphant shares the blame for Hitman with the fools who wrote and helmed what should have gone directly to video along with all the other cloned claptrap. Swordfish scribe Skip Woods contributes a slipshod screenplay that qualifies as a catalogue of clichs. The outlandish Clive Owen actioneer Shoot'em Up about a deadly accurate hitman protecting a woman and an orphan infant that illuminated screens a few months ago emerges as a masterpiece compared to this cretinous incomprehensible comic book nonsense. Sophomore French director Xavier Gens doesn't provide enough largerthanlife setpieces or eyeopening stunts to enliven things. Worse the origins of our elite enigmatic title character called Agent 47 are shrouded in secrecy and Agent 47 is so invincible you know he will never acquire so much as a scratch even in a room swarming with flying lead. The only thing remotely surprising is that our antiheroic hero finds the time to keep his head cleanshaved so the bar code tattooed to the back of his noggin stands out for all to see.Hitman opens one dark rainy morning in London England as Interpol agent Mike Whittier Dougray Scott of Mission Impossible III arrives home from a late night at the office to find his electricity isn't working. In the dark he stumbles over a corpse and is surprised by the fugitive that he has been pursuing around the world for the last three years. Cool as crushed ice Agent 47 Timothy Olyphant of Scream 2 has been patiently awaiting Whittier's arrival. They have an offtherecord chat that dissolves into a flashback. This flashback occurs three months in the past when Agent 47 had been assigned to assassinate Russian President Mikhail Belicoff Ulrich Thomsen of The World Is Not Enough and learned the client wanted the hit to take place in public. Flashbacks invariably mar films and this flashback is no exception. Until the last quarter hour of the film when the action reverts back to Whittier's home neither Whittier nor Agent 47 can either die or suffer grievous bodily harm. Ultimately Hitman qualifies as anticlimactic because we know nothing can happen to either of them. As a result the movie springs few surprises on us.Along the way we learn a little about our taciturn protagonist's background. During the opening title credits with classical composer Franz Schubert's Ava Maria playing on the soundtrack we are shown baldheaded little boys as an adult tattoos bar codes onto the backs of their heads. Anyway these kids are taught discipline and shown how to wield firearms with lethal accuracy. Sentries with telescopic rifles surround the place and pick the kids that try to escape off like flies as they climb the surrounding fence. Eventually an individual decked out like a Catholic priest with a white collar gives the hero a polished box with two automatic pistols.Once on the outside Agent 47 receives messages via a computer notebook and rarely disobeys his orders. At one point he reveals to another character that he works for an outfit known only as 'The Agency' that has been training equipping and dispatching assassins to perform executions for decades. These agents operate alone and their trademark is their cleanshaved heads. Neither Woods nor Gens explain why these hit men must shun cranial hair in the performance of their duties. Curiously despite his top ranking as an assassin Agent 47 appears ill at ease around women. He excuses himself nervously when a female tries to pick him up at the bar. Later in the confines of his own motel room a sultry young woman tries to entice Agent 47 with the promise of sex. The woman gets nowhere because Agent 47 zaps her with something that puts her to sleep. Indeed in this sexually promiscuous era Agent 47 emerges as an ironic role model for sexual abstinence. Actually this turns out to be the most interesting thing about him. He can shoot bullets but he cannot shoot sperm! Essentially Agent 47 concerns himself only with killing his targets and has little use for people as social acquaintances.After Agent 47 shoots President Belicoff he learns to his shock that the highranking official has survived his bullet. Our incredulous protagonist starts snooping around for any worthwhile clues. Inevitably he finds out that Belicoff's girlfriend Nika Boronina erotic Olga Kurylenko of The Serpent is on the lam because she knows about Belicoff's use of doubles to confuse assassins. Agent 47 saves Nika before the bad guys get to her and they become a twosome. The Russia Federal Police have launched a manhunt for both Agent 47 and Nika and Interpol shows up to help the Russians. Meanwhile Agent 47 and Nika find themselves dodging assassins from 47's own organization. Although Gens displays minimal expertise in orchestrating blood splattered firefights in close quarters with automatic weapons he cannot tell a coherent story. Unless you know something about the 2001 video game you won't initially understand the presence of the CIA in this lame action thriller. Sadly too the villains are always one step behind the hero who rarely seems to have problems with dispatching them. They annoy him more often than antagonize him.Hitman is a hitandmiss shoot'em up saga that misses more often than it hits bull'seye.".

	schema:reviewBody "Okay before we begin let's take a look at the title of the film in question Hitman. Not only that but the T is created by pressing two handguns together upside down. Okay now we know what kind of film we're dealing with. Hitman is a strange kind of film. It seemed to pop up around the end of the summer with it's teaser trailer and then stay below most people's radar with the exception being fans of the game. Then in popped up again with a full blown trailer and then two weeks later it was released. This is the approach of a studio that doesn't exactly believe in it's product. However Hitman isn't actually all that bad. While not breaking or even bending the rules the action is load violent and stylish. Some of the movies strongest moments are when the hitman Agent 47 Olyphant is doing his thing staying one step ahead of the game before the action explodes onto the screen. The plot is a bit convoluted but it was bound to be. 47 is hired to assassinate Mikhail Belicoff a Russian politician running for reelection. His problems begin when the man he killed holds a press conference showing him to be simply grazed by the bullet. Judging by the ample amounts of blood used in the assassination scene he didn't miss. From there 47 finds himself running for his life from Russian goons as well as people from his own organization. And along the way of course he find the hooker with a heart of gold Nika Olga Kurylenko. The plot is linear and not complicated. The film carried a serious but not too serious tone. Moments of levity surround 47 and his awkward sexual frustration we see him reading articles about what women want and he has some humorous back and forths with Nika. However we all know that Nika's really purpose in this film is to wear a very revealing dress and then take it off. In the end Hitman manages to be a decent action flick perhaps even slightly above average. I disagree with most people and think that Olyphant did a fine job playing the hitman. Would Vin Diesel have been a better choice? Maybe but not necessarily Olyphant's mild mannered disposition carries the tone of the film very well. So will it win any Oscars... no. Will we ever be talking about the cinematic significance of Hitman... no. Will I buy it on DVD... probably.".

If any of you who saw this movie played the game hitman any of its sequels you would know who the Hitman is and how he acts. The dry and possibly unintentionalhumor is something that would never happen with Agent 47 otherwise. He would never have some kind of alasamurai showdowns with anyone and he would most definitely lack any socializing skills whatsoever. All the oneliners all the intense gunfights are just way over the top. If the game focused on planning and perfect execution why make it an absolute mess in the film? I digress a bit but this leads to the storyline. It's completely made up with no reference to the actual game whatsoever and I strongly doubt the creators of the movie ever listened to what Eidos the software company that made Hitman ever had to say about their script. So what is the point is making a movie that has no footing at all in the game's storyline as far as the plot of the movie goes is beyond me. I am not an expert in films but since this movie did not appear in the cinemas where I live as most big titles do it rightfully deserves to be called an expensive B movie that would only be entertaining to teens or children. I had to actually FORCE myself to watch it till the end that's how bad it is. The special effects are cheap the whole movie has some kind of get it filmed already thing about it and I just feel sorry who spent their money at the cinemas watching this.Fortunately such talentless scriptwriters and directors that make these kind of absolute failures have no power over the game designers if anyone out there wants to see how addictive and rich the game's storyline is try all Hitman games from 2 to 4 1 is just way too old. But if you want a good movie in this genre watch Leon or Matrix. Both fit their own niche both enjoyable much unlike hitman the movie.In all the movie is the pinnacle or storyline ignorance and some kind of selfcenteredness of the director.

	schema:reviewBody "As a fan of the games meaning I've played them all to completion this movie was a SERIOUS disappointment. In short it seems like they wrote a completely generic action movie then decided to shave the protagonist's head and call it Hitman as an afterthought.

	schema:reviewBody "Woody Allen's alter ego Boris a bitterly good and sardonic Larry David makes this statement to the audience rather early on in Whatever Works. The truth is no matter how misanthropic sarcastic and neurotic Woody Allen is he ultimately is a pretty likable personality...if you like that type. Allen's return to Manhattan after three stays in London and a wonderful stopover in Barcelona is yet another niche film. Fans of Allen as well as fans of Larry David's Seinfeld and Curb Your Enthusiasm which not so ironically should be the same folks will find plenty to laugh at here while others will inevitability whine I don't care for Woody Allen...and oh that Larry David! Can't stand him! The plot of Whatever Works is irrelevant. Boris is some sort of geniuslevel physicist trying to speed his way to death though those metaphors are never explored as poignantly as they should be. It all just serves as a soapbox for Allen through David to funnel his usual dialogues about relationships love luck and the meaning of life. It's all very broad and obvious this time around but it's sometimes nice to still be laughing at the same old feelgood shtick. It should come as no surprise that Boris also tells the audience this isn't a movie designed to make you feel good unless you're Allen fans and then you'll feel pretty swell afterward. Leave it to Allen to infer moviegoers are inherently morons but we're sophisticates for watching his films.Apparently this is a reworked screenplay from the 1970's and the Annie Hall style monologues to the audience are evidence of that. In the jokes department you'll find old standards mocking the French and suggesting kids should attend concentration camps for the summer mixed with modern humor about the Taliban and Viagra. There's also one hilarious throwawayblinkandyou'llmissit reference to James Cameron's The Abyss that makes you wonder if perhaps the screenplay was first reworked in the 1980's before its final incarnation here. In the casting department we find Patricia Clarkson yet again is a delight in her curiously underwritten overwritten role which is far too simply complex to explain in a traditional review and continues to build a case for herself to be declared this generation's Best Supporting Actress twenty years from now. Evan Rachel Wood is cuteas abutton oh as her character might declare what a clich as a Southern cutiepie who runs away to New York City and meets up with the suicidal Boris. Allen as always is luminous with his photography of the young lady. And unlike the similarly dumb motormouthed funnyvoiced Mira Sorvino character from Mighty Aphrodite Wood's character is actually given an arc here and proves not to be as shallow and moronic as Boris originally assessed which indicates maybe Allen is growing just a teeny bit in his view on women...or maybe not.Ultimately this is yet another testament to Allen's worldview which is summed up here as do whatever works for you to trick yourself into believing you're happy in this miserable world. Sure there are times when Boris' diatribes run a few lines too long or when the film stops dead when he is not on screen but for the most part this is Allen doing what works best for him. No other director can call himself out on all his personal pratfalls and annoying quirks yet still find a way to endear himself to the faithful who are ever patient with him and his films. No other director can be so charmingly meanspirited and selfdeprecating yet still find a way to declare his alter ego a genius at picture's end. And that's why we've always liked you Woody for better and for worse. For what it's worth when it comes to Allen's better and worse Whatever Works falls happily in between and works just fine thank you very much.".

Afflicted by numerous neuroses Boris has become the ultimate pessimist seeing life as one long water slide ride into an eventual cesspool. So bleak is his outlook that he becomes convinced that suicide is the only option but even that cheap out fails him.Fed up with the world Boris turns his back on much that society has to offer instead spending his days teaching chess to kids while publicly humiliating them at every opportunity. Yes Boris isn't a happy camper and takes pride in it. The fact that he's managed to maintain a core of four friends is a miracle in and of itself.Then one day fate causes him to cross paths with Melodie St. Ann Celestine played by the delightful Evan Rachel Wood a country bumpkin runaway from the backwoods of Louisiana. She is Jethro Bodine to Yellnikoff's Einstein. A complete intellectual and generational opposite. Love at first sight it isn't but given the axiom that opposites attract Boris soon finds himself falling for the much younger siren cue the Allen parallels.While some critics have complained that much of the dialog comes across as stilted and unnatural which it does Whatever Works unravels more like a stage play than real life which I think is how Allen meant it. As writer and director he has lots to say here and refuses to allow such trivialities as natural delivery stand in the way. This isn't to say that the performances are wooden but rather that nobody talks like Yelnikoff in real life and I'm good with that. What's important here are the ideas constructs and situations that Allen infuses in his characters.Interestingly while much of the movie's theme focuses on the serendipity of life and thumbs its nose at the divine the film can easily be viewed from both the atheistic and spiritual viewpoint particularly given how events unfold in a seemingly manipulated manner.While not Allen's finest work Whatever Works will appeal to those who enjoy a light romantic comedy particularly one that provokes a few sparks from our grey matter while delivering its laughs.".

The movie works for me as the smartest most enjoyable of this summer with a message countering Allen and his alter ego's worldweariness.It doesn't take long to look at David's work cocreating Seinfeld and starring in his own Curb Your Enthusiasm to see that this worldweary worry wart is a good choice to play an Allenlike New York Jewish intellectual. Unfortunately his lack of real acting talent is a hindrance especially when he slips into shouting many of his lines. Yet when David plays himself more than the stuttering Allen he becomes relaxed and believable. When David speaks to the audience several times the sincerity is powerful.Allen wanted Zero Mostel to play this part his death in 1977 put the script in mothballs for decades. As an accomplished Broadway and film actor Mostel underscores David's limited acting range.The conceit of Whatever Works is that older Boris in his 60's hooks up with twentyyearold Southern Melodie Evan Rachel Wood despite his genius mind rejecting the whole affair as trite but his heart going with whatever works. Throughout Allen juxtaposes the Southern innocence with Northern experience creating a situation where NYC actually transforms the Southerners into urban sybarites no better exemplified than the transformation of Melodie's mom Patricia Clarkson from bible thumper to artist humper with avant garde photos and multiple lovers. Even her exhusband John Ed Begley Jr. has a NYC epiphany of the sexual kind.Although Allen has his characters looking for love with results that will remind you of his Everyone Says I Love You the sweetness is replaced with a philosophy that encourages searching out whatever works because of the transitory nature of love and life.The mixture of love and cynicism allows deep appreciation of irony and the transformative nature of experience.".

	schema:reviewBody "When Woody Allen's films are released in the UK I usually blink and miss them. I happened to be in France this week so I was able to catch Whatever Works which is having its first general release in that most Woodyfriendly of countries.In Whatever Works Larry David plays Boris Yellnikoff Woody Allen's most unsympathetic character yet. He is even bleaker than Harry Block in Deconstructing Harry this is despite the fact that the screenplay was apparently written in 1977 during what some people refer to as Woody's funny period. Woody usually gets away with his portrayals of nihilistic characters because of his diffident manner. Larry David on the other hand plays what is recognizably an Allen character but in a very aggressive manner direct to camera. I do sympathise with Allen's world view that life is meaningless arbitrary painful and followed by oblivion but even for a sceptic like me David's delivery is a little too blunt. To make matters worse he is an arrogant misanthrope who regards himself as a genius and everyone else as inchworms and cretins. He even verbally and physically abuses the small children who he is supposed to be coaching in chess.By chance Boris shacks up with a nave Mississipean runaway Melodie charmingly played by Evan Rachel Wood. In one of many implausible plot devices she just turns up on Boris's doorstep and he takes her in. Things start to look unpleasantly like an old man's fantasy with the 60something Boris and the 20something Melodie although fortunately Allen spares us the bedroom details. We are in familiar Allen territory here with an older man having a Svengalilike influence on a younger woman. Then suddenly in the film's best scene Melodie shows that she has completely adapted Boris's attitudes and beliefs expressing contempt for her young friends' optimism and cheerfulness.Things improve greatly in the second half of the film as the action becomes more farcical. First Melodie's mother arrives on their doorstep closely followed by her father. Both are rapidly seduced by New York life and renounce their Southern fundamentalism for exciting new lifestyles and sexual orientations. Melodie's mother Marietta mischievously played by Patricia Clarkson becomes a famous photographer on the strength of some snaps she has taken with a cheap camera. The plotting is quite perfunctory here but it is so funny that the viewer is carried along with the fantasy. And of course it is a fantasy that the vast majority of Americans who believe in Heaven and Hell can just have Allen's doctrine of despair explained to them and reject their value systems instantly.The film ends on a note of euphoria and one can see that the whole thing is a parable. All the characters seize their one bit of happiness whatever works for them in a naughty world. I liked the way the mood of the film flips it starts in despair but you leave the cinema with a broad smile and a warm glow.".

	schema:headline " A trip back to vintage '70s Woody Allen that's almost convincing";
	schema:reviewBody "For those wondering what happened to the old Woody Allen here he is. Whatever Works is a script from the 1970s. I noticed that without even knowing Allen has been forthright about it. A few script rewrites  talk about the Taliban and not the Communists  and old Woody works in a modern context. Then again Whatever Works is not a film that anyone will herald the second coming of great Woody Allen comedy but it is one that will win over a handful of audience members.Whatever Works is pure vintage Woody. Boris Yellnikoff Larry David is a cynical neurotic and suicidal man that Allen would've played himself in 1977 had he been old enough. He's an elitist intellectual jerk who loves classical music and literature and spews life philosophy. He is a Harvard grad physicistturnedchessteacher who considers himself a genius and everyone else a peon. He delivers an opening monologue. He and the characters in this film go to the movies reference movies and attend art gallery showcases  and it takes place in New York. This is the comfort food of Woody Allen movies.If one considers the film's title a mantra then Allen must've applied it in casting Larry David. David ... works. He's got only a few gears as an actor and we've seen plenty of his main gear on HBO series Curb Your Enthusiasm. We get lots more of it here only Boris spouts some of Woody's wittiest lines and insults of all time. It's great but it comes with the price that Boris is a jerk and his thoughts about life  we only grow closer to death love is a waste of time there's all this crap to worry about  make him overbearing. It's to Allen's point but it's difficult to listen to Boris at times.In a twist of Allen's love for cosmic coincidence Boris meets a 21yearold runaway Southern girl named Melodie St. Anne Celestine Evan Rachel Wood who he takes in and via foot in the door ends up letting stay. She's a completely naive and uneducated stereotype the complete opposite of Boris and all Woody prototypes with great purpose however. Mistaking his crafty insults and fatalistic world view for great intelligence Melodie develops a crush on him and Boris with his take what you can getenjoy what you have mentality agrees to marry her. All manages to work until Melodie's mother Patricia Clarkson finds her in New York and her traditional views act as a major countering force to their relationship.Allen's crafty little concoction about not being able to plan for life and love and all its overwhelming negatives that can pop up at any moment is nearly charming. Truthfully it's a bit sophomoric for his capability level in terms of comedy. The Southern stereotyping random sharp turn of events and his choice to break the fourth wall in a film no less might all be leading somewhere but it's nothing you totally bite on. The situations are funny and interesting but not believable or sophisticated enough to convince you to start popping Allen's philosophy pills.Whatever Works is neoclassical Woody Allen. It's like asking your mother to cook you something she always made when you were a kid only it's 40 years later and not all the same ingredients are present and she uses some different and not as sophisticated ones as a replacement. In other words not quite what it used to be but it's still pleasantly palatable and it takes you back in a positive way.Steven CVisit my site at httpmoviemusereviews.blogspot.com".

She is one of our greatest living character actress's working today and hope to see her in many more films. She adds class and perfection to everything she does.The story could have been quite discomforting with a young girl and man old enough to be her almost grandfather. But somehow it works as we are not witness to anything inappropriate not even a kiss. Even though David plays an unsympathetic role and nobody actually talks like that he's still fun. The evolution of the Evan Rachel Wood character is wonderful.There are a couple of neat twists at the end and it all ties together for a very happy ending. See this for Woody at his best.".

So the first ten to fifteen minutes or so into the movie I'm thinking that Larry David is better at improvising as on his own show than doing someone else's lines albeit Woody Allen's.But then as usually is the case with Mr. Allens movies I got hooked half way through. I got hooked because it was very well done. The story the direction the acting  yes Larry David was perfect for this. It was a risky casting move on Mr. Allen's part but it worked beautifully. I like it also because Mr. Allen interjects philosophy in all of his movies. He courageously exposes himself allows us to hear his thoughts and does these things by seducing us with entertainment. Excellent work.The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the sort of tying up philosophy about how we should go with whatever works. Such a happy ending. Why?That said id didn't interfere with my overall appreciation of the movie.".

Also disclaimer I really like and respect Woody Allen's work and I'm also an ex New Yorker. With a Jewish wife no less. So no okay I'm not unbiased. All that said... I fully agree with boyden in that this movie is far better than the reviews it gets from critics. On rottentomatoes.com for instance this garnered a 45 rating. That's on par with nonhits like Gigli etc. Yet the dialogue was great... Larry David was as close to a Woody Allen substitute as anyone has come in a long time Allen always casts people he can direct to sound like him it seems... and it made me crave that old New York before the money of the recent prebust boom turned it into a homogenized hasbeen of a city. Evan Rachel Wood by the way was overwhelmingly charming. And I thought all the other acting was excellent too in the way people act in Woody Allen movies... which is ALWAYS different from what it is in other films you occasionally get those moments where the lines are crafted or improvised rather than somewhere in the middle.At any rate it's amazing the size of the disconnect between fan response and the response of the critics... who in my opinion should go watch Annie Hall and Sleeper and the like so they can remember again.".

The only problem his character here Boris Yellnikoff is just a very bitter abusive negative force ... so even some of the best comedic moments are a bit tainted by the mean spiritedness.Evan Rachel Wood has been a star in the making since Thirteen and really brings a new dimension not just to her career but also the film. Her runaway southern belle is a flat out hoot. When her parents Patricia Clarkson and Ed Begley Jr. arrive we gain some insight into Allen's thought process ... he thinks NYC is the be all and end all ... and can even enlighten those southern crackers.Mr. Allen has always been obsessed with three topics ... dying sex and intellect and all three are on prominent display here. He really has an innate ability to exaggerate life subtleties and slap us upside the head in his films. I believe his message is that the big picture of life is overwhelming and disheartening but as individuals we can each find happiness.".

	schema:reviewBody "A perfect blend of Woody Allen's views on love and relationships and Larry David's pessimism of life and the imbecilic Whatever Works won't appeal to those who can't find humor in the morbid recesses and sarcastic ranting of these two comedians' minds but everyone else will revel in the darkly misanthropic philosophies. Though this perverse fable may wrap up a little too neatly for those less inclined to believe in optimism for such an ensemble of decadent misfits viewers with the right amount of indifference towards decency won't object as long as they aren't one of the mindless zombie masses so scathingly scolded in the cynical social commentary.Attempting to impress his ideologies on religion relationships and the randomness and worthlessness of existence lifelong New York resident Boris Yellnikoff Larry David rants to anyone who will listen including the audience. But when he begrudgingly allows naive Mississippi runaway Melodie St. Ann Celestine Evan Rachel Wood to live in his apartment his reclusive rages give way to an unlikely friendship and Boris begins to mold the impressionable young girl's worldly views to match his own. When it comes to love whatever works is his motto but his already perplexed life complicates itself further when Melodie's parents eventually track her down.It may be written by Woody Allen but it certainly feels like Larry David's material. Regardless of who's channeling who the biting humor in the film is simply hilarious it's surprising how much fun can be had from watching a character who positively abhors life people and interaction. Boris may not be relatable but he's wickedly sarcastic and intelligently despicable. The conclusion may be a bit too tidy to be interpreted as much more than a cynical comedy but the supporting actors and clever dialogue creates a set of disillusioned protagonists that are easy to watch.Perhaps the most intriguing aspect is the oddcouple pairing of elderly Yellnikoff and the hopelessly nave twentysomething Melodie. Extreme differences in age and social standings have been explored in Allen's previous films but both characters are so delightfully polar opposites that seeing them together is refreshing. They're two runaways on a mission to fulfill the illusion of meaning one a selfproclaimed genius the other a foolish feebleminded cretin with a heart of gold. Add to that the nonstop sophomoric tirades on religion sexuality mortality marriage the presidency racism human existence and chess and you've got an overload of pessimistic insights posing as genius. It may not be a feel good movie but it's convincingly ridiculous and it absolutely works.The Massie Twins".

During an existential crisis Boris ends his marriage with Jessica Carolyn McCormick and jumps through the window to commit suicide. However the canopy saves his life and Boris becomes limp and quits his job in Columbia. He moves to an old apartment downtown and gives chess classes to children to make some money. When the simpleminded religious Mississippi runaway Melodie Saint Ann Celestine Evan Rachel Wood asks for food to him he temporarily lodges the girl in his apartment. Along the days the atheist Boris shapes Melodie to his thoughts and the girl impressed with his pretentious geniality fits his world. Despite their difference of ages they marry each other and have a routine life. However the world of Boris changes when out of the blue Melodie's mother Marietta Patricia Clarkson arrives in their apartment.Whatever Works is an ironic romantic comedy about how irrational things of the heart are. The lead character Boris Yellnikoff is annoying and maybe reflects the alter ego of Woody Allen in the present days. But the black humor is hilarious and does not disappoint the fans of this great director with cynical and witty lines. The return of Woody Allen to New York is great and shows that he has not lost his shape. My vote is seven.Title Brazil Tudo Pode Dar Certo Everything Can Work".

	schema:headline " Anything You Would Ever Hope From Either of the Two Comic Masters.";
	schema:reviewBody "There is something to Woody Allen's method of working that as ironic as it may seem to his general appearance outdoes most other great filmmakers working right now. Every year since 1967 he has come out with at least one film. He had no idea what end of the camera had the lens when he started. By now he has come across such a wide array of different genres themes casting and setting staples and classical influences that with a career that has had unequivocal consistency he gives us precisely what even the most remote Woody Allen observer would expect from him but with such an intensely enriched mark of mastered skills as both a writer and a director and the age that has been spent mastering them. It is a simply classically structured story about an old Jewish man that can't stand being so much smarter than everybody else. And so he is.He casts Larry David in what Woody Allen himself would probably deny is the Woody Allen role but he couldn't deny that it has all the accoutrements that embody the persona he's made almost inimitably his. But David is the star here in a role originally for Zero Mostel but despite everything is inimitably himself as well nonetheless. He has the extra bite and carping dysfunctionality that is more his shtick that Allen's. The two apt collaborators easily remain flexible with each other. David plays Boris Yellnikoff a misanthropic intellectual who teaches chess to children and abuses them when they don't make the moves that he finds obvious. He is nonetheless a highly knowledgeable man. Whatever your opinion may be of his political and social commentary we're not given a choice whether or not to think highly of his intelligence when he shows the other characters in the opening scene that they are in a movie and they stagger in discovery of this and quiver in denial. To onlookers however he just looks insane and that is the key to his crabby cynicism. But despite all his knowledge and wisdom in the end there is only one deducement he can make of all the chaos To be sort of happy in life you have to do what you want not what other people tell you to do.It's as sheer as that as we see when what are to him broad cultural fastsketches enter his purposely lonely life after a divorce and an attempted suicide and the plots strands unravel for the duds of the American South to find their true selves unfettered by their stubborn traditional mores in the unadulterated liberalizing melting pot of New York City. Evan Rachel Wood is the overtly ironic love interest for Boris who is truly and utterly disgusted by her and no matter what hilariously unkind names he call her she does not simply act as if he is performing his standup routine to the wall like many other lesser vehicles for comedians but gives a real performance by reacting in the innocently confused way that Boris is baffled to find endearing. The true cartoons are Patricia Clarkson and Ed Begley Jr. who effortlessly play their characters without missing a beat in the swift aboutfaces they undergo from the minute they're on screen.This film is not just the collaboration of two talents with a lot in common culturally. It is anything you would ever hope from either of them. Larry David is a clever and funny persona under his own lifesucks farcical writing but that very broad and freetoroam character is sharpened and distilled under Woody's veteran instinct which is as sagacious as ever because although his work has been particularly strong recently this is not another attempt at something new to his range as most of the filmography from Match Point on have been. This is what he began doing and always has kept as his staple a broad screwball sex comedy with an interwoven intellectual urge and a familiar intimacy with New York. And he's given himself extra room to be unapologetically sociopolitical and brutally honest about his ideologies viewpoints on sex and love between people of drastically different ages and generally the overall deeply imprinted signature of a Jewish agnostic New Yorker who has lived a long time stayed busy and never stopped pondering.".

There's NO bassinet. That's just silly so stop it. She's old enough for marriage okay? I'm pretty sure. Let's see.. according to IMDb Evan Rachel Wood was in the movie Thirteen at least 5 years ago making her..ahh carry the one...making her over the legal age by.. mmm... by months. SEVERAL months okay? So let's settle down stop the insinuations  it's beneath you really  and get on with the review The acting is uniformly horrible right down to the extras and unseen characters but I'm not sure the source material they're reading COULD be acted well. In Act One the characters loudly announce their stereotypes in Act Two they announce their abrupt life changes into totally different stereotypes then in Act Three they announce that life's a crap shoot the universe is an uncaring void but the joys of the Marx Brothers makes life worth living so support your comic movie makers. The End. Drive safely.Is this the same Woody Allen that made Annie Hall? It can't be the same guy can it? Maybe I'm mixed up and it's a Woody Woodpecker picture. It's loud and annoying like a woodpecker. I'll have to check IMDb on that one. Anyway I stuck with the whole mess because Larry David is funny in his improvisational show Curb Your Enthusiasm. But with written lines he seems to just..what's the word?.. exclaim everything. It's not acting really it's more like acting out. In any case this movie gives off a strange vibe. The dialog is so stagy and weird that it seems like it must have been made that way on purpose. But why would a woodpecker do that? This is a terrible movie.".

The soundtrack for the movie actually cost more than this DVD.What is it about Larry David's walk. Was he injured at some time? That wasn't him crashing through the windows so it must have been something else like polio that caused that swerving almost drunken gait. He also does it in Curb Your Enthusiasm so it's natural.Hilarious movie. I don't really buy the mother falling into the menage a trois thing with her super religious background but whatever. It's a comedy. Real life wouldn't even had David let the girl into his apartment too afraid of pedophile arrests.".

	schema:headline " The Bolder Allen";
	schema:reviewBody "The themes are the usual ones. But the attitude has gotten worse! Larry David plays the character that Allen would usually play himself but this times the character is more certain more contempt and with a larger ego.It is not usual for a Woody Allen movie to upset anyone but this one really might! The certainty is irritating.

Instead every thing goes smoothly until the happy end. Unlike the alienated Alvy Singer for example Boris is like a prophet.. every man he meets gets saved and at the end he's surrounded by many people with a big smile on his face.It is wonderful to see a man whose work and mentality I extremely admire grows to be more in peace with his ideas.".

Her mother is a character who like her exhusband undergoes a totally unbelievable transformation and the denouement has all the characters who have either betrayed or been betrayed happy together.

Music and movies that Woody loved when he was 21  he reveries as untouchable icons . Everything else sucks.Shameful and embarrassing . It was not a surprise to see that Woody has signed the petition to release Roman Polanski.Worst of all and this really is unforgivable he steals a joke.

Woody Allen has made an unforgivably unfunny film that no matter how hard it tries it never works and doesn't produce one laugh.

Having heard about the Guinea Pig movies many years ago I had been warned that they were strong stuff and best viewed on fastforward due to the overthetop graphic violence or pornographic gore as I believe Chas Balun referred to it in one of his articles. As my finger paused on the Play button I had to wonder Would the films be just too much to view or another case of overhyped horror product? The first Guinea Pig production was Devil's Experiment 1985 otherwise known as Unabridged Agony. This 1986 straighttovideo release in Japan is a deliberately low budget production resembling a snuff movie with just a touch of Japanese artistic content to make the viewing experience more bearable. Interestingly the original Japanese video release had no credits and so bore more resemblance to an under the counter real snuff flick! My own feelings are that this original version presented on a VHS tape would have really appeared seedier and more ahem authentic.The plot as such is that a gang of men systematically abuse and torture a young woman climaxing in her final demise. Their various methods of pain affliction involve the use of white noise constant rotation forced to drink alcohol being burnt cut etc. One of the most bizarre moments of the ordeal is when the unconscious victim is being pelted with animal guts. Although it could be argued that there isn't really a storyline as such the film does succeed in a slightly sordid voyeuristic and uncomfortable manner in making the viewer an unwilling viewer of the unfolding events.The film definitely isn't easy going but the episodic nature of the production allows you to draw breath before being plunged into the next atrocity. In terms of raw energy this production does pack a punch.".

It weighs really heavy on you and with the small nuances of the film like the fact that there's no opening or ending credits and that the actors in the film have their eyes blacked out with bars for the sake of authenticity really lends a hand to the entire experience of this shocker for sure. After finishing this frightfully offensive movie I remember thinking to myself... What the HELL have I just seen here? I think I just saw something that I shouldn't! Now I just know that sock full of nuts and bolts sure looked real when they smacked her across the face with it. Not to mention the gutteral scream that she bellowed out when that scalding hot water hit her elbow with that fleshy exposed wound. Ehmmm... makes my knees go weak just thinking about it. Be careful. I'm warning you BE CAREFUL with this one! I swear it! I've tried to warn you! DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM!!!".

	schema:headline " An honest look at Guinea Pig";
	schema:reviewBody "I felt compelled to write this review because I read so many negative things about the film before I saw it.  I wondered if the film was really that bad or if people were just so disgusted by what they saw they felt the need to trash it.  That's why I decided to provide an honest look at Guinea Pig.The first important thing to know about Guinea Pig is that it is quite obviously fake.  I won't go into details as to why but the reasons are many and widespread throughout the entire film.  From the first frame of video alone text that explains where the film came from...are we to believe that this was actually released?  A much more effective start would have been to just dive right into the video.  That way we might have some sense that perhaps we are viewing something illegal that somehow slipped through the cracks.The question is why is it so important that Guinea Pig is obviously fake? Unlike other films Guinea Pig doesn't have any character development. Without empathy for the film's characters the only thing that we have to rely on for fear is the thought that maybe just maybe what we are seeing is real.  Contrast that with Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  We know that's just a film but it is much more effective because we care what happens to the characters.  Also TCM is able to show some scenes of violence from the victim's point of view allowing the viewer to put himself in the victim's shoes.  Guinea Pig can't do those things so the only thing it has to frighten us with is realism.Guinea Pig fails in the realism department so does that mean the film is a total failure?  Not exactly.  I think Guinea Pig succeeds on two levels.Human beings have a natural instinct towards selfpreservation.  It's that very instinct that causes the thought of true snuff to illicit such horror as well as curiosity.  When viewing questionable material this instinct also causes us to search for explanations as to why what we are watching is not real.  In one scene the victim has hot oil poured on her arm.  This is obviously not really happening as she makes no reasonable attempt to move her arm out of the path of the spilling oil.  But hold on....how do I know that?  The film made me consider it.  The mere fact that viewing Guinea Pig made me have to think about how a person might react to hot oil being spilled on them means that it has succeeded on some level.  Whether this success of the film is something that the viewer actually wants is another question entirely.Secondly I think Guinea Pig succeeds in forcing us to think about what we are willing to see.  Though quite fake the famous climactic needle scene is indescribably difficult to watch.  This forces the viewer to consider how much more he is willing to see.  Many people seek shocking video but then wish they could unsee what they have seen.  Perhaps Guinea Pig can provide some answers as to what we are willing to see.  If nothing else maybe after seeing Guinea Pig we will really think about viewing something before wishing we could unsee it.In summation I can't recommend Guinea Pig because of its shortcomings.  I expect its recent domestic release on DVD will create wide interest in the film but I would certainly wait until it's in the 10 bin before considering it.  I even found Jeepers Creepers to be a scarier experience because at least the story was told well.  With the lack of any story and the lack of realism what does Guinea Pig really have to offer?  Not much.".

And at this point I will say that these films are NOT real! They are faked horror films which try to be as realistic as possible.The scenes are sickening but also unrealistic in many cases. For example when they kick the girl in the floor we can clearly see how they kick and stump the floor near the girl! And how stupid this looks! The sound effects are also unrealistic and don't make sense. Other scenes include animal intestines thrown on the girl the girl exposed to loud noises for many hours the ripping off of fingernails worms placed on the wounds in the girl's body the eye pierced and mutilated in horrific detail and stuff like that. Very sick and mean spirited film and has absolutely nothing valuable or cinematically significant. This first entry is the sickest and most amateurish Guinea Pig although it is not as bloody as the next part Flowers of Flesh and Blood which tries to be as shocking as possible.Guinea Pig Devil's Experiment is perhaps the sickest thing I've seen and the closest thing to snuff there is. This is still of course faked sntuff the only difference to genuine snuff film is that no one dies or hurts for real in this film. I cannot recommend this to anyone since thi s is so sy and repulsive. They who consider this is a great horror film understand nothing about cinema and the real meaning of it. I watched this as a curiosity as the other parts in the series and now I know how insignificant trash these are. They work only in shock level and that's not too valuable cinematic achievement. Devil's Experiment is perhaps the sickest film I've seen and Mermaid in a Manhole Guinea Pig 4 is perhaps the most disgusting film I've seen. So these are pretty extreme in my book but that's all they are.".

Devil's Experiment falls solidly into the latter category. It is of course the horror version of hardcore porn. An almost completely plot less 43minute wait for the money shot. Shot on video in 1985 it consists of three relatively nondescript Japanese boys torturing one fairly unattractive Japanese girl. The tortures range from the banal slapping her 50 times kicking her a hundred the silly tying her to an office chair and spinning her around the fear factor a bath of maggots and sheep guts and finally the money shot. A well executed eyeball piercing. That's it no plot no motive just Blair Witch tree shots and torture. The girl looks bored and with the exception of yelling no one expects the Spanish Inquisition during the office chair scene I was bored silly. Staring dumbfounded at the screen waiting for the money shot. Just like hardcore porn.".

	schema:reviewBody "Guinea Pig 1  Devil's Experiment is one of those films I have wanted to see ever since I saw a trailer for it and the first sequel in the early 90's. It was impossible to get back then because customs would stop any video on their banned list from entering the country and I didn't feel like going to Japan just to see it either.The piece is not a movie in the conventional sense though it belongs firmly in the horror genre. What you have is a horror film stripped to the bare essentials of what makes a good horror movie atmosphere violence and gore. Devil's Experiment is more like a piece of funereal art than a movie. It is something you would run day and night on a large flatscreen monitor and put up on the wall next to your Hieronimus Bosche prints.It is quite a short movie but it belongs up there with other classics of the period like Texas Chainsaw Massacre Cannibal Ferox etc. This film however is art because the makers were making a point about extremity. These days mainstream movies are far more extreme in terms of violence and special effects but mainstream movies use context to justify what is on the screen. Take away plot narrative and meaning though and you would have a hard time justifying the rest of it. Charlie Sheen waged a personal campaign to have the Guinea Pig movies banned in the USA in the early 90's which just made them more popular. I only mention it because I don't remember seeing Charlie Sheen in any movie of merit. While his films will be forgotten over time the Guinea Pig movies will live on  possibly being included on the curriculum at film makers school along with Metropolis Citizen Kane and the like.Devil's Experiment is a havetosee' movie for lovers of movies not just horror movie fans either and art. Time has taken its toll on the impact of the movie so you must view it with a mind of when it was made. Indeed it could probably be shown on free to air TV channels in forwardthinking areas such as Europe UK and Japan the UK showed an artist eating the flesh of a real dead baby at the beginning of the year on free to air TV.It is an interesting movie the special effects are welldone considering the miniscule budget on which it was made. Don't believe the hype about it either. It is not the most sick or horrific movie you will ever see. Chances are if you are reading this review then you have seen a more horrific movie already.8 out of 10 and I am now after the sequels.".

Fingernails teared off beaten with hands feet tools infested by maggots ... and many more until the final scene  I'm still not sure how they did that . Because it belongs to the 'japonese underground scene' it's obvious she didn't get a lot of money. So what were her  their  motivations ?I saw it in japonese without subtitles but it's not a problem  no real dialogues the boys are just insulting her in a few scenes . I haven't seen yet all the serial but the first Guinea Pig is not known for being the best one. Still I've rated 8 because if the purpose was making people believe this a snuff the issue is quite good  ask Charlie Sheen the actor .

Oh the humanity! She doesn't even make any noises for the last half of it. She's just sitting there as they pour a few maggots on a wound and even when they shove a massive needle through her eyeball... not a peep.What was up with the sheep guts part? She screams as they lightly toss sheep organs onto her but not a noise as they shove a needle through her eyeball. Seems pretty legit to me! I was expecting to see something that would haunt my dreams for weeks. Instead I'm laughing at how weak of an effort it is 10 minutes after watching.The second Guinea Pig Flowers of Flesh and Blood is 100 times more disturbing but even that one isn't particularly awful. It took itself less seriously though and even has a twisted kind of comic relief in the way the killer is wearing a samurai helmet has a powdered white face and fake halfrotten hillbilly teeth.There have been college dorm hazing rituals more awful than this lame film. If you want to laugh at something stupid then sure give this film a try. Otherwise just move along and find something else.".

We just started releasing the Guinea Pig films on DVD for North America. Now before you ask why am I writing a review? Instead ask why some people bash it. I'm writing this review because I love the Guinea Pig films. Why do I love em it's because they go for the throat and they don't let go. I've seen it all. Almost every horror film known to man Argento Fulci Bava Buttgereit. from every underground cult sensation to every Hollywood blockbuster. I've seen it all and the films that have stuck in my head over the years was definitely the Guinea Pig films. Why because it doesn't try to hide the reason why we watch horror movies in the 1st place. This review is for the Devils Experiment. I find it devoid of story which is fine by me. Why do I watch horror films? So I can see blood and gore and the torture of people. The Devils Experiment not only delivers but that's all it is. Pure unadulterated violence. Yeah I like a story but sometimes I just want the gore and the Devils Experiment delivers ten fold. Why do people bash it. Cause they like a story so that the torture and death of a person can be hidden behind a story. It make em feel better about themselves. We all want blood and gore. It's just really hard to justify it if it's not wrapped around a story. The Guinea Pig films have a historical meaning to them and they have created a definitive splash whenever they have been released.I'm thrilled to be able to release one of the most famous horror series in the world. Maybe I shouldn't have written this review but then again maybe I should. My view is biased cause were releasing them but then again it's not. I've always told people to find them and to watch them way before I started Unearthed Films. Sure it's exploitive and over the top but isn't that why we watch horror films in the 1st place. The Devils Experiment is NOT for everybody. It's for thrill seekers and gorehounds only. If you think Jason movies and Freddy Krueger movies are awesome then stick to those. But if your on the next level and have seen it all then the Devils Experiment is for you. There is a reason why they haven't been released for over 17 years. They are wrong disgusting and down right freaky and not something to watch with your mom unless she is totally cool. Good luck enjoy and never stop living your life.".

Anyone who browses through my other user comments will notice that I am actually very proviolencegore when it comes to films. However I do think that there should be at least some point to the violence. This piece of crap doesn't have any point whatsoever. The first film in the notorious Guinea Pig series The Devil's Experiment 1985 is widely controversial but as opposed to many other controversial films this stinker has nothing at all to be recommended for. I must say that before seeing any of the GunieaPig films I already had a feeling that I would hate this one knowing what it was about. Due to its status as one of the most controversial films around however I decided I had to see it. I am very glad I didn't waste any money on this pile of crap and I sure wish I hadn't wasted my time with it either.This thing's story I don't even want to call it a 'film' It doesn't have one. Three scumbags torture a woman to death for some excruciating 40 minutes. That's it. There is no artistic value no 'shocking' story no suspense nothing. Simply the disbelief that a film that shows NOTHING except for a woman being tortured for no reason enjoys an enormous cultfollowing. It IS disturbing I give it that. Of course it is disturbing to watch a torture video for 40 minutes. What is more disturbing however is the fact that many people actually seem to regard this pile of garbage as some kind of masterpiece. I really cannot figure why. The fact that the gore effects look realistic cannot be the reason I hope. The girl who plays the victim isn't a very good actor and reacts very calm to all the torture. That makes the film look less realistic which is in this single case a good thing. This is a film that is sickening not for its gore but for its redundancy its existence for the sole purpose of showing 40 minutes of torture.I strongly oppose any form of censorship. Since this is 100 per cent fake and nobody got hurt during its production it is of course legitimate to make such a film. However I cannot think of a single reason why anyone would like this other than the morbid desire to watch suffering and the enjoyment of torture. This film's sequel Flowers of Flesh and Blood gained notoriety when actor Charlie Sheen mistook it for an actual snuff film and informed the FBI. Fortuneately the film turned out to be fake. Overall The Devil's Experiment is a fake torturesnuff film that seems to have the sole purpose of looking as close to a real snuff film as possible.The Devil's Experiment is one of the worst films I have ever had the misfortune of sitting through. Don't torture yourself by giving this piece of crap a try for its controversial status. Do yourself a favor and avoid it.".

It's commentary said This is a report of an experiment in the breaking point of bearable pain and the corrosion of people's senses but it was in fact an exhibition of devilish cruelty as 3 perpetrators severely abused a woman. Note Guines Pig is defined as any experimental material.' Once that's out the way Za Ginipiggu Akuma no Jikken starts proper  the fun begins... Another caption informs us that it is 'Summer 198X' the film is split up into various sections that are preceded by a title card  the first one reads 'HIT' in which three men slap  punch a woman named Yegg around her face  eventually start whacking her with a small cloth bag full of coins a counter in the bottom right hand corner of the screen indicates 100 before the second section 'KICK' begins which is self explanatory. The third is 'CLAW' in which the skin on Yegg's arm  hand is pinched with a metal tool of some sort. Then it's 'UNCONCIOUS' in which the men spin Yegg around on a chair a lot. Next up is 'A SOUND' in which Yegg is subjected to a horrible high pitched noise through headphones which are tied  taped to her head as the counter reads 20h Yegg starts to drool. In 'BURN' the men pour boiling hot water over Yegg's arms. 'WORM' sees a load of maggots poured over Yegg's face body  wounds. 'GUTS' shows the men throwing presumably animal intestines all over poor Yegg  finally Za Ginipiggu Akuma no Jikken finishes with 'NEEDLE' which is the showstopper where Yegg is put out of her misery... The first of 7 Guinea Pig films produced in Japan Za Ginipiggu Akuma no Jikken is sick offencive twisted depraved senseless brutal  has no redeeming values whatsoever which means it's just about the perfect exploitation film! I can't say I loved it but at the same time I found it quite watchable for what it was. There is no story no characters  it really is just scene after scene of Yegg being beaten  abused. I should also point out that Za Ginipiggu Akuma no Jikken is totally fake  that's an absolute certainty. While the special makeup effects are very good they don't convince 100 having said that the needle inserted into Yegg's eye is a brutal scene  I can see how many would be grossed out by it but it's definitely just an effect albeit an impressive one. The production is extremely basic being filmed on what looks like a camcorder there are no sets to speak of no music  it contains virtually no dialogue except abuse the men hurl at Yegg. There isn't really much else to say about Za Ginipiggu Akuma no Jikken except that if it sounds offencive to you then it will be otherwise if you like extreme cinema  looking for something unique then this may fit the bill for you. I found it strangely watchable I don't know what that says about me but it certainly isn't for everyone. Think carefully before you give this one a go difficult to recommend  my score is based on my own personal liking of it.".

	schema:headline " An alright decent mystery 80's horror flick Amy Steel is the best";
	schema:reviewBody "This was an alright 80's horror flick and I like it but I do have problems with it. The only reason I watched this film was Amy Steel. I am a big fan of the actress and I love her to death in Friday the 13th Part 2 it is definitely in my top 3 favorite slasher Friday the 13th films series and I love her so damn much as Ginny Field! She was the best heroine in the slasher films in my opinion. Alongside with actress Lar ParkLincoln from Friday the 13th Part VII The New Blood I love this 2 actresses to death they are awesome heroine's from the 80's.Next month after 20th September I am getting all Friday the 13th movies on Bluray discs I purchased all 11 films. I do already have Freddy Vs. Jason and I have reviewed that film already. I also have A Nightmare on Elm Street Bluray collection which I am a fan of that horror franchise but I don't have any Friday the 13th movies in my collection. I just become a big fan of the franchise and I am so excited to get them. So after 20th September I will start reviewing all Friday the 13th movies all 11 films when I will re watch them again. That is why I just finished watching this movie today for my favorite actress Amy Steel. I love horror flicks from the 80's and my favorite werewolf film is The Howling that a lot of people hate and I just love how the film was directed and I love the filming locations in that movie.April Fool's Day is American mystery horror film directed by Fred Walton and it is filed with mystery entertainment intense and it is creepy film which the same time is terrifying with the humor around. I really miss these kind of films today that are filed with mystery and humor around the 80's films really had that. Today horror movies suck and they don't give 100 of them like this movie did.So the plot evolves around a group of college students on a weekend getaway at the island estate of their wealthy classmate which is infiltrated by a killer.First Amy Steel as Kit Graham the main heroine is awesome and she does a very excellent solid job her acting was awesome. Ken Olandt as Rob Kit's boyfriend was just alright. Deborah Foreman as MuffyBuffy St. John the twisted psychopath was a decent slasher assailant I liked her.These 3 cast of actors are the reason why this movie is so good the death scenes are terrifying and in the first hour it goes very very slow. It could have been faster the ending is great and it ends with a twist plot and a humor but the same time to me it come for as realistic. I know the death scenes were FX special effects they were shown in the movie. We see also a snake in the movie and it is a fake snake it is not real.The film was written by Danilo Bach who also wrote the story for Beverly Hills Cop alongside with Daniel Petrie Jr. who also wrote the screenplay for my favorite Eddie Murphy film that is why this movie is so good. So the problems with the film I do have are death scenes are not gory enough we never see the assailant ever in the film I wish they would have showed that. I wish the death scenes would be more gory and scary that's all the issues I have. By the end it is alright horror film it has a happy ending and i like that in the horror movies. Amy Steel is a brilliant addition to the cast a great heroine I love her to death in Friday The 13th part 2 and I also love her in this it's such a shame that she never became a big star but she will always be remembered as a terrific actress in my heart. She was always my favorite lead heroine of all of the Jason movies and yet again she plays the female lead in this which I was very happy with and again she was great. I wish I could meet Amy Steel and I wish she would have signed me Friday the 13th Part 2 poster I would really love to see that. But since I am not from US I can't meet her or get the poster signed from her to bed. She will always be in my heart.April Fool's Day is a 1986 American mystery horror film directed by Fred Walton and starring Deborah Foreman Amy Steel and Ken Olandt. The original music score was composed by Charles Bernstein.The film get's 910 I really love Amy Steel in this and I like the film it is fast paced entertaining film and goes fast around.".

	onyx:emotionText "This was an alright 80's horror flick and I like it but I do have problems with it. The only reason I watched this film was Amy Steel. I am a big fan of the actress and I love her to death in Friday the 13th Part 2 it is definitely in my top 3 favorite slasher Friday the 13th films series and I love her so damn much as Ginny Field! She was the best heroine in the slasher films in my opinion. Alongside with actress Lar ParkLincoln from Friday the 13th Part VII The New Blood I love this 2 actresses to death they are awesome heroine's from the 80's.Next month after 20th September I am getting all Friday the 13th movies on Bluray discs I purchased all 11 films. I do already have Freddy Vs. Jason and I have reviewed that film already. I also have A Nightmare on Elm Street Bluray collection which I am a fan of that horror franchise but I don't have any Friday the 13th movies in my collection. I just become a big fan of the franchise and I am so excited to get them. So after 20th September I will start reviewing all Friday the 13th movies all 11 films when I will re watch them again. That is why I just finished watching this movie today for my favorite actress Amy Steel. I love horror flicks from the 80's and my favorite werewolf film is The Howling that a lot of people hate and I just love how the film was directed and I love the filming locations in that movie.April Fool's Day is American mystery horror film directed by Fred Walton and it is filed with mystery entertainment intense and it is creepy film which the same time is terrifying with the humor around. I really miss these kind of films today that are filed with mystery and humor around the 80's films really had that. Today horror movies suck and they don't give 100 of them like this movie did.So the plot evolves around a group of college students on a weekend getaway at the island estate of their wealthy classmate which is infiltrated by a killer.First Amy Steel as Kit Graham the main heroine is awesome and she does a very excellent solid job her acting was awesome. Ken Olandt as Rob Kit's boyfriend was just alright. Deborah Foreman as MuffyBuffy St. John the twisted psychopath was a decent slasher assailant I liked her.These 3 cast of actors are the reason why this movie is so good the death scenes are terrifying and in the first hour it goes very very slow. It could have been faster the ending is great and it ends with a twist plot and a humor but the same time to me it come for as realistic. I know the death scenes were FX special effects they were shown in the movie. We see also a snake in the movie and it is a fake snake it is not real.The film was written by Danilo Bach who also wrote the story for Beverly Hills Cop alongside with Daniel Petrie Jr. who also wrote the screenplay for my favorite Eddie Murphy film that is why this movie is so good.

	schema:reviewBody "April Fool's Day has just the right smarts about it that it holds up extremely well even all these years later.  While the cast may be youthful the characters and story set this film way above teen slasher or horror flicks.  Mainly because this is really a mystery in the vein of Ten Little Indians. It's a good thing I saw this film in a theatre when it was first released in 1986  because the VHS cover has something on it that would have kept me AWAY if I had not seen the film already It's just what you'd expect from the producer who brought you Friday the 13th  Parts Two Three Four and Five.  You just can't put April Fool's Day in the same category as those films! This is far superior in story and intelligence.  It's clever wellwritten and has great characters that you like even if they are not so nice!  These days it seems it's more important to find the most popular actors and that is usually distracting and doesn't guarantee a good  film. April Fool's Day had lesser known stars for that time Deborah Foreman Amy Steel Clayton Rohner Griffin O'Neal and that worked as an advantage. The basic premise of a group of college students stuck on an island in a big house and one by one they disappear yes it's been done in many variations before.  But the clever execution of the story red herrings and the underrated Deborah Foreman's delightful portrayal of MuffyBuffy all make for a really fun viewing experience. Foreman has just the right amount of sweetness and can go right into being just plain quirky with such ease. The touch of having dolls on the dinner table sort of like name tags will bring a giggle and a smile for sure! One plus for this film is the fact that it didn't sink into the tiring T  A route.  Sure a few of the characters have sex on the brain but their actions and dialogue never really wander off into the gratuitous area. Guys if you really want lots of breasts than just go ahead and get some porn or a Playboy video okay?  Let the rest of us enjoy a good story once in a while! After the body count rises and things escalate into a tense and frenzied chase through the house you'll be surprised at what happens next.  April Fool's Day is one of the few films of this kind that actually had a very surprising reveal and I was even caught off guard left with my jaw agape at what the whole deal was about. The BIG surprise just happens so...abruptly that you feel just like the character that runs into the room  just stuck for a second! After about 90 minutes of mystery the payoff BETTER be good and sure enough  this one doesn't disappoint! I'm especially thrilled to have picked up the eerie soundtrack by Charles Bernstein on vinyl when it first came out and to this day love to give it a spin on the turntable. Paramount has a vast library of films that just NEED to be given great treatment on DVD and I'm crossing my fingers that films like April Fool's Day Let's Scare Jessica To Death and Polanski's film The Tenant will be given their glory.

Amy Steel from Friday The 13th 2 stars in this homage to crafty horror films alongside the charming sexy Deborah Foreman Waxwork.  It is really good to see at any time and nothing about it should disappoint you.  It is not your average horror movie.  It's really more funnier than scary.April Fool's Day provided horror fans something a little more tasteful than was expected back in mid80's.  It's nice to have a mystery every now and then and this movie will have you wondering what's up the sleeves of each character.

	schema:reviewBody "Student Muffy St. John whose family is incredibly wealthy decides to invite her college pals up to her parents' remote island home for a couple days getaway. The first day on the island is April fool's day which means everyone is trying to outdo each other with pranks but before they get to their destination one of there gags goes wrong when a person is rushed to hospital. When her friends reach her house they found items stashed away in their rooms and Muffy's behaviour has some friends worried. But what catches everyone's attention is that guest list is getting smaller and the pranks are no longer funny anymore with someone within the group making sure that no one leaves this getaway.You might think this is just another runofthemill slasher that falls on a very notable day but that's not entirely the case on this occasion. Well yeah this holiday slasher sticks to the usual formula and clichs of teenagers being knocked off one by one by an unseen killer but what sets it apart from it's subgenre are some neat twists a pinch of suspense VERY likable and real characters and mostly the unforgettable original conclusion that totally throws you off track. The unusual plot plays out more like a compelling murder mystery with it being very similar in the vein of Agatha Christie's 10 Little Indians. Although this one is quite lighthearted with a lot fun being thrown about with the constant I got you gags and a variety of ripe characters stereotypical of course who are believable in their actions hold a perfect rapport with each other and provide enough effective humour. Sure they aren't fleshed out but at least they aren't painful to watch and I never got tired of their shenanigans! Screenwriter Danilo Bach obviously brought over the bubbling energy from his earlier witty script in 'Beverly Hills Cop' to this spirited project and the results here definitely show in the final product. While the film might be kicking with such verve some people might be disappointed that's heavily with the absence of flowing nudity though we are teased and gracious gore. It's tame in that aspect with most of it happening off screen and we see only the aftermath of these murders with a little bit of blood chucked in. But you'll find out there's a reason why you don't see the murders. Since there ain't no gore in sight they had to build up the intrigue by squeezing out some blinding suspense and jump scares to keep you amused. The first halfhour is filled with usual get to know you scenes as everyone gets acquainted with their surrounding and each other while kidding around. Then it makes for stalk n slash phase where the setting of the isolated island comes to the foreground as now the impending doom fills every pocket of the screen. Maybe the atmosphere isn't that thick but the essential sound effects are efficiently creaked out to add to the growing anxiety and the neurotic score chimes in with some spiralling odd sounds that give out eerie and on edge vibe.Director Fred Walton manages to keep it all under wrap with some exhilarating suspense and sudden surprises so that when we come up to the film's conclusion it does ruffle some feathers. Because the film is pretty short it does seem to fly by quick enough without much tedious spots that are usually associated with the subgenre. Now the film's revelation is definitely ambitious risk because it's a make or break and in my opinion I thought the pay off was rather nifty. Although the tact on second ending I thought it could've done without. The performances by the entire cast are more than adequate from the likes of Deborah Foreman Amy Steel Tom Heaton Thomas F. Wilson Deborah Goodrich Ken Oldandt Jay Baker and Griffin O'Neal.This offbeat slasher that follows the conventional patterns definitely has more merit and style behind it's novelty to simply entertain.".

	schema:reviewBody "The basic plot of April Fool's Day is similar to many of the teen horrorslasher movies of the 1980s. For the most part the story of the first three quarters of the movie isn't really anything special. A group of eight friends travel to the island estate of Muffy St. John Deborah Foreman to spend the weekend. Soon the inevitable happens  people start disappearing and bodies start piling up. Of course there's no way off the island the phone isn't working and Muffy is acting very weird. But just when you think you've got things figured out the big ending comes out of nowhere.About the ending and I'm not going to give it away  from what I've read it seems to be a love it or hate it proposition. There's not much middle ground. You will either feel cheated and want to throw your remote at the television or you will love it and appreciate it as something different. Put me in the love it category. I think it is a nice change of pace from the normal horror movie from the period. There are a few very few clues as to what's coming up but it takes a repeat viewing to pick them up.Most of the 80s teen horror movies have interchangeable characters  there is a nerd a jock a slut a good girl etc. And even though the characters in April Fool's Day can be put in these categories they are not as exaggerated as you find in most similar movies. The writers should be given credit for at least attempting to write somewhat real characters. By no means do we get in depth characterizations but these characters are more like people I actually knew in the 80s.As usual I do have a couple problems with the movie. The biggest complaint I have is the idea that the whole scheme could be pulled off without anyone knowing or discovering what was going on. That notion requires an extra large leap in any sort of known logic. And I have a problem making a jump that large.By the way what ever happened to Deborah Foreman? After the 80s she seems to have dropped off the planet.".

After this latest viewing I'm pretty convinced that's not the case and that this movie is exactly as bad as I've always suspected.The main draw of the film seems to be the gimmick that ties the whole thing together but labeling this the absolute dumbest and least plausible twist ending in the history of horror seems like a woefully ineffectual understatement. I'm all for throwing something unexpected at the audience but it has to work to be effective. The ending of April Fool's Day is not only faulty it's pretty much insulting. Don't be surprised if you're actually angry when you see how this whole thing plays out and good luck trying to make sense of the second gotcha ending that is tacked on after that.Stripped of the ludicrous twist what we have here is a wellbelowaverage dead teenager flick with a cast dominated by thoroughly unlikable characters. Since there's not even any scares of suspense to speak of you can easily spot the killer on the DVD case and during the movie they pretty much wear a sign on their head that says Yep it's me the film becomes a tedious mess that leaves you hanging on only to see how the scenario is wrapped up. Unfortunately as I've already stated the ending does nothing to justify this film's very existence.Surely devotees to this genre have gotten used to accepting nonsense but in addition to the ending several plot elements here are so muddled and pointless that dozens of scenes seem to be in place only to pad the run time I dare you to figure out how two of the disposable chuckleheads in our bunch pull off the knife to the stomach gag on the dock at the beginning of the film. In addition though the movie starts out on April 1st the majority of the action here unfolds the day after which leaves our characters more accurately celebrating April Fool's Weekend. Thus the big reveal comes about a day late by my estimation.The filmmakers certainly had some money to work with so the production values are higher than we're used to in slasher offerings. Likewise they cast some decent actors in a few parts so the dramatic end of things is handled adeptly. The only thing they didn't spend money on is a script that makes any sense.Of course one of the big selling points in this genre is the splatter element. But in April Fool's Day the series of rote and largely bloodless murders rather negates that aspect. The red sauce is so notably absent in fact that a misguided sex scene played purely for laughs seems to have been added for the sole purpose of garnering this film an R rating. Nothing else in this movie even skirts the boundaries of a PG13. I'm not saying you need a huge body count or scores of spurting jugulars to make a decent horror film but you need SOMETHING. This film certainly won't appeal to anyone who likes wellcrafted stories or ablyexecuted scares so the fact that the filmmakers also made this film utterly unappealing for fans of the bloodier side of things is a perplexing approach that further makes me question exactly why this film ever got made and released.The only real piece of interest to be found here is the appearance of both Summer School's Ken Olandt and Amy Steel who played our plucky heroine in Friday The 13th Part 2. Fans of 80's Bmovies will likely enjoy seeing both of these faces pop up here and they do a fine job of carrying the weaker actors in the ensemble. It's just a shame they wandered into such a wretched movie.I mean no disrespect to the scores of people who have fondness in their hearts for April Fool's Day as I have plenty of cruddy films I hold in high esteem. But this is my review and as far as I'm concerned calling this movie crap is insulting to feces.".

There's something to be said when you create any type of movie that actually is an original piece especially with everything being out there it's very hard to come up with something fresh and clever all at the same time. With this jewel of a horror classic I believe that was the case where everything came together perfectly. I thought the characters were well thought out and interesting. The balance of the film was superb where the first half it was all fun and games and very funny then the second half it got serious to where the hammer falls on you and sucks you back in saying don't forget this is a horror movie which I thought was brilliant. This wasn't an allstar cast some of the biggest names were Amy Steel who was in Friday The 13th part 2 who by the way was amazing as well as in this film then you had Thomas F. Wilson that played Biff in Back To the Future who also was great in both of these films. Deborah Foreman who played the lead character in this film also played the lead role in Valley Girl opposite A young Nic Cage who was great in this role as well. Clayton Rohner and Deborah Goodrich played in Just One Of The Guys together who both did their parts very well. Ken Olandt which didn't make a big splash yet as far as big time roles he was just starting out in his career and Griffin O' Neal same scenario in that he hadn't done a whole lot yet in his career when this came out. I have to tell you that there were some great performances by everybody in this film ones that were funny lines like Clayton Rohner as Chaz was telling Jay Baker's character Harvey who was excellent in this film as well confronting him about an earlier incident that happened in the film Chaz says to Harvey You were jumping around like your ass was on fire. That was a very funny line in the film as well as several others. There is this one scene in the film where all the friends are sitting at the table discussing what they were going to do with their lives after graduation I thought that Griffin O' Neal's character Skip should have been at the dinner table with them it would have made the scene that much better. I think that Griffin O' Neal did really well with his character and should have continue to act because personally I think he's a good actor. The last twenty minutes of the film will leave you on the edge of your seat just typing this out and thinking about it gives me goosebumps it was played out so brilliantly. You can laugh a little but it was very creepy and scary and well thought out. I think this holds well with the slasher genre it's just a fun smart suspenseful and scary movie period. At the end of the movie there is this wacky song on the soundtrack that's very out there. Some of the material could use some strengthening but overall pretty solid. One of the better horror movies in general. This could be very well in the top twenty in great horror movies of all time.".

At the time I was beginning to discover the horror genre and I preferred my horrormovies filled with monsters or at least a supernatural badass that wouldn't die running around slashing people up. I wasn't even a particular fan of the whole slashergenre so if you've seen it you can understand why I was not happy with this flick.Now many years later I've almost seen 'em all in the slashergenre the good the bad and the really bad so I thought What the hell let's see APRIL FOOL'S DAY again. And what do you know? I liked it way better than back in the days. Now why's that?First of all this movie knows what it's doing. Here we have a bunch of teenagers being invited by Muffy St. John to spend the weekend in a landhouse situated on an isolated island. As soon as they are installed the movie follows all the rules of the slashergenre by having a mysterious killer which we never see killing the teenagers off one by one If you even think about having sex you die. If you consume too much alcohol you die.... Most of the time we don't see anything of the killings and the bodies just disappear with the sole purpose of being able to pop up later after the cast is dramatically cut down with two survivors running around trying to hide from the killer which they discover by conveniently placed clues is a close friend of them. So the movie plays it by the book just so it could be able to present you that twist in the end.Though there are bound to be a few practical jokes in the movie the atmosphere is more suspenseful than you'd expect with a subtle but moody soundtrack. And the actor's aren't all that bad giving a more decent performance than you'd expect from a movie in this genre. All this keeps you interested and in the end it's not you but the movie that gets what it wants. And that is taking a pi at you while laughing in your face.So this movie is especially intended for those who've seen just enough slashermovies so they think they know what's gonna happen next. Those of you who seek blood  gore need not watch this film 'cause there is none. The only thing we do get to see is a bit of rubbery makeup effects some bodyparts and a few decapitated heads. They are nicely presented to us providing some scares but they do look fake. Fake I said...? Now how could that be...?".

Just look at the DVDart.April Fool's Day is of course another 80's Slasher but with something different which of course I mean the ending which everyone will already probably know by now when I first saw it I thought what a cheat I was really disappointed but now I think differently the ending is something different and quite original even by todays standards and was copied in the awful 2005 horror flick Cry Wolf.The gore factor is also a letdown as all deaths are offscreen but this movie was still entertaining. While this movie didn't contain much gore it had some unforgettable moments of suspense and it was obviously a F13th ripoff but a pretty decent one at that and characters. Even though they're all stereotypical I think that they were surprisingly sympathetic and it really did feel as if they were all friends which is an unusual thing to find in slasher flicks. It was a theatrical movie it had good production values as well. My fave character has to be well I can't remember her name in this movie but Amy Steel a brilliant addition to the cast a great heroine I loved her in Friday The 13th part 2 and I also love her in this it's such a shame that she never became a big star but she will always be remembered as a terrific actress in my heart she was always my fave lead heroine of all of the Jason movies and yet again she plays the female lead in this which I was very happy with and again she was great.And finally the big reveal the ending which I thought was a major letdown but at least they did something fun with it that no one expected.All in all April Fool's Day is a mediocre but entertaining slasher flick starring the ever likable and wonderful Amy Steel.".

Of course this being an 80's slasher flick that wasn't the only thing nostalgic about the picture. April Fool's Day was quite a pleasant surprise as I expected it to be more on the cheesy side and less on the thrills don't get me wrong this movie definitely had some cheese but it was also pretty well written and directed and there was a fair amount of tension. The whole setting was very 'Agatha Christie' a name that's slyly dropped early on in the film and reminded me of Bava's Four Dolls for an August Moon a giallo film based on Christie Novel Ten Little Indians a.k.a. And Then There Were None so that added even more of a nostalgic vibe to the film. Although this film was very nicely carried out the plot was very transparent and every twist was telegraphed a mile ahead... other than the ending which was just silly. For me this really wasn't a problem as I wasn't looking for a dense mystery. In fact this probably only added to the to the expectations and sense of familiarity that one generally wants when turning on an 80's slash nstalk.Just as a little side not so you can get an extra feel for the film here's one of my favourite quotes.Harvey I know you think I'm a hick but I'd like to change your mind about that if you give me a chance.Hal Why?Harvey Because I would really like to plow your field.".

For me this really wasn't a problem as I wasn't looking for a dense mystery. In fact this probably only added to the to the expectations and sense of familiarity that one generally wants when turning on an 80's slash nstalk.Just as a little side not so you can get an extra feel for the film here's one of my favourite quotes.Harvey I know you think I'm a hick but I'd like to change your mind about that if you give me a chance.Hal Why?Harvey Because I would really like to plow your field.";

Once there  surprise surprise  they start getting picked off one by one.Now unlike other slasher films at the time the killer is never seen until the 'big reveal' at the end obviously making it like an early 'Scream' film and part 'whodoneit' as well as simple teenchopping fun.If you're into your early slasher films then this one is worth a watch. There aren't any stars to speak of are there ever? unless you count an appearance from 'Biff' from the 'Back to the Future' films. Plus the death scenes aren't that well done a bit of decent gore makeup here and there but the obvious lack of budget does show sometimes. However just because it isn't that gory or well acted! doesn't mean it's not fun.It kind of knows what it is and what it's not  i.e. Highbrow and plays to its strengths. Without going into anything that may spoil it it's actually quite clever here and there with a few things that you might not see coming.Naturally it has all the flaws of the genre such as the nice girl surviving longest and anyone who has sx dies first but if you're generally a fan of slasher films you've long since learned to forgive such traits and should be able to enjoy it for what it is  good reasonably gory silly fun.".

The film contains relatively little graphic gore no actual nudity and some pretty good actors thereby going against the cookiecutter recipe and instead concentrating on the development of likable characters eerie atmosphere and some genuinely effective spookshow scares. The plot is quite simple. A group of eight college friends each more annoying than the next gather together at an island mansion belonging to heiress Muffy St. John to celebrate their final year of school. They soon discover that each has a hidden secret from their past which is revealed and soon after they turn up dead. Yet are they really dead? Or is it just part of some very real and cruel April Fool's jokes? The hostess Muffy is the only one who apparently knows what's going on. But then again is it really her doing the killing? Fun from beginning to end.Director Fred Walton uses a funny yet haunting script to create a slasher film with a twist. Nothing too special for it stills holds very true with the genre April Fool's Day will greatly satisfy fans of a film that combines humor and violence while others purely dedicated to the sliceanddice theme might be turned off. There is no argument that April Fool's Day was riding in on the wave of 80's slasher films but that is where the similarity to other genre movies ends. You really have to think at this one. They really want to you ask yourself is this all a joke? and could anyone have actually survived that? I have to give some credit to the music for setting up some great tension. It adds to the feel without taking you out of the moment.Overall rating 7 out of 10.".

Unfortunatelysomeone is taking April Fool's Day too seriously and is trying to kill Muffy and her friends one by one and now Muffy and her friends are trying to find out who the killer is and survive April Fool's Day.Released in 1986April Fool's Day is an entertaining and underrated HorrorComedy Slasher film that while was a modest success at the Box Office divided Horror fans and Slasher fans when it came out as some Horror fans were expecting a typical holiday Slasher film and they got something different from the norm. Thankfullyover the years April Fool's Day has found an audience and Cult status among Horror fans and is consider one of the better Slasher films of the 1980s. April Fool's Day is a terrific HorrorComedy in the highest order a movie that balances out great laughs and nonstop terror for 89 minutes. April Fool's Day has the typical Slasher movie set upa bunch of young kids who go to a house in the woodsor in this case an islandand killings and creepy things start to happen but in April Fool's Day the setup as well as the execution is done in an offbeat and tongue in cheek manner that fresh and weird. The Comedy and Humor in April Fool's Day is great because it's driven by the main characters and the way they act or the situations and interactions that they all have with each other which is at times quirky and over the top. The humor in AFD can almost be seen as a precursor to Scream1996and the Slasher films that came in the 1990s because the dialog and story was much more clever then most of the Slasher movies that came out at the time although AFD isn't always self aware. As a Horror movie AFD isn't really scary but it can be suspenseful and atmospheric because there are certain scenes that will have viewers on the edge of their seats and because AFD is more in the style of an Agatha Christie Mystery like Murder On the Orient Express or Ten Little Indians where the movie keeps you guessing and asking questions about who's doing the killing and when will it end. What's also great about AFD is that the kills and murders happen off screen and makes them more effective and intense and the less you see in the movie the more intense the film becomes. The Blood and gore in AFD is outstanding and well done but is very light in comparison to other Horror and Slashers movies of the time which I think gives the movie a light edge and makes AFD less serious. The main characters in AFD are wonderful and interesting because where in most Slasher movie where we are waiting for the characters to be killed we as the viewer like the characters in AFD and root for them to live because they are funny and are not always arrogant. I also think that April Fool's Day has one of the best casts I have seen in an 80s Horror movie or in an 80s movie in general because the film features Deborah ForemanValley GirlAmy SteelFriday The 13th Part 2Thomas F. WilsonBiff from Back To The Future TrilogyClayton Rohner and Deborah Goodwichboth from Just One Of The Guysand Ken OlandtSummer School. All of those actors were in wellknown movies from the 1980s and this was a great young cast that stands alongside the cast of the Brat Pack movies. The ending of April Fool's Day is amazing and one of the best endings and twists of I have seen in a Horror film but if you're a Horror you are either going to love or hate the ending I happen to fall into the former category because the ending is very funnydaring and truly unexpected and I think the ending adds to the greatness and quality of April Fool's Day. A terrific ending.The cast is great. Deborah Foreman is excellent as Muffythe hostess of the house. Amy Steel is terrific as Kitthe tough heroine of the film. Clayton Rohner is great and funny as Chazthe guy with the camera. Thomas F. Wilson is wonderful and hilarious as Archa big talker. Deborah Goodrich is fantastic and sexy as NikkiChaz's crush. Ken Olandt is good as RobKit's boyfriend. Jay Baker is funny as Harveya student with a preppy student. Griffin O'NealSkipson of Ryan O'Nealand Leah King PinsentNangive good performances as well.The direction by Fred Walton is greatwith Walton sometimes moving the camera using nice angles and shots with outstanding composition. Wonderful directionWalton.The score by Charles Bernstein is hauntingeerie and effective and fits in well with the suspenseful scenes. Powerful scoreBernstein. There is also a great song by Jerry WhitmanToo Bad You're Crazythat is funny and quirky and the classic song Mama Told MeNot To Comeby Three Dog Night. The Makeup effects by Reel EFX group is wonderfulbloody and realistic and work for the film. Great Makeup effectsReel EFX.In final wordif you love Horror Films or 80s Slasher filmsI highly suggest you see April Fool's Daya wonderfulunderrated and funny HorrorComedy Slasher movie from the 1980's that you can watch again and again is a great time.

	schema:reviewBody "I was fortunate to see this film on the big screen and I was very impressed with the cinematography. There isn't much character development but the simmering hatred between Scorpion and a rival inmate creates significant tension. Those who enjoy Eastwood's man with no name films other unusual Japanese films from the same time period Black Tight Killers Ecstasy of the Angels etc. will find this interesting... my only caveats have to do with the rape scenes which for some reason often find their way into offbeat Japanese films. Some of the scenes aren't entirely fulfilling... at times I wished for more unbelievably violence so the characters are more fully able to avenge themselves. Some of the editing is a little awkward but there are a few scenes that have breathtaking cinematography... particularly in the hut toward the end of the film where the camera focuses on Scorpion as the contents of the hut rotate around her... and the amazing transition dream scene on the bus. Great stuff... I thoroughly enjoyed it. Will be buying on DVD....I wrote that review in 2001 but thought I'd add a comment four years later. This film has worked it's way into my subconscious and has become one of my alltime favorites. Not only do I own the U.S. DVD but the Japanese Region 2 as well the print quality is much higher... no English subtitles though. I have since seen all four of the Sasori films and this film Joshuu sasori Dai41 zakkyob the second in the series is the best one.".

There isn't much character development but the simmering hatred between Scorpion and a rival inmate creates significant tension. Those who enjoy Eastwood's man with no name films other unusual Japanese films from the same time period Black Tight Killers Ecstasy of the Angels etc. will find this interesting... my only caveats have to do with the rape scenes which for some reason often find their way into offbeat Japanese films. Some of the scenes aren't entirely fulfilling... at times I wished for more unbelievably violence so the characters are more fully able to avenge themselves. Some of the editing is a little awkward but there are a few scenes that have breathtaking cinematography... particularly in the hut toward the end of the film where the camera focuses on Scorpion as the contents of the hut rotate around her... and the amazing transition dream scene on the bus. Great stuff... I thoroughly enjoyed it. Will be buying on DVD....I wrote that review in 2001 but thought I'd add a comment four years later. This film has worked it's way into my subconscious and has become one of my alltime favorites. Not only do I own the U.S. DVD but the Japanese Region 2 as well the print quality is much higher... no English subtitles though. I have since seen all four of the Sasori films and this film Joshuu sasori Dai41 zakkyob the second in the series is the best one.";

It's a wonderfully psychotic vision I often sat there thinking Where the heck is the camera? How did they get that angle?.  The opening shots of Matsu and the warden in her cell were simply incredible. Throughout the film there are surreal interruptions of the narrative in a Theatrical style where the location turns into an obvious backdrop and the lighting becomes more intrusive. These scenes usually highlight what's happening behind the eyes of the silent Matsu. I won't give it away but near the end of the movie there is a transition between shots that is so incredible and unexpected that the audience broke out into applause just for a TRANSITION!  If you are a fan of surreal film or 60's70's psychocinema you owe it to yourself to seek out this film.  It is available on DVD now as well.".

I have yet to see one of these type film that I didn't like and at this point I've seen a pretty good amount. There's something about this era in Japanese exploitation cinema and exploitation cinema from other areas as well... that is so refreshing. Along with having fun sleazy violent sexy story lines and characters  there is still a real emphasis on QUALITY cinematography and storytelling that is lacking from a lot of modern shotonvideo microbudget underground and exploitation films. This added dimension gives these 70's films a quality of respectability and seriousness despite usually containing some pretty offthewall subject matter...FEMALE CONVICT continues the tale of Matsu aka Scorpion by the other prisoners and guards a hardass unbreakable inmate who's short on words and long on action and has a penchant for violence and creative jailbreak. In this installment Scorpion has been in the hole for a year since we last saw her in the FEMALE PRISONER film. A prison Official is coming to check up on the prison Warden the guy that Scorpion stabbed in the eye in the last film  so they decide to dust Scorpion off as the prison Official wants to do a meetandgreet with the convicts. This doesn't turn out to be such a great idea because even in her weakened state Scorpion is still a formidable foe and attacks the warden. This leads to a riot and of course Scorpion is blamed for the disturbance. As punishment Scorpion is subjected to a public gangraping from some of the other prison guards. Afterward during a prison transfer Scorpion and six other prisoners cause a disturbance that inadvertently allows them to escape. Taking refuge in a small abandoned village the group tries to remain one step ahead of the warden and his henchmen. Here we get a little background on the other prisoners  including a particularly nutty broad who is in prison for drowning one of her children and performing a harakiriabortion on her other unborn child. Scorpion and this chick don't get along so well and the tension between the two is palpable. Continuing their trek the group have a runin with a group of traveling businessmen on a bus  and problems arise when one of the girls is raped and accidentally killed. The girls hijack the bus and the occupants and continue on their run from the law. At a roadblock CrazyHarakiriLady throws Scorpion off the bus as a diversion but ends up being cornered by the cops anyway. Scorpion tells the cops that the hostages on the bus were all killed which isn't true... which prompts a shootout between the cops and the hijackers. Scorpion is carted BACK to jail  but a bungled attempt to kill her in transit to the jailhouse offers her ANOTHER chance for escape. Free again Scorpion exacts revenge on the sinister prison warden in much the same fashion as the end scene of the first film...There's all kinds of stuff going on in FEMALE CONVICT. The storyline is solid the acting is good cinematography is excellent  everything that I love about this genre of films is present. This entry is a little more stylized that the previous with a few trippy dream sequences thrown in. This doesn't impact the film negatively  in fact they're kinda cool  it just gives FEMALE CONVICT a little less straightforward feel then FEMALE PRISONER. Overall  another winner for fans of such films as SEX AND FURY FEMALE YAKUZA TALE LADY SNOWBLOOD of course FEMALE PRISONER 701 SCORPION or pretty much any 70's era Japanese pinkyexploitstyle films. 8.510".

First let me say that I saw it in a film class that concentrates on the visual styles of several films.  In this same class I have seen Touch of Evil and several other classics.  I was amazed to see that this film only had 6 votes7 including mine so I had to add my own comment.This film is masterfully shot in a classic Japanese style that emphazises color and full use of the widescreen presentation.  The film also has a bit of a campiness to it that adds a flavor that is unusual for a foreign film.  Most foreign films that are thought of as being campy usually are just not well done.  This is not the case with Female Convict Scorpion Jailhouse 41.  The campiness that I refer to is the same campiness that has made the Evil Dead series such a success.  Exaggeration of many shots and the characters themselves.The story itself is very unique following a group of escape female convicts lead by an awesome character named Scorpion.  The filmmakers gave her a near godlike respect when shooting her and she is very well developed even though she doesn't speak.  She doesn't speak because she knows that actions speak louder than words.Anyway I highly recommend this film for anyone who is a fan of foreign films and I also recommend it to those who like stories based on comic books.  I believe that this film is based on a series of Japanese comics it is put together like a comic book so it is obvious that many shots and the story are out of this world as movies such as The Matrix have proved to the mainstream audience.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw the fantastic Female Prisoner 701 Scorpion recently and was thoroughly impressed by it. Jailhouse 41 is the first sequel to said masterpiece and sees the successful reunion of director Shunya Ito and star Meiko Kaji. I'm guessing that the first film was a big success in its native Japan and rightly so as the pair obviously wasted no time in making this sequel seeing as it was released the very same year! The two films have obvious similarities and follow something like the same plot formula but the two couldn't be much different in terms of style as while the first film was your 'by the book' women in prison flick this one takes a more risky approach! The film starts as the last one left off with a scene that sees our heroine Matsu a.k.a. Scorpion being tortured by the merciless prison guards  lead by the one eyed guard that Matsu had a hand in disfiguring in the first film. She's brought out of the dungeon to attend the visit of a high ranking official but after a riot breaks out Matsu takes her chance to escape along with six other prisoners...As was the case with the first film this one excellently straddles the line between trash and art. The story and the action is largely very sleazy but it's shot in such an artful way that you'd be forgiven for thinking otherwise. The sleaze comes mostly by way of character actions and violence rather than nudity  of which there is very little. The film is not as bloody as the first film either though the focus here seems to be more on surreal hallucinations and the film features plenty! I'm undecided as to how much I liked this element of the film although the hallucination sequences are largely very memorable and serve in giving the film its own unique style. Meiko Kaji excellently steps back into her role and this time she is required to look daggers more often and speak less often as she has very few words in the film. She fits the role like a glove however and is easily one of the main standouts of the film. The revenge theme goes on throughout once again and climaxes well although familiarly at the end. Overall I can't say that I liked this film as much as the original but it's certainly a good follow up and comes recommended to anyone who enjoyed the first in the series.".

	schema:reviewBody "The first film in this acclaimed Japanese exploitation cycle entitled Female Prisoner 701 Scorpion literally perplexed me because it was such an atypical W.I.P accomplishment. It had a great story a likable heroine character stylish photography and  shockingly enough  only a minimal amount of nudity and perversion. The second entry in the series entitled Female Convict Scorpion Jailhouse 41 actually astonished me even more! This time because it's such an atypical sequel. The formula of the original film clearly worked so you would expect and even respect director Shunya Ito and his crew to embroider on the same successful elements but they don't. In fact the concept is completely different and easily the most innovative one ever used in a W.I.P film. Most of the action takes place outside the prisons' walls during an escape that gradually changes into a wild and surreal 7headed girlpower road trip across the desolate Japanese countryside. Seen from a certain viewpoint the script's drastic change of direction is actually rather logic since the protagonist's engaging background story properly ended in part one. Scorpion successfully extracted her vengeance and returned to prison to serve a deserved sentence this time. But still the completely alternative setup is courageously ambitious and not just the story lines vastly changed but nearly everything else as well including atmosphere imagery editing the depiction of violence and even the Matsu's entire persona! She now fully embodies bitterness and ferocity which is masterfully illustrated through Ito's visionary direction. Matsu barely speaks five complete sentences during the whole film yet her stares penetrate through the thickest skulls and she catches each suspicious sound in massive stereo. Since her virulent escapades which even cost the headmaster's eye Matsu spent the last year in a moist pit underneath the prison. She's allowed one day of daylight when a government inspector comes to visit and this is already enough for her to cause a major hoedown. Severe punishment ensues but Matsu and six others manage to escape. Their journey turns into a crusade of retaliation against all male foes. The convicts' road trip if you can refer to it like that is truly surreal and artsy and often nightmarishly macabre! They encounter a witch who eerily narrates the women's stories rapists on tour numerous abstract and depressing tableaux and  last but not least  collective hatred. Especially the vicious Oba battles Matsu for the honor of most respected jailbird. There's a lot of dreamy and addictive weirdness going on during the escape but nonetheless the actual prison and revenge footage remains the best and most exciting. Both the opening and climax are tremendously brilliant and even though everything in between is quite uniquely experimental and accomplished it occasionally gets in the way of the good old exploitation themes. Meiko Kaji's performance is once again marvelous and she receives excellent support from Kayoko Shiraishi who's overacting actually works as Oba and Fumio Watanabe as the sadist head warden. Great stuff!".

Matsu Meiko Kaji is the Scorpion of the title and is the near silent heroine of the movie. In classic Japanese exploitation fashion she is subjected to all sorts of cruelty and punishment at the hands of a sadistic prison warden and his equally sinister underlings.  Matsu as we learn in narration was wrongly imprisoned and must fight to survive and escape imprisonment. During the course of the movie She joins a gang of other female convicts and escapes from prison.  The gang creates all sorts of violent mayhem with Matsu silently watching on.  Very bloody grim and violent Jailhouse 41 is atypical of the violent sexploitation movies Toei released during the '70s. Directory Shunya Ito presents the movie in a surreal narrative that is both haunting and inventive.  Kaji is captivating as the heroine although her character allows little for her to develop.  For those who are fans of girlsinprison movies this may be your cup of tea.  On the other hand for those who are wanting more story and character development you might be better served to avoid this.".

Jailhouse 41 is the second film in the Scorpion series way more surreal than the first one also directed by Shunya Ito.This film has far less nudity and seemingly lower production values than the first one but it's a bit more violent in comparison. The story takes place mostly outside the prison but it isn't anything special. Matsu escapes with six more convicts and is trailed by the vengeful warden whose eye she has stabbed in the first film. The dialogues could've been better and I really don't understand why the other inmates hate her in this film. The surreal sequences are hitor miss. Some of them like the waterfalls in a national park ? turning red after a corpse is thrown into the water are pretty memorable while others like the part where they come across an old woman who sings their backstories in the He Had It Comin' from the movie Chicago fashion before dying making Autumn come prematurely and getting buried with leaves are just baffling.Some of the supporting characters include the two guards from the first film the slightly Mexican one and the slightly nerdy one who serve as secondtofinal bosses. There's also a busful of rapey tourists some of them being WWII veterans who brag about having raped women in Manchuria which makes this one of the rare films to mention Japanese war crimes in Manchuria. The final scene has one of the coolest screen transitions I've seen Matsu simply slices the screen in half and moves to a different location.The story to this film is a lot weaker than the one in the first film and there is some awkward editing but it's still entertaining and worth a watch.".

There are apparently a few dream sequences that suddenly appear early in the movie without any obvious connection to the story. Sometimes the scenery changes from rocks and dirt to leafy greenery to red leaves in the course of about 30 seconds.There's not a shred of explanation given why the warden hates the main character enough to abuse her so much. Nothing about why the other prisoners hang out with her but seem to hate her too. Kaji's character says her first line at about 80 minutes into the movie and her last line at 81 minutes. Not counting the soundtrack which she sings most of.I didn't expect much from a cheap womeninprison exploitation flick but this film would barely be a passable effort by a highschool film class.".

Female Convict Scorpion Jailhouse 41 which comes very close to the brilliance of the first part. Sasori Jailhouse 41 as it is called where i live is easily the most surreal of all Sasori films. As the first part this is THE perfect proof that it is possible to make Exploitation and Arthouse cinema at the same time. Brutal and beautiful sleazy and visually stunning full of violence as well as full of symbolism Jailhouse 41 is another true gem of ExploitationArt.After disrupting a prison ceremony which was to impress a government official Female prisoner 701 Nami Matsushima aka. Sasori Meiko Kaji is tortured and abused even heavier than usual on behalf of the sadistic Inspector Goda Fumio Watanbe. Sasori endures the torture with her usual stamina and takes the first chance to escape with six other female prisoners...As the first film Jailhouse 41 is again very violent. This film however is by far the most surreal of the entire series. Brutal tortures murders and rapes are featured as well as visually stunning artistic elements symbolism and dreamlike sequences. The stunningly beautiful Meiko Kaji is once again brilliant in her role of Sasori I simply lack the words to express my admiration for this wonderful actress. Fumio Watanbe is also excellent and wonderfully sadistic as Inspector Goda. The rest of the performances are also great especially the women who play the six other escapees are very good in their roles. As the first part and the sequels to follow the main theme song is the iconic UramiBushi which Kaji who is not only a brilliant actress but also a wonderful singer sings herself.Personally I still prefer the first Sasori film and the third part Joshuu sasori Kemonobeya aka. Female Prisoner Scorpion Beast Stable 1973 which is arguably the best of them all. However Jailhouse 41 is doubtlessly a masterpiece too and there probably little point in arguing which of these fantastic films is No. 1. The entire Sasori series is an absolutely outstanding highlight of exploitation cinema and Jailhouse 41 is ingenious in every aspect. This is a mustsee for my fellow fans of Exploitation cinema and Arthouse cinema alike and a cinematic highlight that is highly recommendable to all lovers of cultcinema!".

Although the unaware should know there isn't much nudity and it's largely male nudity. The seven gals on the run are an interesting bunch and in one musical sequence we learn the nature of their crimes and see that they're not all THAT bad most of them and garner more sympathy than their lawmen nemeses. Their tale is somewhat episodic as among other things they encounter a sickly old woman come across an abandoned settlement take a bus full of hostages and attempt to punish some horny tourists  rapists.This is a very stylish film and people will marvel at the sharp dutch angles used by the filmmakers and the various oppressive visuals. The finale in particular taking place on a garbage heap deserves credit for being rather unusual. Director Shun'ya Ito proves to be a master of atmosphere right from the beginning as we see what it is like for Matsu as she does her time in solitary. The music by Shunsuke Kikuchi is also noteworthy as it is accompanied by plaintive singing.The acting is right on the money with gorgeous Kaji making for a compelling central figure stoic and already hardened by experience. She does receive some heavy competition from some of her costars though.Certain to appeal to cult film fans for its balancing act of arty and trashy elements.Eight out of 10.".

The film boasts incredibly stylish direction with some really outlandish scenes  the psychedelic bit where they meet the weird old woman being a personal favourite moment.

	schema:reviewBody "Jailhouse 41 is the second film in the Scorpion series directed by Shunya Ito and of course starring Meiko Kaji along with plenty of other actors and actrices from the first film. Even though it shows some significant similarities with 701 it still manages to keep you excited throughout this epic escape where murder and humiliation are well spent.We start off in a familiar location. Meiko Matsu has been locked away in the bowels of prison for her countless attempts to escape and of course her disfiguring attack on the warden. But her chance to escape again is lurking when a dignitary comes to visit. She immediately takes advantage of the situation and attacks the warden. Leading to even more punishment and humiliation but also giving her the opportunity to escape with six other female prisoners.Prisoner 701 was pretty much located in and around the jail but this time Shunya Ito decides to take it one step further and have them explore the almost surreal landscape of Japan. Enountering many difficult circumstances with their own personal issues while being chased by the guards... it seems like the same recipe as the first one. But don't worry it has some joy full differences below the surface. It almost feels like there is no limit. Crazy stories are followed up by heavy raping and male humiliation. Badass action seems to go hand in hand with a supreme sense of style and the music has the same impact as the first time. Matsu remains an amazing character. She's still standing strong even in the most difficult situations. There's a certain appeal to her attitude which I can't help but love. Again it's one of the finer features.I mentioned the word ''surreal'' earlier on. It's not entirely new but it's closer to perfection this time. Shunya Ito is showing a more overthetop sense of humor and isn't holding back on the dreamy sequences which you'll encounter more than once. It has a strange effect but it never feels out of place. It takes the visuals to a whole new level with crazy colored lighting andor moving set pieces it's the sudden switch that makes it work.Taking you from one gorgeous place to another Jailhouse 41 is an exciting thrill ride just like the first one. It's beautifully shot and it still manages to keep some surprises up his sleeve even after a brilliant first film like 701. It might score a little below the first one but I'd say it has plenty in store to be liked just as much or maybe even more by some of you.".

He has his subordinates blast her with a water cannon maybe this inspired a similar scene in Don Siegel's Escape from Alcatraz? and asks almost plaintively why she doesn't just go crazy already.  Ya mean um she wasn't?  It's pretty clear the warden is the Bad Guy and the female convict is the Victim. We never do learn why she poked his eye out earlier or why she's in prison in the first place or why any of the female inmates are.  Presumably they were all done dirt by evil male people.Once the plot gets underway the movie immediately becomes less interesting. A bunch of female inmates manage to escape it helps that all the male guards are morons as well as evil and commandeer a bus armed with as I recall one knife a pair of chopsticks and a really mean looking origami creature okay I made that up.  The passengers on the bus are mostly male Japanese war vets who before getting taken hostage are seen bragging about the women they raped in the war thus establishing their credentials as sexual predators on top of the standard male traits of being evil and stupid.  Oh and cowardly of course guess that goes without saying. In one scene a female escapee unwisely leaves the group and encounters some men who without missing a beat immediately rape and kill her.  The sequence has almost a perfunctory air to it as though merely reminding us of the obvious.In a way all postwar Japanese cinema has the same theme the emasculation of an ancient and formerly proud culture.  Like the Sand Kings in a scifi story I read years ago they're excellent adapters.  Assign them a task and they go nuts with it.  After the war their task at least as they perceived it was to obliterate the essence of maleness by lampooning and exaggerating it to death.  Even in the straightup Japanese bondageSM flicks there's a hint of ridiculousness in whatever the men are doing. The women on the other hand remain sublimely serene and dignified even if they're getting suspended upside down or whatever.   Each gender seems to know what role to play as in their traditional NohKabuki theater.  I like Noh theater.  What do you have against theater Mike?.....Anyway there's a climax of sorts with the Scorpion chick and the warden which I won't give away although I'm not sure it makes any difference. The director immediately follows that up with a closing shot of all the female convicts running along in their striped uniforms that look like those of soccer players as though slyly acknowledging that the whole point of the enterprise was watching a bunch of cute chicks. Not much about the movie lingers in the mind except some mediumclose shots of the heroine staring balefully at the camera her face barely moves and she only has a few lines of dialogue.  Too bad she never found her way to America so far as I know where she could have been in some REAL buttkickin' exploitation stuff. Imagine if she'd substituted for the terminally insipid Ali MacGraw in Sam Peckinpah's classic The Getaway which was being filmed about when Scorpion was.  That would've been a blast.There seems to be a Japanese word for everything and one I especially like is KOROSHI death by overwork.  So gentlemen along the way to this inevitable end of ours feel free to partake in some cheap thrills as in Scorpion artfully filmed cheap thrills at that.  But stick with American beer the Japanese stuff is bizarre and not hugely potable....".

She is then transported to another prison with several other prisoners whilst on route they escape thus the story begins.The film focus even more on the arthouse area of the film with underlying themes of feminism human rights and is quite psychedelic in parts which can be expected from an early 70s film. The nudity is toned down a lot but there is still enough violence and action to keep people entertained throughout and quite a few twists. Sasori speaks even less than in the previous film uttering only a few lines throughout the film. Its highly enjoyable and well written and beautifully shot i particularly liked the waterfall of blood which was done with practical effects and looks great it is quite similar to Suspiria in terms of lighting but I actually enjoy this more. so check it out if you haven't already.".
