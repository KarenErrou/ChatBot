After his master dies suddenly the squire hits the road with his cohorts Roland and Wat. On the journey they stumble across an unknown writer Chaucer. William lacking a proper pedigree convinces Chaucer to forge genealogy documents that will pass him off as a knight. With his newlyminted history in hand the young man sets out to prove himself a worthy knight at the country's jousting competition and finds romance along the way.";

Heath Ledger is an Aussie what happened to the black hair he had in 10 Things I Hate About You! I didn't recognize him! and Alan Tudyk is a Texan so their accents should have tanked! But they didn't just a few slippages a la Mel Gibson in Braveheart or Jonny Lee Miller in Hackers...This film is funny fastpaced certainly didn't feel over 2h... well constructed hilariously tongueincheek From the We Will Rock You opening scene to the Nike swooshes on the armor I couldn't stop laughing! It certainly has its problems including some horribly cheezy lines  most on purpose but that doesn't make them any less horrible! and an evil Hollywood ending  including a Bravheartlike scream of defiance in the final joust that made me cringe... but those problems are overcome by sharp wit and consistent amusement. The actors were obviously enjoying themselves and the action was beautifully blended in with the rest of the film. None of the jousting scenes were too long like say the race in Phantom Menace... and all were shot in such a way as to make them really exciting!And I have to laud Paul Bettany who was an incredible and incredibly amusing Geoffrey Chaucer...even though he looks eerily similar IMO to Thom Yorke...Kudos to anyone who recognizes Laura Fraser the blacksmith from Man in the Iron Mask...Overall A great watch. I went in expecting little and came out extremely satisfied. Not the best film of its kind but a head above most. And the blending of contemporary style and music and characterization with the medieval storysetting is really well done. It really shouldn't but it does work! 710.".

And they're singing We Will Rock You.My initial response was God this is going to be bad.But as the movie continued it suddenly dawned on me  I wasn't hating the movie at all!  On an intellectual level I should have been booing and throwing stuff at the screen but there's something about the sheer verve and energy of A Knight's Tale that just drags you in on an emotional level.A clever script with many modern references a good cast of likeable characters and a fantastic soundtrack the reveal of Golden Years is particularly good all add up to make A Knight's Tale one of the most entertaining mainstream movies I've seen in a long time.Normally I hate popcorn movies  not because I consider them low brow or an insult to the intelligence but because they're shallow tired and lack soul.  Yet A Knight's Tale is different.  No it won't change your life and it won't make you ponder your place in the universe.  But it will entertain you.If you're looking for an old fashioned good vs. evil movie with a twist or your copy of The Princess Bride is wearing thin check out A Knight's Tale.810".

Once you get past the glaring anachronisms put in the film on purpose of course you find the movie is actually quite true to its period.The presence of Chaucer in the film combined with some of its details leads me to suspect that Brian Helgeland has read Chaucer's Knight by fellow filmmaker Terry Jones of Monty Python fame. The book deconstructs the knight in Chaucer's The Knight's Tale in a totally unique way  he is seen NOT as the flower of medieval chivalry as most scholars have interpreted him but as a mercenary out for nothing but money and blood. The character in the film Chaucer would have written about then is not Sir William Thatcher Heath Ledger but Count Adhemar of Anjou Rufus Sewell.The part of the film in which this connection clicked for me was the scene where Count Adhemar is called away to his command in a Free Company  a particular stain on the reputation of knighthood which Jones talks extensively about in his book.Jones' book made use of extensive research into medieval history and Helgeland's film obviously does too.Chaucer was a master of satire in his day. Helgeland's use of modern conventions in a period film is a conceit of which  I believe  Chaucer would definitely have approved.I gave A Knight's Tale 9 out of 10  it's not perfect but I like it so much I try to watch it every time it comes on it's been on HBO and Cinemax pretty regularly for the past several months.

After you get past the first one or two scenes everything really grows on you.  The humor is yes cheesy at times the Nike armor but I still laughed.  Chaucer was great the villain was definitely evil and the joustingaction scenes were very well done.

	schema:reviewBody "This wonderfully uplifting little film has a great big heart good humor and a classic message about love and honor and the rarity and preciousness of those who practice both with style. I went to see this with my spouse and a good friend of ours because THEY the spouse and the friend wanted to see it. I am a nonfan of comedies and had been annoyed by the stream of trashy Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court films that had been coming out since the 1980s. My spouse had also informed me that I would be seeing Jousting performed to Bachman Turner Overdrive. My reaction was to reach for the nearest bottle of hard liquor. I didn't need it.I've now seen this film about six times and though I can't say that I see something new in it every time it's just not that complicated I can say that I have enjoyed it each and every time. The characters though relatively uncomplicated are very lovable and the casting is quite excellent all around. Before Brokeback Mountain William Thatcher was Heath Ledger's most memorable role. He's a poor boy from London's Cheapside who wants to change his stars and to become an honored knight. Travelling from tournament to tournament with his fellow indentured servants his liege passes on and William seizes the moment  taking his armor and his horse to become Sir Ulrich Von Liechtenstein of the Gelderland. He is joined by the other nowfree indentures and eventually by Chaucer and a female Farrier played by the wonderful Laura Fraser. Eventually William falls in love with a princess and is challenged by a rival for her affections with a lot more experience money and political clout. The love story which could have easily become a distracting annoyance in fact comes to dominate and drive the story very nicely.Special kudos to Ledger Alan Tudyk Rufus Sewell Paul Bettany and James Purefoy for their awesome performances. And extra special kudos to Director Brian Helgeland for pulling off an impossible task  taking a fairy tale making us want to believe it and yet retaining some wonderful elements of silliness often missing in the fairy tale genre. This would make a wonderful romantic livingroom double feature with The Princess Bride.Recommendation Definitely worth seeing.".

	schema:reviewBody "A story about jousting but this old knight's tale is anything but old because it mixes in satire of today's modern sportsaudience age with some funny bits. Those include the overly dramatic public address announcer boy that's even more so since this film came out rock music blaring out as the contestants do battle etc.The main characters are nicely varied with distinct personalities. Shannon Sossamon however was not quite up to leadinglady status and hasn't had a choice role like this since either. I would have rather seen her assistant in this film or the blacksmith woman be the lead. Anyway even though it's a bit long at 132 minutes it's still entertaining most of the way with some of the funniest bits at the beginning. However it's just as much a romance with Heath Ledger as the male lead than a comedy.What also is good is the sound and visuals in here all highclass. The lance hitting an opponent made an interesting sound each time. The surround sound in here was good too. It's a film most people would like and I recommend seeing it.".

It's one of those films which require certain intelligence to get all the asides and witticisms or numerous viewings to pick up on all of them otherwise its still a funny and enjoyable film. With something for everyone this film is a joy to watch again and again it's also attractive visually  many points to the costumers who mixed historical fashion with a modern edgy almost punk twist. Ditto the soundtrack  mixing in modern music was a clever touch similar to Romeo and Juliet Baz Luhrmann and also an interesting look at fame and the cult of celebrity. A great viewing experience which sometimes even brings a tear to my eye. If you don't enjoy this film there's something wrong with you. Ignore the haters it's not supposed to be historically accurate or highbrow! Sometimes a feelgood comfortable Disneyesque story arc is just what you want.".

I think people are missing the point because they thought it was going to be a film like Braveheart. A Knight's Tale is a story which is set in medieval times and as a JOKE they have mixed in things that weren't around at that time such as the Nike sign and Ulrich being introduced by Chaucer before his matches.The story is predictable but in my view that doesn't really matter in a comedy if it makes you laugh on the way.

This movie is listed as a comedy which it does have its share of but I would personally place it as a fantasy drama. There are those certain movies out there that hit you in such an emotional way as to make you envy the characters lives. Such as when I first watched backdraft and wanted to be a fireman or watching Major League and wanting to be a pitcher. This movie made me want to buy a horse and a stick which I haven't.No matter how many times I watch this the introduction that Geoff gives during the final match still brings tears of joy to my eyes and really sums up the entire movie in my eyes.

Heath Ledger is perfect in the role of William Thatcher a young man hired out to a knight as a squire to change his stars. The story has everything including romance comedy and drama. Rufus Sewell as Count Adhemar is the perfect dissociated royalty who cares little for the common folk. He loves the adoration of the crowd and their subservience and considers them beneath him. Mark Addy Paul Bettany Alan Tudyk and Laura Fraser complete his band of Merry Men and do so with a flair seldom seen in actors who are at the beginning of their careers but perhaps that is the magic Helgeland was able to conjure here. Personally I would have reversed the roles of Jocelyn and Christiana since I think Brnice Bejo is much hotter than Shannyn Sassamon but I grant you that is a matter of taste. James Purefoy as Edward the Black Prince plays the role to the hilt and adds the icing on the cake to this already perfectly baked confection. Toss in perfect photography excellent costuming and a soundtrack that evokes all the action of modern day sports and you have a perfect movie. Rated PG13 for language violence and a brief sexual innuendo I personally don't see a problem with most preteens watching this. Definitely a collectible film both for the fans of Heath and the rest of us who just like a good movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Brian Helgeland finds room for all of the usual clichs of your average sports film in his medieval adventure but yet it still feels fresh entertaining and most of all fun. A combination of the perfect cast with an awesome soundtrack keep Helgeland's film from ever feeling too familiar. The film follows William Thatcher a peasant squire who dreams of one day being able to compete in the jousting tournaments with the knights he's admired all his life. He soon finds an opportunity when he decides to pass himself off as a knight to compete and pursue the woman of his dreams though he risks penalty of death if his truth is discovered.One of the first aspects of the film you'll notice is the unconventional soundtrack 1970's rock and roll. Some people are thrown off by the anachronism but I loved it. The film opens with Queen's We Will Rock You and from that moment I was hooked. The film is loaded with tracks from David Bowie Sly  the Family Stone ACDC and more through the use of classic rock undertones Helgeland makes the film that much easier for the audience to relate with and feel for. I can't understand how some have complained about the use of modern music in the film as I thought it amped up the entertainment level and got the blood pumping.What made this film as enjoyable as it was would have to be the cast. This film's stars couldn't have been any better with Heath Ledger starring as the titular knight William Thatcher. This movie was my first exposure to Ledger and I thought he was perfect in the role equal parts noble courageous and caring. Shannyn Sossamon appears in her first feature film as Jocelyn the woman who has caught William's eye and despite a few instances of poor line delivery could've just been a moment of weak writing she manages to come across as sincere in her love. I loved the supporting characters more than anything in this film particularly that of Geoffrey Chaucer. Based on the real English writerpoet and portrayed by Paul Bettany the character stole every scene he was in with his elaborate crowdpleasing speeches and his constant bickering with Wat hilariously played by Alan Tudyk.There is little to dislike about this movie. My only complaint would be that the film slows for a moment when the crew arrives in London for the world championships and William seeks out his father but it isn't long before the film picks up the pace and rockets along to the conclusion. This movie really is one of the most fun films I've seen and it's broad appeal should interest just about anyone. You can't go wrong with a trip back to the 1370's for a rocking great time.".

Shannyn Sossamon appears in her first feature film as Jocelyn the woman who has caught William's eye and despite a few instances of poor line delivery could've just been a moment of weak writing she manages to come across as sincere in her love. I loved the supporting characters more than anything in this film particularly that of Geoffrey Chaucer. Based on the real English writerpoet and portrayed by Paul Bettany the character stole every scene he was in with his elaborate crowdpleasing speeches and his constant bickering with Wat hilariously played by Alan Tudyk.There is little to dislike about this movie. My only complaint would be that the film slows for a moment when the crew arrives in London for the world championships and William seeks out his father but it isn't long before the film picks up the pace and rockets along to the conclusion. This movie really is one of the most fun films I've seen and it's broad appeal should interest just about anyone. You can't go wrong with a trip back to the 1370's for a rocking great time.";

The actors are all fresh and have just the right spirit to match the film.However some of the plot twists and nuances are poorly edited and the story can jump on you at times. Examples 1 The chopping of the cave scenes loses the link to the creation of Sir Ulrich. This leaves you wondering where they came up with all this. 2 Adamar's spy. You have to be very quick to realise that the lady following Will for about a 1 second shot is the same person who has led Adamar to Will's home. This should have been better telegraphed so we knew of Adamar's animosity and disceptive nature.".

When Will realises what he really is  a knight  you can't help but be drawn in to the adventure. The sets and extras are awesome it was shot mostly in the Czech Republic and Will's archrival has such depth as the villain.I think what really draws us into Will's quest is the way the director uses rock music and shoots the jousting like a football grandfinal. If you think the whole rock thing is too much of an anachronism think about if music used in other period films is any more appropriate. The music is a great way to bring the middle ages to the screen. The film is silly but at least it doesn't take itself as seriously as other similar films. While it plays on the conventions done to death in more serious films it's smart enough to know when to use them and does so so much more convincingly.To get a handle on Heath Ledger's acting style see 'Two Hands'  a top Aussie film.I know that I said I'd forget the literary stuff but how good are Peter the Pardoner and Simon the Summoner especially?".

Along the way they meet the writer Geoffrey Chaucer who helps them by creating a false lineage for a nobleman from an obscure place. William performs well and catches the eye of Jocelyn a noblewoman he isn't the only one interested in her though the brutish Count Adhemar sees her as a prize. Soon Adhemar is sent away to war and William continues to win tournaments the two things he really wants though are Jocelyn's love and to put Adhemar on his back. When he returns to his home city of London for the World Championships he may get his chance as well as seeing his father for the first time in years of course if the truth about who he really is were to emerge it would all be over.Anybody expecting gritty realism will be in for a bit of a disappointment the opening in joust makes it quite clear that this will be a romp the audience cheer on their champions to the accompany of Queen's 'We Will Rock You' clapping along with the tune! The story might not be too original there are plenty of films about an underdog working their way up from the bottom to get to the top and get the girl setting the story in the world of medieval jousting is rather different though. The competitions are exciting enough even though there is no real doubt how they will end. There are plenty of laughs to be had along the way mostly provided by Roland Wat and Chaucer when we first meet Chaucer he is walking along stark naked as though this is perfectly normal. The cast performed well with Heath Ledger putting in a solid performance as William and Rufus Sewell being suitably dastardly as Adhemar. Paul Bettany is on great form as Chaucer stealing almost every scene he is in. There are also impressive performances from Mark Addy as Roland Alan Tudyk as Wat Laura Fraser as Kate the Blacksmith Shannyn Sossamon as Jocelyn and James Purefoy as the Black Prince. Overall I found this to be rather enjoyably yes it is silly and anachronistic but that is intentional and part of what makes it enjoyable.".

	schema:reviewBody "As I expected it was the appropriate choice of movie for a Saturday night. It's a great movie that combines entertainment and education. I believe that this movie brings Greek cinema in a higher level. All the people that participate in this production have made great job. The story is about a middleaged man Stavros whose life hasn't any surprises. He has a minimarket and not a lot of customers. With his friends who have more or less the same interests relax all day drinking coffee and playing football. Their only problems are Albanians. One of them has even trained his dog to bark to Albanians. However one day Stavros' mother recognises her lost son in the eyes of an Albanian. The whole life of the main characters turns upside down wandering if Stavros is from Albania or not. On the other hand Savros tries to get her exwife back. Antonis Kafetzopoulos is unbelievable in the role. The movie is a combination of drama and comedy. It shows a reality that happens in so many countries and nations. I'm sure you will laugh but it will also make you think. I totally recommend it.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film at Noordelijk Filmfestival 2011 in Leeuwarden province of Friesland NL. Reading about Greece almost daily in our newspapers each film about that country will be watched through subjective eyes. Particularly in this case we cannot overlook the twofold ! satirical elements embedded in the story. Firstly we see how some Greek people live and spend their time doing not very much. Even worse they seem not to worry about that. Secondly we see the gradual invasion of Albanian and Chinese people apparently enterprising and busy with useful work. The discrepancy cannot be demonstrated better. However it may possibly be construed as painful for those in Greece who really pull their weight.On the other hand though tempting it may be my inclination to see a connection with today's economic crisis in the EU may not be the main intention of the film makers. It is rather an open invitation to consider it applicable to life in Greece in general. I have that from a trustworthy source An introductory speech by the director's wife who happened to be here for another film emphasized that the satirical elements applied to years before the current crisis as well.There is no useful purpose in condensing the story here in a few sentences. Several complications form the core of the plot causing surprising things to happen throughout the film. Many hilarious scenes make up an additional substance that succeeds in keeping our attention. Even those not interested in politics or socialeconomics can watch and appreciate this film on other merits.It may seem a bit long to take 103 minutes for the story to develop but relevant scenes are distributed evenly and leave the intended impression. Anyway the quiet tempo is appropriate for the Greek way of living as showcased here very explicitly. An ingeniously constructed script thanks to the mentally retarded mother who suddenly displays Albanian roots provides for a strong story line. She is the unwilling cause that surprising things keep happening without her mental state leading to uncomfortable moments for us viewers.All in all the insight it gave in the Greek way of living be it intentionally satirical or not confirmed suspicions we had all along. Same can be said about the visible presence of Chinese and Albanian people with an apparently very different attitude against work. In the end everything seems back to normal as far as the four neighbors are concerned. Or can it be that the past is not fully restored and that some doubts remain? All things considered script acting etc I found enough reason to give a maximum score for the audience award when leaving the theater.".

Sure after all this time his Henry looks ancient pretentious and artificial but so will Blade Runner after 50 years and still both mark a watershed after which none could be done like anything before. Odd comparisons? Maybe. But fitting.Branagh's Henry finally set a tone worth to succeed the initial awesome blast unleashed by the most powerful actor for generations and I'm sure Branagh would be the last to deny Olivier's version the place it deserves in British movie history. Times were ripe for another tone  but times before had needed Olivier as much as the following ages will need Branagh.I'm an obsessive fan of both versions  both for entirely different reasons  and both merging perfectly what I love most about Shakespeare's eternal works.Branagh's film is timeless  of this time  without ever being trendy. Olivier's is timeless  as well as of its time  as long as we keep an understanding of its time.Olivier praised the eternal flame the eternal smell of Shakesperean theater as always reaching far beyond the confinds of its subject  beyond the confinds of the wooden circle of 'The Globe'.Branagh went right for the jugular without ever loosing grip on what makes this play a play beyond its subject and THE play about that subject.Has anyone considered the vital difference between Branagh's and Olivier's versions? I doubt it. Where Olivier conjured up the intoxicating smell of fresh 15th century glue from the sets rising into the audience's noses come here straight from the bear fights whore houses sermons of zealots and whatever had to flee London's stern moral walls of those times Branagh cut right to the bone of any hardened 'modern' movie goer.Behold Derek Jacoby's prologue is a piece of speech which will forever haunt enchant and cover me in goosebumps  firing me up to see what comes as well as see what Olivier as well as Branagh had done with the only play ever to merge humanity's lust as well as dread for the subject of war.Of course Olivier's version couldn't even dream of matching the intimate intensity of Branagh's. But how could it?Ok I won't further dwell on it but for the last time consider the father to fully understand the son.Now having shed the overpowering shadows of the past Derek Jacoby steps into the dark of the expecting stage  striking a match...Oh for the muse of fire... ... and off we are lured into the torrent of the bard's unique and eternal magic.I consider Henry V the best of Branagh's Shakespeare adaptations even though I wouldn't want to be with any of the others on pain of death. This one's flawless perfectly cast perfectly executed and perfectly acted by Branagh himself.From Burbage to Garrick to Keane to Inving to Olivier to Branagh... it is a glorious lineage to follow in love and admiration for the bard of Bard's ambassadors.Schogger13".

	schema:reviewBody "Henry V marks Kenneth Branagh's greatest achievement to date. Branagh not only directs this rich and visually stunning film he stars as the title character. The movie opens with Derek Jacobi Branagh's Shakespearean mentor in modern garb passionately delivering the prologue. Then we are taken into the dark dank rooms of Henry's castle. The king makes his dramatic entrance complete with a Darth Vader style cape. The entire film is filled with grandeur and pomp with any faults in the story line being attributable more to Shakespeare himself than Branagh. Henry V as I remember it from my college English class is a decidingly proBritish play and film. There is little question that France should be conquered and Henry speaks of his war against France as if it were France that attacked England. Indeed Henry's famous St. Chrispin's day speech is so rousing that it has been quoted often and inspired the name of the Band of Brothers miniseries about World War II. This is no surprise since Shakespeare's prose is famously beautiful.There is definitely a difference in the way that both sides of the conflict are presented. The French at least in Branagh's movie are presented as arrogant and somewhat effeminate while on the side of the English even children are filled with manly courage. Henry is presented as noble fair and merciful. True he threatens the mayor of one French town telling him that if he does not surrender the town the English will do terrible things to its residents but does not carry out his threat. He also hangs the one English soldier who steals from a French church refusing to show favoritism for him just because he was his friend. Apparently mercy towards your own countrymen was not a virtue that Henry saw particularly important.The films greatest attribute is its soundtrack particularly the use of music in the scene following the battle of Agincourt in which the warring parties collect their dead for burial.All in all a fascinating look inside the mind of a king.".

	schema:reviewBody "According to William Shakespeare on the morn of the Battle of Agincourt 1415 one of the final military confrontations during the 100Years War between France and England the English troops exhibit hesitancy and consternation toward this monumental of tasks at hand. They have been engaged in a long campaign on French soil having just trekked several hundred miles toward Calais to return to England. Kenneth Branagh as King Henry V suddenly appears among his soldiers and speaks the words that inspire his noble brethren. Here is but an excerptThis day is called the Feast of Crispian He that outlives this day and comes safe home Will stand a tiptoe when the day is named And rouse him at the name of Crispian. He that shall live this day and see old age Will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbours And say 'Tomorrow is Saint Crispian' Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars. And say 'These wounds I had on Crispin's day.' Old men forget yet all shall be forgot But he'll remember with advantages What feats he did that day then shall our names. These are words that would make any man fight for his brethren. Act IV Scene 3No one knows exactly when William Shakespeare wrote Henry V aka The Cronicle History of Henry fift The Life of Henry Fift except that it was probably penned sometime between the late 1580's and 1590's. Aside from the historical liberties that permeate much of the drama such as the king's executing anyone who would steal from local French communities in reality Henry V's troops plundered much of the French countryside during their campaign Henry V stands as one of Shakespeare's most moving and inspirational achievements. Certainly the play is very much biased toward the English. While the English are colorful emotional and determined the French are portrayed as conniving and dispassionate except for the princess Kate. Shakespeare was not intending to teach a lesson in medieval history but rather arouse patriotism among his fellow countrymen. Is it possible Henry V was written during the time of England's battle against the Spanish Armada in 1588? Kenneth Branagh has taken Shakespeare's overly patriotic play and forged a piece that combines the stunning visuals of Hollywood filmmaking with the highculture of William Shakespeare into a movie of stunning magnitude that seems nearly incomparable with the possible exception of Zeffirlli's Romeo and Juliet. Hollywood films of this type have often been lopsided with great visuals but mediocre scripts. However in this case there is no better screenwriter than William Shakespeare. Added to the mix is an outstanding cast of Shakespearian actors who navigate through Shakespeare's blank verse as easily as if they were speaking modern dialogue instead of late 16thcentury English. They speak the lines as if they are spontaneously being uttered rather than being remembered from a 400yearold play. And to give a little bit of spice to the experience Branagh incorporates a few flashback scenes from Shakespeare's Henry IV in which Prince Hal not yet Henry V commiserates with a band of drunkard cronies lead by noneother than one of Shakespeare's most popular characters Sir John Falstaff.This play this noble play which hast action adventure and high arte would be a fine and noble way to show those of young years the arte of Shakespeare. Seest thou this filme this fine filme. And if thou seest not this filme I will sadly be forced to come into thy companie and take ye to the theatre tie ye up to a chair and make ye watch these actors fine. Aye ye willst later thank me for never was there a moment dull.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film surely must be in the frame for a number of best ever categories  best Shakespeare film adaptation one of the best ever war films AND one of the best ever performances by a male actor.  It's truly stunning to see how Shakespeare's words which seemed dull and difficult to understand at school can be spoken as passages of such depth beauty and power.  Not one in a thousand actors could do this convincingly  but Kenneth Branagh can. I think this far outshines the Olivier version from 1944 very good though that was.  Branagh convinces where Olivier does not always as he gives a wider range of emotional responses to Henry  self questioning compassionate sad at the harsh realities of life.  You can really believe that here is a young man who used to be a playboy now faced with having to grow up and behave as a king of England.  As others have said he gives such fire and charisma to the battle speeches that you want to march straight into battle yourself!  And importantly Branagh also convinces utterly in the romantic wooing of the French princess.Naturally enough the film focuses on the main actor playing Henry but the supporting actors are also excellent.  Derek Jacobi particularly does wonderfully in a difficult role.  If I had to give one very slight caveat however it would be that Emma Thompson who I love as an actress does not quite convince as a native French speaker though she makes a good try at speaking the language rapidly.  Perhaps Juliette Binoche would have been better here?  But overall the obvious rapport between Branagh and Thompson who were married at the time is more important than any slight problems with the accent.The only Shakespeare performance that tops this movie is seeing Branagh give a live performance on stage  I was privileged to see him with Emma Thompson perform Much Ado About Nothing in the late 1980s and that's still the best I've ever seen.  Don't just see this  buy or record a copy.  If you see it once you will most likely want to see it over and over! 1010".

Scofield is in his element playing a distracted French monarch. Ian Holm is an irascible isn't he always? Fluellen. Derek Jacobi is a master chorus you can listen to that voice ALL day.

Great fun. Twenty or so of us spent a whole Sunday afternoontolateevening discussing and arguing the merits and demerits of both versions. I recommend the exercise for other Shakespeare fans and film fans. Holms vs. Scofield as Lear Zefferelli's Romeo  Juliet vs. the one with Caprio etc. Try it you'll like it. Henry V has been read as English triumphalism so often that this badwar era version was probably NECESSARY in order to show folks how subtle Shakespeare can be even when he seems to be tooting a patriotic horn! We are shown a very complicated and very disturbed king in three fine scenes in particular 1 Henry slouching on his throne as he hears his ecclesiastical minions telling him what he wants to hear and feeding him the longshot arguments that speciously justify his claim to the throne of France 2 the subtle demonstration that his French obsession is partly a way of displacing his guilt about abandoning Falstaff and 3 his maniacal behavior at Harfleur as he rides around waving his sword and making himself a perfect target with his surcoat decorated with the royal arms! Shakespeare makes it impossible to doubt Henry's courage and military genius but he also appalls us My God we think it's nuts like this who still rule the world and cause most of the problems thereof!I have a few bones to pick. Branagh is trying to keep the film from getting too long and he is sometimes sloppy about what he cuts. Here are a pair of examples 1 The film movingly depicts a French atrocity namely the killing the youngsters who guarded the English luggage Directly against the laws of war as the lovable fussy legalist Fluellen puts it. But Shakespeare puts this in perspective by highlighting Henry's equally atrocious violation when he orders the mass killing of French prisoners. BRANAGH IGNORES THAT AND LEAVES OUT THE British ATROCITY WHILE INCLUDING THE FRENCH ONE! In the play as Shakespeare wrote it Fluellen displaying his unconquerable admiration for the king has to force himself in his Alexander the Pig scene to rationalize Henry's atrocity as a response to the French atrocity which hadn't happened yet. The stickler Fluellen in other words is disingenuous with himself as the price of keeping Henry in the right. Ouch! But the ouch would actually have strengthened Branagh's interpretation.2 Branagh is gorgeous in his handling of the scene where Henry disguises himself as a common soldier in order to hobnob with his men and loses his coolthrows a tantrum in factwhile listening to soldier Williams' good and honest antiwar talk. But another sequence without which the foregoing scene can really not be understood properly is cut!!!! The scene in question which isn't in the film shows Henry revealing himself to the honest or lippy? Williams and demanding satisfaction for the latter's supposedly insubordinate and disloyal talk. Williams stands his ground like a man and tells Henry respectfully but firmly that if he wants to be treated like a king he shouldn't disguise himself as a buck private. The King thus put in the wrong in front of his officers and shown the flip side of the thoughts he himself expressed in his Upon the King! soliloquy a few scenes earlier cuts his losses tells Fluellen to make up for the deception by giving Williams his Henry's glove filled with money and hurriedly exits. Williams refuses the money along with Fluellen's patronizing b.s. and we are left to contemplate the fact that we have just seen an unpleasantly catty side of Henry. As in the other case Branagh's cutting of one scene rather makes hash out of the other.There is one scene where Branagh unnecessarily remains in Olivier's shadow. Branagh was quite aware that he couldn't speechify like Olivier nor could anyone else actually and that he would therefore inevitably suffer if he tried to declaim the Once more to the breach Harfleur set piece he somehow couldn't resist trying which resulted in the only lame acting in the film. Branagh would have made more sense if he had just allowed the mounted renzied Henry to shout himself hoarse almost unheard over the noise of battle while urging his men to this crazy suicide attack and to eschew such stagey hamming as we end up seeing here and nowhere else in the film. Finally a bow should be made toward the supporting cast especially Holms Blessed and Scofield who are splendid. About Scofield the history books say that Charles VI was subject to migraine headaches and fits of depression and that due to the absolutist nature of the French state the whole mechanism of government ground to a halt when the King was suffering in this way. Scofield's brilliant performance shows that there is no such thing as a minor role.I don't know what one of the IMDb reviewers means by the complaint that Emma Thompson as Princess Katherine looks too English. She's great in her Le foutre et le con scene.".

Battle movies whether Shakespearean based or not are not normally my favorite genre though this tale seems very well executed. I found the actual battle scenes quite long and graphic with plenty of mud sweat blood and tears even though it was doubtless exactly thus at Agincourt in 1415. The scene where the surviving soldiers from each side collect their dead from the battlefield for burial is a vivid depiction of the tragedy of war.This Shakespearean play made for all time whether accurately or not a noble and just hero out of the historical figure Henry V just as Shakespeare firmly established Richard III as a villain. From my amateur perspective Kenneth Branagh gives a brilliant performance in all facets of the king's action whether back in England dealing with political  military issues following an insult by the King of France eventually at the end wooing the French princess daughter of said French king and most especially rallying his weary demoralized troops at Agincourt.Of course the English victory at the bloody Battle of Agincourt despite superior numbers of French forces is legendary. Henry's rallying St. Crispian's Day speech prior to the battle is from my standpoint a fitting example of Shakespeare's genius. I can still picture 'We few we happy few we band of brothers...' delivered by Branagh with such eloquence and intensity. The scene in which Henry refuses to spare his friend who has been caught stealing from the French church is also dramatic and shows the king's efforts undoubtedly painful to him to remain impartial when disciplining his troops. This soldier was in fact Falstaff whom I recall vividly as 'Prince Hal's' later Henry V's friend from the earlier play Henry IV Part I which I DID read in school so found the incident particularly touching.However for me the scenes of Henry hobnobbing incognito with his troops before the battle his own conflicted emotions about his military decisions and the subsequent rousing St. Crispian's speech are indeed the definite highlights in this memorable adaptation.".

	schema:reviewBody "Derek Jacobi's wonderfully proud winking Chorus and Patrick Doyle's interesting but barely score are the sole redeeming features of this early Kenneth Branagh misfire. A gritty in a BBC sense of the word take on Shakespeare's mostly tedious historical play Henry V gives far too much power to one man in the worst way that Branagh repeated so often to such bewildering acclaim. He not only directs and rather pretentiously adapts for the screen the words of the Bard but also plays the title character. And sadly he is by far no Olivier. The man has talent to be sure but it either wasn't here yet or it had fled temporarily when he took up this triple task. The only flat unraised spirit here is Branagh himself who essays a monotonous monarch with all the emotional depth of Keanu Reeves after an allnighter. He even fumbles his one good instinct as a filmmaker flashing back to Henry IV is an excellent way to provide backstory for people who aren't too familiar with the soap opera nature of some of Shakespeare's histories which is primarily important here for the character of Falstaff but the technique doesn't mesh with the rest of the picture. And why keep the Chorus? He's a purely theatrical device. He's there to tell us we have to imagine that we're in France or Southampton a necessity of the theater in which all you can see is a stage and what's on it but somewhat disconcerting in a film because the entire point of a film is to show us someplace we normally wouldn't see. Did he keep the Chorus to make his job as a director of sustaining our illusion that much easier? Whatever the motives and no disrespect to the vibrant Jacobi it was not the right decision. It's a boring slowtoevolve adaptation of a terrible impossibletoread play. I am a fan of ol' Will but his history plays are some of the most tedious dramas ever to plague the page. If you're a fan of the kind of epic battle scenes of films as diverse as Platoon and Gladiator you'll definitely enjoy that aspect of the movie. Actionwise it has its moments. But after a while you just want Branagh to stick to doing one thing. Unfortunately he's too selfindulgent to get that idea into his head.".

Yet for all Shakespeare's literary brilliance and the fine acting Henry V feels like a nomadic and underwhelming experience.The story is linear and this is in stark contrast to the complex but deeply meaningful language of the play. Although the acting is of the highest quality the straightforwardness is rather cumbersome. The introduction of Chorus played by Derek Jacobi certainly serves a necessary purpose of providing immediacy to proceedings. The introduction of the four characters Bardolph Nym Pistol and Flagstaff just didn't fit at all in the scheme of the film it felt rather strangely and obtrusive. I understood they knew Henry V but couldn't understand their relationship it was vastly underexplored. Most of the characters are tipped very lightly in characterisation and their deaths do not nurture a single regret.The cinematography is the films greatest strength providing the necessary atmosphere but I felt the direction suffered a lack of emotional structure and set bearings. This is where Henry V suffered as a film the battles are staged in rather closely shot environs not wishing to expand the destruction and death of warfare. The fine speeches and acting is severely hampered by not providing the audience with sufficient stimuli that a film can only provide. Henry V goes on his journey to Agincourt and indeed to his famous victory with a tiny consortium of people that is not grand or epic but rather nonsensical how did they win the battle of Agincourt? Henry V provides the necessary thespian talent but it is ravaged by its lack of coherency and piecemeal offerings of epicness. The film is too straightforward and suffers greatly from its almost nomadic sense of pushing to the end leaving the cinematography to make up for the lack of extras landscapes and grandeur. Henry V although admirable in some ways does not enrich the vistas of our imagination as it had so offered to do so at its beginnings.".

The scene where Henry walks among his men the night before battle to gage their mood is Branagh at his finest.The St. Crispin's Day speech to rally those same troops the next morning is delivered with the correct pace and vigor. Many interpretations of this pivotal characterrevealing speech take a poignant We who are about to die gallantly approach. But Branagh rightly takes a rousing stance dealing with massive obstacles offhandedly. The most remembered lines in the play are spoken as an aside. That the king stayed up all night speaking to his troops incognito and pondering their fears then casually dismisses them with a wave of his hand allows the army to share his disdain. It's a ruggedly masculine act of bravado that seems immediate yet is highly structured showing the steady prepared courage of a king who doesn't lightly risk his men and takes the political aspect of his role as seriously as the military.The battle scene is wonderful just the right blend of chaos mud blood and agonized cries of the wounded. There are subtle gestures typical of Branagh  watch for the French liaison's tip of the hat to Henry during their final encounter. Much better than the flawed Hamlet Branagh produced later this epic piece is just right  good Shakespeare faithful to the book good cinematography good acting and a great lead performance.Roman Polanski is said to have told Jack Nicholson on the set of Chinatown that in order to execute the shooting script in a reasonable running time he had to talk faster. I wonder if Roman was on the set of Henry V or every filming of Shakespreare for that matter. Why is it that directors almost always confuse high emotion with rapid speech? In real life it leads to confusion inability to rapidly choose what to say slowing of intensely charged vocalization. Perhaps Branagh needed to bring Henry in under a time constraint but the rapid speech and repartee makes one wonder if the characters think about what they're saying. But they don't need to do they? The words have been on paper for hundreds of years and we've all learned them in school.".

Both are Shakespearian actors with a love for The Bard and both made their directional debut with an adaptation of Henry V.In 1413 Henry V Branagh has ascended to the English throne. Worried that the King may take property from the Church The Bishop of Ely Alec McCowen and The Archbishop of Canterbury Charles Kay convince Henry V to claim the throne of France and go to war with their rival. The English storm through France but with disease fatigue and horrible weather Henry attempts to bring the army back to England leading to the Battle of Agincourt.Branagh's version of Henry V has often been compared to Olivier version for good reason. Olivier takes a more stylised approach his art direction was routed in Medieval Art and his film started as a play and slowly become more realistic. Branagh takes a more realistic approach setting his film in castles halls and muddy fields and he uses darker more natural lighting as places are lit by candles. The 1944 film was made as to be a prowar film to help morale the British public whilst Branagh takes a much more antiwar view showing the horrors and hardships of Medieval war.Branagh gave a terrific performance as Henry V someone with intensity behind him and quiet determination whilst still being able to deliver a speech. There is pain and doubt on his face as he sees the war at first hand the death and destruction and even doubts about his mission. This is particularly the case during his monologue of selfdoubt. Branagh is surrounded by talented actors all giving excellent performances the most surprising being Brian Blessed who is much calmer to his usual largerthanlife persona.Branagh's direction has a Kubrickian edge to it sharing camera angles and movements and a visual look having similar lighting and sets. There are many moments where Branagh he allows a long take when more are debating or monologuing and zones in very slowly. There is a gorgeous four minute tracking shot showing the aftermath of the battle whilst a Latin song is playing in the background.It was clear that the production was limited on the scope of the numbers of people it could shooting very closely to mask this. But an advantage was that it show that the Battle of Agincourt was a very close tough battle it really was as it was fought on a muddy wet narrow field. The 1989 version got the tactics right but the costumes wrong and the 1944 got the costumes right but the battle wrong.The 1989 Henry V is a great adaptation of one of Shakespeare's most quotable plays. It is a great realisation of the play and one of Branagh's best films.".

Branagh is surrounded by talented actors all giving excellent performances the most surprising being Brian Blessed who is much calmer to his usual largerthanlife persona.Branagh's direction has a Kubrickian edge to it sharing camera angles and movements and a visual look having similar lighting and sets. There are many moments where Branagh he allows a long take when more are debating or monologuing and zones in very slowly. There is a gorgeous four minute tracking shot showing the aftermath of the battle whilst a Latin song is playing in the background.It was clear that the production was limited on the scope of the numbers of people it could shooting very closely to mask this. But an advantage was that it show that the Battle of Agincourt was a very close tough battle it really was as it was fought on a muddy wet narrow field. The 1989 version got the tactics right but the costumes wrong and the 1944 got the costumes right but the battle wrong.The 1989 Henry V is a great adaptation of one of Shakespeare's most quotable plays. It is a great realisation of the play and one of Branagh's best films.";

It's not a 'complete' version of the play but it has the wit subtlety and invention missing in Branagh. Olivier is much truer to the spirit of Shakespeare  it's playful and funny in parts for example the lovely scene where Catherine is learning English. Most importantly Olivier brings out the beauty of Shakespears words the spine tingling soliloquy in Henry's nighttime tour of the camp?.Branagh's version is neither a film or a play. It unfortunately the throttling of language for dramatic effect. Drowned in muzak and delivered with hollypinewood whispers or You slag! shouting. And kicks the crap out of the language with odd action film stresses and punctuations. Making the whole play difficult to listen to and understand.There's nothing playful or subtle about it  it's wall to wall drama  which inevitably gets a bit tedious after a while.

A bit like being server a steak you really wanted to tuck into but cant as someone's covered it in tomato sauce and half a pound of salt.Although there are some funny bits e.g.Derek Jacobi doing Marty DiBergi introduction to Spinal Tap at the start.It's also very 80's e.g. Branagh's hair cut  When he's asked if he's Cornishman I half expected him to answer No I am from HampsteadDerek Jacobi with thespian scarf on the White Cliff of Dover doing Michael Palin's Ripping Yarns You know I think it was G.K.

The enthusiasm for this appalling mess totally mystifies me. One truly good part was performed by the French herald Montjoy who actually dignified his role.

Incredibly difficult to understand what was going on but the English foot soldiers apparently charged headlong into the massed French cavalry. After that the archers sent showers of arrows into the carnage. Fortunately the arrows managed to pick out all the French and spare the English. Remarkable perhaps the shafts were fitted with special sensors. Although the comparative statistics of the slaughter were read out in the aftermath there was no indication whatsoever of how these staggering figures had been achieved. The Olivier version indicated very clearly that it was the archers who had decisively won the day long before there was any handtohand fighting.

The cinematography is poor and generally framed as many TV movies are and the score and editing are consistent with TV movie standards read bland.  I think the way these were completed a viewing on video is preferred it more than likely hides these poorly done elements better.  Aside from Henry's entrance nothing else would benefit from a theatrical screening.The story however is the main problem of the film.  It seems like not much thought went into story flow.  Scenes are flimsily connected and besides the first thirty minutes and the battle sequences do little to advance the story but are routinely overlong.  Most scenes end up merely being opportunities for various actors to have good monologues.  Poor Emma Thompson the main victim does a good job in her small role but seems ultimately wasted here.  Her English lesson scene is superfluous and it is extremely hard to buy the romance scene which ironically is too compacted yet stops the movie cold at the end of the film dragging it out for nearly ten long minutes.  The story also makes it hard to care about these characters there are too many characters crammed into too small of scenes. In the end we really know nothing of any of them nor can we remember many of their names by the time their scenes are finished.With all these glaring negative aspects to the film it is impossible for me to see it as a masterpiece.

Spencer Tracy before his MGM years and major stardom was teamed with Loretta Young one of the major stars of the early 30's and sparks were united.Tracy is a rough and tough shanty town character who takes in down on her luck Young. Slightly mistreating her Tracy is on the verge of leaving her when she drops a bombshell that will change their lives. Also around are Marjorie Rambeau as a drunken neighbor with a heart of gold and giving a very sensitive performance Glenda Farrell as a singer who turns Tracy's head and Walter Connelly as another neighbor who becomes a fatherlike figure to the two. The camera work and settings are rough and gritty almost like a Warner Brothers film. However this was made at Columbia then a secondrate B studio which was most known at the time for its string of films directed by Frank Capra usually starring Barbara Stanwyck. It is short and sweet 66 minutes according to Leonard Maltin and very moving. I agree with Maltin's comment that Tracy's character was a bit much to take at times but it is evident that he hides many facets behind his hard exterior. The story is very close to the play Lilliom Tracy finding spiritual guidance after a failed payroll robbery and ironically Tracy's character's name is Bill changed to Billy for the musical Carousel.Young never one of my favorites was at her best in the early 30's before she became too ladylike. Even though her character is sweet and vulnerable she is far more realistic than she got in her more esteemed years after winning the Oscar for The Farmer's Daughter. Farrell is fine in her few scenes but has little to do. It's a shame that this very talented lady never rose above the line of secondary roles or leads in B features. If A Man's Castle makes its way onto cable or with some miracle home video I highly recommend it to film students and historians.".

Even though her character is sweet and vulnerable she is far more realistic than she got in her more esteemed years after winning the Oscar for The Farmer's Daughter. Farrell is fine in her few scenes but has little to do. It's a shame that this very talented lady never rose above the line of secondary roles or leads in B features. If A Man's Castle makes its way onto cable or with some miracle home video I highly recommend it to film students and historians.";

	schema:reviewBody "Man's Castle is one of the most important American films of the 1930s. As Andrew Sarris has noted it's one of the few films that was able to capture the emotional nuances of the Depression. Borzage's sweet ethereal love story concerns a toughguy Bill Spencer Tracy and penniless girl Trina Loretta Young who are incurably optimistic lovers. They setup house together in a squalid shanty town. Their romance transcends in Borzage's spiritual vision the Depression and worst possible squalor. Borzage typically championed the proletariat no better than in this film with the tease of material success at the very beginning of the film with Tracy's selfindulgent character and then challenge to the audience to accept a different set of circumstances. What impressed me the most about Man's Castle was Loretta Young. She actually became that character Trina. Her devotion and innocence are heartbreaking. Not to mention she carries Bill's unborn baby and it would be a crime if he doesn't return the love she expresses to him. Bill loves Trina but he does it in a tough or bullying manner that almost becomes annoying. One of the most moving moments in the film occurs when he buys her a stove that she always wanted to get.  She couldn't believe it and falls down on his knees and cries. Bill cannot help but moved by what he did. Despite his tough mannerisms he ultimately succumbs to Trina's fragility as they ride the freight train at the end transcending the Depression and its harshness.".

But in this lyrical Frank Borzage romance and even though she's playing a lowselfesteem patsy who puts up with entirely too much bullying from paramour Spencer Tracy she's direct and honest and irresistible. It's an odd little movie played mostly in a oneroom shack in a Hooverville unusually upfront about the Depression yet romantic and idealized. Tracy playing a blustery hardtotake regular guy who would be an awful chauvinist and bully by today's standards softens his character's hard edge and almost makes him appealing. There's good supporting work from Marjorie Rambeau and Glenda Farrell who never got as far as she should have and Jo Swerling's screenplay is modest and efficient. But the real heroes are Borzage who always liked to dramatize true love in lyrical closeup and Young. You sort of want to slap her and tell her character to wise up she's too good for this guy but she's so dewy and persuasive you contentedly watch their story play out to a satisfying conclusion.".

The hardships of the Depression are never ignored in fact they're integral to the film.

Like in other films of Borzage The seventh heaven bad girl... love faces poverty and survives because of his almost magic nature. But what makes this film more remarkable than others from Borzage is the complexity of Spencer Tracys role. He is full of passion for life but also fears everybodys life. When he meets Loretta Young has to face a new situation than creates an earthquake of contradictions. I was very surprised with this role and it explains why this movie had so many problems in his time. In the end a very nice surprise".

	schema:reviewBody "Man's Castle is set in one of those jerry built settlements on vacant land and parks that during these times were called 'Hoovervilles' named after our unfortunate 31st president who got stuck with The Great Depression occurring in his administration. The proposition of this film is that a man's home is still his castle even when it's just a shack in a Hooverville.Spencer Tracy has such a shack and truth be told this guy even in good times would not be working all that much. But in a part very typical for Tracy before he was cast as a priest in San Francisco the start of a slew of classic roles he's playing a tough good natured mug who takes in Loretta Young.One of the things about Man's Castle is that it shows the effects of the Depression on women as well as men. Women had some additional strains put on them if men had trouble finding work women had it twice as hard. And they were sexually harassed and some resorted to prostitution just for a square meal. Spence takes Loretta Young in who's facing those kind of problems and makes no demands on her in his castle. Pretty soon though they're in love though Tracy is not the kind to settle down.The love scenes had some extra zing to them because Tracy and Young were having a torrid affair during the shooting of Man's Castle. And both were Catholic and married and in those days that was an insuperable barrier to marriage. Both Tracy and Young took the Catholic faith quite seriously.Also in the cast are Walter Connolly as a kind of father figure for the whole camp Marjorie Rambeau who's been through all the pitfalls Young might encounter and tries to steer her clear and Arthur Hohl a really loathsome creep who has his eye on Young as well. Hohl brings the plot of Man's Castle to its climax through his scheming. Man's Castle is grim look at the Great Depression not the usual movie escapist fare for those trying to avoid that kind of reality in their entertainment.".

Being someone who likes Spencer Tracy in many things and that 'Man's Castle' was a relatively early role for him and a largely forgotten film. Was also interested in seeing a young Loretta Young in a period where her acting for most people here seemed to appeal more than her later roles.'Man's Castle' is a very intriguing and to me pretty impressive film. Not perfect one can see why it won't work for some or an alltime classic and all have done better work but it has a lot of great things and charms and deserves to be seen more. 'Man's Castle' has a theme of love amidst and against poverty very much relevant then in 1933 and still something that can be related to today in having to overcome love in face of adversity and dire circumstances so it was a film that wasn't hard to relate to.It is a shame that despite lovely photography 'Man's Castle' is visually quite primitive. With a shantytown setting that doesn't look authentic at all and instead looking studiobound on a modest at best budget and the miniature use looks pretty phoney.At times too the character of Bill can be hard to take with it being overdone.However the two leads are wonderful with Tracy at his aggressively passionate and Young giving one of her most charming and winsome performances. Their chemistry is unlikely at first but is suitably complex and has passion. There is fine support from Glenda Farrell Marjorie Rambeau and Walter Connolly.Frank Borzage a sensitive and deservingofmorecredit director directs sensitively as ever the film is scripted thoughtfully and with emotional impact and the story always engage and is both charming and moving. Sentimentality doesn't get too much generally or get too hard to stomach to me though the ending goes a little overboard.On the whole very well done and well worth seeing. 810 Bethany Cox".

She however gives a very sensitive performance as the lovely girl attracted to him despite his arrogant behavior. This is the weakness of the story. If played by a charmer like Clark Gable Loretta's yen for Tracy would be more understandable. As it is he plays a real scoundrel without any attempt to soften his character for the sake of romance. He's sometimes so despicable that he alienates the viewer from sympathizing with him.But it's Loretta Young who holds the film together even though her character often seems naive and foolish to stay with Tracy. MARJORIE RAMBEAU is effective in a good supporting role as a woman with backbone who helps Tracy and Young when he has to flee the authorities. WALTER CONNOLLY as a man Tracy attempts to rob is also fine.The film looks as though it was bathed in soft focus perhaps to make the tone of the love story less gritty than it would have looked if filmed realistically. Whatever Loretta Young has never looked more beautiful. Her costuming belies the fact that she's a Depression era heroine. Another unrealistic touch by director Frank Borzage who has chosen to tell the story as if it were a fairy tale Depression story.".

	schema:reviewBody "Wow. Watching this film today you can't help but be appalled by the writing of this film. Spencer Tracy and Loretta Young play a couple who in modern times might be featured on The Jerry Springer Showas they have a sick and abusive relationship...and inexplicably the writers appear to be endorsing it! The film begins with a hungry and homeless Loretta being shown the ropes by the poor but very resourceful Spencer Tracy. He shows her how by conniving you can do very well with little money and takes her home to his shack to stay. It's never clear whether or not they marryand considering it's a PreCode film you can assume they aren't even though they are cohabiting. Their relationship is very strange...and rather sick. While you can see that Tracy cares about her by his actions he is verbally abusive and a total jerkand Young comes running back for more like some sort of dog. He calls her skinny or ugly and these are in a sick way his way of using endearments! Later when he starts fooling around with another woman Glenda Farrell she tells her friend that if that's what he wants it's okay with her!!! It sure smacks of a sadomasochistic relationship and you can't help but feel a bit horrified. Sure he doesn't hit her but the relationship is very abusive. To show how sick it is when Young gets pregnant she tells him ...it's your baby and it's mine but you don't need to worry I'll take all the blame for it!! Yikes! Doesn't this all seem a bit like looking through a peephole into a sick and dysfunctional home?! Later in a case of art imitating life Tracy proves what sort of man he is and disappears. After all he can't be burdened with a babyeven if it's his. But he changes his mind and decides to return home. Wow...that's bit of him! And when he returns he's nasty and acts like IF he stays he isn't obligated to care for the kid!! And she tells him he's a free man...free as a bird! Wow I was almost in tears at this tender moment...NOT! Soon this crazy pair are married...and naturally Young is depressed because he seems to be staying as long as it suits himnot because of any love or sense of responsibility. So how can you salvage anything with this sort of sick characters? What would you do? Well as for the writers they have Tracy soon commit a robbery to help pay for the brat! The romantic aspects of the film are underwhelming to say the least! During the robbery Tracy behaves like a chumpdoing almost nothing to take precautions not to get caughtlike he was secretly hoping to get sent to prison. And to show what sort of nice guy he is the guy he tries to rob is one of his best friends.While there's more to the film the bottom line is that Tracy is a jerk and Young is an idiot in the film. Despite both being very good actors there's absolutely no way they could make anything of this crap the writers produced. Nice music nice sets good acting...and a script that is 100 poo. How the film is currently rated 7.4 is beyond me and I wonder how anyone can ignore the pure awfulness of the characters. A horrible misfire that somehow didn't destroy the careers of those involved.Oh and if you wonder if Loretta EVER gets a backbone in this film or plays a person who is the least bit strong the answer is NO! By the end she's learned nothing and hasn't changed one whit for the better.They sure don't make films like they used to...and in this case...thank God!".

He turns out to be poor also and was only dressed as an advertising streetwalker. They go skinnydipping in the Hudson River and shack up in New York City's Hooterville. Ms. Young becomes thoroughly domesticated she cooks irons and decorates Mr. Tracy's shanty with fancy curtains. Tracy treats Young badly in the shack and sees other women on the side like sexy singer Glenda Farrell as Fay La Rue...At home Young resists skuzzy neighbor Arthur Hohl as Bragg and befriends boozy Marjorie Rambeau as Flossie. They add danger to our drama. Babe Ruth fan Dickie Moore as Joey and a reverend Walter Connolly as Ira are also in the cast. Tracy and Young connected in real life too. Indeed irresistible Young weathers the Depression looking never less than perfect in cinematographer Joseph August's soft focus. Director Frank Borzage's fairy tale romance is lauded in some quarters not mine. There are some good production values and Mr. Hohl contributes a good supporting performance. Man's Castle 102733 Frank Borzage  Spencer Tracy Loretta Young Arthur Hohl Marjorie Rambeau".

	onyx:emotionText "Wearing a tuxedo during the Depression smoking Spencer Tracy as Bill picks up starving Loretta Young as Trina while feeding popcorn to some curiously adorned pigeons in Central Park. He turns out to be poor also and was only dressed as an advertising streetwalker. They go skinnydipping in the Hudson River and shack up in New York City's Hooterville. Ms. Young becomes thoroughly domesticated she cooks irons and decorates Mr. Tracy's shanty with fancy curtains. Tracy treats Young badly in the shack and sees other women on the side like sexy singer Glenda Farrell as Fay La Rue...At home Young resists skuzzy neighbor Arthur Hohl as Bragg and befriends boozy Marjorie Rambeau as Flossie. They add danger to our drama. Babe Ruth fan Dickie Moore as Joey and a reverend Walter Connolly as Ira are also in the cast. Tracy and Young connected in real life too. Indeed irresistible Young weathers the Depression looking never less than perfect in cinematographer Joseph August's soft focus. Director Frank Borzage's fairy tale romance is lauded in some quarters not mine. There are some good production values and Mr. Hohl contributes a good supporting performance.

	schema:reviewBody "The film begins with a woman the beautiful Loretta Young who is starving because this is at the height of the Great Depression. She meets up with a man who looks rich Spencer Tracy in a park. He takes her to an expensive restaurant for dinner. But it turns out he is just as poor as she is. After bilking the restaurant out of dinner they return to his shack down along the river and she stays the night this is precode falls deeply in love with him but does so with a great deal of stress because she realizes that while he loves her he is also a man who has a strong bent toward being free. And that is the crux of the film and the first reason I give this film bonus points  I know the feeling. I have been in two relationships where my partner wanted to be free almost as much as he wanted to be in a relationship. And it was a constant struggle for both of us. So in that sense this is a really real dilemma for both characters.The other reason this film earns some bonus points is that it is at least a bit unique. Stop and think of what group of people are usually portrayed in Depressionera films  it's usually gangsters or high society people. In contrast in this film the people depicted are primarily honest people living in the slums of the Depression.Now the film loses a few points too. For one thing some of the transitions between shots from different angles are very sloppy. But this was only 1932 so I can let that slide...a bit.Spencer Tracy's acting here he's one of my two favorite actors is very good considering this is early on in his career. You begin to see elements of the Tracy we came to know throughout his film career. Loretta Young is not only beautiful but perfect in this role. I have mixed feelings about Marjorie Rambeau's portrayal of an alcoholic though her part is central to the plot. Walter Connolly is very good here though I noted his poor teeth and found that distracting. This role is a bit different for him so it's nice to see him in something this is not a comedy.And one of the joys of this film is that it's precode but not in your face about it. As Tracy says early in the film No female has to starve in a town like this. And then there's the nude swimming scene...although trust me you won't see anything. And the fact that Young becomes pregnant later in the film. And of course all this was filmed at a point when the real Tracy and the real Young were having a torrid affair.Although I won't put this film up to an 8 it is darned good and wellworth watching. You're likely to learn something about the Great Depression to boot.".

But what a glimpse of life at the bottom when no one had any work. Tracy's Hooverville shack somewhere in New York City is made out of garbage. Cardboard corrugated iron no stove discarded automobile doors and other junk a divine assembly of bricolage. And boy does Loretta Young dress it up and turn it into a home. Women are always doing things like that. They just can't leave a man alone to live like a billy goat.

	schema:reviewBody "MAN'S CASTLE Columbia 1933 directed by Frank Borzage is not so much about a British king and his royal subjects but a Depressionera story of survival and one man who's castle happens to be the great outdoors in a shanty community. Starring future Academy Award winners Spencer Tracy and Loretta Young in their only pairing together and direction by twotime award winning Borzage it's very much precode movie with enough material not commonly found in motion pictures after the production code was fully enforced by 1934.Set in New York City the story opens in Central Park where Bill Spencer Tracy dressed in top hat and tuxedo is feeding popcorn to the pigeons. Seated next to him on the bench is Trina Loretta Young homeless hungry and desperate. At first he takes her for a panhandler but believing her story that she hasn't eaten in two days treats her to a meal in an nearby expensive restaurant. As much as Bill appears to be a man of wealth he's just as broke as Trina. Due to his self confidence he talks his way out of paying the check to the manager Harvey Clark. Later that night Bill takes Trina to his place of residence a Park Avenue section along the East River called Shanty Town where the homeless victims of the Depression are gathered together in run down shacks including Ira Walter Connolly a churchless preacher who quotes scriptures from the Bible Flossie Marjorie Rambeau an argumentative drunk and Bragg Arthur Hohl a man not to be trusted all close friends of Bill's. Through the course of time Trina having moved in with Bill keeps house for him while he acquires various lines of work to support himself and when not working odd jobs finds time playing baseball with the neighborhood kids. Helping Bragg with one of his assignments as process server Bill succeeds in where others have failed  that of personally handling a subpoena to entertainer Fay LaRue Glenda Farrell and facing up to several of her tough thug bodyguards. Because Bill is having an affair with Fay who likes his nerve Bragg tries to step in on Trina now pregnant with Bill's baby. When Bill learns he's about to become a father he's faced with a decision to either catch the next train out of town or join forces with Bragg on a job that could get them in trouble with the law.This seldom revived love story is one from the time capsule capturing in a reality sense the hardships and struggles of the Great Depression. Borzage offers some reflection of the times as the camera focuses on Bill and Trina walking down Broadway with movie marque titles of the day visible in background namely George Raft and Sylvia Sidney starring PICK UP Paramount 1933. As for the script it portrays Tracy as tough irresponsible and confident in a physical sense. He charms women with his dynamic personality but in reality is unable to face up to any responsibility. When asked what he does for a living he responds I LIVE! When not working he's out playing baseball with the neighborhood kids. Almost immediately Bill makes Trina his own. The very night of their initial union they end up skinny dipping in the East River a scene that certainly raised a few eyebrows way back when. As much as Bill doesn't waste any time neither does Trina. At first she's shy and lacks confidence but loses all fears once she's in the company with Bill. Like Trina Fay Glenda Farrell becomes attracted to Bill admiring his big shot personality. Farrell's Fay sings one song titled Surprise. No doubt she gets one from Bill. Other noteworthy support goes to Arthur Hohl as Tracy's underhanded friend Connolly the middleaged preaching night watchman. and Dickie Moore briefly seen as the crippled boy with leg in brace who gets an autographed baseball from Bill. Existing still photos of Helen MacKeller indicate her withdraw from production and substituted by character actress Marjorie Rambeau whose mannerisms and performance reminds any film buf of Gladys George.Not televised in the New York City area since the 1960s MAN's CASTLE seemed destined to never be seen again. Aside from revival movie houses in the 1970s cable television helped bring films such as this back to life again. One of its earliest known broadcasts was on Wometo Home Theater in 1985 followed by other cable channels before turning up on Turner Classic Movies on August 31 2008 during its Summer Under the Stars presentation and 24hour salute to Spencer Tracy.

It is currently in rotation on Antenna TV which is broadcast not cable in most major markets. I particularly enjoyed the opening dinner date between the two and how Tracy pays for it. The real worth of this movie is its depiction of the time early Depression and the values of the time in which it was made. 1933 was indeed a very different world and a character like Tracy's and his attitude towards women was not that uncommon then. Probably not that uncommon now but an attitude only allowed to be expressed in the action genre. Young plays a smitten young woman of 19 who may indeed be an idiot to use one other reviewer's less than charitable description of her but that type of young idiotic and naive woman is very much with us today and putting up with far worse from their men than anything Tracy dished out in this film. Many of today's reputedly liberated young women will by the CDs with the most misogynistic lyrics which make up so much of what passes for modern music and call themselves the most vile and basest of names. There is no way Loretta Young's character in this movie would do that. Needless to say a woman clinging to an abusive man is a recognizable type in any era  as is an abusive man. To my eye Tracy's character was abusive only because he wanted to drive her away as he saw correctly that she would be able to tame him if given the chance. The only thing that truly surprised me was the outofwedlock pregnancy  mention of which was never made in films of that time except for this one. And to see the very devout Tracy and Young in those roles in light of what came later for both of them personally was very surprising.Frankly I think that sums up this film for me  very surprising. The setting surprises. Ditto for the characters. The screenplay works well enough to bring out the world in which Bill  Trina and Ira  Flossie and all the rest find themselves and how they attempt to deal with it and to find what happiness they can.".

	schema:headline " Rough Love Story";
	schema:reviewBody "Man's Castle 1933  out of 4 A rather bizarre love story from Borzage set during the Depressionera as two different people are brought together through being poor. Spencer Tracy plays a hot tempered man who has the charm to live a good life but instead plays it day to day just making what he has to. He takes in a poor woman Loretta Young and they hit it off well even though he mistreats her and she might want something out of him that he'd never be able to give. If the term love story makes you want to pass this film up then you might want to think again because this isn't the tear jerker that would have women lining up buying tickets. Instead this is a pretty mean spirited precode that has all sorts of stuff from premarital sex to abused women to suffering because of being poor and even a brief mention of an abortion. Did I mention that Tracy and Young go skinny dipping early in the movie? At the heart of the film is a love story but we've got so much other stuff going on that you might lose site of that. For starters Tracy's character is one of the biggest S.O.B's you'll likely see in a film from this era. He's incredibly mean and often takes it out on Young who doesn't mind getting insulted or being left behind when he's out with other women. I think a lot of people are going to be turned off because of how mean he is but I guess this is a part of the moral in the film. Tracy delivers another fine performance and I think the reason I personally didn't hate his character more is because of how good the actor was. He certainly pulls off the meanness without any trouble but at the same time you can just look at him and know there's something under that toughness. Young perhaps my favorite actress also delivers another winning performance. She's very believable in the abused woman role even though you want to ask her why she's with the jerk. The film has a message about a lot of issues and this is another reason why it remains rather fresh today especially since we're going through another hard time with people without jobs and unable to eat. The speech Tracy's character gives to a restaurant early on is something that would probably get a standing ovation today.".

Young perhaps my favorite actress also delivers another winning performance. She's very believable in the abused woman role even though you want to ask her why she's with the jerk. The film has a message about a lot of issues and this is another reason why it remains rather fresh today especially since we're going through another hard time with people without jobs and unable to eat. The speech Tracy's character gives to a restaurant early on is something that would probably get a standing ovation today.";

Those used seemed hardly past puberty and had no idea how to play sexually jaded at all.Overall I prefer Reardon to Dogfight as a River Phoenix vehicle and a comparison of the boxoffice take shows many others did too.See it if only to see a still innocent River Phoenix playing a young man far removed from himself.".

There is no lesson learned no great friendships explored no amazing love story here. Jimmy doesn't seem to really care about anyone but himself. You get the idea  due to the narration that jimmy does indeed become a writer...but that's not explored either. His writing is actually just a side note in the story . It's almost as if somewhere in there a good story existed but they don't finish telling it or something. It's really just a movie about a selfish person surrounded by selfish people...who is really nave about life and has no clue what he wants to do other than girls of course.

His tomboy niece Spurs O'Brien has a teenage crush on the handsome Cavalry lieutenant David Garth.

Therefore Dr. Julia Garth's arrival in town and her medical practice ruffles many feathers not the least some of the more conservative townsfolk's. Dr. Rourke O'Brien is no exception.

Also there is another doctor played by Dana Andrews who isn't crazy about the new competition. Dana's tomboyish daughter Lois Smith does like the new doctor however and Greer starts teaching Lois some feminine ways.Garson with a new knowledge of medical advances pretty much shows up Andrews in many ways. But Dana's a bit confused here between jealousy and a little desire. Truth be told he behaves until almost the end of the film like a bit of a lout.Mitchell however is a real bad one somebody whom the army failed to discipline. His actions cause a crisis of conscience for Garson even with all the good work she's done.Greer does look a little lost in the wide open west but then again her part does call for her to be a fish out of water. Strange Lady In Town which seems to have anticipated Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman is a nice tale and there's a nice little bit performance by Nick Adams as Billy The Kid.I think western fans and Garson fans will approve.".

The young lady is GREAT!Wish I had been able to see more of her. The theme song is a fine one. Frankie Lane never acquired the acclaim he should have had either. However it was evidently a forgettable tune but one I know by heart. Dana Andrews is a doctor soured on life since the death of his wife. He is raising a daughter while being the only M.D. in a small village in the old west. Into town drives Greer Garson. A brilliant woman who has studied medicine in Europe and has several new techniques to try to update the staid older doctor. Sparks fly and so do the tempers.".

	schema:reviewBody "There are few actresses of the caliber of Greer Garson and it's difficult to believe that she only made a couple of dozen pictures. This was her first after leaving MGM and it was 5 years before her next film in which she played Eleanor Roosevelt. This was not one of her best films but she's that rare actor that one almost always marvels at her performance even when the script is not the best.That's not to say that this is a bad film. It's pretty decent. Her costar is Dana Andrews a fine actor. His role here is not very positive  he's playing a fellow doctor Garson a female doctor who doesn't believe in female doctors and thinks women belong under a man's thumb. Of course they fall in love though Andrews' role was overdone...I'd blame the director...and his constant switch between love and anger is rather tedious. Along the way there are a number of subplots Garson's brother is a raffish soldier in love with Andrew's daughter...and eventually he's a bank robber who gets shot. Oh yes and there's a guest appearance so to speak by Billy The Kid played by Nick Adams.The daughter of Andrews is played by Lois Smith who mellowed nicely in her later years and is pretty decent here also. Cameron Mitchell plays her romantic interest  solider and I have little more use for him here than I do in most any other film he appears in. Walter Hampden is good as the old priest. The remaining cast do their jobs but little more.Ironically the film begins on a dusty wagon road into Santa Fe and although actually filmed in Arizona the area does look a lot like the land around the Forked Lightning Ranch where Greer Garson eventually lived and retired with her third husband in 1967...on the way to Santa Fe.This is hardly a classic western or even a classic Greer Garson film. But it's pretty good. And Garson is as beautiful and sassy and that intriguing blend of refined and spicy that made her so alluring.It's well worth watching though probably only once.".

I might even watch it again someday. However all of the positive elements failed to add up to equal the caliber of film both of these actors had made many times before. Also Dana Andrews looked a bit too young for Garson as he often did with a costar who wasn't at least 5 years younger or more. He had a young face even for a man with a drinking problem. I adore both of these actors but this might have been a good time to match Garson with Pidgeon one more time. You can hardly beat that teaming They could have added some humor and it might have turned out to be more than worth a watch for me. Also I chalk it off to poor writing Cameron Mitchell's usual overacting and not much romantic tension between the leads bad casting there as I really like each actor separately.If you are a fan of these actors or westerns or bored and prefer classics to other films then I recommend watching it purely on the fact that it is beautifully shot and Greer Garson with her gentle demeanor and lovely beauty and voice can make even a fairly bad picture better".

Why didn't they just say she was from England...now THAT would have made sense! And to make it worse her brother in the film is played by Cameron Mitchellwho is NOTHING like Greer...NOTHING.The film is set in Santa Fe during the late 19th century. It begins with a plucky female doctor Garson arriving there not only to see her nogood brother but also to live there. However there already is one doctor in town Dana Andrews and he's a sexist who insists that women aren't cut out for 'man's work'. Not surprisingly the pair eventually fall in love. However it's the stuff in the middle that makes the film interesting...but I'll let you see that for yourself.Strange Lady in Town is a great example of a decent film despite insane casting decisions. While the film is far from a classic as it's awfully predictable in some ways it never was dull and is worth seeing. Plus while miscast Garson tried her best and Andrews was as always excellent.By the way the film shows an insane clich.

To keep it short the 137 version is great and the 190 min version sucks.The TV version was split up to fill 2 evenings. For that they added about an hour of additional material not seen in the original version. While some of it is quite good like the prologue which went a little bit deeper into the Dune universe Butlers Djihad but most of it just destroys the atmosphere and the flow of the movie. On the technical side there is to note that the whole movie was PanScanned which never is a good idea. Compared to the original version the quality really blows.Now to the good oneThe movie is pretty much faithful to the book. There are things that were cut out from the book or it shows stuff that wasn't there but what you see is CLEARLY Herbert's book which I thought is nearly impossible to translate into a good movie. It translates the feel of the book very well to the screen.The most notable differences is that in the book Paul is at the age of 15 at least at the beginning while McLachlan more looks like 20 but I can live with that. The rest are minor things like these sound modules and some differences in continuity the navigators needing the spice to well... navigate is revealed at the beginning.The all actors give a solid performances. Notable are Kenneth McMillan Baron Harkonnen Patrick Captain Picard Steward Gurney Halleck and Sting as Feyd Rautha which really add to the movie.The special effects range from crappy to good. The movie shines where it 's most important namely the sand worms which look fairly convincing. Personally I prefer well done miniature shots over those Episode 12 CGI effects which make especially environments look like plastic.I think everybody who calls himself a ScienceFiction fan should have seen this movie which is a jewel under all those mediocre films that were spawned by Star Wars at that time. All the fans of the book should see it as what it is A movie based on Dune. If you want the book word by word don't watch the movie and read the book again.".

Of course there are some elements which are simply not explained and are therefore very confusing but somehow this seems to be a thing Lynch tends to do in every of his movies so what? I like some simple scenes like the opening monologue a whole lot. I LOVE the music which played in my mind all the time while I read the book and I think the characters are very strong and for example Letho Atreides sometimes full of tragedy.The part I like the most though is the wormpart. I think the special effects are not always brilliant but seeing the scenes with the worms I am really awestruck because they are so impressing.All in all I think this is one of the more underrated movies in Science Fiction history. It may be because the director himself was not happy with it or because fans expected too much from a simple two hour movie. I always enjoy watching this film and listening to the soundtrack.

Not being familiar with the book you're left with a disjointed tapestry of weird costumes and special effects some of them impressive but if you are and don't have to burden yourself with following the constantly clumsy explanation of the multifaceted Dune universe you can enjoy this as illustration of a few core ideas. Herbert's novel was the product of strange and powerful times. The US public was experiencing the Civil Rights upheaval its shortlived infatuation with Islam and meditation and the same year as the book came out LSD had spilled out of some topsecret government labs into the streets and youth culture of San Francisco. The first satellite images of Earth had just been published. The Black Panthers had entered the vernacular. So all the stuff about prescient visions mentats and mastering mind herbally expanded consciousness as the tool to the navigation and 'folding' of space Herbert wrote with one eye on the Jordan Belson Beatles and Maharishi crowd  the generation between noir and Lucas that for a brief time projected truths into constructed cosmologies.Herbert was more erudite than most. But he was caught under the same spell  the expectation of a noble jihad of the people and wise lamas from the East coming to teach 'the way'. And you can tell that he was exposed to Eastern thought through Jungians by his laboriously constructed mythology and now trite focus on a Chosen One's journey.Lynch was a late bloomer in that scene. To my knowledge he fell in with what was being marketed as 'transcendental meditation' in his AFI years during filming of Eraserhead. I don't know what they practice behind closed doors  my interest lies with the Chinese model and they seem cultish to me. But there's no doubt to me that he passed on the Lucas gig thinking he was going to work on a vision of some power.The film outright fails because the scope of the book is too big to think that Hobbit is being stretched into a trilogy these days and because he lacked the right collaborators and probably the predisposition to make an 'action' Dune.Now Jodorowsky's Dune would have been something to see probably as cumbersome about spirituality but much more organic. But it's worth noting a few interesting things about this in context of how Lynch would expand in later years. He zeroes in on the transcendental experience of 'awakening the sleeper'. He does so in an obvious manner. Rambaldi's spiceworms as blossoming desert flowers top his visual meditation. And that all of Herbert's pomp and mythological noise works against him submerging the idea.Keep in mind the Chinese notion  from the Tao Te Ching  that the 'soft beats the hard' stressed twice in the film even though no one actually fights in the Chinese style. Discard everything that is hard from the crass Harkonnen to the acting style mentat Dourif! to the sophomoric rousing of Fremen rebellion laser battles and final redemption.The one part that is soft is at House Atreides the preparation for Dune. What is there? Familiar dynamics  it is soap opera if you take out the costumes. Premonitions of murder and telepathic wiring with a fabric behind reason. A woman with her box of illusory sensations. A space flight through the doors of perception. It's heady. None of it really works because Herbert's synchretic universe is not one of internal martial arts what we see matters. But does any of it remind you of a David Lynch film you know?".

	schema:reviewBody "There are two groups of people who write at IMDb the pessimists and the optimists. The pessimists love to complain about something or other in a film. The optimists try and find something good. DUNE probably ranks as one of those that feels like it's going to be good but leaves a confusing lackluster feeling in its wake. In an attempt to be optimistic I will try focusing ONLY on the good parts. This might be tough.I will give David Lynch credit indeed as Frank Herbert did when he saw this for trying to take an enormous amalgamation of things and ideas from the novel and trying to turn them into a movie. Lynch's visual style is very raw here and everything in the production design seems to be under his spell.The sets costumes cinematography and choice of cast is excellent. All of them lend a flavor of difference that transcends whatever confusion is on the screen. On the side note I was sick of hearing Kyle MacLachlan repeating himself over and over The creature designs by Carlo Rambaldi are very Lynchien even though we rarely get to see them.Overall a scifi epic that requires a lethargic butt an open mind and a copy of Frank Herbert's novel to enjoy. Still it is far superior to the TV miniseries of late I know saying that is blasphemy to some. I refuse to rate this with stars or anything else.".

The optimists try and find something good. DUNE probably ranks as one of those that feels like it's going to be good but leaves a confusing lackluster feeling in its wake. In an attempt to be optimistic I will try focusing ONLY on the good parts. This might be tough.I will give David Lynch credit indeed as Frank Herbert did when he saw this for trying to take an enormous amalgamation of things and ideas from the novel and trying to turn them into a movie.

	schema:headline " Dune's Devil in David's Details";
	schema:reviewBody "My review covers both versions of Dune the 2 hour release and the extended 3 hour Smithee version aired on television. The first cut of the film was over four hours long but there was never any intention to release this and Lynch himself shot scenes which consolidated the final product into a more manageable length.Allen Smithee a protest pseudonym adopted by Lynch when he disassociated himself with the 3 hour version of this film is also alluded to in Lynch's latest film  Inland Empire. A portion of a film studio in Inland Empire is Smithee's Room  a metaphorical insight into Lynch's feelings about Dune and studiocontrolled filmmaking in general.Given the tremendous investment made by the studio Lynch's general distaste for the final product the repetitive clich soundtrack and the occasionally bizarre use of voiceover narrative in the TV version it seems more a DeLaurentis film than a Lynch film. Although I am very interested in Lynch's films and other projects I am evaluating this solely from my own perspective. Despite the great director's poor opinion of this film I enjoyed it and it is one of my favorite scifi films. Frank Herbert author of the novel upon which it is based approved the theatrical version but he had the benefit of knowing what he was going to see. If you haven't read the book these films can be somewhat difficult to understand. And if you come to the experience expecting something like Star Wars you should probably find something else to do.The soundtrack is repetitive and only interesting the first time you hear the film's major theme the Eno composition. The use of rock orchestration simply does not work in this film. Happily Lynch learned from the experience and used rock instrumentation beautifully in later films especially Wild at Heart and Lost Highway. The camera work is generally less inspired than the rest of Lynch's portfolio. There are occasional visually striking scenes which will remind you of the film's origin but there are too many static shots  especially during the action scenes. The soundtrack is easy to explain  like the inclusion of Sting in the cast  this is a marketing move by the production company not a creative choice of the director. The camera work is much less easily explained. Perhaps Lynch was asked to avoid doing anything surreal or bizarre with this film sort of like asking Groucho Marx to avoid being funny or the studio was trying to appeal to fans of Star Wars by simplifying and sterilizing its story.The recently released special edition DVD reveals some very interesting aspects of the production. Lynch's influence not surprisingly is best explored in the short documentary concerning the film's design. As an artist Lynch spent a great deal of time and energy envisioning the material culture  both historical and modern  of each culture depicted in the film helping to create a consistent and unique characterization for each. This spilled over quite naturally into costume design. The sets and costumes used in this film are really spectacular. The special effects often derided by contemporary viewers required a great deal more effort that the synthetic art of today's computerized extravaganzas and the documentary concerning their production on the DVD is also appropriately respectful.What you will see is an intense visualization of several fully realized alien cultures whose art architecture and general heritage are as well realized if not more so than in Herbert's epic novel. To fully appreciate this don't just check out the extras on the DVD turn down the sound and just watch the sets costumes and effects move through each scenes. There is as with Lynch's entire portfolio a great deal to be seen. And the acting and direction are fine throughout the film.The longer version fleshes out the stories themes and intricate subplots of Herbert's book more thoroughly and maintains a much steadier pace than the cinematic release. Even so both films to some extent suffer from too much story overwhelming visualization and a unLynchian frenetic pace. The later TV miniseries by the sci fi channel does a better job of telling the story in its entirety but runs about 246 minutes and does not compare to the original in terms of design. Lynch's cinematic release by contrast rushes through components of the book and often feels inconsistent in pace.PLOT Dune is the story of Paul Muad'ib Atreides the son of Duke Leto Atreides the Just and his Bene Jesserat concubine Lady Jessica. Combining aspects of fantasy scifi and anthropology the story follows young Paul through a series of tragedies which find him seeking redemption for an entire galaxy by leading an adoptive tribal culture to a revolutionary cleansing of the malignant imperial system from which he sprung. The plot is exceedingly complex  in both Lynch versions of the film much is left out of Herbert's original work. Subplots abound but true to form Lynch avoids shortcuts as much as possible and attempts to show his audience what is going on rather than resorting to a great deal of voiceover narrative in the theatrical release. The TV version however attempts to provide even more detail and uses voiceover to patch up the areas glossed over by Lynch's script.SUMMARY If you're a Lynch fan and not a big Herbert fan or you don't have a great deal of patience see the cinematic release. It is the class of the lot.If you haven't read the book or you are a Herbert purist who will accept only what was written choose the SciFi Channel version review forthcoming soon  but be forewarned  it is very long.If you want something that compromises between story and cinematic artistry go for the TV version. The weakest link but still OK.".

I do enjoy the movie however I can see that it would be difficult to follow without having read the book. I read that David Lynch cut about an hour from the movie's length that hour probably would've been better left in to help move the story a little more smoothly. It didn't stay true to the book completely but the book is so detailed that I don't see how any movie could really capture it totally. At any rate the movie is an enjoyable experience if a little choppy but seeing as how it was approved by Frank Herbert himself that is unimportant. All in all I give this movie a seven on a scale of one to ten.".

	onyx:emotionText "I've been a fan of the Dune series since I was twelve and I first saw the movie about that time. I do enjoy the movie however I can see that it would be difficult to follow without having read the book. I read that David Lynch cut about an hour from the movie's length that hour probably would've been better left in to help move the story a little more smoothly. It didn't stay true to the book completely but the book is so detailed that I don't see how any movie could really capture it totally. At any rate the movie is an enjoyable experience if a little choppy but seeing as how it was approved by Frank Herbert himself that is unimportant. All in all I give this movie a seven on a scale of one to ten.";

No. The movie is pretty good actually. But the problem with it is that you can't tell the whole Dunestory in just one movie it should have been a two or even threepiece like LOTR. People completely unfamiliar with the Dunestory and world will ask themselves after viewing it 'what the hell was that all about?' while I myself say 'that was quite nice actually'. The budget was no less than 40 million dollars huge huge for 1984. And it shows the costumes ships decors and wormfx are great. If it would be made in this year it would probably be brilliant. In 1984 it was a bit limited because of technological limits not creative ones.Yes I liked it and once more added a new dimension of understanding for me to the story of Dune. The spice the houses the Fremen the worms everything is a bit clearer now. 7 out of 10 just good.".

	schema:reviewBody "For those of you who have perhaps read Frank Herbert's original Dune and are considering viewing this movie here's some advice don't.  Swish orange juice toothpaste and clam chowder in your mouth you'll get the same effect.Herbert wrote an epic masterpiece that should be regarded as the Hamlet of science fiction actually it is very vaguely adapted from Hamlet.  David Lynch scripted and directed a butchery of this novel.  He made so many mistakes it is impossible to cover them all.  Here's a general idea the novel is summarized not adapted.  The movie contains about half of the elements involved in the story and watching it makes you feel like you're falling asleep and missing half the plot.  Everybody in the story has an agenda but you get to see only half of these agendas and are left to imagine the others.  Character development was mediocre and paled in comparison to the rich depth given in the novel.  The writers obviously did not understand Herbert's technologies because the movie displayed loads of horse dung where there should have been intricacies that would say Star Wars eat your heart out.  There was poor acting from everybody but Jurgen Prochnow as Leto Patrick Stewart as Halleck and Sting as Rautha.  And finally the special effects of the time simply weren't up to snuff for Herbert's vision.  From the blue eyes to the force fields everything looked horribly cheesy.  If the folks had waited a decade or maybe used something better than a thirdgrader's sketch pad then they would have had stunning visual effects.Overall what we are left with here is a definitive flop.  I can only hope that the TV miniseries version that aired last year did a better job.  On a scale of 1 to 10 this movie is somewhere around absolute zero 273.15 FYI.".

	schema:headline " Unrelentingly Awful";
	schema:reviewBody "When this film was released in 1984 I had some misgivings as putting Frank Herbert's epic novel on to the big screen was always going to rank with the labours of Hercules. So I went to see it and came away convinced that I has just seen the worst bigbudget film of all time. Its crippling handicap was the quality of the screen writing. As I watched it I tried to relate the portrayed characters to their counterparts in the book and found that I could not recognise a single one. I wondered if David Lynch had actually read the book before he wrote the screenplay. The acting was dreadful and the dialogue was worse. I have seen most of the cast in other films where they were actually permitted to act which is just as well or I would have grown up thinking that they were all overblown secondrate hams. The biggest piece of miscasting was to have Patrick Stewart play Gurney Halleck  he deserved much better than that and I hope he didn't spend too long regretting accepting this role. Choosing another at random Everitt McGill as Stilgar was less than memorable not being allowed to act but simply progressing from one sonorous pronouncement to the next.The sets were brilliant  I have no quarrel with that part of the film  but imaginative backdrops alone cannot bolster a production where the quality of the script and acting  or rather the direction  fell so dismally short of any acceptable standard.The costumes were also very well done with one notable and very important exception Lynch clearly forgot most of what he had read in the book when he approved the final design of the Fremen stillsuits.On occasion over the intervening twentyodd years when I have thought about this unrelentingly awful film it has been more in regret than anger. Despite this I never really gave up on it and four months ago when I found the threehour extended version at a price that made it worth the effort I bought it in the hope that some extra added footage might give the wretched thing some credibility.It was a forlorn hope. This extended version is an even bigger train wreck than the original theatrical release and was clearly reworked for television  it is easy to spot the blanks for the commercial break cues. The editing is quite incompetent and added scenes that have no context in the story line at the place where they were inserted  for example one repeated scene showed the same Harkonnen ship approaching the landing field at Arrakeen. Another piece of sloppy editing early in the film had Reverend Mother Helen Gaius Mohaim being transported to Caladan the home world of House Atriedes by the same two Harkonnen pilots that took Jessica and Paul into the deep desert on Dune after the Harkonnen attack.There was one particular poignant part of the novel that both versions of the film left hanging and which deserved to be included. That was the death of Thufir Hawat at the end after the Imperial forces had surrendered to Duke Paul Atreides. In the film this lifelong servant of House Atreides was left standing among the Imperial captives gazing vacantly at the ceiling suffering from the terminal effects of the residual poison that the Harkonnens had infected him with after they captured him on Dune and subverted him to their own service. In the book however the dying Hawat was given a poisoned needle by Emperor Shaddam and Reverend Mother Mohaiam and ordered to assassinate Paul this 'upstart Duke' when he stood before him. Hawat disobeyed and as he he stood before Paul he turned to the Emperor in a magnificent gesture holding out his hand with the needle in its palm and said See Majesty? See your traitor's needle? Did you think that I who've given my life to service to the Atreides would give them any less now? Then he collapsed and died in his Duke's arms.I have read that David Lynch wanted nothing to do with the extended version and he was right to disown it. Even so with the original release there was so much that he could have done to turn Frank Herbert's novel into something memorable. Instead he made an abomination that deserves to dumped into the same rubbish can as that dreadful Starship Troopers.".

Lynch got so many things right but in the end the shortcomings of trying to squeeze an epic story into a little over 2 hours was simply too daunting a challenge.  Besides I'm sure many went into the theatre expecting a film in the vein of STAR WARS.  DUNE is not a story with which one can delve into brainless.  It does require thought for it's inaccurate to portray it as anything less than a thinking person's story.  It's not space battles lasergun shootouts funny aliens etc. There's nothing wrong with those things it's just not what DUNE is about.  It touches on everything from politics religion ecology the true power of the human mind and will when fully realized God etc. Some heady stuff.  So imagine trying to fit all that in a movie.  Lynch got the feel the imagery down but wasn't able to cohesively bring the story around wo really making it a Cliff Notes version of the story. You get the main gist but don't get the full story the themes etc.  So in the end it does disappoint because you're left  wondering what may have been had the movie conventions of that time  allowed for a 2 or even 3 movie epic.  Oh wait STAR WARS did that.  I guess DUNE wasn't viewed as bankable enough to make such an investment.Anyway I still like the film a lot.  The visual realization by Lynch makes it a classic in my book too bad it couldn't be matched by an equally strong script. I wonder if Peter Jackson would be willing to tackle another 3 film epic?

Some of the time they're flat out describing what we can already see happening on screen.The less said about the special effects the better. In 1984 they should have been able to do a lot better.So does it have any redeeming features? The art deco inspired sets are pretty cool. The film certainly looks interesting and unique.

That said the film's other elements are awful.The plot is an incoherent mess. I had no idea what was going on. After the first thirty minutes I really didn't care what was going on. Character and place names confuse and irritate they are like something from out of a witch's dictionary. The characters are uninteresting and I could not identify with any of them. They have no sense of humor and always seem to be in a bad mood. Whatever happened to antidepressants?. The dialogue is heavy duty melodramatic mumbo jumbo. The voiceover technique is overused and is therefore irritating. The casting is poor. Kyle MacLachlan is not convincing in the role he plays because he lacks charisma. The worms have no personality. The special effects are mediocre at best. And the film is full of cheap cinematic gimmicks like blue eyeballs futuristic technogadgets and a floating fat man.It is a dreadfully pretentious and ponderous film that takes itself way too seriously. Even Ed Wood's Plan 9 From Outer Space has some entertainment value derived from its technical crudeness. But apart from portions of the soundtrack Dune has no entertainment value of any kind. The film is cold and clammy. It has all the charm of a dead fish.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw Dune when it first came out in 1984 and admittedly have had a lot of time to reflect on the failings of this movie.Most of this film's woes can be summed up in one word ... screenplay.But first why I liked it. Set and costume design. In one word sumptuous. From the neo baroque Emperor's palace to the Fremen Stillgar's sietch to the'metropolistic' Harkonnen homeworld of Giedi Prime.The costumes were indulgently impressive eg the fetishistic leather of the Harkonnens the bizarre plastic outfits of the Emperor's Sardukar the Elizabethan gowns of the Princess Irulan. Great efforts were made to make the various environments well worn and dirty and much of the technology appears anachronistic... of 'technology as archeology' which all fits perfectly within the Frank Herbert vision.Characters. For some reason most popular SciFi movies involve characters that have little to define them from people of today apart from latex masks and clothing. Under David Lynch's direction the peoples of the Dune worlds are human enough to relate to and 'alien' enough to cause wonder. And lets not forget the Stage Three Guild Navigator ... this was the most original conceptions of a character as you are likely ever to see. Scenes like this give you the courage to sit through the more unpleasant aspects of the movie. The customs of the Fremen as defined by Frank Herbert are for the most part faithfully rendered although being a serial Dune reader I would have liked the movie to linger more on these aspects of the Dune world.Acting. For the most part good. David Lynch directing his favorites Jack Nance Kyle MacLachlan and Everet McGill cant really go wrong.I particularly liked Linda Hunt hamming it up as Shadout Mapes ...the housssse keeeper... Dean Stockwell whilst an accomplished actor appeared a little wooden but is not a problem really when compared to the ridiculous overacting of Jose Ferrer. What on earth was he thinking? And of course there was Kenneth McMillan. The Baron could have been no one else.But ...I am a huge David Lynch fan ... but .... what happened? His efforts to make the vast worlds and concepts of Dune more edible for mainstream audiences while necessary did not properly respect the source material.In an effort to avoid the complexities of describing the 'weirding way' properly termed 'prana  bindu' a kind of super martial art form we are left with ... weirding modules ??!!!? ... what the hell? And to keep them in that poorly locked cupboard in the training room downstairs was just asking for trouble.And after all that spiel about crushing your enemy's nerves exploding their organs boiling their bottoms etc ... the Fremen simply go about making those silly sounds which cause little firepots to go off in the sand the Emperors 'terror troops' obligingly falling over.It's easy to be dismissive when speaking from a time that brought us action and fight sequences like those in the Matrix or LOTR. However I felt that the scale was far to small to be convincing this was the fight for the fate of the known universe's economic prosperity! Individual fight scenes were obvious and telegraphed and slow and just plain boring. The final showdown between Paul the universe's super being actually he's not but thats another storyand Feyd Rautha was one of Cinema's greatest anticlimaxes.I mean he's the leader of a race of people whose woman and children routinely best the Sardukar and has unimaginable mind powers all the powers of the Bene Gesserit and moreand still he is almost defeated by the Baron's nephew after a bit of taunting about his girlfriend.Another incomprehensible departure from the novel was the addition of 'heart plugs'. Apart from the constant fear of getting it caught on something you'd really have to wonder why the Baron chose to have one himself. That's just silly and as it turned out fatal.A lot of the psychedelic special effects were pretty crappy even for 1984. What's with the folding space scene which is simply done by the Guild navigator spitting the departure and destination planets out of his mouth and then ... wait for it ... flying between them? Of course scenes like the sandworm swallowing the spice harvester still cause wonder ... it's more that the conception of those less tangible aspects like folding space or the Sayadina taking the water of life etc really did not convince me even way back in 1984.I also could not believe that Lynch succumbed to the temptation of tying the whole thing up with a rain storm. In one fell swoop he undermines the logic of the entire film. The collecting of water in thousands of Sietches across Dune was meant to be part of a trans generational plan to terraform the planet. It's meant to be science  the movie simply has it happen by magic for he is the Kwisatz Haderach. Given that water is poisonous to the Sandworms and that Spice is produced as part of their life cycle Paul really is not being much of a help. His Jihad is set to destroy the Universe.This Movie if produced today under the right direction and a totally new screenplay could be the most amazing thing. If it were possible to create a hybrid director although I would avoid contracting the Bene Gesserit for the breeding program of David Linchfor his quirky darkly comic interpretation and dare I say Peter Jackson for his sincere respect for the source material attention to detail and childlike wonder that he evokes as he lingers over landscapes people and customs it would do the justice to Frank Herbert's vision which has as yet wether by movie extended DVD or miniseriesremained unfulfilled.6 12 out of 10  really.".

Added to this it is a rather good thriller with plenty of plot twists and wrong turns.This film perhaps because it isn't one of Chabrol's best makes clear to me why he is such a talent. To clarify this I will point out that no other French director new wave or otherwise interests me at all and I really think I only have a peripheral interest in film.

	schema:headline " More twists in the tale than usual and another excellent film from the great Claude Chabrol!";
	schema:reviewBody "Innocents with Dirty Hands appears to have something of a poor reputation among it's viewers and that made me go into it expecting something a bit subpar from the great French director so you can imagine my delight when I found that there's very little wrong with this twisted thriller and while it's not quite up there with the best of Claude Chabrol films such as This Man Must Die The Butcher and The Breach it's a thriller that keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat for the duration of the film and provides plenty of shocks and twists along the way! The film is unlike some of Chabrol's other films in that the plot is rather simple and the film focuses on a couple with the surname Wormser. Louis Wormser is 18 years senior to his wife Julie and can no longer have sex after suffering a heart attack. When Julie meets young stud Jeff Marle the two plot to kill Louis and hatch a plan to dispatch him and deflect suspicion from themselves. However things go awry immediately after the murder when Julie finds herself alone and under suspicion.The main influence for this film would seem to be The Postman Always Rings Twice as the two plots share a lot in common. Innocents with Dirty Hands does get criticised for being a bit too long and this is a bit of a problem. The story has plenty to it and is constantly interesting thanks to the numerous twists in the second half but it could have benefited from being a bit more streamline as the way it pans out does remove some of the suspense. However this is hardly enough to condemn the film. The first hour building up the initial twist is absolutely superb and Chabrol keeps the tension bubbling nicely. After the initial twist the film changes somewhat and the focus is more on surprising the audience but despite this change in pace the film still flows well. The film is bolstered by two excellent performances from the leads the beautiful Romy Schneider is superb as the young wife while Rod Steiger is thoroughly convincing in the opposite role. The film works on a number of levels it's entertaining thrilling and also funny in places and while it's filmed with Chabrol's familiar verve and focuses on the marital relationship  it's also a change of pace for him. Overall this is well worth seeing and I'm sure that anyone who enjoys Chabrol's films will find a lot to like in this one.".

	schema:reviewBody "The films of Claude Chabrol are more than those of any other director highly unnerving.  I don't just mean in subject matter which are generally taken from pulp fiction.  This plot is Double Indemnity as if written by Nabokov.  The beautiful Julie is married to overweight rich impotent drunk selfloathing Louis Wormser and plots with her young hack writer lover Jeff Marle to kill her husband.  Things generally go to plan but Jeff panics and lies low in Italy sending Julie letters while she has to face the insinuating investigations of two detectives.For a director of his intellectual reach Chabrol shows a strange affinity for GoldenAge style mystery stories.  Unlike the fiction of Pynchon and Borges or the films of Bertolucci and Antonioni he has no interest in formally deconstructing the mystery story subverting its narratives ironising its principle characters obviously undermining its tenets although his double act of Epicurean detectives teasing out the crime like cross word puzzles over dinner making lecherous jokes and misogynistic comments unbelievably hitting on solutions yet completely missing the point are a comic disturbing joy as are the upturned faces of the Law searing Julie at the climax.  It is perfectly possible to watch INNOCENTS as a straight thriller with a recognisable crime investigation and solution and plenty of excellent twists and turns.Even on this conventional level the film is unnerving.  The abruptness of the decision to murder.  The shocking callous act of murder itself.  The brutal climactic rape.  But Chabrol's real nagging is in his wholehearted artifice.  Many directors from Chabrol heroes Lang Welles and Hitchcock to Von Sternberg Sirk and Ophuls are artificial but they create convincingly hermetic worlds which are totally artificial and plausible on their own terms.  Chabrol's is different.Although not as breathtakingly formal as LA DECADE PRODIGEUSE INNOCENTS is highly artificial from the stylised acting the unrealistic dialogue dissonant score and stunningly contrived plot to the breathtakingly intrusive camera movements and alienating shifts in point of view and especially the setting the futuristicmodernist architecture which swallows up its characters the decor that moves and closes in on them. With Chabrol however this artifice is not selfsufficient.  It coexists jarringly with a sublime feeling for nature for the French countryside the shadows cast by windblown trees the wide green fields the parched roads.  The two realms refuse to merge and this disjunction of registers moves the film away from mystery to something much more metaphysical.An interesting question that arises from this film is whether it is a film about misogyny or a misogynistic film.  We are shown quite clearly how a female protagonist who is in almost every frame of the film who seems to be in control and driving the plot is completely betrayed by men  husbands lovers the law  an object of contempt whose desires are made seem guilty whose grasping for love in a chilling loveless evnironment and marriage are reduced to petty motives.  Maybe they are  she does collude in murder and theft.  She is often featured in scenes present but silent as men decide her fate.  The director further is obviously a man colluding in this too filming her pain and humiliation witholding from her all the information.  Yet despite this the film is very sympathetic to Julie its visuals often seeming to arise from her emotions.However I don't think the film is really a postfeminist 70s comment on the still marginal and oppressed role of women in French society.  Before Chabrol became a filmmaking genius he was one of the brilliant critics of Cahiers du Cinema cowriting a book on the religious underpinnings of Hitchcock's thrillers.  In one sense INNOCENTS a religiously loaded title can be seen as an allegory in the Bresson tradition of the spiritual progress of a woman a three part processo of Sin Suffering and Redemption. The final image when Julie rises in the darkness stripped of material wealth defining environment and human companionship and walks towards a flickering light is compellingly enigmatic  possibly indicating suicide but such is the theorematic godlike structure of the film the sly allusive imagery I prefer to think of it as Julie existentially completing her spiritual journey.  In any case an endlessly rich masterpiece.".

I am very happy that Chabrol has chosen her character as the central one for now we can admire gracious Scheider in almost every scene. I have the impression the camera man was in love with her and who can blame him. Romy even looks amazing in the scene where she is putting curlers in her hair. She is the perfect cast for this complicated Femme Fatale role.Although mainly the mediteranean filming locations in combination with the outstanding weather are to be credited for providing this Film Noir with a deceptively pleasant yellow warm glow it is Romy Scheider's radiance and talent that make Les Innocents aux Mains Sales a joy to watch.".

There's a murder scene using some sort of club that falls completely flat in dramatic terms. There are simply too many twists and turns for a simple adultery story to bear so we are left to admire the gracefulness of Schneider's performance. She is a trophy wife who must start to make decisions on her own in the absence of her husband and her lover she must also learn to lie convincingly to suspicious detectives. The eroticism of the lovemaking on the livingroom carpet taunting her frustrated husband is well evoked.The interrogation before the judge is the one scene that really holds up dramatically. The impatient judge who finds the beautiful woman suspect very desirable the eager lawyer who smells a way out for his clientfabulous acting by Jean Rochefortand the woman herself who hardly says a word while the two men argue over her fate.

	schema:reviewBody "First as another reviewer pointed out the two leads Romy Schneider and Rod Steiger do their parts in English and the rest of the cast are speaking Frenchmaking it irrelevant whether or not you watch the Frenchdubbed or Englishdubbed version. However and this is odd you probably should NOT watch the film with captioning as the subtitles are inferior to both dubbed versions! I know this makes no sense but often the subtitles were inaccurate or didn't convey the message as well as the actors originally spoke! I actually watched about half the film in French and then watched the other half in English. But boy were those subtitles annoyingeven getting little details wrong.As for the film itself through the first half of the film it all seems pretty familiarespecially for a tale directed by Claude Chabrol. He made a career out of films about infidelity and murder. However midway through the film the film has many excellent twists and turns. BUT I CANNOT REALLY TALK ABOUT THEM WITHOUT WRITING A FEW SPOILERS SO BE ADVISED!!! Romy and boytoy Jeff begin a torrid affair as the husband Steiger drinks himself to oblivion. Eventually the lovers come up with a plan to murder Steiger and live off his fortune. Unfortunately for the lovers the plan goes awry but it isn't certain exactly what happenedall we know is Romy is now being blamed for possibly killing BOTH men as there isn't much trace of them.When Steiger returns later and is indeed alive this created a wonderful opportunity for the film as Romy suddenly found that her formerly impotent husband is very potent indeed and their dead relationship is rejuvenated. This would have been a wonderful point to end the story. In essence the woman's lover is killed by the impotent man who in doing this regains his own power and sexualitya somewhat kinky but fascinating idea. Unfortunately while this was where the film was going the movie had an additional 30 minutes of plot twists that did a lot to confuse everything and make the story much more difficult to believe. It's a great example of a film that didn't know when to stop. Without the next 30 minutes I'd have scored the movie an 8. With it the impact is greatly lessened. I strongly agree with the review that saw this film as needlessly complicateda problem common to many of Chabrol's films.Finally a note to parents that this isn't a great film for kids due to its sexual nature and nudity. Miss Schneider at age 37 is quite lovely in her many nude scenesit's a real shame her life offscreen was so short and tragic.".

	onyx:emotionText "First as another reviewer pointed out the two leads Romy Schneider and Rod Steiger do their parts in English and the rest of the cast are speaking Frenchmaking it irrelevant whether or not you watch the Frenchdubbed or Englishdubbed version. However and this is odd you probably should NOT watch the film with captioning as the subtitles are inferior to both dubbed versions! I know this makes no sense but often the subtitles were inaccurate or didn't convey the message as well as the actors originally spoke! I actually watched about half the film in French and then watched the other half in English. But boy were those subtitles annoyingeven getting little details wrong.As for the film itself through the first half of the film it all seems pretty familiarespecially for a tale directed by Claude Chabrol. He made a career out of films about infidelity and murder. However midway through the film the film has many excellent twists and turns.

However there are also inexplicably weak actors such as Paolo Giusti one of my previous commentators has already stated this correctly which lead me to believe that Claude Chabrol really was not up to his great level in this film. Whatever it was something is definitely wrong the camera angles and shots the story how the plot is linked  you watch the film it sucks you in but leaves you with a strange feeling of unfilled expectations! Secondly what buggers me very much indeed is the horrible mixture of dubbed and nondubbed voices. I have had the chance of watching the French and English version on DVD and caught myself switching from one to the other for getting the respective voices in their original. Yes and another commentator here said rightly Rod Steiger spoke English of course. And lots of his acting power and prowess went into how he spoke! Unforgettable how at the beginning of the film he plays the impaired soontobebetrayed husband of a too beautiful wife. Romy Schneider spoke both languages in the English and the French version. The other French actors as the great Jean Rochefort in the memorable court room scene hilarious spoke French to great advantage. And Paolo Giusti is speaking I don't know what absolutely impossible to figure out he sound horrible in whatever version you listen to. You see it's a complete mixture. Very disturbing very unFrench. All cinephiles know the French cinema to excel in the art of direct sound recording and captivating the original actor's voices marvelously. Why on Earth did Claude Chabrol make such a mess here? Why not have chosen allFrench actors and make another one of his great films? This one isn't one even it it entertains you in a certain unfulfilled way.".

This time the colours tend more toward rich oil than the pastel water he invariably favours but maybe the rich stew of the plot dictated the palette. The basic premise is a mixture of The Postman Always Rings TwiceDouble Indemnity andor any of the ripoffs in which a young virile wife is saddled with an older andor sexually dormant husband finds a young stud and what begins as healthy lust graduates to 'let's murder rich husband and spend his money'. Chabrol merely uses this as a jumpingoff point and is soon introducing more twists than a hairpin bend on that very Riviera that forms the setting St Tropez. The strongest factor is Romy Schneider as the wife and Chabrol has had the good taste to include her in virtually every scene. Rod Steiger as the husband plays Rod Steiger but that isn't necessarily bad but the weakest link is definitely Poalo Giusti who has to be the most wooden actor since Laurence Harvey as the stud cum assassin and for good measure Hitchcock buff Chabrol has thrown in a comic couple who clearly had their genesis in Basil Radford and Naunton Wayne in Hitch's The Lady Vanishes but are now transformed into a Greek Chorus of cops. You may not want to see it again for a decade or so but it's diverting enough for a couple of hours.".

I'm in Japan at the moment and just picked up an old Japanese video release of it here from a secondhand store. Here's a shock  the version of the film available here has some significant DIFFERENCES from the North American in print. There are some minor scenes that were cut from the North American release  Keitel announcing a commercial break and shining his shoes which he tells Stanton are made of ostrich is a scene I sure don't recall in the N. American version or Romy Schneider telling Max von Sydow how she loves to see the moon come out during the day. But there's also a significant plot point that differs too  conveyed by a few brief scenes and lines that are NOT in the American version WARNING spoilers follow. I mean it HAS been years since the last time I saw it so maybe I've just forgotten the film but I really don't think so. KATHERINE IS NOT ACTUALLY DYING in the movie she has been deceived by the doctors and the TV crew. We think she really is sick all along but in fact she is being tricked with the plan of rescuing her later in the series. The doctors reveal this shortly after Keitel blinds himself  they have a conversation that goes like Do you think he should have been told that she's not really dying? It's the medicine she's been prescribed IT is making her sick. When Stanton calls the Mortenhoe residence and Mortenhoe tells Katherine that they're on the way von Sydow has lines about how it's all a mistake you're not really sick it was all a stunt  you just have to stop taking the medicine! So when Stanton and the TV crew and such are racing to Mortenhoe's in the helicopters they're coming in part to rescue Katherine and her decision to take all the pills and commit suicide to ruin them plays VERY DIFFERENTLY in this context. Maybe it was felt North American audiences couldn't handle it?If any of you can confirm that I'm not nuts here and that the film I've just described is quite DIFFERENT from the US version PLEASE email me. One easy way to test would be to check out the runtime on the video release back there  the original one from way back when I think on Embassy. The runtime is NOT 128 minutes the version I watched actually is.All told the international cut is slower meanders more  but is ultimately the superior version carrying Katherine's defiance out more fully. I recommend it if you can actually find it. If you're curious no it isn't in print here anymore.".

A strong cast portrays a simple if at times ponderous story dealing the acceptance of death and those out to prosper from it with Harvey Keitel putting in a passionate driving performance as the TV company's 'virtual camera' a point in the film which adds a certain element of fantasy to the whole proceedings along with vague decrepit industrial towns and eerie bays as the backdrop for the main characters to drift through. However despite strong performances all round the journey the film takes never seems to reach a definitive destination rather slows bogs down and then finally stops and despite keeping the viewer intrigued throughout never seems to deliver anything more than the inevitable.

This was haunting  especially since in this film she plays a woman who is dying and just wants to be left alone. Harvey Keitel plays a reporter working for a TV station who wants to up their ratings by filming raw drama. Harvey follows her befriends her and secretly films her on the run as she falls sicker and falls in love with Harvey. There are wonderful twists in the plot and technology ground breakers.  Harvey has a camera lens implanted in his eye but the side effect is that he can never sleep.  When I saw the Truman Show it reminded me of this film from so long ago whose treatment of the subject matter filming someone's life  who is unaware of the fact was such a new and exciting concept.

Though the print itself was old and worn the film blew me away with its futuristic storyline fantastic cast and phenomenal locations.  It captures Glasgow as it was in the late 70's just before a period of great changes in the landscape of the city.  Tavernier skillfully uses an environment that is full of eery imagery  graveyards cranes and an industrial landscape that is grinding to a halt. The film also depicts a society fascinated with death.  Harvey Keitel is excellent as the human camera that allows society the ultimate act of voyeurism  watching someone die on TV.   Awesome.

I have gone on to use it in my own Media Studies high school class for it is perhaps even a more relevant critique of a celebrity and reality obsessed screen culture today than it was when it was released in 1980. It also serves as a fine example of how the genre of science fiction need not rely on futuristic expensive locations and effects for it is incredibly locationdriven and the bleakness of the Scotland it was filmed in reflects its interior contemplations on the progress of humanity via technology. In these ways it reminds me of the recent Children of Men by Alfonso Cuaron.The idea of video cameras being implanted in someone's eyes is brilliant and full of narrative possibilities. And unavoidable for us it seems. The portrayal of the reality TV show producer as being callous and only interested in ratings  with his firm belief that everyoneviewers have a right to know pushes the story into the opposites If everything is of interest nothing is important says the dying woman in a society where there is no natural death.Sight as knowing and the eyes as technology opens up many theoretical discussions especially because of the Oedipallike scene where Roddy blinds himself for knowing too much.... for his shame in that knowing as if sight gives you knowledge. Yet as Hitchcock showed us again and again sight is unreliable. Reading in another user's comment that the original film's story had Katherine's death a falsity set up by the producers in order to set their show in motion made me gasp for that makes all of the film's meanings even more powerful and painful. Wow.This film may very well be the most memorable film I have ever seen and yes I agree with all the other commentwriters that it should indeed be brought into the light of day WITHOUT remaking it!!!!!".

In the world of Deathwatch the latest advance in satisfying bored beings won't call them human since most of them here are mere walking robots is to follow a reality TV show whose main star is a terminal patient who is about to die at any moment. A show like this would be considered an outrageous act a new low yet all sides of the issue whether being regular viewers or righteous souls opposed to it they all watch it. Why? Because its too hard to kill curiosity. You may wonder how this managed to be presented? Well we have Roddy Harvey Keitel a volunteer on a new experience where he has a camera implanted on his brain which records everything he sees his eyes are the intrepid lenses who follow the poor Katherine Romy Schnieder recently diagnosed with an incurable disease. The filming of someone's downfall reflects in the escalating viewers numbers who are in it trapped in this program just waiting for the final hour. They want to be there they wanna be present in those moments thinking they won't let her die alone. She'll have the company of millions. George Orwell's 1984 Aldous Huxley's Brave New World and Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 all worked in giving us frightening visions of a future that already was somewhat happening in the time these authors were living. We're followed everywhere there's pleasure everywhere books are depressive and if you go against your rules there's punishment ahead waiting for you. I was almost waiting for Deathwatch to be a little like those examples this is based on David Compton's novel but it missed an authoritarian government to force people to watch it. But there's conflict not only between idealisms very reduced but the one fought by Katherine and her choices since she doesn't want to be involved at all in this ludicrous spectacle worked on her back on her disgrace. Here starts many of the films confusing issues. It throws that mass consumerism and media are evil forces but it never gives them a proper face the audience who watches the reality show all look simple people compelled by the woman's tragedy the master behind the curtains Harry Dean Stanton seems too good despite his ways of getting what he wants always hiding himself from anything until he realizes there's no other way than show up and face the problem. We're never able to see who is sponsoring it and why it's so important to present such thing.I'm not sure if the problem lies in the original source or in the way such was translated to the screen. All I know is that as long as it kept feeding me with ideas new paths of thinking the unthinkable or the less shown on other films it kept me captivated fully immersed in its story. Then the second half came in proving to be sadly Hollywoodian and simplistic and disengaging. Luckily the movie didn't mirrored its characters in the sense of us watching something dying slowly in front of our eyes. The final result is an interesting piece about mortality and how powerless humans are in face of many obstacles and this is all sides of the issue when it comes to Roddy's own problems while filming this project. Bertrand Tavernier makes an artistic different and beautiful film over a delicate and rarely touched upon theme with efficiency which is death and everything surround it.Here's a quite innovative scifi film more human down to earth and less imaginative and technical as those films tend to be Deathwatch is a thoughtful experience with pleasant and powerful performances by Schneider Keitel and Max von Sydow playing Katherine's first husband. Satisfying despite its problems. 810".

It reminds me a bit of Gattaca where the astronauts are shown boarding the ship in black suitspresumably because space suits would have cost a lot! This is not a major problem...but a problem.In this futuristic world folks are intrigued by any death that occurs to a young person...since they happen so infrequently. And because of this a sleazy TV show wants to follow someone as they die...because as one of the execs says death is the new porn! And that person they've chosen Romy Schneider wants nothing to do with fame or money...she just wants to die in peace. And she eventually flees to the poor part of town...where she can blend in and be anonymous. So they use their newest invention to follow her surreptitiously...a camera embedded into a reporter's skull Harvey Keitel. So what he sees the world sees as well.In some ways the film is very prescient. After all in this future reality television is king...just like it is today. It's also a bit like watching Network. But you can't help but think that for folks to be unfamiliar with death you'd THINK the world would have changed in some way...with newer styles of clothes cars and buildings. I think this film is worth watching. However I also think Bernard Tavernier's direction is at times rather slow...not bad but slow. And at the end it becomes glacially slow!! Because of that as well as the constricted affect of most of the actors definitely NOT Keitel the impact of the film is lessened and the film loses steam. Overall good but not great.".

So what he sees the world sees as well.In some ways the film is very prescient. After all in this future reality television is king...just like it is today. It's also a bit like watching Network. But you can't help but think that for folks to be unfamiliar with death you'd THINK the world would have changed in some way...with newer styles of clothes cars and buildings. I think this film is worth watching. However I also think Bernard Tavernier's direction is at times rather slow...not bad but slow. And at the end it becomes glacially slow!! Because of that as well as the constricted affect of most of the actors definitely NOT Keitel the impact of the film is lessened and the film loses steam. Overall good but not great.";

This prescient film certainly seems to foretell the advent of TV exploitation of personal identity complete with a team of producers manipulating events to wring the most dramatic scenes out of its victims. You could argue that Katherine signed off on it as all of today's realityshow contestants do but we're not seeing the most watchable scenes as we do on a reality show instead this film shows long boring stretches of time selfreflection bickering and routine mundane details such as sleeping in a hostel or riding on a bus intended to convey a sense of impending doom I suppose. At one point Keitel is wracked with guilt at betraying Katherine's trust but by that point it seems rather disingenuous and artificial. Max von Sydow is wonderful as he is in everything he does and here he makes the most of a small but important role as he tries to give Katherine some dignity. All in all the film doesn't go deeply enough into the characters for me to care about any of them.".

The person of interest is a woman named KatherineRomy Schneider 193882 who has a terminal illness. She avoids the network every way possible. For Roddy's case he has a issue he has to heed.

For good measure Schneider is involved in a car crash and a stint in a mental hospital so you could argue she welcomed the bullet in the back albeit it came at the height of her fame. This is an absorbing film and if Schneider walks away with it that's not to say that Trintignant Claude Brasseur and  in smaller roles  Daniel Auteuil and Thierry Lhermitte are chopped liver. Very well worth watching.".

	onyx:emotionText "Films as innovative as Citizen Kane inevitably have a lot to answer for as other  often inferior  talents divide up the techniques like relatives dividing house and contents of their late family member so no prizes for guessing what gave Francis Girod the idea to punctuate the story of Romy Schneider's banker via newsreels which conveniently display the dates changing styles etc. As a bisexual Schneider should not be too surprised when she gets shafted by both male and female elements though arguably the one that hurt most was courtesy of JeanLouis Trintignant who had her thrown into jail on a fraud charge but then if you will offer 8 per cent interest when all around you they're offering one you're bound to be unpopular. For good measure Schneider is involved in a car crash and a stint in a mental hospital so you could argue she welcomed the bullet in the back albeit it came at the height of her fame. This is an absorbing film and if Schneider walks away with it that's not to say that Trintignant Claude Brasseur and  in smaller roles  Daniel Auteuil and Thierry Lhermitte are chopped liver. Very well worth watching.";

While staying with a blind woman some toughs decide to rough up her host when they won't pay for her services. A wandering samurai named Toma tries to help but its Ichi who kills the men. Following Ichi Toma ends up hired as the protector of a village built around a town. They think Toma killed some of the gang that had been running rough shod over them but it was actually Ichi. As the gang moves to take revenge Toma and Ichi grow close. How it all plays out is the movie.Some people really don't like this movie. I've seen somethings that have blasted the film for not being a real Zatoichi film. Some people have taken it to task for having poor performances especially in the lead. I really liked the film. I had no problems with Haruka Ayase as Ichi. I found her fine for what the part is. This is not a real restart of Zatoichi its more a continuation with flashback sequences implying that the elder Ichi was this girl's father. Its a film that is going in a different direction.I have no trouble with the film being anything other than its own thing. You can't really compare it to the best of the Zatoichi series since its not really fair since those films had a couple of chances to hit their stride before they got it right. Its certainly better than the weakest of the series which could be downright dull. If I were to pin point the films flaws it would e the over length I don't know if the film really needs to be two hours. Certainly it felt longer while watching it than when it was over. The other flaw is that the films budget at times makes it seem almost like a TV movie especially with the use of computer generated blood.I like the film a great deal and would recommend it especially if you let the film do what it wants to do and not take for what its not say a continuation of Beat Takashi's take on the characters. Worth a rental or an evening at the movies.Between 7 and 8 out of 10".

It stands out as it is heavier on the action and the acting than the older movies that are heavier on the melodrama.The movie is easily summarized for those not familiar with the legend of the blind swordsman. Ichi played by Haruka Ayase a blind traveling musician is seeking out her mentor and on her travels she meets up with Toma Fujihira played by Takao Osawa and the end up in a feud between the Yakuza and a gang of thugs.Ichi has some good action scenes and sequences that were nicely choreographed and they used a great combination of slowmotion and regular motion camera work to enhance the action. And the sword fight scenes were spices up with spray blood although there wasn't actually any gore so it was tastefully done. Oddly enough though with her skills with her sword Ichi never got any blood on her and was always pretty and clean.The movie was driven by a good story and helped along by some pretty good acting. I must applaud Haruka Ayase for her portrayal of Ichi because it was really nicely done emotional and beautiful. The movie did suffer from the acting of Shid Nakamura who played Banki the leader of the thugs it was overdone and very staged.There was a lot of good camera work in the movie and lots of nice scenes. They made good use of the scenery in the movie and the sets were working quite well. And the costumes and props were working well in favor of the movie as well.For a live action Manga then Ichi was a good movie entertaining and full of action. I was glad that I watched this despite of my former bad experiences with the older movies. Recommendable for those who like feudal Japanese swords fighting movies.".

	schema:reviewBody "I haven't seen the original films in the '60s and '70s but I watched the 2003 Zatouichi starring Beat Takeshi which was a very strong film.This remake starring Ayase Haruka has its share of improvements but just as many shortcomings.Sori Fumihiko's direction as with Ping Pong was wonderful. Cinematography was very beautifully done and the slow motion in action sequence for dramatic effect was spontaneous and enjoyable.One thing that really impressed me was the music. I saw the name Lisa Gerrard under musical scores in the opening credit. My first impression was huh? A Japanese jidaigeki with foreign sounds? Unthinkable! But it turned out to be incredibly dramatic and accommodated every scene perfectly.Unfortunately I can't say the same about the casting. Ayase Haruka was really beautiful and cool as the blind assassin but she was hopeless in a particular singing scene and some other 'everyday' scenes. I can't help but to notice how blood wasn't spilling all over her face like the 2003 version. An inevitable consequence of an idol film. Nakamura Shidou as the villain was outright horrible. He severely overacted and made the film feel incredibly cheesy. Although I'm a huge fan of Kubozuka Yousuke I must admit his presence was too modern for an edoperiod film like this. He just seemed out of place talking like a modern teenager. Only Oosawa Takao fit the role and delivered a decent performance.I guess most of the blame should be placed on the script which not only set the tone of each character that the actors were not capable of... it failed to illustrate the most important feature of the character Ichi. When I watched the 2003 version what impressed me about the character was that he can be so deadly even though he was blind merely using the sound of opponent charging and feeling of enemy presence. This remake however completely failed to show how the character was strong as she was and also ignored the weaknesses such as the scene where the crowd was making a lot of noise but she was still able to easily defeat her opponent.The movie had nice action and few touching scenes but plagued by miscasting and a weak script that also overdramatized the story. Not nearly as good as the 2003 version in my opinion but still fun enough to watch.".

So this film stands on its own merits or lack thereof.Ichi starts off kind of weak with some hokey dialogue. But the hokey dialogue does play off as somewhat endearing btw Toma the insecure samurai trainee and Ichi the cold and bleak musician. The story and the relationship btw Toma and Ichi are developed decently so we are kept interested in the movie throughout. However the film's pacing is rather clunky and some of the symbolic imagery and the profound dialogue isn't set up well and comes across rather forced. It's almost as if the director is making up for plot holes by inserting random bits of poetic images and dialogue that aren't set up well and don't make that much sense.The action is more or less decent but the climactic fight scenes are too short and simplistic. All in all it's not a great action film not a great romance and not a great drama although it aspires to be all three. It's a film that's OK for killing time with but I wouldn't set aside any part of your day with it.".

Ichi is a goze who is travelling Japan in search of her mentor who was the actual Zatoichi. She was born blind. As an infant Zatoichi rescued her and left her in the care of a group of goze visiting her and secretly teaching her the techniques Zatoichi had mastered. After being abused she is exiled by the goze. She pleaded to the man who had abused her to say nothing happened but he refused and she killed him. She wanted to see her mentor one last time before she died so she began searching for him. While on her search she gets involved in a war between residents of a small village ruled by a yakuza gang and a group of bandits Bankito. It is all beautifully shot and acted. The main character has been criticised in here for no personality whereas I saw lots of personality and emotion subtlety done as is often the case with Japanese women. And Haruka Ayase as Ichi herself is stunning and beautiful and at the same time a convincing swordswoman. Also the film is not as bloodthirsty as some in this genre such as the Azumi series. Overall I would definitely watch this again.".

	schema:reviewBody "For people who love the Zatoichi films many will no doubt watch this film hoping to see their beloved character and stories recreated for the 21st century. Although the Takeshi Kitano version of Zatoichi 2003 did manage to recapture much of this original magic the bottom line is that this new film really ISN'T a Zatoichi filmstoo much is different from the original tales. Shintaro Katsu the original actor for the series died some time ago and apparently Takeshi Kitano is not up for another film in the series though apparently there IS another Zatoichi film coming out in 2010 starring Shingo Katori. Like the old saying goes you can't go back...or at least it's very hard to.Here there really is not Zatoichi as we know him but instead Ichi is a blind womana blind woman who seems like the old Ichi in some ways and definitely not in others. Yes she's great with the sword and is blind...but otherwise she is oh so different. Katsu's and Takeshi's versions had a sense of humor about them as well as foreboding. Haruka Ayase on the other hand seems to be mired in the depths of depressionsaying far less and doing far less during the course of the film. Sure she can fight though not as good as the other Ichis as in the first boss battle she gets her butt kicked but most of the time she seems much more distant and disconnected than the old Ichiprobably even clinically depressed. Though there's no denying that Ayase is incredibly beautifulsomething no one would ever accuse the male Ichis of being! Yet you wonder with so much going for her despite her blindness why didn't she just settle down and have a happy life?! The Zatoichi of old could not because he had to make up for his violent past as a member of the Yakuzabut why was this Ichi so sad and on her ownacting like a total outcast?! Even with the montage scene her actions through the film didn't seem to make total sense. This was a weakness in this film.Another weakness and this is a big one is that the new Ichi was actually NOT the main character for much of this movie. Instead so much of the tale has to do with a samurai who refuses to fightthough his reasons seemed a bit silly to meespecially late in the film when so many died because of his inner struggle. In many ways he just came off as a pathetic and somewhat annoying guycertainly NOT someone around which to base a movie get over your fear of the sword already and be a man!. Additionally the son of a slain town leader also commanded much of the screen time and was a dominant figure in the filmand probably the one most will like the most in the film. Much of the time Ichi was simply out of commission and unavailable for the fighting.Now this is the key however. If you DON'T consider this a Zatoichi film and simply accept it on its own merits it IS a very good film. Sure it's not enough like the old films...but is this perhaps asking too much in the first place?! Given that it's not really a Zatoichi film and you don't assume it will be it's good entertainment throughouteven if the leading lady seems half asleep during the film due to her severe depression. Plus despite the same name which means 'number one' she isn't supposed to be the same characterjust a girl who was trained by him. The direction music special effects most of the acting and even the story are all quite good. The biggest weakness was in the motivations for Ichi and the wimpboth seemed a bit hard to believe as they were written.By the way unlike the early Zatoichi films this one is a lot bloodier and has a bit of nudity and adult contentso be forewarnedespecially if you show it to your kids or minister or mother.".

	schema:headline " Dull and Expressionless!!";
	schema:reviewBody "Zatoichi the blind wandering yakuza as played by Shintaro Katsu is a broad and irreverent character. He is at times funny or serious crafty and silly pathetic yet heroic. In fact this character tramples over the affectations and customs of the day with intelligence and glee. This finely tuned and expansive portrayal of Zatoichi by Shintaro Katsu is the main reason his numerous films and TV episodes still endure today.Ichi 2008 is an alternative take on the blind wandering Yakuza character and Zatoichi becomes a blind wandering Goze female blind musician. The main problem with Ichi 2008 is that the titular character has no character. Haruka Ayase plays Ichi with only one expression that of deadpan emotionless. This incarnation of Ichi has no humour pity or sympathy. The acting in general is pretty poor with scowling cackling villains complimented by dull nonexpression. Apart from the action the film is shot very much like a TV movie.The fight scenes in the original Zatoichi movies and TV episodes all had one thing in common the suddenness and brutality of the action. Shintaro Katsu's dexterity and deftness with the sword and also the long single takes allowed the action to be seen and as a result the fights were almost always surprising. In the same way you may enjoy and marvel at a Bruce Lee fight the same can be said of a Shintaro Katsu sword fight.In Ichi 2008 this sudden and convincing violence is gone to be replaced by the cinematic clich of realtime cut to slowmotion and back again. This gimmick does not help the audience with actually seeing the action as most of it is missed by the selected camera setups or the selfconscious rapid editing. The CGI blood adds nothing to make the violence more authentic.Haruka Ayase is unconvincing in the fight scenes. She may hit her marks but there is little force behind the sword to make it believable she is cutting up men like butter. This same problem occurred with Azumi 2003 when Aya Ueto skipped through the fight scenes with ineptitude and men simply fellover. For the best results in female martial arts action it is better to cast an actress with a background in dance or martial arts like or Ziyi Zhang in House of Flying Daggers 2004 or Yanin Jeeja Vismistananda in Chocolate 2008.Ichi 2008 is a missed opportunity scuppered by mediocrity.".

	onyx:emotionText "Zatoichi the blind wandering yakuza as played by Shintaro Katsu is a broad and irreverent character. He is at times funny or serious crafty and silly pathetic yet heroic. In fact this character tramples over the affectations and customs of the day with intelligence and glee. This finely tuned and expansive portrayal of Zatoichi by Shintaro Katsu is the main reason his numerous films and TV episodes still endure today.Ichi 2008 is an alternative take on the blind wandering Yakuza character and Zatoichi becomes a blind wandering Goze female blind musician. The main problem with Ichi 2008 is that the titular character has no character. Haruka Ayase plays Ichi with only one expression that of deadpan emotionless. This incarnation of Ichi has no humour pity or sympathy. The acting in general is pretty poor with scowling cackling villains complimented by dull nonexpression. Apart from the action the film is shot very much like a TV movie.The fight scenes in the original Zatoichi movies and TV episodes all had one thing in common the suddenness and brutality of the action. Shintaro Katsu's dexterity and deftness with the sword and also the long single takes allowed the action to be seen and as a result the fights were almost always surprising.

The characters are of course blind but while the zatoichi characters have mannerism such as the way he acted the facial expressions and the way he talked. This Ichi is totally devoid of all personality. Ichi's features range from wooden stoic to wooden sadness to wooden expressionless. Her speech is in monotone and her actionmotion are no different from people with vision except for the cane.However if you compare it to Crimson Bat it becomes better. The plot and character becomes almost similar abandoned by parent and took up Goze as a living. Travelling in search of the parent. The unseeing open eyes and expressionless face although Crimson Bat still shows more personality. Even the gambling sequence where she wins by listening to the dice.The actions scenes with Ichi are not bad nice quick and slow motioned sequence. One cut type kills. But the action sequence are far in between. But the part where she fights the main baddie is weak.A well shot movie thats worth a watch. Just don't compare it to Zatoichi.".

This is one case where I was glad that I was wrong.Don't get me wrong there are still enough wellchoreographed fight scenes to entertain the average joe. But the fight scenes are by no means the bulk of the movie. I appreciated that the fight scenes were deliberate that is each specific fight was justified with reasoning behind it whether it be a plot device to further the story or give some small insight to a character's past. There wasn't any fighting' for the sake of fighting'The wandering protagonist Ichi is a Goze a blind woman who barely scrapes by working as a wandering musician. Unbeknownst to most she also happens to be a master swordsman of unknown origin. All we see is a laconic emotionally repressed young lady who has found one singular purpose in life a journey of sorts. Although she tries to avoid conflict with others she also is willing to maimkill anyone without hesitation or regret if they obstruct her path or pose a threat. She takes neither pride nor shame in killing but she doesn't lack morality. It may just appear that way since her persona is buried so deep that she appears to be a hollowsoulless shell at times. Although undesired she carries a certain allure about her which attracts attention.. A blind swordswoman with such exceptional skills is enough to make anyone curiousscared.Although the movie may sound very dark the theme is wellbalanced with an appropriate amount of humor. This is due to the introduction of a goodhearted but overly confident man Toma who joins Ichi on her quest. Toma recognizes Ichi's amazing fighting skill and feels some sense of emasculation. He claims to be quite the swordsman himself but his demonstrated technique says otherwise The characters play well off of each other given their extremely polarized personalities. It allows for the occasional playful moment in an otherwise serious and dramatic movieThroughout their journey Ichi and Toma learn about each other as well about themselves. The overriding themes of character development selfrealization and overcoming one's inner demons are the true essence of the movie. That said their journey has its ups and downs but due as a series of events unfolds they quickly find their lives more and more in the balance building to an amazing climax. Overall I really liked the movie. It's common knowledge that this premise is not original but the form it takes is what makes this movie special. At times it's both easy and difficult to relate to Ichi but once you hear her full story you'll likely gain some perspective into this flawed but beautiful person. A rare delicate flower which will eventually bloom into something amazingly breathtaking. And yet this flower is also capable of death unbeknownst to many. When a flower is at conflict with itself what will happen when you approach it?".

The storyline leads us to believe that this is a samurai movie with great sword fights and martial arts but the fights are just mediocre.In spite of the above things I greatly enjoyed this movie. The beauty of this movie is comparable to that of Tokyo Story or The Twilight Samurai. The beauty is mainly in the cinematography the immaculate sets the delicate love story the fantastic audio etc. And being a new movie it comes in blueray and that greatly intensifying the beauty.So despite the bad rating I would say go see it at the very least you won't feel that you wasted your time. ........Cheers!".

	schema:reviewBody "I hate this film It is really one of the worst Asian films I have ever seen. Now everyone who has heard of Zatoichi or seen even some of his films or episodesthen you know how the story goes. Me personally I only saw the last movie with the original actor and the 2003 adaptation so I am not biased in the least. Now some people are either giving it flack or praise for casting a female lead. To me I don't care in the slightest. Haruka Ayase is really good in this role as Ichi and she comes in and slices and dices her foes as expected.Then comes in the secondary character the buffoon Fujihara who likes to run to the rescue but can't draw his sword because when he was little he swung his sword broke the tip of said sword which flew across the court yard while his mother who happened to be passing through who gets slashed across the eyes blinding her. This is which in turn makes him unable to draw his sword. You honestly would think you were watching a Final Destination film. And you know what it didn't bother me until he starts lecturing Ichi on stepping up and saving lives and that is when he the film goes down hill. This man claimed he stepped in to help yet if Ichi wasn't around he would have been killed along with the hooker.Now I don't know if the director is a chauvinist but if you have movie named Ichi and the lead actress is named Ichi and if her picture is posted on covers trailers and posters then why doesn't she play second fiddle to the buffoon? I mean seriously the girl is badass she's tough and you like her but after one confrontation with the big boss another problem with this movie the buffoon suddenly realizes he is an ass and takes out the bad guy in a few strokes? Isn't she the star shouldn't she have the chance to redeem herself as so many other characters do in movies like this? Instead they make her contemplate life and gets saved by a man and cry! This is the kinda crap that gets me with movies and shows in general. They build up these characters and make them larger than life but for reasons that defy me they add a little dose of realism and make the character fall into a generic stereotype. Its like making The Bride in Kill Bill find her daughter midway through the film and she spends the rest of the film dodging assassins and panicking like a concerned mother. Didn't this character mow down dozens of bad guys in the previous films? It doesn't follow the same tone.If you want to watch this movie for Haruka Ayase's looks and acting ability just remember there are two little things called youtube and google and you can watch her anytime you want instead of shelling out twenty dollars on this movie. Skip this movie!".

Those who say we shouldn't compare this to the Zatoichi movies should understand that the movie itself is based upon the Zatoichi series. Fair is fair.It is a shame that the woman took on a personality like the Takashii Zatoichi as opposed to the superior Shintaro Katsu version of the character. It was a solid movie however there was very little that was likable about Ichi's character. As an action movie it wasn't too bad.This is the second time that someone has missed the point concerning the success of the Zatoichi franchise. Shintaro Katsu's Ichi was interesting with or without a sword. He was a mixture of Jesus Christ Toshiro Mifune and Curly from the Three Stooges. The copies have been lifeless cutouts...with one exception...The Crimson Bat series had a title character with a personality...a different personality in each of her four movies. I hope that when the next blind swordsperson movie is made they pay attention to what made the old ones great.".

Fair is fair.It is a shame that the woman took on a personality like the Takashii Zatoichi as opposed to the superior Shintaro Katsu version of the character. It was a solid movie however there was very little that was likable about Ichi's character. As an action movie it wasn't too bad.This is the second time that someone has missed the point concerning the success of the Zatoichi franchise. Shintaro Katsu's Ichi was interesting with or without a sword. He was a mixture of Jesus Christ Toshiro Mifune and Curly from the Three Stooges. The copies have been lifeless cutouts...with one exception...The Crimson Bat series had a title character with a personality...a different personality in each of her four movies. I hope that when the next blind swordsperson movie is made they pay attention to what made the old ones great.";

It really isn't good as Ping Pong and lacked elements that made that movie great. But this film is still watchable despite the really manga influenced style of it all even if it worked for the movie Ping Pong. Everything just seemed a bit too crisp and clean for this type of movie even if they wanted to modernize it a bit. If the movie was suppose to be a comedy than it's understandable but it's not. The movie wasn't as engrossing as expected but it was still sort of entertaining watching the blind female swordsman cut down bandits although the movie is a bit too vivid and colorful in a negative way. The script just wasn't as sharp as it should have been and the characters weren't all that interesting. If at least the direction would have been better it could have had potential to be a great movie but the direction of it all wasn't that great. This movie was a bit of a disappointment and maybe this director should just do another manga adaptation with a good and engrossing story. Another thing that got annoying is how the villains are always way too over the top and it gets a bit irritating to watch but than again they are obnoxious and annoying to the point I actually liked watching them get sliced and diced. There really isn't anything that stands out from this movie and nothing special.3.210".

Zatoichi's character has nothing to do with Ichi not because she is a female character but she lacks of inner deepness  Ichi got stuck with her past and the feelings from that  she hasn't overcome her sadness hasn't go beyond it. Unlike Zatoichi  who is ever present yes he has a past too but he is able to free himself of it past is past  he says in one of the series about an event and walk away dancing joyfully. Yes it is a comparison but with it I just want to point out that in reality no one can be called a master who hasn't look beyond the surface. Stillness is inside outside  like face expressions can be changed according to the situation. The master is who is still inside like before fight the master stand still  the posture is like he or she is going inside of him or her and from there he or she acts  very effectively not outside. Ichi's face is as mentioned by a lot of review motionless which makes the movie very unreal. At the end there is a smile on her face which gives a bit of hope but it doesn't elevate the movie. The fighting scenes are all right the movie is nicely shot this could be a real potential  if the writer could have more insights about the real martial arts which is about the Presence  not just in fight but in other circumstances too. The character development of Toma also could be portrayed much better remain wasted potential and Ichi's character could be more visually influenced by the character of the child and Toma too.Otherwise the music is absolutely amazing. Real gem is Lisa Gerrard and Michael Edwards  The Memory Of The GOZEYet I would advice to watch this movie because it can be a caricature about us if we stuck with our so called past mentally we could become as dead as this characterand almost the whole movie in most of our lives...".

	schema:reviewBody "Il Divo which won the Jury Prize at Cannes last year and has recently been released in US movie houses is a devastatingly ironic and highly stylized portrait of the strange extraordinarily powerful and longlived Italian politician Giulio Andreotti. He has been in Italian government in some office or other since the late 1940's. After slipping out of repeated convictions for Mafia ties in the past decade he remains senator for life at the age of 90 and he's been credited with helping bring down governments even quite recently.The ultimate political survivor Andreotti was seven times prime minister from 1972 to 1992. He's had a seat in the Italian parliament without interruption since 1946 and has also been Defense Minister Foreign Minister and President. In Andreotti's own view though he walked out on the film his wife of 60 years Livia Anna Bonaiuto and his longserving secretary Vincenza Enea Piera Degli Esposti are both sympathetically portrayed in Il Divo. He really didn't like being shown kissing Mafia boss Toto Riina which he has said never happened. In the film Andreotti is most haunted by the Red Brigades' murder of the kidnapped of Aldo Moro which he might have prevented.Though Sorrentino's film is in some ways a detailed chronicle of Anreotti's 60plus years of political power and dubious dealings with a focus on the seventh government and its aftermath the film seems more an exercise in style than an impassioned study of politics. The selfconsciousness of its frequent uses of loud contrasting music ceremonial almost Kabuukilike set pieces and slowmotion to muffle scenes of violence are further underlined by the performance of Toni Servillo who accurately perhaps too accuately mimics Andreotti's look his hunched posture even his oddly turneddown ears and his puppetlike mannerisms. Staring forward neck rigid he keeps his arms close to his body and his hands turned inward and peers expressionlessly out of his big eyeglasses. He walks across the floor in quick tiny steps like some 18thcentury Japanese court lady. There is no attempt by director or principal actor to charm or to involve. It seems Sorrentino with Servillo's diligent collaboration is laughing not only at Andreotti and at Italian politics but at us.Il Divo is soulless and cynical but it is so stylish that it's bound to be remembered. It's some kind of ultimate statement of the essence of the slick heavilyguarded world of Italian political corruption. In its own special magisterially meanspirited and pessimistic way it's an instant classic.In this film Andreotti who has been referred to as Il divo Giulio The God Giulio referencing the Roman Empire's deification of Julius Caesar and by monikers like Beelzebub The Fox The Black Pope The Prince of Darkness and The Hunchback is a queer nerdy mummifiedlooking creature who hardly ever changes expression or cracks a smile. His rigid gestures and the odd commentary of his group of primary supporters themselves all provided with gangsterstyle nicknames lead to a series of scenes that suggest politics as caricatural facade as almost pure ritual with time out on occasion for jokes selfpity and cruelty to others. You won't hear constituents mentioned in this movie though when somebody says another politician prays to God but he prays to the priest Andreotti answers Priests vote. God doesn't. Politics is everything to him and politics means the pursuit of power.For a nonItalian the details of various moments from the Aldo Moro kidnapping and all the terrorism of the Brigate Rosse of the 1970's to the 1990 Mafia trials may be pretty confusing. It's not that the filmmakers don't care they're primarily talking to an Italian audience. But even for such an audience they're keeping an ironic distance.The facade never cracks. In one scene typically staring straight forward Andreotti delivers an impassioned speech of selfdefense raising his voice almost to a shout at the end but without moving a muscle of his face. Servillo is a noted man of the theater in Italy and his whole performance is a chilly tour de force that inspires awe without giving much pleasure. Andreotti in this soliloquywhich highlights the film's often solipsistic feelargues that a leader must manipulate evil in order to maintain good. This may fit in with the evidence that he collaborated with the Mafia and yet at times was severe in repressing it.In life as in this film Andreotti has compensated for what may be the lack of visible humanity by being a wit and Il Divo crams as many of the famous battute or onelineers into scenes as it can. One was the trouble with the Pope is that he doesn't know the Vatican. Another They blame me for everything except the Punic wars. Signor Andreotti how do you keep your conscience clean? he was once asked. I never use it he replied. Other bons mots among many The trouble with the Red Brigades is they're too serious and Power is fatiguing only to those who don't have it. The world of Italian politics is baffling to the outsider. Andreotti's cool detachment and wit and this film's stylized cynicism may be the best approach to its deviousness and complexity.Last year Servillo also played one of the main characters in Matteo Garrone's Gomorrah where he's an outandout Mafia functionary. Gomorrah won Cannes' numbertwo award just below the Golden Palm the Grand Prize last year which given Il Divo's Jury Prize prompted declarations of a rebirth of Italian cinema in the making. NonItalians like Mafia movies Italians are sick of them and might have wished for patriotic reasons that their best filmmakers had won applause by turning to some other subject matter. Both these films are cold detached and analytical. Maybe they mean Italians are getting serious about their own film industry and want to look the country's ugliest aspects right in the eye. But don't look for hope here. A great cinema requires more humanity than this.".

The result is a portrait of a divinity you know that is there you know that everything happens because of his will but on earth everything happens by chance so that the fact that Andreotti is the mastermind of everything becomes a matter of divine faith.The strength of the movie rests on the capacity to describe a personality that is so powerful that does not need to speak does not need to go on TV he is able to make things happen in a way that only Andreotti knows. Andreotti is above the politics above the Church above finance above mafia he is depicted as a power that stands on its own someone who uses all the different leverages to rule.Andreotti got it away with his trials and only Andreotti knows how. For a man of his power it was the least you could expect.At the end Italians have to acknowledge that in the 20th century Italy was ruled by the King shortly Mussolini and Andreotti. But if you remember the Glossary shown at the beginning of the movie through the Loggia P2 Sorrentino suggests that Berlusconi could be the person in charge to continue the job. Whether this is the will of Andreotti or not is a matter of faith.".

	schema:headline " An extraordinary account of an extraordinary life";
	schema:reviewBody "What does the title Il Divo mean? Well it comes from Divo Giulio the Italian translation of Divus Iulius a Latin expression used to describe Julius Caesar. Divo translates as divine and the term was employed in regards to Caesar's outstanding power as well as his alleged otherworldly ancestry the founder of his family the Gens Iulia was Aeneas son of Venus. But of course that has nothing to do with Paolo Sorrentino's masterpiece the title refers to another Giulio who has also been called Divo because of his considerable influence and longevity he was 89 when the film was released. That man is Giulio Andreotti largely considered the most important political figure in 20th century Italy.Although the unabridged subtitle of the Italian version reads The extraordinary life of Giulio Andreotti it doesn't chronicle all of the famed politician's life. Instead it focuses on the most important period concerning his career from 1978 to the early '90s. 1978 is of course when Aldo Moro a member of the rightwing party Democrazia Cristiana just like Andreotti Toni Servillo was kidnapped and later executed by the Red Brigades. Andreotti shows no sign of emotion when he learns of the event as usual he has always been a quiet secretive man. All that matters to him is the significant amount of power he gains over the years. As he points out when asked why he doesn't talk to God when he goes to church priests vote God doesn't. Nevertheless he certainly enjoys a little help from above when he is accused of various illegal activities working with the Mafia and ordering assassinations being the most serious ones let's not forget some conspiracy theorists believe he contributed to Moro's death a conjecture that is dealt with in the film.Sorrentino obviously put a lot of research into his work and the opening title cards which explain the movie's context are his way of making sure viewers don't find his effort too confusing. It clearly paid off since the picture walked away with the Jury Prize at the 2008 Cannes Festival silencing rumors about it being too Italian. Predictably the real Andreotti wasn't too impressed word has it he even considered taking legal action against the filmmakers at one point. He obviously couldn't admit what happened on screen was true so he made the following statement I don't agree with Sorrentino's portrayal of me but I understand he had to make certain dramatic choices to make it interesting my real life is actually quite boring. He has a point there's a certain operatic grandeur to the scenes of the Divo walking around in government buildings and talking with his collaborators a bit like in The Godfather. This gives the picture the greatness of a Greek tragedy combined with the fiery spirit of politically charged movies like say Oliver Stone's body of work.The Stone comparison isn't accidental since he directed Nixon which much like Il Divo depended hugely on its leading man. Stone had Anthony Hopkins while Sorrentino has his Robert De Niro namely the superb Servillo whose transformation isn't a mere makeup job to see what he really looks like one ought to check out the equally magnificent Gomorra the Neapolitan actor doesn't just play Andreotti he becomes him. It's a performance that gets past mimicry or impersonation  it's Andreotti as a person not a movie character.So the concerned party's opinion aside everything speaks in favor of this ambitious thoughtprovoking stunning opus. In one word to keep in with the complete title extraordinary.".

The answer to the mystery is probably given in one secondslong soundbite somewhere near the end of the film. I say probably because Mr Andreotti spends a fair bit of time in solo self justification and I was never sure if any of his monologues had elements of truth in them.As a piece of film making this movie is dark elegant and strange as befits the subject matter.

If he had to do such for an unknown to understand the story line the movie would be one hour longer or it would become a pointless exercise and most likely a tiring one for most of the audience.

In light of this sin flood of information I watched the movie a second time and was frankly baffled by it's incredible way of telling such a complicated story in such short period of time.Speking only a bit Italian but coming from a non English mother tongue country I was able to understand many parts of the movie without subtitles. I am however used to reading subtitles of nonEnglish movies which might ruin the experience for people who are not used to such due to the speed of dialogues and the general amount of data released during the 110 minute high speed portray of much more than Il Divo Giulio himself  it is about Italy as a country...Long story short if you appreciate Italian way of life accept that the Mafia is something as part of their society let it be Sicilian Calabria or Napolitano you enjoy style class quality good food and music as well as the fact that things might just not be inside what it says on the tin then this is a movie for you. If you rather look for an easy digestible film after work do not speak Italian and have no interest in reading subtitles do not like ambiguity in scenes and do not like to put the movie together in your head afterwards  then this is certainly not a movie for you...If you do not know about Italian Politics and want to grasp this movie at first viewing read on the internet about Andreotti Craxi and the years of Lead for 20 minutes before going to the Cinema.Enjoy.".

	schema:reviewBody "Biographical films tend to be respectful to the historical figures that they describe. Even when they describe complex and controversial characters they try to explain and to put in context the motivation of deeds which in the perspective of history seem evil. Paolo Sorrentino's 'Il Divo' is quite the contrary it is a negative biography about a character who dominated the Italian politics for most of the second part of the 20th century the leader of the ChristianDemocratic Party and seventimes Prime Minister of Italy Giulio Andreotti. The film does not lack complexity  quite the contrary  and the historical context of the 80s and 90s is described in detail but the effect is willingly opposite than in usual biographies. Even political actions which would have seen candid or neutral seem to catch a strong significance and are seen through the perspective of the corruption and Mafiarelations which seem to have dominated Italian political life of the period.My knowledge about the Italian politics is too superficial to make a definite judgment about the correctness of the facts presented on screen. What I can say after seeing the film is that it does not seem to pretend to be objective. Even if there is no explicit statement there is neither any positive angle we brought into the film or positive dimension that is not questioned. Even the relationship with his wife 'I knew all these years what kind of man I married' or helping the poor which looks more like a political exercise deprived of sincerity. There are however many other scenes like the repeated walk on empty streets surrounded by cohorts of security people the reception after his last nomination as Prime Minister which describe not only the outerworldness of the man but also of the whole system.Even more amazing is the fact that Andreotti was alive when this film was made he actually died about a month ago and has seen at least part of the film allegedly walking out after a while. So this is not only a biography but a pamphlet directed against a living politician. Andreotti by the way was no stranger to the Italian cinema industry he played an important role in establishing the rules that protected the local industry against foreign especially Hollywood imports in the 50s but also the establishment of a defacto censorship over the content of the productions which was in place for many decades. Is this film also kind of a revenge of the now free industry over this character? Maybe.To a very large extent 'Il DIvo' relies on the extraordinary acting performance of Toni Servillo. He makes one of these creations which in time tend to superpose and replace the visual representation we have about the reallife person. Great acting indeed but do we end by understanding better Giulio Andreotti the man? I doubt it. Paolo Sorrentino certainly knows how to construct complex characters which do not show easily their intense internal beings. Looking now retrospectively he did the same thing in This Must Be the Place which he made later but I saw it before. He does not however serve the viewers with ready prepared answers about the motivation of his heroes. I knew very little about Andreotti before seeing this film I know many more facts now but the man remains a mystery.".

	onyx:emotionText "Biographical films tend to be respectful to the historical figures that they describe. Even when they describe complex and controversial characters they try to explain and to put in context the motivation of deeds which in the perspective of history seem evil. Paolo Sorrentino's 'Il Divo' is quite the contrary it is a negative biography about a character who dominated the Italian politics for most of the second part of the 20th century the leader of the ChristianDemocratic Party and seventimes Prime Minister of Italy Giulio Andreotti. The film does not lack complexity  quite the contrary  and the historical context of the 80s and 90s is described in detail but the effect is willingly opposite than in usual biographies. Even political actions which would have seen candid or neutral seem to catch a strong significance and are seen through the perspective of the corruption and Mafiarelations which seem to have dominated Italian political life of the period.My knowledge about the Italian politics is too superficial to make a definite judgment about the correctness of the facts presented on screen. What I can say after seeing the film is that it does not seem to pretend to be objective. Even if there is no explicit statement there is neither any positive angle we brought into the film or positive dimension that is not questioned. Even the relationship with his wife 'I knew all these years what kind of man I married' or helping the poor which looks more like a political exercise deprived of sincerity.

For one the performances and interpretations of these real characters are spot on and for another the intelligence and courage to which the script approaches the ethical implications of Il Divo's actions the breadth of moral exploration how he defends himself to himself to others and often directly to the viewer is a welcomed shock and dose of complexity to the often polemic and overlyreductive discourse in Italian politics not much different than here in the States in that regard. Lastly for Italians these events resonate incredibly and speak very much to the current power base in Italy. I truly feel that a lot of Americans are watching this film with cultural blinders on.I won't lie it is definitely designed for people that already have a strong grasp of the history. It doesn't weigh itself down with long explanations and exposition except in text at the beginning and end of the film so if you're coming to this to learn every sordid detail about its subject or for a plot even then you might not find much reward in it.

He is a tiny man quite fragile looking hunpback dogeared but very witty and with a huge aura of power around him one of his famous aphorism is power tires those who don't have it. He was a controversial character first depicted quite as a saint then as the great maneuverer and at last as a politician able to welcome the evil to reach his aims. At first sight this movie surprised me. First of all i was surprised by the ironical and grotesque cut that Sorrentino gave to his movie. Then i was surprised by the judgement suspension that this movie gives to the main character yes of course there are tons of evidences that Andreotti had to do with evil persons to keep his power but the movie director never says he is the evil. At the second sight i found out there is more. At the second sight the main character faded into the whole background. This is a movie about Italian politics as a whole. This movies points out how italy has become the country that is nowadays. It shows the slow downhill starting from the first idealists of the republic such as DeGasperi down to politics such as Andreotti for whom a tree needs manure to grow up a sort of Machiavelli's a greater aim justifies any deed down until the politics that just want power for power's sake for this reason the portrait of Cirino Pomicino  this name looks like a joke but it isn't!  is wonderful. So no surprise when you read about an Italian politician that is judged for corruption or something even worse it's the consequence of the downhill of the politics that common citizens cannot stop anymore simply because citizens have no power anymore it is all in politicians' hands and they share it from hand to hand. I can understand that foreign viewers can find this movie boring and difficult to understand. But forget for a moment it is a movie about Giulio Andreotti and watch it as the history of 30 years of a real country's politics. Veeery frightening the scene in which Andreotti caught by insomnia walks in an empty street surrounded by a 20 men's heavy armed escort. In a normal country straight people should be able to walk safely in any street with no need of any escort at all. That's all imho...".

The story of Androetti the head of a government that went for seven administrations and then went on to run for President has some really fascinating things to it. One of those is seeing just how the parliament works in those scenes midway through the picture and how the country actually chooses its president which is so far removed from the US democratic process it's hard to fathom. And I also admired how the actor playing Androetti so got into this kind of quietly conniving politician a man who believed that politics was everything and yet would never get passionate enough to raise his voice above a whisper. Somewhere inside of him a Dick Cheney is rumbling perhaps.But the problem in watching the film if you don't pay attention to the Italian politics of the period or just in general is that the filmmakers lose you fairly quickly. I usually find myself a viewer who doesn't like to be spoonfed information very simply but this is on the opposite end of the cannon where only a few real details are clear enough and then the rest comes whizzing by at a quick clip and quick indeed as the camera style is akin to the operatic nature of Scorsese only not as talented or focused. Names of characters keep coming up as title cards and except for a couple of names like The Lemon Androetti's righthand man none of them really stick out and the incidents keep piling up without any real connection. At some point the basic story does reveal itself and holds some interest but there's a disconnect between many scenes too and a sense of crosscutting done a few times i.e. the horse race scene crossed with a shooting comes off as unimaginative.It's not a waste of time though if you're totally ignorant about Italy's political structure and brash sense of the power dynamic. But it's not one that I particularly enjoyed either and its lack of a connection with the mounting details made it harder to appreciate.".

It is an unconventional highly stylised comedydrama that is infuriating exciting informative and exhausting. Director Paolo Sorrentino throws so many facts figures and names at you in rapid fashion that it all becomes a blur it is near impossible to keep up especially if your knowledge of Italian politics around this time is slim which was the case for me.

He was so influential so powerful that nothing escaped him. And nothing could touch him.Toni Servillo's simply brilliant performance conveys everything you need to know about Andreotti. He is not physically intimidating but instead he is hunched softlyspoken and extremely strangelooking. But Andreotti does not need to move for anyone. His extreme intelligence and nearsupernatural ability to get out of situations by doing next to nothing only increases his divine status. We see the best and worst of Andreotti but Sorrentino is not trying to force an opinion of him out of us but instead he has directed an outrageous film about an outrageous man.

	schema:headline " Exhausting trying to figure out the plot";
	schema:reviewBody "I heard this movie was great exciting and gripping...and therein I was set up for disappointment. It was beautiful cinematic great sound trackbut simply exhausting trying to understand all the relationships. After 45 mins I stopped trying so hard to remember names and connections the gestalt took over. That helped but nevertheless without any familiarity of Italian politics one really had to remember closely the framework that was outlined in the first five minutes. And similarly there is a scene when his secretary describes what his hand movements meanif he is tapping his fingers together you will be dismissed within 5 mins if he is playing with his ring it means he is interested etc....And then throughout the movie it shows his handsbut I couldn't remember the different meanings. It wasn't important but what I am saying is that it's hard to know the forest for the treeswhat IS important to pay attention to and what isn't really essential. We found it very long because the storyline was rather vague and very gradual. The last 15 mins were excellent. This is a film made at a very high caliber I just think the writers could have structured it a little differently. But this is 10 stars compared to most of what comes out of Hollywood. It was challenging but special.".

It was beautiful cinematic great sound trackbut simply exhausting trying to understand all the relationships. After 45 mins I stopped trying so hard to remember names and connections the gestalt took over. That helped but nevertheless without any familiarity of Italian politics one really had to remember closely the framework that was outlined in the first five minutes. And similarly there is a scene when his secretary describes what his hand movements meanif he is tapping his fingers together you will be dismissed within 5 mins if he is playing with his ring it means he is interested etc....And then throughout the movie it shows his handsbut I couldn't remember the different meanings.

However unlike those two movies I found it almost impossible to follow or understand. The structure left me feeling completely lost for the first thirty minutes or so and as another writer commented the use of explanatory text on screen gave too much information in too short a time particularly when trying to grasp the translations which often appeared in difficult areas of the screen. The story no doubt resonates for those who know and understand Italian politics but for me I felt no empathy for any characters or to be perfectly honest any interest in the outcome of the film.However the movie did look absolutely fantastic at times feeling much like a Europop music video. The cinematography is superb. Yet the movie just doesn't work on a narrative level for an Englishspeaking audience in my opinion. It relies too much on an understanding of the intertwined relationship between Italian politics and the criminal underworld knowing who these characters are or were in the real world and their relationship to each other. It is not a story that stands on its own as a piece of narrative cinema but it is a movie that is worth watching just for the the visual spectacle.

Seven convicts escaped with him yet Pearce was the only one that emerged... along with chunks of human flesh in his pockets. The legend of Pearce was born. An extinct species... a long forgotten legend... both had a desperate need to survive both could now have living descendants within the Tasmanian bush. Many sightings of the tiger have been reported.

	schema:reviewBody "The little hype surrounding this Australian feature is probably better left unnoticed as while I found it solid it doesn't pull any out punches we haven't already gone through before to leave an impressive imprint. Hey it reminded me of an other Australian horror film 'Wolf Creek 2005' and maybe 'The Hills Have Eyes 2006' remake but this time the escalating terror is found in the beautiful forests of Tasmania as a group of young adults head out searching for the supposedly instinct Tasmanian tiger but actually earth up something more horrifying about the area's local history. For me this film really came out of nowhere as the striking poster artwork featuring a half eaten pie with an eyeball and finger within it caught my attention and some rave reviews can feed your appetite. Sadly though I was only one of four who were at the cinema to see it. I probably could've gone without seeing it and waited for it to hit DVD but there's nothing quite like watching a horror film on the big screen. What this story sets off to be is a little unsure but about midway through you know where it's heading Psycho territory with cannibalistic currents. I might sound like a broken record but really this isn't nothing new compared to much modern horror focusing on the visual torture and torment of its victims. While it might not be as abundant it still lingers and has a really nasty side. It has explicitly raw moments with pockets of vicious intensity but it was not the violence that unnerved but the ominously remote woodland backdrop with constant eerie imagery. The scenery is gorgeously lush but lurking beneath the gracefully hypnotic setting is the true grotesque horror that's hidden very well. The nocturnal but surprisingly also the day sequences can get under your skin. The cinematography is professionally catered for with it drawing upon the atmosphere and setting. Editing is brisk but well infused. As for the story it uses actual facts and spins them in to total fiction. The main base of the story centres on the history of the extinct Tasmanian tiger which some still believe exists and combining that legend of the cannibalistic Irish convict Alexander Pearce that managed to escape from the penal colony and headed for the wilderness to only be hanged in 1824. Then we hit modern times with a group of four after the exclusive photograph of the Tiger but one of girls lost her sister within the same area they're visiting in a supposed drowning many years earlier. Now cue those articles of missing backpackers. But when they meet the creepy locals the inbred jokes flow. Still we're flooded with flashbacks piled on to flashbacks. Even if the setup is clichd and obviously formulaic these back stories do give it a little more background and depth and lessens the idea of turning in to something meaningless. The script has its questionable actions but mainly lets it go about things. The pacing is rather leisured and I can see many complaining about the slowness of the opening half think of the criticism that 'Wolf Creek' copped. But I thought it was milked out accordingly and with a purpose to hit you hard when it finally changed direction. Featuring heavily is that it centres on mood visuals and sounds than that of tearing and ballistic actions. Even when it does break out from it's causal handling it still doesn't burst out and only adds tension with jolts in scattered slabs and formulated rushes. When it comes to the end I found it to be stumbling there and results not entirely satisfying. But it still keeps that glum feel throughout. Jody Dwyer's assured direction is slick and stylish. Maybe too so but it's a brash display as his not afraid to bare gore and flesh usually the latter in recent times sees little daylight in the mainstream horror releases. Even animal lovers should be aware. The performances are workmanlike but no real empathic edge was created. Well not for me. One thing though it never seemed like they were ever aware in what type of situation they were or could be in but when it unfolded it didn't entirely changed the perception. Leigh Whannel Nathan Phillips Mirrah Foulkes and Melanie Vallejo play the unlucky party. A basic but durably crafted genre effort.".

	onyx:emotionText "The little hype surrounding this Australian feature is probably better left unnoticed as while I found it solid it doesn't pull any out punches we haven't already gone through before to leave an impressive imprint. Hey it reminded me of an other Australian horror film 'Wolf Creek 2005' and maybe 'The Hills Have Eyes 2006' remake but this time the escalating terror is found in the beautiful forests of Tasmania as a group of young adults head out searching for the supposedly instinct Tasmanian tiger but actually earth up something more horrifying about the area's local history. For me this film really came out of nowhere as the striking poster artwork featuring a half eaten pie with an eyeball and finger within it caught my attention and some rave reviews can feed your appetite. Sadly though I was only one of four who were at the cinema to see it. I probably could've gone without seeing it and waited for it to hit DVD but there's nothing quite like watching a horror film on the big screen. What this story sets off to be is a little unsure but about midway through you know where it's heading Psycho territory with cannibalistic currents. I might sound like a broken record but really this isn't nothing new compared to much modern horror focusing on the visual torture and torment of its victims. While it might not be as abundant it still lingers and has a really nasty side. It has explicitly raw moments with pockets of vicious intensity but it was not the violence that unnerved but the ominously remote woodland backdrop with constant eerie imagery. The scenery is gorgeously lush but lurking beneath the gracefully hypnotic setting is the true grotesque horror that's hidden very well. The nocturnal but surprisingly also the day sequences can get under your skin. The cinematography is professionally catered for with it drawing upon the atmosphere and setting. Editing is brisk but well infused. As for the story it uses actual facts and spins them in to total fiction. The main base of the story centres on the history of the extinct Tasmanian tiger which some still believe exists and combining that legend of the cannibalistic Irish convict Alexander Pearce that managed to escape from the penal colony and headed for the wilderness to only be hanged in 1824.

The myth of the Pieman and Tasmanian Tiger is fascinating and intriguing storyline. Once the carnage kicks in this is a tense brooding film that will have you on the edge of your seat.

	schema:reviewBody "Just saw Jody Dwyer's Dying Breed. What an excellent Australian Horror flick it is! It could well be one of my favourite Australian Films of the year.Four young cryptozoologists go to check out Western Tasmania in search of ye ol' Tasmanian Tiger. Little do they know they are stumbling upon the ancestors of Alexander Pearce the famous Australian exconvict bush ranger and sometime cannibal known as the 'Pieman'. Suffice to say fine dining is loosed on the Pieman River as a group of Deliverance style in bred Tassie freaks hunt down our hapless Tiger hunters. Dying Breed is well cast with Leigh Whannell Saw giving us a great version of the metrosexual out of his league in the wilds of Western Tasmania and Nathan Phillips Wolf Creek as a roustabout larrikin hunter. Whannel is an excellent leading man and should branch out from horror and do other serious work. The two girls Sally MacDonald and Melanie Vallejo are good too. Especially the later when she is strung up and dismembered Cannibal Holocaust style out the back of the Pieman's shed. I'm sure Leigh Whannell must have been showing the director Cannibal Holocaust as this scene certainly bears the imprint of that classic film and the Dying Breed scene is very well done in its brutality. The film has various very effective set pieces in a cave at night in the bush out the back of the killer's shed on a bridge at dawn etc. All shot effectively and scored very nicely. The ominous Tasmanian landscape evokes a darkness akin to what DH Lawrence said about the great primordial emptiness of the Australian bush. The film should travel well as the Aussie accents aren't too harsh and one is a Irish accent. The family of inbred freaks are memorable and varied in their motivations and actions.Dying Breed is a great edgy genre piece that is one of the first to appear in the new wave of horror cannibal films so its ahead of the game world wide also. I would have to rate it right up there with Rogue from last year and Acolytes Horseman and Rats and Cats.Why did they not enter it in MUFF? It would have won some awards! Check out the posters. I like the stylish one while the second one with a gory pie will entice the teen market.Stylish new Ozploitation is on display that gives hope to the future of the Australian Film Industry!".

Some scenes were creepy and disturbing.

The movie sort of builds up some fairly good moments but they are always toppled by an anticlimatic result. Toss in a supposedly Tasmanian tiger in the equation and hope it would work. But it didn't at least not for me...And had the movie been based on something fresh it might actually have been interesting but the story and plot was handpicked right out of movies like Wrong Turn The Hills Have Eyes and such similar movies.Now as for the cast well they were actually well cast and they did good jobs with their roles. I especially liked the acting of Leigh Whannell towards the end when he was in the chair. That was really cool. Although what happened following that scene was so predictable that you could smell it a mile away.There was no frights in this movie which was a total disappointment. There were moments when there could have been some suspense but the movie failed to deliver on that part. As for the psychological aspect of the movie well that was brilliant. Being trapped in the woods scared something stalking you and weird hillbillies nearby well that actually did work out well enough for the movie. Although it has all be used before.Dying Breed was somewhat of a disappointing experience. I had expected more from this as it is a part of the After Dark Horrorfest movies. But now I've seen it and will chalk it up as a Tasmanian remake of Wrong Turn and The Hills Have Eyes nothing more... I don't recommend this movie to be a top priority to watch if you are into horror movies or psychologically freaky movies this is slowmoving and takes forever to get nothing told.

Shot for 3 million more than Wolf Creek 1 million shot with the same cameras as Wolf Creek and unique story for an Australian movie.Basically the movie's about 4 people presumably science geeks as they try to find the extinct Tasmanian Tiger and the lead girl's sister who presumably drowned 8 years ago. What i did like about this film not the sex scene but the build up to the on and off screen violence but the lack of music is what doesn't make this film come to life like many others. Nerida Tyson Chew who we have heard from the Twisted series one and two tries more subtly to put his music through noises like Francois Tetaz did in Wolf Creek. Jody Dwyer shot the movie a bit too stylish with the camera looming in on more close up shots feeling a little too claustrophobic.Leigh Whannell's character Matt was the most quiet character out of the lot which i didn't like at all Nathan Philips character Jack was the most offensive but the most funny of the pack the Ruth and Bec characters who go with them they do alright but Bec dies too quickly. The cannibals of the town give a good performance across the board enjoying some good raw meat courtesy of Justin Dix who did some nice makeup effects on this show if put into the right direction could be the next John Carl Buechler.The ending of Dying Breed is a strange one but nonetheless a shocker which it felt like it had a few too many endings but once it did end i felt better because the little girl in the film was creepy. Not everyone will like this film but i'm a supporter of good Aussie films and this one goes on my shelf in 6 months time good work.Rated MA15 for Violence Gore Language and a Sex Scene.".

	schema:reviewBody "Dying Breed is a largely derivative and predictable Aussie horror flick that nevertheless benefices from a handful of marvelous elements like a fascinating historical plot outline albeit not at all accurate breathtaking filming locations  scenery and a few unyielding shock sequences. The pivot character in Dying Breed even though he only briefly appears during the opening sequence is Alexander Pearce a.k.a. The Pieman. He was a cannibalistic murderer of Irish descent who got exiled to Tasmania to pay for the crimes he committed. Back in the early eighteen hundreds when the whole of Australia was still a British prison colony and Tasmania an island where the heaviest cases were shipped off to Alexander Pieman Pearce was the only convict how managed to escape and flee into the impenetrable Tasmanian forests. Obviously this plot outline isn't entirely accurate as the real Pieman was in fact the nickname of a completely different prisoner and the real Alexander Pearce died at the gallows in 1824 but hey it's a horror movie so everything goes. After the introduction of Pearce and the Tasmanian region the plot resumes in present day Tasmania with the arrival of four twentysomething adventurers. Nina is a zoologist and wishes to continue the research of her sister who died here eight years ago whilst looking for last remaining species of the Tasmanian Tiger. She and her friends quickly discover that her sister didn't just drown but fell victim to the bewildered and horribly inbred descendants of Alexander Pearce. They have only one goal in their miserable existence and that is to keep the bloodline alive. At the festival where I watched this movie Dying Breed was exaggeratedly promoted like an Aussie interpretation of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and The Hills Have Eyes. Perhaps this is a fairly apt comparison but stating something like that inevitably raises high expectations that Dying Breed can't possible fill in. Director Jody Dwyer does a reasonably good job but heshe ? yet doesn't succeed in generating an atmosphere of despair and sheer terror. It also takes slightly too long before the suspense and nastiness truly breaks loose. The first half of the film is overly stuffed with typical inbred jokes and stereotypical tourist behavior. There are a handful of downright disgusting sequences notably a gruesome bear trap death sequence and a few close ups of pickaxesinthehead moments which will undoubtedly appeal to the bloodhounds among us. The nature and wildlife images are dreamy to stare at and the acting performances are surprisingly above average. One of the lead actors is Leigh Whannell who along with James Wan created the original concept of Saw.".

Similar movies have covered the same material before Wrong Turn perhaps to a lesser extent even The Chainsaw Massacre movies... and although there's a link to an actual historical figure it's a pretty weak link and there's no new twists to make this unique.The characters are all pretty unlovable so there's not much to relate to in that department.The production values are high so I have to recommend this over some of the other After Dark Horror Fest films I've seen.

	schema:headline " Its Tradition....and I like it.";
	schema:reviewBody "I was lucky enough to catch the midnight showing of Dying Breed at this year's Tribeca Film Festival and want to get my thoughts down immediately. In short its a solid horror thriller movie that I would recommend you see if you are fan of this genre. If I had to try to compare it to any of the more recent horror films I'd say its 1 part Cabin Fever 1 part Devil's Rejects and 1 part Hostel. The film is based on two bits of historical fact. First there is Alexander the Pieman Pierce who back when Tasmania was used as a prison island for Britain's worst lot escaped from the prison and resorted to cannibalism to survive. The Pieman's cuisine of choice has spawned a slight tradition in the backwoods of Tasmania where hikers have historically ventured into and never returned. The film's second historical basis lies with the mystery of the Tasmanian tiger which most scientists deem extinct. Not our protagonist Nina Mirrah Foulkes who is out to find the tiger and finish the work her sister began before she mysteriously drowned out in the bush. Enter our two couples Nina and her boyfriend Matt Leigh Whannel and Matt's old buddy your standard obnoxious peripheral character in horror movies and his girlfriend your standard pretty and clueless body who are along for the ride. I would say one of the movie's strengths is the great cinematography that takes you along with the foursome as they enter the beautiful but eventually spooky backwoods. They eventually end up in a town that hearkens you back to the West Virginians in Cabin Fever serious backwoods nut jobs. From a strange girl to a male only town to a mysterious figure lurking in the woods you can tell that things are getting weird and that these 'tourists' are entering a sketchy situation. From the town the foursome venture via boat deeper into the bush. This movie succeeds because you have good tension building elements 1 the woods caves jungles etc 2 messed up locals with a tradition they need to keep alive and 3 a good bit of blood flesh flying around and things called mantraps I mean you cant go wrong there. This is not a gore fest and special effects are minimal. The ending takes you for a good ride but ultimately this wasn't a crazy adrenaline pumping horror movie. The bad guys are bad weird and a bit grotesque but are basically people who act and look pretty weird nothing that'll make you jump out of your seat. Its cool though and it works. Like most movies in this genre you have the god these people are stupid moments there are a bit too many you stay here I'll be right backs and our audience laughed at the idiocy of some decisions but the movie is not campy as campy horror movies go it tries and largely succeeds at keeping to a dark serious undertone. On top of that the reality of their situation does not seem to ever dawn on the foursome. One brief nonspoiler example is that certain townies end up all the way out in the bush with the foursome and the foursome never really seem to recognize just how strange it is that these bonified weirdos just happened upon them in the middle of the woods. This realization the fear that occurs when the character is forced to contemplate how completely screwedmessed up their situation is is what makes horror movies horrifying. The characters almost seem oblivious to the situation and honestly I get more freaked out when I see the actors on film freaking out. There is a twist or two that doesn't jive with logic but Im not complaining. Not a classic but certainly worth your time if you want to see a horror movie based on cannibalism.".

So there's no point in really expanding on that above point! I saw this movie tonight at the first screen in Tasmania. Being Tasmanian there were lots of little 'trivia' and mistakes I guess the eds made  Victorian number plates Victorian pub!.The movie itself I found to be quite slow during the first half. Flashbacks of this flashbacks of that intermingled with the building of the story the slow building of the story. Things got going about halfway through when night came and people started disappearing. Yes clichd with tried and tested scariness in parts some nice uses of symbolism.... If you're thinking this is a re run of Wolf Creek just in a more wet and soggy state think again! It's a little different and I think there's a lot less gore in this one! Suspense was built fairly OK  enough to keep me hooked but not enough to be going I really don't want to be here!!! Although is that a good or a bad thing in the end? In the end this movie was OK not outstanding but not written off.".

Among the numerous big flaws here is the fact that barely anything at all really happens in this one which draws the viewer in where the majority of time here doesn't come off as enjoyable. A lot of this here is due to the group were forced to spend all the time with who are an utterly annoying group that are completely unlikable that really wouldn't be friend as the wild outofcontrol jerk really shouldn't be with them as he would've prove tall that trust worthy in reallife. Acting like the stereotypical heman macho jerk that has to be the leader of everything bosses and beatsdown everyone into seeing things his way and is such a general pain that he really wears himself out rapidly. That also plays a huge part of the film's first half pacing problems as not only is spending time here excruciating but their other antics are even less so wandering through the endless miles of forest in their jeep or staying at the motel with the locals don't really have any really enjoyable sections. It's all filled with really uninteresting moments that simply drag this along at a really slow pace due to these parts. There's also the rather troubling part here that all this manages to hold off the actual attacks until so late in the film that there's barely anytime here where the family actually goes about attacking them which causes the film some really troubled times here as there's so little time here spent with the main purpose of the film being them being stalked yet that can't happen with the film setup the way it is. Even more troubling here is that the motivation for it all is yet another clich of the inbred psychos looking for purity outside the clan which isn't all that original or unique and takes a lot of fear out of the family. These big flaws are damaging enough that the few positives here aren't enough to really make a dent although they are noticeable. The film's biggest plus here is the rather fun and charged second half where after they get past the dangers with the family and finally realize they're being chased as there's some really chilling work in the atmospheric forest as the first encounter by the cave where they encounter the cannibal patriarch who begins munching on the victim in the bushes the guide hikes them out through the forest into the dark trapfilled mine and then the great encounter on the other side of the mountain. From finding the mutilated body of the guide alongside the remains of their friend and then encounter the shack in the woods where they have the gnawed bodies and skeletal pieces left behind there which sets up the truly chilling chase and eventual confrontation on the bridge which gives this some really fun times here. The only other enjoyable art here is the film's blood and gore which not only come from the opening attack on the original member but the few small bloody attacks here. These here make this enjoyable enough but the flaws are just too detrimental.Rated R Graphic Violence Graphic Language Brief Nudity sexual content a rape scene and graphic violence against animals.".

	schema:reviewBody "Inspector Antoine Gallien Lino Ventura is a no nonsense and practical man who only believes in facts and evidence and is assigned on the New Year 's Eve to question a wealthy tuxedowearing attorney named Jerme Martinaud Michel Serrault suspected for the rape and murder of two little girls. There's no real evidence against him except that he was near the locations where the victims were found. So because he was at the wrong places at the wrong moments he naturally falls under suspicion a wink to the US remake's title.Garde  Vue has only four main characters the two leads plus Gallien's colorful assistant Marcel Belmont Guy Marchand and Martinaud's cold and sophisticated wife Romy Schneider in her next to last role. And through a short runningtime of eighty something minutes and a very austere setting such as the commissariat of a French small town the whole movie consists on a long questioning session where Gallien tries to establish Martinaud's alibi if he ever has one. Needless to say that both actors are perfect Ventura plays the determined and competent cop with a bluffing realism and Serrault's nervousness and confusion powerful convey the idea of a man who's not acting natural. It takes some superhuman acting strength to naturally play a nonnatural character. As the session progresses it becomes obvious that Martinaud can't afford an alibi yet it's also obvious that Gallien doesn't want to be misguided by this obviousness.And in fact even the film seems to be governed by a sort of deliberately misguiding impression as if it was manipulating us like Martinaud seems to manipulate his audience. Indeed Garde  Vue strikes by an astonishing minimalism It's a film of a few words a few scenes a few actors but each of these elements is perfect and doesn't ask for more. Directed by Claude Miller and written by one of the greatest French screenwriters Michel Audiard Garde  Vue is a film that meticulously concentrates all the elements of greatness that make the best copthrillers and elevate it to another dimension. More than a copthriller Garde  Vue is a remarkable character study where the flaws of its main character are highlighted by a confrontation with a totally opposite personality. We look at Martinaud from Gallien's perspective then from his wife's and we try to find out by ourselves not if he's guilty or not guilty but what kind of man he really is.Like another minimalist masterpiece 12 Angry Men Garde  Vue is an intelligent introspection into the way human personalities from different backgrounds can interact in their quest for facts and truths. How intelligence and the conscience of one's own failure and mediocrity can work as a mask to disguise emotions. And the film is full of them the questioning starts in a very polite way. Progressively Martinaud expresses his displeasure to be taken in an interrogation room while everyone celebrates the New Year's Eve. But he's incapable of providing an alibi and therefore slips into the suspect n1 category. Belmont believes he's guilty and tries to get the confession the easy way by slapping Martinaud around when Gallien is absent. But it doesn't work Martinaud oscillates between a state where he asserts his rights and others where he falls in his miserable condition convinced that he's only accused by people because they're as mediocre as him and can't stand the idea of a mediocre man succeeding.And 'mediocre' is an epithet that fits Martinaud thanks to Serrault's magnificent capability to play ambiguous and doublefaced characters. He masterfully embodies this category of men apparently successful and wealthy but living a totally miserable life they're by essence misleading persons because their very lives give the wrong impression. The film embarks us in a succession of facts and sordid details about Martinaud's marital life incarnated by a long corridor between him and his wife it's not infidelity not impotence but it's pure nothingness. Martinaud's sexual tendencies pointing a more and more accusing finger are the reasons behind the failure of his marriage but Gallien still can't see where this is leading. He feels he's being manipulated by emotions not realizing that these emotions can give serious clues about Martinaud's eventual motives. But he's afraid of having wrong impressions and desperately asks for an alibi and a confession. But how can you ask such a clear question to a man so full of contradictions. In a way Gallien is manipulated by his own fear of being manipulated.That's the masterstroke of Michel Audiard the film doesn't let itself embark by obviousness there are facts there are motives there are proof but human relationships predominate above all these considerations. And even a practical man like Gallien can get the wrong impression even from facts.. The writing and the editing swinging back and forth between the interrogation the crime settings and Martinaud's background create the enthralling feeling of a puzzle whose pieces reassemble. But it's the kind of puzzle that you only know the picture after reassembling them you can't have a clear idea even when you come close to the heartpounding conclusion. And the acting and directing contribute to a very realistic feel. The interrogation room is not too threatening there's not a suffocating atmosphere aggravated by a terrorizing inspector. No Gallien is relatively calm and tolerates Martinaud's outbursts with an impressive patience. Everything is handled as humanly as possible.The film won four deserved Csar French Oscars for Best Actor Serrault Best Supporting Actor Marchand Best Editing and Best Writing. I was surprised to see that Lino Ventura wasn't nominated because his performance made of calm and quiet strength was not only spectacular in its nuance but indispensable not to let the film become caricatural. Never mind every single element works perfectly and it's one of the greatest French thrillers.".

	schema:reviewBody "Miller is not well known in North America. He made a superb first feature called La meilleure facon de marcher about two young instructors at a summer camp. One terrorizes the other with insults and physical abuse designed to provoke a homosexual response. The typical Miller film has a central figure under a lot of pressure either selfimposed or coming from others. Here we have a rich lawyer Serrault so wonderful in La cage aux folles accused of raping and killing two young girls. He is being interrogated on New Year's eve in a sterile office by two detectives who would rather be out celebrating.As the night wears on Serrault becomes more and more frustrated and anguished since the questioning turns as much on his married life as on his alibis for the two girls. His marriage is a sham his wife married him for his money and they haven't made love in ten years. Romy Schneider made a great cameo as the wife resigned to her wretched loveless but upwardlymobile arrangement. She died soon after the film was released.The main characters are all superbly played. Guy Marchand is the dumber of the two cops he's sweating under the lights and hates the accused man even more for his veiled insults. Lino Ventura plays Gallien with a fine combination of tact and anger. He can't forget the photos of the victims.I'll just mention Bruno Nuytten's fine camera work the night scenes in a steady rain are well done. This is one of the finest crime films from France and should be widely seen.".

	schema:reviewBody "Police investigations murder suspicion we are all so acquainted with them in movies galore. Most of the films nowadays deal with crime which is believed to involve viewers to provide them with a thrilling atmosphere. However most of thrill lovers will rather concentrate on latest movies of that sort forgetting about older ones. Yet it occurs that these people may easily be misled. A film entirely based on suspicion may be very interesting now despite being more than 20 years old...it is GARDE A VUE a unique movie by Claude Miller.Is there much of the action? Not really since the events presented in the movie take place in a considerably short time. But the way they are executed is the movie's great plus. Jerome Charles Martinaud Michel Serrault is being investigated by Inspector Gallien Lino Ventura and Insector Belmont Guy Marchand. It's a New Year's Eve a rainy evening and not very accurate for such a meeting. Yet after the rape and murder of two children at the dawn of the old year the door of suspicion must be open at last. In other words more quoted from the movie it must be revealed who an evil wolf really is. To achieve this one needs lots of effort and also lots of emotions from both parties...Some people criticize the script for being too wordy. Yet I would ask them what should an investigation be like if not many questions and practically much talk. This wordiness touches the very roots of the genre. In no way is this boring but throughout the entire film it makes you as a viewer as an observer involved. Moreover the film contains well made flashbacks as the stories are being told. Not too much and not too little of them  just enough to make the whole story clearer and more interesting. The most memorable flashbacks for me are when Chantal Romy Schneider Martinaud's wife talks about one lovely Christmas... But these flashbacks also contain the views of the places including the infamous beach. It all wonderfully helped me keep the right pace. And since I saw GARDE A VUE I always mention this film as one of the defenders of French cinema against accusations of mess and chaos. But those already mentioned aspects may not necessarily appeal to many viewers since they might not like such movies and still won't find the content and its execution satisfactory. Yet GARDE A VUE is worth seeing also for such people. Why? For the sake of performances. But here don't expect me to praise foremost Romy Schneider. GARDE A VUE is not Romy Schneider vehicle. She does a terrific job as a mother who is deeply in despair for a lost child. She credibly portrays a person who is calm concrete who does not refuse an offered cup of tea but who does not want to play with words. Her part which includes a profound talk of life and duty is brilliant more credible than the overly melancholic role of Elsa in LA PASSANTE DE SANS SOUCI. It is still acted. However Romy Schneider does not have much time on screen. Practically she appears for the first time after 45 minutes from the credits she as a wife and a different viewpoint comes symbolically with the New Year at midnight. Her role is a purely supporting one. Who really rocks is Lino Ventura. He IS the middle aged Inspector Antoine Gallien who wants to find out the truth who is aware that his questions are missiles towards the other interlocutor but does not hesitate. He is an inspector who having been married three times is perfectly acknowledged of women's psyche. He is the one who does not regard his job as a game to play but a real service. Finally he is a person who does not find it abnormal to sit there on New Year's Eve. Michel Serrault also does a fine job expressing fear particularly in the final scenes of the movie. But thumbs up for Mr Ventura. Brilliant!As far as memorable moments are concerned this is not the sort of film in which this aspect is easily analyzed. The entire film is memorable has to be seen more than once and has to be felt with its atmosphere and which I have not mentioned before gorgeous music. For me the talk of Chantal and Inspector Gallien is the most brilliant flawless moment. You are there with the two characters you experience their states of mind if you go deeper into what you see.GARDE A VUE is a very interesting film a must see for thrill lovers and connoisseurs of artistic performances. New Year has turned and...is it now easier to open the door? You'll find out when you decide to see the memorably directed movie by Claude Miller. 810".

The script flows like a clockwork orange of course aided by Serrault who could make rocks weep laugh and commit suicide. Lino Ventura is believable almost likable as a tough cop who doesn't really care who gets nailed but can't forget the young victims and won't be distracted from a suspect even if he's got style and wit.Why does the ending disappoint? Probably a tad melodramatic and manipulative it doesn't harm an already superb film. It only makes it far from perfect. I agree with IMDb's reviewer Taylor from Ottawa that night scenes in a steady rain by Bruno Nuytten create the perfect oppressive if somewhat awkward climate necessary for this theatrical plot to unfold. Enjoy if possible on a damp night !PS The remake Under suspicion... Hackman is fine but can't reach Michel's subtlety and yet how disagreeable he can be he seems born for this gifted neurotics roles. Monica Bellucci is nice but cannot carry the nostalgia Schneider exudes. W. Chisholm's review on Amazon is right she shows Visconti's training. Adaptations should only be made when improving on the original don't you think ?".

There is some kind of JE NE SAIS QUOI type of quality in him which makes him stand apart from the usual group of French actors. Garde  Vue sees him paired against Michel Serrault who is also considered as one of France's important actors.This entire film is their indispensable vehicle to deliberate about justicelaw and unusual methods of police procedures.A deft cat and mouse game with limited movement could be considered as this film's apt description.In the midst of these two towering figuresthere are also some minor figures who steal the show on their own.Director Claude Miller achieves this effect by casting Guy Marchand as a police inspector and Romy Schneider as the main suspect's wife.The dialogs penned by Michel Audiard have a certain kind of literary aura to them.This is one reason why viewers would be more interested in pricking up their ears in order not to miss any line.Film critic Lalit Rao saw this film during FrancoGerman mystery and thriller film festival organized by Alliance Franaise de Bangalore and Goethe Institut in 1992.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is an entertaining wellmade spy adventure set during World War I. Although made 60 years ago the film has a sophisticated approach to the relationship between its three main characters. In particular the natural attraction between the parts played by Conrad Veidt and Valerie Hobson is portrayed believably. Many of the supporting characters are also interesting look out for Hay Petrie as the Scottish engineer aboard a ferry and an early appearance by Bernard Miles as a hotel desk clerk. Unlike the majority of British movies of this period the film doesn't stereotype or make fun of its workingclass characters.The story has several good twists and an ironic climax. There are also some improbable coincidences but no more than the typical James Bond movie.Unlike Bond however The Spy in Black adopts a quite dark tone in its final 20 minutes. There is an almost tragic dignity and regret in the final scenes.Director Michael Powell composes some interestinglyframed shots that make good use of Vincent Korda's sets. One of his favourite devices is to set a key character in sharp focus in the background while lesser parts stand or move slightly outoffocus in the foreground. The effect is often quite striking.This film marks Powell's first collaboration with the Hungarian writer Emeric Pressburger. The maturity of the romance between the leads and the snappiness of the dialogue are probably attributable to Pressburger's European upbringing.Despite its age The Spy in Black is well worth seeing just for the simple pleasures of a wellmade entertainment executed with a little more care and imagination than usual.".

There are some unlikely aspects to the plot but on the whole this is well crafted WWI thriller with a remarkable level of moral complexity especially given that it was made and released just as England was entering a second war against Germany.The protagonist hero? played by the extraordinary Conrad Veidt is a German officer on a spy mission and he is in many respects a quite admirable character. For the first half of the film it's almost entirely from his point of view. It's hard to imagine Hollywood filmmakers EVER having the confidence that Powell and Pressberger clearly had in the intelligence of their audience allowing them to actually like and admire an enemy agent.While The Spy in Black eventually does come down squarely on the side of the English the agents of the Kaiser come off only as perhaps a hair more ruthless than those fighting for king and country.Of course the Germany that England would be fighting within a few a few months would be far far worse. This film is a potent reminder that while World War II might have a morally clear good war because of the vast evil of the Nazis World War I was a horse of a far grayer color.With sophisticated occasionally black humor this is a neat bit of oldfashioned movie entertainment with some genuinely intriguing differences.

	schema:headline " Clever wartime thriller that has darker tones than much propaganda";
	schema:reviewBody "During the World War a German Uboat comes up on the coast of Scotland.  At this point Captain Hardt leaves the vessel and travels to a small village to meet his contact.  He plans to use the treacherous assistance of bitter Royal Navy Lieutenant Ashington to guide the Germans to the spot of the British fleet.  However not all is fair in love and war and Hardt soon finds his operation at risk of compromise.Of course much more famous for The Red Shoes and A Matter of Life and Death this film from Powell and Pressburger should not be over looked. While it is of course propaganda released as it was in 1939 it is not a flag waving lets all kill the Nazi's under the bed style film.  Instead it stands up in it's own right as an exciting little thriller that makes some good points about the nature of war.  The plot is quite straightforward at first but has a few nice twists that I won't spoil and is generally enjoyable.The strength of the film for me was the focus on a German Officer and not having him as a stereotypical evil tyrant.  While the film doesn't let us wonder who the good guys and the bad guys are it does at least allow Hardt to be more of a full person and the film better as a result.  The ironies of the final action of the film is clear and is even more of a striking comment on war when you look at the blue on blue' stats for Gulf War 2.  Veidt does well in the lead as Hardt and is partly responsible for keeping him a bad guy without over egging the cake.  Shaw and Hobson are good but perhaps a little too much of the Heroic Brits' about them.Overall this is a good wartime thriller but the unusual tack that it comes at plus a darker and slightly subversive tone about it helps it stand out if not from the rest of PP's work then certainly from the vast majority of wartime propaganda thrillers made in Britain around the second world war.".

Having just watched the film on television I find that it thrilled me just as much as an octogenarian as it did when I was a teenager in 1939. In my view this is one of the finest of the 1930s British films. The fine quality of the direction and the talent of the principal actors and supporting cast make this a memorable piece of fiction which accurately reflects the narrow attitudes to manners that prevailed in remote parts of Scotland during the time of the first world war.".

Much too simple for most people today who would miss colour violence depravity unfathomable plot and shaky camera work in their spy films.Austere devilishly handsome German U Boat captain Conrad Veidt has convoluted spying mission in 1917 Scotland to locate the British fleet but finds himself being sidetracked with schoolmistress contact Valerie Hobson and the availability of butter. But even though WW1 is portrayed as more civilised than the coming war as in Colonel Blimp oil and water must always remain just so. There's a fine cast of British stalwarts for example the seemingly legless Hay Petrie some eccentric most with secrets and high production values generally disguising occasionally flimsy sets and occasional implausibility. Rosza's music was high class too nicely complementing the nitrate black and white film stock which unfortunately has been allowed to deteriorate over the years but sometimes unintentionally lets you believe it really is 1917 and not 1939. As with Colonel Blimp 4 years later the German viewpoint with a sympathetic lead is told with a seeming impartiality but after all there wasn't any doubt about the outcome. Even Chamberlain might've been hard to appease if Veidt's plans had been shown to bear fruit!Throwaway  so why can't I throw it away? Entertaining engrossing amusing nothing very heavy and even on the verge of war not a big flagwaver so it's just the type of film I enjoy.".

	schema:headline " A Gallant Enemy Commander in the Great War";
	schema:reviewBody "If one really wants to get a glimmer of what Conrad Veidt's career would have been like in American cinema but for the coming of World War II just as he came to Hollywood look at his British films from 1934 to 1940. In many respects his best work was done then  he had a wider variety of roles and was not typecast as villains as frequently as he was in the U.S. Among the films that I'd recommend watching is THE SPY IN BLACK.In World War I Veidt is the commander of a U.Boat sent to Scottish waters. He is told that there is a British naval officer who is willing to betray the Grand Fleet at Scapa Flow. Veidt is shown interacting with his crew at the beginning but he goes by life boat to the land and meets his contact Valerie Hobson. She introduces him to Sebastian Shaw the naval officer. Shaw seems to be drowning his anger in liquor but he is prepared to give Veidt a naval document about a sortie by the Grand Fleet on a particular date which would pass a narrow point the UBoat would be stationed at. Veidt would then be in a position to sink several of the British dreadnoughts in what would be the worst disaster to strike the fleet since UBoat Commander Weddigen sank the Hogue Aboukir and Cressy in September 1914.It's too good to be true. But gradually Veidt realizes it isn't true. He's been set up and Shaw and Hobson are trying to capture him. And the film becomes a chase  with Veidt running amongst the islanders in the Hebrides. But his conflict is that of the gentlemanly type. He will use force if necessary to still reach his boat and crew and try to do some damage to his enemy's ships. But he is not by nature cruel. A telling moment in the film is late in it when he commandeers a ferry boat. He is armed and he tells the adults that he won't hesitate to use his gun if necessary. But having said that he hears the crying of a baby that one of the woman on the ferry is carrying and his voice softens as he says that he certainly will not war against the innocent. Veidt never said anything like that in his Hollywood films  few Nazis as he himself would have been the first to point out from private knowledge would have hesitated in hurting an enemy's child or baby.The film was the best that Veidt made playing an enemy officer in either world war. It ends tragically but honorably for the man as he decides to join his crew for the last time.".

	onyx:emotionText "If one really wants to get a glimmer of what Conrad Veidt's career would have been like in American cinema but for the coming of World War II just as he came to Hollywood look at his British films from 1934 to 1940. In many respects his best work was done then  he had a wider variety of roles and was not typecast as villains as frequently as he was in the U.S. Among the films that I'd recommend watching is THE SPY IN BLACK.In World War I Veidt is the commander of a U.Boat sent to Scottish waters. He is told that there is a British naval officer who is willing to betray the Grand Fleet at Scapa Flow. Veidt is shown interacting with his crew at the beginning but he goes by life boat to the land and meets his contact Valerie Hobson. She introduces him to Sebastian Shaw the naval officer. Shaw seems to be drowning his anger in liquor but he is prepared to give Veidt a naval document about a sortie by the Grand Fleet on a particular date which would pass a narrow point the UBoat would be stationed at. Veidt would then be in a position to sink several of the British dreadnoughts in what would be the worst disaster to strike the fleet since UBoat Commander Weddigen sank the Hogue Aboukir and Cressy in September 1914.It's too good to be true. But gradually Veidt realizes it isn't true. He's been set up and Shaw and Hobson are trying to capture him. And the film becomes a chase  with Veidt running amongst the islanders in the Hebrides. But his conflict is that of the gentlemanly type. He will use force if necessary to still reach his boat and crew and try to do some damage to his enemy's ships. But he is not by nature cruel. A telling moment in the film is late in it when he commandeers a ferry boat. He is armed and he tells the adults that he won't hesitate to use his gun if necessary. But having said that he hears the crying of a baby that one of the woman on the ferry is carrying and his voice softens as he says that he certainly will not war against the innocent. Veidt never said anything like that in his Hollywood films  few Nazis as he himself would have been the first to point out from private knowledge would have hesitated in hurting an enemy's child or baby.The film was the best that Veidt made playing an enemy officer in either world war. It ends tragically but honorably for the man as he decides to join his crew for the last time.";

	schema:headline " The Archers' First Film";
	schema:reviewBody "The Spy in Black is often regarded as the first Archers film although it was not actually described as such Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger did not start to describe themselves as The Archers until One of Our Aircraft Is Missing from 1942. It was however the first film on which they worked together with Powell being credited as the director and Pressburger as one of the scriptwriters. In most of their later films Powell and Pressburger were to share a joint writer producerdirector credit. Most of The Archers' early collaborations were wartime propaganda films and The Spy in Black can also be regarded as such even though it was made before the outbreak of war. It actually opened in August 1939 a few days before the German invasion of Poland. The previous year Alfred Hitchcock had been forced to set another spy thriller The Lady Vanishes in a fictitious fascist dictatorship although it was clearly aimed at Nazi Germany. By 1939 however it was widely recognised that war was imminent and that there was no longer any point in British filmmakers trying to pretend that Germany was not a hostile power. The Spy in Black is therefore a World War I spy thriller doubtless made with the agenda of preparing the British people for the coming conflict and reminding them that they would soon need to be on guard against German spies. The action takes place in the Orkney Islands a remote part of Britain but one which took on great significance in both world wars because Scapa Flow the body of water lying between the main islands is one of the great natural harbours of the world and served as a British naval base. A later Archers film I Know Where I'm Going! was also set in a remote part of Scotland a country which Michael Powell loved. The story is set in 1917 a time when Germany was being brought close to starvation by a British naval blockade. There are numerous references in the script to the hardship which this was causing in Germany another piece of disguised propaganda to reassure the British people that British sea power had won the First World War partially true and that it would win any Second World War a prediction which was to be proved wrong by events. After the Battle of Jutland the German surface fleet did not dare to leave port so Captain Hardt a German submarine commander is ordered to lead an attack on the British Fleet. He puts ashore on the islands to make contact with a German spy Fraulein Tiel who is posing as the local schoolmistress. Tiel introduces him to Lieutenant Ashington a disgraced British naval officer who is offering to betray his country for money and to reveal vital secrets about British ship movements. There are however to be further developments which leave Hardt wondering whether Tiel and Ashington are really what they claim to be. The film is in many ways similar to an Alfred Hitchcock thriller although the Hitchcock film with which it has most in common is not one of his British spy thrillers from the thirties like The 39 Steps or The Lady Vanishes but rather with Notorious which was not to be made until 1946. Both Hardt and Ashington fall in love with the beautiful young Fraulein Tiel leading to a lovetriangle reminiscent of that between the characters played by Ingrid Bergman Cary Grant and Claude Rains in the later film. There are two particularly fine performances from the lovely Valerie Hobson and Conrad Veidt later to become famous for his role in Casablanca. Although Hardt is German he is really the central character in the film playing a more prominent role than any of the British characters and is many ways a sympathetic one being played as an honourable officer and gentleman rather than a villainous thug which is how German officers were generally portrayed in British propaganda. This sort of characterisation however was to become typical of Pressburger's writing even in films written after war had broken out he never lost sight of the fact that the enemy were human and most of his wartime films include at least one good German such as Theo in Colonel Blimp. The film contains one glaring plot hole at the end when the UBoat surfaces to try and sink the Orkney Islands ferry would a submarine on a vital secret mission really have given itself away in order to sink so insignificant a target especially in an area where British warships are known to be operating? This however would really be my only complaint. The Spy in Black may have been made as a quota quickie films made quickly and cheaply to fulfill a government requirement that British cinemas show a minimum number of British films but it is an exciting wellmade thriller which asks some pertinent questions about patriotism loyalty and the moral dilemmas of war. For a quickie there is also some very attractive photography of the Orkney coastal scenery shot on location. I would not rate this film quite as highly as the Archers' great war films like 49th Parallel Colonel Blimp and A Matter of Life and Death but it certainly points the way towards them. 710".

	schema:reviewBody "It's a surprising movie. It's set in 1917 in the middle of the First World War and it was released in 1939 a year in which Britain was at war with Germany. Yet the opening scenes show us Conrad Veidt and his officers returning from a successful cruise on their Uboat and they're given a respectable showing slightly comic. After sixteen days of subsistence on tinned sardines and herring they cheerfully order a stew at their hotel only to be told that it's a meatless day. Veidt is treated with respect and even sympathy. They aren't at all the sneering Nazi bastards that would show up in some later war films.Veidt and crew are sent on a mission to the Orkney Islands near the Grand Fleet where they will meet a young woman who is a German agent. Cut to a young woman on her way to the Orkney Islands to become the new head school mistress. The young lady is June Duprez. She's one of those British actresses like Merle Oberon who from certain angles are so near feminine perfection that they defy description. Duprez' eyes are catlike only lacking vertical pupils. Neither she nor Oberon had careers that really took off probably because they were mediocre actresses. Yet  yum.Is June Duprez the spy that Veidt is meant to contact? Certainly not. In fact Duprez' is etherized kidnapped by the innocentseeming German agents and held in a remote stone cottage while a agenuine German agent substitutes herself. The agent is Valerie Hobson. Now Hobson herself is no slouch when it comes to pulchritude but it's a qualitatively different order of attractiveness. Duprez looks like she should be seated on your lap and stroked. Hobson's beauty is arid elongated elegant and impenetrable. If she were any more statuesque she'd look as if being drawn through a black hole in space. Her appeal is of the genre that suggests any intimacy between you might lead to your having a red rubber ball strapped in your mouth. Later when Veidt puts some moves on the fake schoolteacher she shoes him off and says You're not one of my pupils. Hm.Veidt's submarine makes its way the the Isle of Hoy in the Orkneys and he goes ashore on a motorbike to rendezvous with the local German agent. While rehearsing the plans with his officers he's compelled to recite Die Lorelei a poem by Heinrich Heine which I once thought was just an anonymous folk song. Heine who died in 1851 was one of Germany's bestknown poets and one of the good guys in that the Nazis hated his work and burned his books. Anyway the officers get a kick out of seeing their stern captain spout poetry.On the island Hobson puts Veidt up in a room. Veidt refuses to remove his uniform. If I'm going to be shot it will be as an officer not a spy. He doesn't know it but he's stumbled into a trap a little too complicated to explain. Everything turns out to the advantage of the British but the Germans however many mistakes they make are never deprived of dignity and pride. The print available on YouTube is one of the most crisply defined I've watched. The model work is of the period but there are some fine shots of destroyers and cruisers at sea. All in all it's a wellmade and thoroughly entertaining film.".

	schema:headline " Excellent British naval espionage thriller of the thirties";
	schema:reviewBody "This film was the first collaboration between Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger. In this case Michael Powell was the director at which he did a superb job and Pressburger wrote the screenplay based upon a story by J. Storer Clouston. Four of Clouston's novels were filmed one twice between 1917 and 1939 this being the last. The other which tends to be known by cinastes gave the story to Marcel Carn's farce set in Victorian London DROLE DE DRAME 1937. This film set in the First World War is notable for the first credited appearance in a feature film of Marius Goring who the following year would be so brilliant in the mystery film THE CASE OF THE FRIGHTENED LADY 1940 see my review and go on to a splendid career. Here he plays Lieutenant Schuster second in command of the German submarine U29. The captain of that submarine is played by one of my favourite actors of the period Conrad Veidt whose early death only four years later at the age of only 50 was a great loss to the cinema despite the fact that by that time he had already made 118 films maybe that's what killed him! Veidt is as usual noted for his gravitas and presence and does an excellent job despite there not being any character development or any scenes offering any particular acting challenge. The female lead is Valerie Hobson who instead of being her usual beautiful and romantic self here has to play an icy German agent. But in fact she is really a double agent i.e. a British agent posing as a German agent. When she is being a British agent she is very nice but when she is being a German agent she is horrid. And of course that is very appropriate. This film was produced just before the Second World War began and was a useful 'shot across the bow' of the complacent Chamberlain faction reminding the public of the dangers of the Hun. In fact we see lots of real shots across the bow in this film because it involves naval espionage and naval actions. A considerable amount of real footage of the British fleet is incorporated in the film showing many ships which must have been sunk within two or three years of the filming. We see battleships firing their guns depths charges being fired by destroyers ships travelling in convoy and military historians can only react with glee at all these glimpses of the British Navy as it was just before hostilities with Germany recommenced. For the modern DVD the film has been perfectly and lovingly remastered and restored by the British Film Institute's restoration team those insufficiently appreciated heroes of the cinema who by their expertise have preserved so much that is precious of our cinematic heritage which would otherwise have been lost. For one of their greatest triumphs see the amazing silent film UNDERGROUND of 1928 and my review of it. As for the story of this film it is rather complicated and a gripping yarn. Helen Haye who so dominated THE CASE OF THE FRIGHTENED LADY mentioned above appears here as an arrogant and domineering German spy masquerading as an English aristocrat in a Rolls Royce who throws a charming young girl off a cliff and into the sea without a qualm because she wishes to steal her identity for another German agent. The film is set in the Orkney Islands good location footage there and the German agent is meant to impersonate the new schoolmistress at Long Hope in order to spy upon the British Fleet at anchor in Scapa Flow. Veidt arrives by submarine to link up with her at her schoolhouse. One extraordinary feature of the story is that he brings a motorcycle with him in his submarine and lands it on the Orkneys in order to convince people that he must be a local as how could anyone who was not a local and had arrived by submarine possibly have a motorcycle. What an amusing touch! It must be the first time in fiction or history that anyone ever transported his motorcycle underwater to an espionage rendezvous. Or do US Navy Seals and British SAS do this all the time one wonders. After all a motorcycle could be useful in getting from one end of a submarine to anther quickly couldn't it? I mean if one wanted to countermand an order or just have a sandwich. But the German agent who was meant to be the schoolmistress has herself been supplanted by Valerie Hobson who just happens to speak perfect German. She seems really to do this so perhaps Valerie Hobson was actually a plant all along for her entire film career secretly working for Hitler which is why she married a British cabinet minister? That is a joke folks please do not sue. Here Valerie Hobson is married to a British naval officer who pretends to be betraying his country but is not really doing so. The film is really very good indeed and also shows us what stuffedshirts the local Scots were back then. I remember being stuck in Edinburgh on a Sunday long ago and being astonished to discover that all the cinemas and pubs were closed because it was 'the Lord's Day of Rest' and enjoying oneself was thought to be sinful. At the risk of being controversial might I suggest that the true origins of the Taliban may lie deep within the recesses of the Scottish Kirk? And another thing while I am on the subject of Scotland they eat the most disgusting thing in the world which is called 'white pudding'. I would rather eat a bowl of sheep's eyes any day than face another Scottish 'white pudding'. I won't try to describe it but I leave its horrors to the imaginations of all fortunate enough never to have encountered one.".

But in fact she is really a double agent i.e. a British agent posing as a German agent. When she is being a British agent she is very nice but when she is being a German agent she is horrid. And of course that is very appropriate. This film was produced just before the Second World War began and was a useful 'shot across the bow' of the complacent Chamberlain faction reminding the public of the dangers of the Hun. In fact we see lots of real shots across the bow in this film because it involves naval espionage and naval actions. A considerable amount of real footage of the British fleet is incorporated in the film showing many ships which must have been sunk within two or three years of the filming. We see battleships firing their guns depths charges being fired by destroyers ships travelling in convoy and military historians can only react with glee at all these glimpses of the British Navy as it was just before hostilities with Germany recommenced. For the modern DVD the film has been perfectly and lovingly remastered and restored by the British Film Institute's restoration team those insufficiently appreciated heroes of the cinema who by their expertise have preserved so much that is precious of our cinematic heritage which would otherwise have been lost. For one of their greatest triumphs see the amazing silent film UNDERGROUND of 1928 and my review of it. As for the story of this film it is rather complicated and a gripping yarn. Helen Haye who so dominated THE CASE OF THE FRIGHTENED LADY mentioned above appears here as an arrogant and domineering German spy masquerading as an English aristocrat in a Rolls Royce who throws a charming young girl off a cliff and into the sea without a qualm because she wishes to steal her identity for another German agent. The film is set in the Orkney Islands good location footage there and the German agent is meant to impersonate the new schoolmistress at Long Hope in order to spy upon the British Fleet at anchor in Scapa Flow. Veidt arrives by submarine to link up with her at her schoolhouse. One extraordinary feature of the story is that he brings a motorcycle with him in his submarine and lands it on the Orkneys in order to convince people that he must be a local as how could anyone who was not a local and had arrived by submarine possibly have a motorcycle. What an amusing touch! It must be the first time in fiction or history that anyone ever transported his motorcycle underwater to an espionage rendezvous. Or do US Navy Seals and British SAS do this all the time one wonders. After all a motorcycle could be useful in getting from one end of a submarine to anther quickly couldn't it? I mean if one wanted to countermand an order or just have a sandwich. But the German agent who was meant to be the schoolmistress has herself been supplanted by Valerie Hobson who just happens to speak perfect German. She seems really to do this so perhaps Valerie Hobson was actually a plant all along for her entire film career secretly working for Hitler which is why she married a British cabinet minister? That is a joke folks please do not sue. Here Valerie Hobson is married to a British naval officer who pretends to be betraying his country but is not really doing so. The film is really very good indeed and also shows us what stuffedshirts the local Scots were back then. I remember being stuck in Edinburgh on a Sunday long ago and being astonished to discover that all the cinemas and pubs were closed because it was 'the Lord's Day of Rest' and enjoying oneself was thought to be sinful. At the risk of being controversial might I suggest that the true origins of the Taliban may lie deep within the recesses of the Scottish Kirk? And another thing while I am on the subject of Scotland they eat the most disgusting thing in the world which is called 'white pudding'. I would rather eat a bowl of sheep's eyes any day than face another Scottish 'white pudding'. I won't try to describe it but I leave its horrors to the imaginations of all fortunate enough never to have encountered one.";

	schema:reviewBody "The Spy in Black 1939 seems like it would be your standard spy thriller with a heaping helping of Allied propaganda but it is much more than that. It's as much a humanist dramedy as it is an espionage picture. The World War I setting allows Conrad Veidt's German submarine captain to be honorable charming and even romantic despite his status as the enemy. Valerie Hobson is understated and effective as the English double agent who finds herself falling for Veidt against her better judgement. The sexual tension between them is palpable bringing an erotic energy to already tense scenes between them. The movie ends on a note of melancholy with a sense of weariness that humaneness and tenderness mean nothing in the face of war.This is one of director Michael Powell's earlier efforts and you can see even now his magic. I would not put TSIB in the same category as The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp Black Narcissus or my personal favorite The Red Shoes but it is an above average movie well worth your time. And of course fans of Conrad Veidt well you won't want to miss out either.".

In the fullness of one reel Hobson is installed in the schoolteacher's cottage and has rendezvoused with Veidt the plan is for a team of Uboats to assemble and sink half the British fleet at Scapa Flow with the help of a disgruntled Royal Navy Officer. Of course what transpires is the equivalent of 'it was all a dream' the disgruntled Navy type Sebastian Shaw is really a counterspy as is Hobson and THEIR plan is to lure as many Uboats as possible into the area then drop a few dozen depthcharges where they will do the most good.It's not ALL bad of course.

	schema:headline " Powell and Pressburger at their finest";
	schema:reviewBody "This wonderfully charming film from the Powell and Pressburger team is probably their most underrated great work the most recent Sight and Sound Critics Poll of British films didn't even include this gem in the top 100. If it means anything Trainspotting was in the top 10.What elevates the film beyond other lighthearted romances is chiefly the impeccable acting and tight screenplay by Emeric Pressburger probably the greatest English screenwriter to have ever lived. This might be generic laudation to any film but by no means is Wendy Hiller's performance generic. As the young golddiggertype woman Hiller is slightly bewildered at being sidetracked to the Scottish natives but she is much more fluxed when she realizes she is falling for a common Scotsman and not the rich lord she envisioned. So what is the reaction to this bafflement? A fierce sense of panic that is very honest in its depiction of desperation. It might be puzzling to the viewer why our heroine should seek royalty so vehemently but because of Hiller's expert frenzied facial tics we see her slowly realize her ridiculousness herself. In an age where critics desire constant plausibility and believability in romances Pressburger reminds us that attraction is something that can largely be out of our control. Hiller's character an obsessive control freak is the perfect example of one who cannot comprehend this fact.The perfect foil for Hiller's hysteria of course is Rover Livesey's softspoken Torquil Macneil. Before Ashton Kucherlike effete twigs came to dominate onscreen masculinity or Vin Diesellike musclestudded goons on the other extreme the quiet dignity and charisma of a man like Livesey could light up a screen without any histrionics or wrestling moves. Those still looking for romantic realism will recognize that like Hiller's character Livesey is just as strongwilled and more importantly is a match in wits and a counterbalance in earnest worldweary personality. Their mutual attraction is perfectly played out in the strangely electric silences as much as the dialogue.But the performances enhance what is already a remarkable script. The very basic premise of the love story can be read by many other astute reviewers on this website who also see the merits of this film. Powell and Pressburger have always been smart enough to embed their love stories with some heavy ideas in The Red Shoes it was love vs. art in I Know Where I'm Going! it is love vs. money. Sounds simple enough but unlike other romances these filmmakers can glean insights on the definition of poverty. While primitive the one phone in town is at the post office and poor the staff in charge there can't break change for a pound the villagers are portrayed affectionately with class dignity and culture especially in a wonderful dance scene that seems to affectionately embody both a small community's close familiarity with one another as well as the drunken festival spirit. Like Livesey's character says at one point in the film They aren't poor they just haven't got any money. It's a succinct but revealing statement about the human condition in a time where money did not necessarily determine one's social class because of many other admirable factors. Contrast this cultural milieu with a film like 8 Mile in which the characters are real if they are from the streets or living with trailer trash parents and phony if they have an education from a private school and you can see how our selfimportant attitudes are progressing.Lastly I must mention that this is one of the most exquisitely photographed black and white films I have ever seen and the Criterion remastering does the film ample justice. I have been harping on the merits of the highmindedness of Pressburger but the appropriate plaudits must be dealt for Powell's emotionally expressive vistas that equal his achievements in The Edge of the World. From the craggy peaks of the highest cliffs or the frothy waves of every bank the film's mystic sense of ambiance is drawn by a foggy mist that pervades most scenes. For once grand scenery doesn't dwarf the characters every picturesque shot either captures the characters in the beauty of the element or is intended as a complement to the characters' emotions. It's a great film.".

As the young golddiggertype woman Hiller is slightly bewildered at being sidetracked to the Scottish natives but she is much more fluxed when she realizes she is falling for a common Scotsman and not the rich lord she envisioned. So what is the reaction to this bafflement? A fierce sense of panic that is very honest in its depiction of desperation. It might be puzzling to the viewer why our heroine should seek royalty so vehemently but because of Hiller's expert frenzied facial tics we see her slowly realize her ridiculousness herself. In an age where critics desire constant plausibility and believability in romances Pressburger reminds us that attraction is something that can largely be out of our control. Hiller's character an obsessive control freak is the perfect example of one who cannot comprehend this fact.The perfect foil for Hiller's hysteria of course is Rover Livesey's softspoken Torquil Macneil. Before Ashton Kucherlike effete twigs came to dominate onscreen masculinity or Vin Diesellike musclestudded goons on the other extreme the quiet dignity and charisma of a man like Livesey could light up a screen without any histrionics or wrestling moves. Those still looking for romantic realism will recognize that like Hiller's character Livesey is just as strongwilled and more importantly is a match in wits and a counterbalance in earnest worldweary personality. Their mutual attraction is perfectly played out in the strangely electric silences as much as the dialogue.But the performances enhance what is already a remarkable script. The very basic premise of the love story can be read by many other astute reviewers on this website who also see the merits of this film. Powell and Pressburger have always been smart enough to embed their love stories with some heavy ideas in The Red Shoes it was love vs. art in I Know Where I'm Going! it is love vs. money. Sounds simple enough but unlike other romances these filmmakers can glean insights on the definition of poverty. While primitive the one phone in town is at the post office and poor the staff in charge there can't break change for a pound the villagers are portrayed affectionately with class dignity and culture especially in a wonderful dance scene that seems to affectionately embody both a small community's close familiarity with one another as well as the drunken festival spirit. Like Livesey's character says at one point in the film They aren't poor they just haven't got any money. It's a succinct but revealing statement about the human condition in a time where money did not necessarily determine one's social class because of many other admirable factors. Contrast this cultural milieu with a film like 8 Mile in which the characters are real if they are from the streets or living with trailer trash parents and phony if they have an education from a private school and you can see how our selfimportant attitudes are progressing.Lastly I must mention that this is one of the most exquisitely photographed black and white films I have ever seen and the Criterion remastering does the film ample justice. I have been harping on the merits of the highmindedness of Pressburger but the appropriate plaudits must be dealt for Powell's emotionally expressive vistas that equal his achievements in The Edge of the World. From the craggy peaks of the highest cliffs or the frothy waves of every bank the film's mystic sense of ambiance is drawn by a foggy mist that pervades most scenes. For once grand scenery doesn't dwarf the characters every picturesque shot either captures the characters in the beauty of the element or is intended as a complement to the characters' emotions. It's a great film.";

It gives you a Scotland that really exists if you aren't lucky enough to visit someday you can visit by slipping into your jammies brewing up some tea putting out all the lights and watching this movie.Star Wendy Hiller was memorable when she was younger for her Eliza Doolittle opposite Leslie Howard's Henry Higgins. When she was a bit older she played Paul Scofield's  St. Thomas More's wife in A Man for All Seasons.Here Hiller plays Joan a driven golddigger who is given pause for thought by a lessthanwealthy but highly noble Scottish Laird Roger Livesy whom she can't escape from when a gale postpones her marriage which was scheduled to occur on an isolated island. Joan's groom was to be a nouveau riche industrialist who is renting the island and who happens to be old enough to be her father. As Joan's scandalized father himself points out.

A few corrections Joan Webster the heroine does not have a private income she got to know her fianc because he's the owner of Consolidated Chemical Industries where she works.  It's not clear from the film but apparently Powell and Pressburger said she is supposed to be a chemist not a receptionist at CCI.  Also the money her father gives her is not an allowance from him but her own savings  she's cleaning out her bank account.  The reason he has the money is because he's a bank manager and presumably her account is with his bank.Also her fianc Sir Robert Belinger a rich industrialist was probably knighted for services to the crown but I don't think he's a lord and I don't think that Torquil MacNeil the hero is descended from royalty just the local aristocracy.Somebody mentioned a witch's curse.  A family curse certainly is part of the story but the woman who started it was not a witch and no one ever had a better reason for cursing someone than she did and in the end of course it turns out not to be a curse at all!I read a review saying that the film is great but Wendy Hiller is too unsympathetic as Joan.  Where???  If I had to decide what I love best about this film after the whole atmosphere it would be Wendy Hiller's performance.  She starts out as a sophisticated slightly brittle city girl but as the story unfolds you can just feel the vulnerability and deep emotions under the brittle shell as if it were happening to you.  Now that's acting!I always look forward to the scene at Port Erraig when Joan arrives expecting the boat that will take her to Kiloran and the islands start to cast their spell on us.  In the fog all you can see is the mysterious outlines of the people waiting there and the music fits the scene.  I especially love the seals singing  I wonder if seals really do sing like that?  The Gaelic contributes to the atmosphere too  I'd love to ask someone who knows Gaelic if they're speaking the real thing and if the accents of the actors are right!Other favorites Pamela Brown's luminous performance as Catriona MacLean the eagletraining Colonel the chemistry between the two leads the onlocation filming Roger Livesey's voice especially in the scene at Moy Castle where he begins I'd better introduce myself  I'm a sucker for that one! and the underlying message of the film.  Others have mentioned Petula Clark's small but notable performance as Cheryl. I think Powell and Pressburger did a fine job of showing Cheryl as a real child here not as a sickeningly sweet Hollywood child.  Cheryl is different from her affectionate but oblivious parents and different again from Joan.Has anybody else noticed that the timing is off in this film?  The story works both dramatically and emotionally but the timing is wrong!  The most obvious slip is that Torquil announces at least twice that he has eight days' leave from the navy.  On the second full day at Achnacroish he says that he has six more days which is about right but the next day they attempt to cross to Kiloran and the day after that he's headed back to his ship which leaves at least three days unaccounted for!  A small thing at Catriona's house Torquil tells Joan that he's known the island of Kiloran for 29 years and she replies I shouldn't have thought you as old as that. I'm sorry Roger Livesey looks good but he looks his age late 30s early 40s  I believe he was 39 when he made the movie not under 29!Anyway this is a quiet but wonderful movie.  Watch it more than once if necessary and give it a chance to work its magic on you  you'll be glad you did!".

I'm sorry Roger Livesey looks good but he looks his age late 30s early 40s  I believe he was 39 when he made the movie not under 29!Anyway this is a quiet but wonderful movie.  Watch it more than once if necessary and give it a chance to work its magic on you  you'll be glad you did!";

	schema:reviewBody "The title I Know Where I'm Going refers to a declaration made by the film's heroine Joan Webster Wendy Hiller a middleclass English girl who's determined to get to the top of the social rung by any means legal. Thus at the story's outset we learn she has just become engaged to Sir Robert Bellinger one of the richest industrialists in Britain. She knows where she's going all right To the Scottish isle of Killoran by train and by boat where her future as Lady Bellinger is to be confirmed in matrimony. Yet as far as Joan is concerned Killoran may as well be a distant planet for either thick fog or a high wind makes it impossible for her to ferry across to Gretna Green. It's as if the atmosphere something in the climate or perhaps the old legends and superstitions that proliferate the Highlands are conspiring to keep her from obtaining everything she's ever wanted from the time she was a child. It's obvious to the Scottish locals that the island of Killoran is highly suspect as the key to Joan's future happiness. Yet she is stubborn even bribing a boy to pilot a small boat to Killoran in the midst of a huge squall  a move that proves nearly fatal. She's determined to get where she is going but she's turned away  by the elements as well as by a slow realization that she has become emotionally attached to a naval officer on leave Roger Livesey who she has just encountered. Michael Powell the director keeps things moving at an agreeable pace. There isn't a single wasted motion in this modest little film. The minor characters are memorable Pamela Brown as Catriona who is introduced silhouetted against the gray Northern sky her hand tethered to a leash restraining dogs as they make their way up a brae Finley Curray whose weatherbeaten face says more about his salty character than the terse excellent dialogue he is given and there's a cameo by a preteen Petula Clark.".

I never ever tire of watching this movie.  It is a beautiful picture in every way.  On the one hand it is perfectly crafted with extraordinary visuals a new visual trick every minute said Powell and on the other the story is a gem of romanticism.  The movie is ultimately about Wendy Hiller's character coming to terms with her emotions with her romanticism with the idea that love is something one cannot and should not control and that the greatest thing about love is allowing it to wash over you and transform you.  Hiller is transformed and the process is a miraculous sight to behold.  You will be transformed too. The movie gets you to experience the process of falling in love and it does so through a magnificent story and acting and directing choices which especially use the Hebrides landscape to sort of cast a spell on the characters and on you.  The landscape is one of the most special elements of this picture.  See how carefully Hiller's train journey is presented..... it's like she's being transported to another world a powerful world of romanticism and emotion.On the surface there is not much plot to this picture. But underneath there is so much going on that the movie is tremendously engaging on an emotional level. It also contains what I think is the greatest most joyous movie wedding of all time!".

Never a really pretty woman her supporting costar in Major Barbara Deborah Kerr actually was far better looking  and would have more romantic roles Hiller ended in pretty rich character parts.

It is Joan Webster in the Powell and Pressburger film I Know Where I'M Going. She is a lively and intelligent woman but fairly ordinary looking. Which may explain why her romantic partner in this film is Roger Livesey as Torquil Macneil. Livesey is a distinguished actor too but hardly a handsome man. The two balance very nicely.Joan we are told was alway assured about how to manage her life from the age of ten. She intended from her youth to marry well i.e. a man of wealth and position. And we learn that she is now headed for the Hebrides in northern Scotland. Her fianc is a wealthy man building a mansion on an island up there. He plans to marry her in the mansion. It seems a reasonable set up until Joan reaches the one port across the narrow seas about fifteen miles from the island. It seems the seas are quite rough and the weather is not calming down yet. It would be suicidal to take a small row boat across the sea in this weather. Joan is flummoxed by this as she had no plans to spend much time in the seaport.What follows is the slow reeducation of Joan. Firstly she finds her admiration for her rich boyfriend is not universal. Most of the locals think of him as a stranger or a fool one can't imagine why he wants a swimming pool on his island mansion  he has the entire ocean around him to swim in!. Then she discovers that these common people have lives of interest and intensity of their own. And the person who is awakening her to this slow realization is Torquil. A local Laird he has much personal interaction with the people who give him their respect and affection but he is like many nobles land poor he has some land but no money. Torquil is capable of lecturing Joan when she still tries to get to that island if she can get one of the locals risk it berating her for risking the lives of some others by promises of money they need. But he also keeps showing the small joys of the locals such as their dances and anniversaries. He also shows her the ruins of the ancient kingdom of Scotland including a tower where a lovers' tragedy occurred in the far distant past. And slowly Joan begins to realize that perhaps she should look at less pragmatic reasons to marry.I Know Where I'm Going is not as well remembered as later Powell and Pressburger films like A Matter Of Life And Death Stairway To Heaven Black Narcissus in my opinion their masterpiece or The Red Shoes.

	schema:headline " A joyous and lively Scottish romance";
	schema:reviewBody "The collaborations between Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger represent one of the most respected partnerships in cinema history the two directors long revered for crafting some of the most enduring pictures ever to come out of the United Kingdom. Pressburger once said of his colleague He knows what I am going to say even before I say it  maybe even before I have thought it  and that is very rare. You are lucky if you meet someone like that once in your life. Though I had previously seen and loved 'Peeping Tom 1960' Powell's solo effort a shocking and daring horrorthriller that arguably brought down his career I remained keenly interested in seeing my first PP collaboration and so I was delighted to find the Criterion Collection DVD of 'I Know Where I'm Going! 1945.' Perhaps it's the extensive onlocation photography or the distinctive local accents but there's something about this film that sets it apart from Hollywood romances of the era in the same way that the Ealing Studios comedies of the 1940s and 50s are like nothing ever to come out of the United States.The first thing you'll notice about 'I Know Where I'm Going!' is the absolutely exquisite cinematography by Erwin Hillier who captures the Scottish countryside in glorious crisp blackandwhite shooting the entire film without a light meter. The pristine landscapes are absolutely breathtaking you can almost feel the soft breeze blowing against your face the silent shudder of the trees as a storm rolls overhead. This environment is the perfect stage for the events of the film as ambitious and independent Englishwoman Joan Webster Wendy Hiller comes to meet an array of lively and freespirited locals representing a simpler lifestyle that she could never have imagined falling in love with. 'I Know Where I'm Going!' is also a miracle of clever editing considering the male costar Roger Livesey never came within 500 miles of the primary shooting location having an unavoidable stage commitment in London. Editor John Seabourne was given the monumental task of seamlessly blending closeup shots of Livesey in the studio with middledistance shots of the actor's double in Scotland the result is perfectly deceptive.Powell and Pressburger as was typical for their pictures shared a writing credit for the film which is a celebration of the common man a popular theme of British cinema I've found during that time period. Wendy Hiller's heroine an independent but somewhat conceited woman is hampered in her attempts to join her older wealthier fianc Sir Robert Bellinger on the island of Kiloran. Instead she is left with Torquil MacNeil Roger Livesey a humble naval officer on leave from the military. Despite initially feeling foreign and uncomfortable in the unfamiliar lodgings of the locals Joan eventually comes to appreciate their unashamed simplicity most noticeable in the stark contrast between the upperclass residents' dull stuffy bridge game and the servants' lively and musical birthday celebration for one of their oldest residents. Despite her insistence that she knows where she's going Joan also discovers that fate might be nudging her in a completely different direction. Why can't she travel to the island to marry Sir Bellinger? The answer to this question might not have anything to do with the weather at all perhaps deep down she knows that she can do a lot better.".

	onyx:emotionText "The collaborations between Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger represent one of the most respected partnerships in cinema history the two directors long revered for crafting some of the most enduring pictures ever to come out of the United Kingdom. Pressburger once said of his colleague He knows what I am going to say even before I say it  maybe even before I have thought it  and that is very rare. You are lucky if you meet someone like that once in your life. Though I had previously seen and loved 'Peeping Tom 1960' Powell's solo effort a shocking and daring horrorthriller that arguably brought down his career I remained keenly interested in seeing my first PP collaboration and so I was delighted to find the Criterion Collection DVD of 'I Know Where I'm Going! 1945.' Perhaps it's the extensive onlocation photography or the distinctive local accents but there's something about this film that sets it apart from Hollywood romances of the era in the same way that the Ealing Studios comedies of the 1940s and 50s are like nothing ever to come out of the United States.The first thing you'll notice about 'I Know Where I'm Going!' is the absolutely exquisite cinematography by Erwin Hillier who captures the Scottish countryside in glorious crisp blackandwhite shooting the entire film without a light meter. The pristine landscapes are absolutely breathtaking you can almost feel the soft breeze blowing against your face the silent shudder of the trees as a storm rolls overhead. This environment is the perfect stage for the events of the film as ambitious and independent Englishwoman Joan Webster Wendy Hiller comes to meet an array of lively and freespirited locals representing a simpler lifestyle that she could never have imagined falling in love with.

	schema:reviewBody "It may have been a timefiller project for Powell and Pressburger who were waiting for access to Technicolor cameras they needed for A Matter of Life and Death but I Know Where I'm Going! is no throwaway quickie. In fact it's an important step in their evolution from crafters of taut wartime thrillers to creators of fantastical dream worlds. Here they broaden their horizons by actually inventing their own legends as a backdrop for a standard yet very tender romance.One of the reasons the Archers made such consistently strong pictures was that both Powell and Pressburger absolutely understood each other's roles. Although Pressburger was the writer and Powell the director they dabbled enough in each other's work to give themselves joint credit. Powell understood in ways some other directors fail to that his job was to serve the screenplay and bring out the essence of the story without overshadowing the material with director's ego. Powell was by his nature a showy director and this actually spoils some of his preArchers material. By now he had learnt to rein in his visual razzmatazz in a little and employ it where it would be most effective.In this film the more obtrusive end of Powell's directorial style is mostly confined to the introductory scenes. As the script calls for a voiceover to introduce the heroine of the story Powell's camera also speaks directly to the audience with some attentiongrabbing whippans drawing us towards the subject. Later once the story proper begins in Scotland the simplicity of the natural beauty and subtle love story are allowed to takeover. Once or twice Powell does go too far however for example surrounding Wendy Hiller with a whirlpool of superimposed images  portraying her turmoil in a far too literal way. Powell was quite capable of getting the same effect from framing and staging not to mention the abilities of the actors.When Powell relies upon more straightforward constructions he is superb. After the introduction has bluntly revealed to us that Hiller's character is confident and headstrong  the story then proceeds to reverse that image and show her a fish out of water amongst the earthy highland folk. This is not directly conveyed in the script but Powell shows it by framing her separately in group scenes or sometimes dwarfed amongst them. He deftly shows the blossoming romance between Hiller and Livesy by first showing them in midshot then gradually introducing a few welltimed closeups and expressive lighting as their feelings grow. Pressburger's characters tend to speak the bare facts without revealing their thoughts. It is up to Powell and the cast to supply the true emotional content.Speaking of cast another strength of the Archers partnership was that in virtually all their pictures there is no a weak link among the performers. They seem to have selected actors for what they could uniquely bring to a role often casting against type to give a fresh feel to what were very often stock characters. The players perhaps grateful for the change tended to turn in good performances as a result. Powell also had a talent for spotting the lead actor in the bit player and the supporting actor in the nonprofessional  an example of that here being Esmond Knight's uncle and reallife falconer as Colonel Barnstaple. The real standout however is Pamela Brown who brings the necessary depth to her small yet pivotal role.Somewhere along the line the script for I Know Where I'm Going! ended up at Paramount studios where it was used as an example to struggling writers of a perfect screenplay. And it really is that rare thing. By creating its own mythology  the Corryvreckan legend and the Curse of the MacNeils  it enhances the fairytale aspect of the romance without totally divorcing it from reality. It's a fairly short film because there is no unnecessary material and the structure is expertly balanced. Furthermore it allows for directorial interpretation without being too vague. A smaller less colourful entry in the Archers' canon yet nevertheless one of their best.".

	schema:headline " Charming and breezy romantic gem from Powell  Pressburger";
	schema:reviewBody "My first attempt at writing a review of this film came out two pages long  that's how much I'm bursting to say about this wonderful gem from the unique and special Powell  Pressburger 40s and 50s filmmaking partnership. It's a sweet and simple romance and a hymn to the Hebrides and to its people living an organic life bound to the earth in a way which feels very modern today. It's also thoroughly original eccentric but not merely whimsical.In the closing years of WWII Joan Webster Wendy Hiller a young ambitious independent woman from the South of England travels to a remote Scottish island for her wedding heedlessly determined to skip the queue and marry into social status and of course money.   Small spoilers from here on.   Before she can reach her destination she runs into the only things that can stop her in her headlong course the changeable Hebridean weather and love in the form of Torquil MacNeil the excellent Roger Livesey who she only later finds out is the true Laird of Kiloran the island on which her husbandtobe rich old industrialist Sir Robert Bellinger is living and playing the little king.There's something almost fierce rather than attractive in Joan. But despite her wilful certainty that she knows what's best for herself she has an earnest intelligent gaze ready to do and dare anything thanks Mrs Gaskell. She meets her match in Torquil known to all the islanders as Kiloran reinforcing the actual and metaphysical notion that he IS the land. Livesey's portrayal is inexpressibly charismatic his kindly nature and those big speaking eyes full of pathos his breezy intelligent delivery. You believe utterly that he's a Laird he carries his authority and quiet nobility in his voice his gait it's part of his sense of self transcending the war and the absence of money.Knowing Kiloran and his friends gradually alters Joan's perception of the world addressing her impatience her inability to understand spiritual wealth. Joan says at one point to Kiloran of the people of Tobermory they're poor then? No they just haven't any money. Isn't it the same thing? Oh no they're completely different. She doesn't understand but as he says Kiloran's a patient man. He's drawn to her he's seen enough to believe that the prize  that this bold brave young woman has the capacity to understand and appreciate him and his world  is worth waiting for.But if he's like the land he loves so much then she's the wind or the sea unstoppable. They're a good combination of elements  and this theme is developed expertly throughout the film. She does come to understand that Bellinger's English 'friends' are dreadful people that the local landowners Rebecca and Catriona are the true metal. Had she not she'd be only a merciless social climber who deserves the pompous Bellinger the rich man whose fish do not know him.Powell  Pressburger's world can be extraordinarily intense and theatrical  almost like something out of the surreal tradition of Czech cinema as was. Shots of Catriona looking at Joan wideeyed and full of meaning and power prefigure the tension of Kathleen Byron's mad Sister Ruth in Black Narcissus. I love the daffy and surreal montage sequence in which Joan dreams on the train northwards. Yet the whole flows with great naturalistic ease and a vivid sense of place all the same to me it seems the breathing embodiment of magical realism. This marvellous film is like a fine cheese or wine it just keeps on getting better and better. Romantic films being made today seem pale and shallow by contrast.".

You believe utterly that he's a Laird he carries his authority and quiet nobility in his voice his gait it's part of his sense of self transcending the war and the absence of money.Knowing Kiloran and his friends gradually alters Joan's perception of the world addressing her impatience her inability to understand spiritual wealth. Joan says at one point to Kiloran of the people of Tobermory they're poor then? No they just haven't any money. Isn't it the same thing? Oh no they're completely different. She doesn't understand but as he says Kiloran's a patient man. He's drawn to her he's seen enough to believe that the prize  that this bold brave young woman has the capacity to understand and appreciate him and his world  is worth waiting for.But if he's like the land he loves so much then she's the wind or the sea unstoppable. They're a good combination of elements  and this theme is developed expertly throughout the film. She does come to understand that Bellinger's English 'friends' are dreadful people that the local landowners Rebecca and Catriona are the true metal. Had she not she'd be only a merciless social climber who deserves the pompous Bellinger the rich man whose fish do not know him.Powell  Pressburger's world can be extraordinarily intense and theatrical  almost like something out of the surreal tradition of Czech cinema as was. Shots of Catriona looking at Joan wideeyed and full of meaning and power prefigure the tension of Kathleen Byron's mad Sister Ruth in Black Narcissus. I love the daffy and surreal montage sequence in which Joan dreams on the train northwards. Yet the whole flows with great naturalistic ease and a vivid sense of place all the same to me it seems the breathing embodiment of magical realism. This marvellous film is like a fine cheese or wine it just keeps on getting better and better. Romantic films being made today seem pale and shallow by contrast.";

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of the best films I have seen in awhile. I have heard complaints that the acting is terrible the acting wasn't bad at all. The characters were supposed to be very shallow and that shallowness was heavily exaggerated. But when the acting needed to be there it came across at magnum force. I would say that much of the movie has a cartoony feel maybe that is because the only other work I would compare this film to is South Park. They amplify each characters ego and traits to the point it is cartoonish but it works very well in this film as well as South Park. It switches back and forth between comedy and drama to the point you don't know what you are watching. Maybe many people didn't appreciate it for this reason. But then there are some weirdos that don't like South Park either. Go figure. You could look at this film in a few ways it makes you question things. At first it appears that the Dad is doing the right thing for his Son then for his students and then for himself. You keep wondering where or if he will draw the line. It also makes you wonder what people will do for attention even if they must be a muse. It makes me wonder how many times something like this has occurred in the real world and how many times we have read or heard about it. Robin Williams should be proud of this one Oscar worthy performance. Daryl Sabara is incredible. He has covered quite a bit in his short career but this one should put him in the special class of young actors. I really liked Lorraine Nicholson's character Heather she pulled off the Goth chick flawlessly. I also enjoyed the little shout out to Simon Pegg when Lance is talking to his neighbor about zombie movies. Bottom line many people will not connect with this film because it is very artsy and somewhat taboo. But it is a great film. Way to go Bobcat!".

Robin Williams delivers his best performance in a while as Lance Clayton a struggling writer striving for success and hellbent on not dying alone. I personally found it rather impressive that it was both written and directed by Bobcat Goldthwait because I'm personally not too big of a fan of his standup and this was a far departure from it. However the one thing that I saw as holding the movie back was its climax which I believed took the right route but could have been more powerful or had a bit more of a sting to it.

	schema:reviewBody "Suburbia has transformed from an innocent place with friendly neighbors to a world full of miserable sometimes disturbed people dreams deferred and earthshattering secrets. From this year's Sundance Film Festival we have Bobcat Goldthwait's dark comedy World's Greatest Dad we delve once again into the unknown of Any Town USA.This film mainly takes place in a school setting but the themes and conflicts that arise coincide with those found in other films about suburbia. Robin Williams stars as struggling writer Lance Clayton. He lives with his son Kyle Daryl Sabara a porn obsessed perverted teenager who attends the private school Lance teaches a notsopopular poetry elective. There is tough love between the two. It's a typical teenager vs. the parent relationship only the censors have been turned off.Lance is dating another teacher on staff Claire Alexie Gillmore who he suspects isn't totally committed to their relationship. Life isn't getting any easier for Lance who struggles to reach his students or find a publisher for his work. When things couldn't get any worse Lance suffers a blow few could recover from. From tragedy comes opportunity and it is up to Lance to decide what is the right thing to do.It would be wrong of me to give away the tragedy but it is something that does occur in Any Town USA. In fact it happened not too long ago just a town over from me. It's the first time I can think of it being used in a film or at least of this magnitude. There are several times during the film that I felt uncomfortable but not to the point of disgust. There are some pretty heavy issues handled here and I think it is tasteful.Williams does a fine job especially in the second half of the film. For a comedian I can imagine it being difficult to change emotionally like that but Williams has proved time after time in films like Good Will Hunting One Hour Photo and Insomniac that he can play just about any role thrown at him. He has a presence that is very real and powerful.I was surprised by Sabara's performance as Kyle. I had only seen him in Spy Kids so I really didn't know what to expect. He seemed to have a clear idea of who Kyle was and what is motives are.Goldthwait who also wrote the screenplay tackles a lot of issues both for adults and teenagers. At first I thought the film was going to end up like last years Towelhead a hodgepodge of issues and conflicts that are each could have been their own film but here we have an even dosage of each culminating to a great finale and realization by William's character.The film isn't perfect. One thing I don't like films to do is talk about other films. I feel like it is only a way for the writer to show off his movie knowledge and personal views about certain movies although one segment involving zombie movies is relevant to the story. Occasionally it can be beneficial. Some of the scenes were a bit overdone with cheesy overused dialogue and some of the deliveries felt like they were just saying their lines and not really connecting with them.Overall I was impressed. Goldthwait is not a big time filmmaker but this is certainly a step in the right direction he has acted in several films and worked on other projects behind the camera. Williams gives one of his better performances as of late but he doesn't steal the show. I thought the story was good enough to stand on its own which is a very good thing. I hope this film doesn't get completely overlooked this year. You should try to see this one if you can.".

When I finally sat down and gave it a chance I found a very dark disturbing adult drama that had me laughing and crying at the same time. There are some humorous moments but this is by no means a comedy. If you are expecting a bunch of belly laughs you will be disappointed. This is a very sad story about a natural born loser who finds the attention he craves in the sympathy he gets after the death of his sexually perverted son. What makes this even more emotionally charged is that our antihero is fabricating the circumstances surrounding his son's death in order to gain sympathy and also to ghost write his illiterate son's brilliant journal to get it published in compensation for his own failed writing career. This character's hookwinking of the superficial people around him might come off as a funny gag if not for the fact that he shows absolutely no regret while bleeding his son's death for all it's worth. And everyone around him does the same relishing in the invitations to talk shows and the offers from book publishing companies. While everyone celebrates their false love for the person they completely ignored while alive a very brooding tone develops that makes us wonder about the true nature of humanity. World's Greatest Dad is brilliant and provocative. A big ten!".

In his latest role as Lance Clayton in Bobcat Goldthwait's yep the guy out of Police Academy 'World's Greatest Dad' he is once again showing us he's still got what it takes as he tackles the role of a father who loses his son to a tragic accident. This though is no straight drama and contains humour that is very dark indeed. Lance is an aspiring writer who can't seem to get published he is also a teacher who runs a very poorly attended poetry class and the father to Kyle perhaps the most obnoxious kid to ever grace our screens. After an accident presents an interesting opportunity for Lance he grabs it by both hands and runs with it until it reaches its unnatural conclusion. Well acted and directed this is a film that would sit perfectly with say Junebug Thumbsucker Igby Goes Down and Wonder Boys as one of those quirky small town America tragcoms that you find yourself laughing at even when you shouldn't and one that can at times make your skin crawl ever so slightly. Like finding yourself staring at a car crash you won't be able to look away as the pacing draws you through the story with ease and although it deals with matters that are slightly taboo its ultimately an enjoyable watch and one which cements Williams reputation as a comic actor adapt at playing the wounded human soul.".

How wrong I was on that assumption .....Recently I read an interview with Bobcat where he talked about this plus another movie he made concerning bestiality Stay or Sleeping Dogs Lie depending on who you ask I guess and I was like really? Bobcat made this? so I looked it up. With positive memories of Shakes the Clown plus a good understanding of Bobcat's twisted side PostPolice Academy days that is World's Greatest Dad became a must see title for me. Coincidentally a couple days later I found it for 4 in a clearance section so I grabbed it ..... I went in not knowing what to expect but from the Bobcat interview I had a basic idea of its dark tone. I knew there was gonna be some unexpected twists and that it was not going to be a typical family comedy as the titlebox art might suggest but I had no idea it was gonna be quite like this. For the record I say that in a good way. It would be difficult for me to say anymore without giving away any spoilers so I'll leave it at this World's Greatest Dad was incredible and refreshing for its originality. If you can appreciate comedy with an unforgiving cynicism and a dark side then watch this movie with a clean slate and an open mind you won't be disappointed.".

I like his performances and really appreciate what he has done for Hollywood. World's greatest dad is one of the best movies of the year. It's something that everyone will find a line of his character in this movie. It's about how ironical the life can be and how people threat others and what an egoistic creatures we are.

I'm also a pretty big Robin Williams fan but I was pretty surprised he chose to play this character and just didn't think he fit with his role in this film. As for his son Kyle jeez I don't know if I've ever hated a film character as much as that kid. I just can't easily recall being bothered so much by a character in a movie nor can I remember a more grotesque teen character ever. The brightest moment in the whole flick as far as I'm concerned was when the kid died. I've known some real pigs in my time and have like most guys heard and have sometimes partaken in quite a bit of 'trash talk' in my life but I honestly never heard anyone talk like such a pig ever. The kid obviously had some serious issues but we're never given any indication about why he's actually so disturbed and disturbing. Were we ever told anything about the mother or why the kid has such a negative attitude especially towards his father? I guess it doesn't make any difference since it's not the point of the movie. Either way I got absolutely ZERO entertainment value from this flick and thought the 90 minutes watching it was a major waste of time. It's all just my opinion of course and good for you to anyone else that liked it but it just wasn't for me.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the dark comedy World's Greatest Dad Kyle Daryl Sabrara suffers a tragic accident. Kyle is a jerk. So when his tragic accident helps out his dad Lance Robin Williams Lance then uses this tragedy to his advantage. Bobcat Goldtwaith has made a funny and witty script and even though this accident I will not mention since you have to see this for yourself happens it is still consistently funny. Lance teaches a poetry class at Kyle's school and some very funny moments occur as students read either their too personal or too impersonal poems. This is really the best film of 2009 so far. So far 2009 has brought us some great films but nothing tops the quality and hilarity that is World's Greatest Dad. This also features what is quite possibly Robin Williams's best performance ever and I mean ever. He is fantastic here you really feel for his character. He does a good job of making a sympathetic character and is very funny here. I can't say this is Casablanca but it sure tops all of the other great films of 2009 so far. The movie's message you can drag a man to water but you can't make him drink and what a great message that is.".

	schema:headline " Nice Black Comedy for Williams and Bobcat";
	schema:reviewBody "World's Greatest Dad 2009  out of 4 One of the blackest of all black comedies features Robin Williams as Lance a failed teacher failed boyfriend and failed father to an obnoxious pervert Daryl Sabara who masturbates too much is hated by everyone and who has no real purpose in life. After a tragedy and a lie the father must then come to terms with something that I won't ruin here. When people think of Goldthwait 99 of them are going to think of the crazy guy from the POLICE ACADEMY films and only 1 are going to know him as a filmmaker. SHAKES THE CLOWN has gained a cult following over the years and there's no doubt that this film will eventually be looked at as not a great movie but one that after watching you'll want to stand up and applaud the filmmakers for delivering something completely original and different. It's hard to really describe this movie because it's best that you go into it without knowing all of the details and how we get to the events in the second half. I'm sure you could show this movie to a hundred people and each one of them would walk away feeling the movie was about something different. I think the film certainly shines the spotlight on parenthood teen suicide and how we worship celebs and how those celebs even become famous. The movie has so many layers that people are going to take different things away from it but I really respected the comedy of the first half and then the drama of the second. The first half of the movie is full of vulgar situations as the loser son offends one person after another and the viewer can't help but hate him. There's never an attempt to make us like him and that's usually not a good thing in a comedy if you hate the leading man. We're not even given a reason to like the father played by Williams although I'm sure one could feel sorry for him because of how big of a loser he is to everyone around him. If you do find yourself caring for him then that might change after the events in the second half of the movie. Everyone was informed about Williams and his full frontal nudity but more people should really look at his terrific performance. I guess raw might be a simple word but the entire Williams persona is cleaned away and we're seeing a performance from him that we haven't seen before. I've always felt that he was a better dramatic actor than a comedic one but he handles both sides extremely well here. Sabara is just as great as the perverted son and Alexie Gilmore is wonderful as Williams' girlfriend. The film hits on all sorts of rather taboo subjects but for the most part is looks them directly in the face and doesn't back down. I'm sure the subject matter might be too much for certain film fans but I think those looking for a rather brave and original piece of filmmaking is going to at least respect what we get here even if they find themselves feeling uncomfortable.".

Lance's poetry class lacks attendance the teacher he is dating Alexie Gilmore doesn't seem to want a serious relationship and his son Kyle Daryl Sabara could care less about him. But then in the midst of tragedy Lance gains the opportunity to change everything. This is not a film for everyone. Well most films aren't for everyone but in this case i'll say it's a fairly warranted statement. The plot mainly centers around the wishes of Lance's life suddenly coming to fruition thanks to his son accidentally committing suicide while masturbating. Lance salvages the situation by hanging his son's body in the closet and writing a suicide note on Kyle's computer. When the suicide note gets published in the high school's newspaper and becomes a sensation Lance realizes it is the first time people are appreciating his writing skills. Kyle insufferable crude and rightfully disliked by his peers while alive becomes a hero of sorts after the note is published. And things just continually snowball as Lance realizes more ways the event can work to his advantage.If you're fine with the premise World's Greatest Dad does have a lot to offer. The banter between Robin Williams and Daryl Sabara in the film's first act is sharp twisted and downright hilarious. World's Greatest Dad is full of great satire and actually has something interesting to say about loneliness. And eventually an unexpected and undeniable sweetness emerges from the film that's punctuated by its conclusion. Robin Williams shines in his best performance in years in a film that is both vulgar and poignant hilarious and saddening.httpwww.cinemarewind.com200907reviewworldsgreatestdad.html".

Robin Williams' enormous talent ranges from extremely funny as in The Birdcage to extremely unfunny as in One Hour Photo. World's Greatest Dad well and truly sees him in the latter.Williams plays a teacher and unsung poet who has been unsuccessful in his quest to become published even though he has submitted quality work over many years.As a single father he has an extremely difficult relationship with his utterly detestable teenage son. When tragedy strikes Williams inadvertently realises his dream of fame but it comes at a cost.I cannot recommend this movie to anyone who is looking to be entertained. Despite flashes of humour it was very dark and very unpleasant. I won't be watching it again. There are simply too many excellent movies to waste viewing time on ones of this ilk.This movie deserves 10 stars for Robin Williams' acting but 1 star or less for content and enjoyment. I'm absolutely no prude but the idea that anyone could find suicide and sexual deviancy in any way humorous or entertaining is as repugnant as was this movie. Not for me and I suspect not for many normal people either.".

The film runs into trouble in its agonizing first half where we're told in scene after repetitive scene that the protag's son is an obnoxious creep. The creepy son's death ought to occur fifteen minutes in to get the story rolling but it occurs about an hour in or at least that's how it seemed. To make matters worse the scene where Robin Williams discovers and covers up his son's lurid death is a drawnout mawkish montage sequence where Robin howls and weeps for all he's worth as he zips up his son's pants and hangs him demurely from the closet rod all to a heavyhanded musical score. The audience tittered nervously during this sequence unsure if it was being played for dark comedy or pathos if it was meant to be comic the writerdirector blew it.The second half is meant to be a social satire of how the public lionizes troubled suicides like Kurt Cobain as intenselydeep philosophes. Aside from the fact that this is probably one of the lesser problems that we as a society are facing right now Goldthwait lacks the skill required to pull off this type of satire. Social satire requires a spoton accuracy to get the look and sound of its targets exactly right. While inveighing against the shallowness of high school kids Goldthwait gives us shallow unfunny portraits of a wannabe goth an angry black kid a closeted gay kid etc. We're supposed to jeer at them for not getting that Robin is conning them. Meanwhile we're supposed to sympathize with Robin and cheer at his swimmingpool facilitated redemption because ... because why? He's the protagonist? He's a loser and therefore lovable?What this boils down to is Goldthwait standing on a chair screaming about peepee and caca until a small crowd's assembled and then shouting you're all too spoiled and shallow to GET that beneath my loser exterior I'm a really good guy. The crowd has no choice but to wander away heads ducked in embarrassment. With any wouldbe distributors apparently in tow.".

	schema:reviewBody "PLEASE NOTE I know that there are those who will disagree with my rating of World's Greatest Dad. But I rate movies based in part on how much I enjoyed them and that significant part of my personal rating system is based almost solely on a comparison with other movies I've liked. I try to stay fair with those comparisons and given other movies I've rated higher this is the best I could do for World's Greatest Dad. In honesty it's somewhat better than that but the comparitive scale I use left me with the rating you see here.I first heard about World's Greatest Dad when comedian Bobcat Goldthwait was being interviewed on a popular morning radio show. I was leery since I'm not a big Bobcat Goldthwait fan but the show hosts raved about the movie and film festival attendees seemed to agree. So did a good friend of mine who happens to be a fellow movie fanatic. How could I not take the chance then to see World's Greatest Dad on pay per view? The first thing we learn from World's Greatest Dad is that Lance Clayton Robin Williams isn't the man he thought he'd be. He's a writer but he's never been published. He's a teacher but his poetry class is decidedly unpopular. He's a father but his son Kyle Daryl Sabara is a disappointment. And although he has a pretty girlfriendthe high school art teacher Alexie Gilmoreshe refuses to take their relationship public.Despite repeated rejections Lance hasn't given up on writing. And he certainly isn't giving up on his relationship with Claire even though he suspects she's interested in another teacher Henry Simmons. But his son? That's a tougher choice. Kyle is crude inexcusably rude sometimes deliberately cruel and not terribly bright to boot. Although Lance loves his son he can't make himself like him. But when a sudden tragedy turns Lance's life upside down he realizes he also has an opportunity to turn his life around and in the process influence everyone around him in a positive way. All he has to do is decide whether or not to grab the brass ring.We all know that Robin Williams is both a brilliant comedian and a very good actor. This may be the first role that's really let him be both simultaneously and he's a tour de force in this film. Daryl Sabara is good too. He holds his own in scenes with Williams and he had me believing in his portrayal of Kyle strongly enough that there were moments I really wanted to deck himmuch as I suspect his father did at the time. Alexie Gilmore Henry Simmons Geoffrey Pierson who plays the school principal Evan Martin as Kyle's best friend Andrew and Lorrain Nicholson Jack Nicholson's daughter all but unrecognizable as Kyle's goth classmate all give solid supporting performances.Bobcat Goldthwait wrote a clever and funny script and then directed it beautifully. He claims he doesn't like teenagers and seeing the way they behave in this movie I can't think of too many people who won't agree with him but he surely understands them! A friend who raised two boys said the portrayal was unfortunately entirely realistic I was reminded of several high school classmates myself when I watched World's Greatest Dad. Fortunately we can appreciate the funny and the horrible alike when we're watching it on screen even as we shudder at our own more personal experiences.The set decoration is entirely realistic with some amusing but believable quirks. The camera work is nicely handled including a few moments of judicious slow motion one camera angle in particular adds so much to the pain of a poignant moment that my breath caught for just a moment as was likely intended when I saw it.BOTTOM LINE Given the combination of a good idea a solid script terrific actors and a gifted director I'd have to say that World's Greatest Dad would be a treat for people who really love film making however they happen to feel about teenagers themselves. Many of the rest of the grownups out there would likely enjoy it too.FAMILY SUITABILITY World's Greatest Dad is rated R for language crude and sexual content some drug use and disturbing images. This is probably about right. While many things aren't too shocking for kids as young as 13 or 14 there are a few things which I won't discuss here so as not to ruin some nicely twisted parts of the plot that are well beyond what you may want your younger teen to see.POLITICAL NOTES There's nothing either overtly or subtly political about World's Greatest Dad. But when I saw the blatant hypocrisy of the high school students on full blown display I couldn't help but think of the politicians who will do and say anything just to stay popular with the voters. I suspect that if they grew up like the vast majority of teenagers eventually do our country would be the better for it.".

It is you he is talking about. In this film he gets at a lot of us because the screenplay is wonderfully handled. The writing and directing is superb work by Bobcat Goldthwait. Daryl Sabara is excellent as Kyle and there is very able support from elsewhere from a very talented cast.There is an underlying sadness about this film not because of the subject matter but because it honestly unpeels the fancy wrapping we put around things we don't like or understand. It is rich in deeper meanings in sharp contrasts between our judgements and opinions and fact. There are some patches of uneveness or slightly flawed interludes building up to an immense final five minutes or so.Watch it and be prepared to think about it for several hours afterwards.

The second 18year old girl is sent by church elders to follow the rebel watch over her and keep her from falling into sin and ending up in eternal hell.Now we have a situation that promises to bring about something of interest and it does. The story continues with the familiar inner conflict of desiring forbidden experiences and how each individual reacts to the big city's temptations. Not to give away the story further I'll just say the two girls in question are easy on the eyes and the director certainly knows it.

	schema:headline " Forbidden Fruit";
	schema:reviewBody "Dome Karukoski can be called one of the most prominent Finnish film directors right now having achieved success among both the public and popular critics with all of his films so far. Following the hip hopflavoured romance Beauty and the Bastard 2005 and the serious drama The Home of Dark Butterflies 2008 Karukoski's third feature film Forbidden Fruit examines common themes of finding one's place in the world when leaving one's home for the first time.The teenaged Maria and Raakel Amanda Pilke and Marjut Maristo are two best friends who have grown up in Conservative Laestadian families in Ostrobothnia Finland and are strong in their faith. However Maria is turning from a girl to a woman and longs to see more in life than what the basically loving but highly patronizing Christian community can offer. Having turned 18 she moves to Helsinki and starts experimenting with various temptations the big city has to offer. Concerned for her safety and redemption the community leaders send her friend Raakel to look after her and hopefully to convince her to return to her roots. After initial reservations the city life starts tempting Raakel too especially after she meets a nice cinephile boy named Toni Joel Mkinen.At first the premise sounds terribly oldfashioned like a cautionary tale about the hazards of sinful cities straight from the 1950s. Luckily the idea of the movie is not to contrast the conservative country life to wild urban partying the opposing environments provide only the backdrop for personal development of Maria and Raakel. Many viewers can probably identify with the girls' budding feelings of sexuality and sense of freedom even if such themes are not anything groundbreakingly new in the youth film genre. An extra twist is provided by the girls' connection through faith and the effect their strict upbringing has left on their view of life under the funloving surface Maria has a fearful heart unlike Raakel who has never dared to even think about rebellion until tasting it personally.The film does not overtly criticize the conservative Laestadian movement even if the members' narrowminded views about things like contraception television pop music makeup and young people's relationships are at odds with mainstream opinions. It cannot really be seen as sympathizing with the movement either the social shunning of former members like Maria's sister Eeva Malla Malmivaara is not exactly something a truly loving person would do. The storyline of the harddrinking promiscuous Eeva is among the weaker aspects of the plot anyway I think it has been left feeling somewhat unfinished and heavyhanded compared to the mostly balanced tone. On the other hand it adds to the spectrum of possible fates people may get after leaving the movement some decide to stay away and feel better than ever some realize the oldfashioned lifestyle is the best for them after all while others never really find out what would be good for them much like Eeva in the film. In a way Eeva's emotional problems could be seen as stemming from the conservative movement's influence but she might as well be unstable by nature so it is left up for the viewer to decide if her character should be understood as criticism towards strict conservatism or not.Visually Forbidden Fruit is real eyecandy. The rich colours of the cinematography by Tuomo Hutri marvelously capture the beauty of both urban and rural environments and Karukoski's direction flows forward effortlessly. The young protagonists Pilke and Maristo do their parts well even if they constantly look too young to be even allowed in bars but I guess that's how a lot of young adults look these days I also still tend to see Pilke primarily as the shy little singer girl from Perttu Lepp's hilarious 2003 comedy Pearls and Pigs. In summary Forbidden Fruit is a very satisfactory portrayal of the shaping of one's identity at the tender age between childhood and adulthood. The Christian background can be generalized to symbolize any safe home from which young people have to eventually leave to face the dangerous world on their own so in the end the overhanging themes of the story are universal for people in or outside of any religion. Of the three Karukoski films I have seen at the time of writing this I would call Fruit the best.".

	onyx:emotionText "Dome Karukoski can be called one of the most prominent Finnish film directors right now having achieved success among both the public and popular critics with all of his films so far. Following the hip hopflavoured romance Beauty and the Bastard 2005 and the serious drama The Home of Dark Butterflies 2008 Karukoski's third feature film Forbidden Fruit examines common themes of finding one's place in the world when leaving one's home for the first time.The teenaged Maria and Raakel Amanda Pilke and Marjut Maristo are two best friends who have grown up in Conservative Laestadian families in Ostrobothnia Finland and are strong in their faith. However Maria is turning from a girl to a woman and longs to see more in life than what the basically loving but highly patronizing Christian community can offer. Having turned 18 she moves to Helsinki and starts experimenting with various temptations the big city has to offer. Concerned for her safety and redemption the community leaders send her friend Raakel to look after her and hopefully to convince her to return to her roots. After initial reservations the city life starts tempting Raakel too especially after she meets a nice cinephile boy named Toni Joel Mkinen.At first the premise sounds terribly oldfashioned like a cautionary tale about the hazards of sinful cities straight from the 1950s. Luckily the idea of the movie is not to contrast the conservative country life to wild urban partying the opposing environments provide only the backdrop for personal development of Maria and Raakel. Many viewers can probably identify with the girls' budding feelings of sexuality and sense of freedom even if such themes are not anything groundbreakingly new in the youth film genre.

The locations for the events are interesting and realistic.Of the actors I especially liked Maristo. She fit her role perfectly as a young woman who goes out to the world to discover how it is instead of just basing her opinions on what her parents say and tell to think. I liked how all the characters were flawed in a way or another like how it is in real life. I also liked how the movie portrayed love and the painful process that is finding one's way to love. There were some famous actors in side roles and it's good that they've been left there because I dislike them in general.The budget for this movie might not have been a large one but I enjoyed watching it and that is the most important part.

	schema:reviewBody "Those of us outside Thailand will regard the Thai film production company GTH with some of the best horror films to have come out of the Kingdom in recent years and introducing a promising crop of young filmmakers under its fold to which audiences round the world have associated with Shutter and the two 4bia films. Banjong Pisanthanakun one half of the famed dynamic duo who brought us Shutter now switches from horror to romantic comedy with Hello Stranger and with Bangkok Traffic Love Story already under GTH's belt one wonders if this is another genre that they're branching out since horror and romance are quite the crowd pleasers in Asia.Strangely enough this Thai romantic comedy is set in South Korea a country which like Japan has their own fair share of genre films rolling off their assembly line. Perhaps it's a nod in their direction and a knock on their doors that Thailand can produce an equally entertaining film that in my opinion can challenge some of their best and that of Hollywood's as well. Needless to say the significance of setting it in South Korea which has its romantic drama serials to thank for in boosting its tourism arrivals as its pop culture made waves throughout Asia and the story here by Chantawit Thanasewee rides on that phenomenon having the female lead Nuengtida Sopon as an equally inspired tourist that wriggles her way from her possessive manic boyfriend to make her solo fangirl trip to visit places made famous by the dramas.I had visited Korea before the Kcraze ruled supreme and having that relook into the sights and sounds of Korea from a touristy perspective again was a treat. I'm sure there are many out there who have visited Korea thanks to being influenced by its dramas and will probably find it easy to identify with the intentions of the female lead going gaga over statues of stars and having to eat and drink in the exact same places featured in films. A chance encounter which is a clichd staple for a romantic film to work sees her bump into Chantavit Dhanasevi's lovelorn guy who goes on a package tour after being dumped by his girlfriend and through a series of errors sees himself stuck with the fangirl.I suppose one will never turn away a countryman in a foreign land who seems lost and doesn't speak the language nor English to get by so the pair hook up for travels but make a pact not to tell each other their names which would suppose to get them to be brutally honest with each other. But you can bet your last dollar that with one just being dumped and the other having to escape from the clutches of a possessive boyfriend this new found freedom and opportunity will lead to hearts set to flutter but not before the story gets to put them through the paces necessary for chemistry to build and for the characters to click. There's the obligatory outing where they discover more about themselves a wedding to go to counseling sessions to open up their hearts and that proverbial spanner in the works to toss everything up and to test the strength of their new found friendrelationship.Banjong Pisanthanakun seems comfortable in handling the genre tackling mushy romance with comedy with aplomb and you'll soon find yourself laughing along and at their antics. Given its run time of just over two hours there are numerous sequences designed to cheer the duo on as we the audience find that they make quite the couple but for them to constantly deny that absolute truth. The director also found plenty of opportunity to lampoon the Korean phenomenon on tourism and romantic films and therein lies plenty of comedic irony in the story. The production stuck to safe parameters to deliver a romantic comedy within expectations though of course given Pisanthanakun's first foray into the genre he might have wanted to play it a little safe.Unless you're Han Yew Kwang wanting to experiment with an unromantic film like in his When Hainan Meets Teochew chances are the leads in any romantic flick tend to be extremely good looking. Newcomer Nuengtida Sopon plays her extremely likable character of optimistic nature with great comic timing and it'll be interesting to note how her film career will branch off from this. Chantavit Dhanasevi's character though calls for a lot more range as he begins as quite the sulker before love transforms his demeanour from negative to positive then followed by a pretty lovelorn turn into the wishywashy which is a big nono. Both leads share a comfortable chemistry that made this believable without turning you off with too much clichd and kitsch moments that will make your hair stand on ends. Instead you'll find this episode rather believable though detractors will moan at the finale which I agree tend to be a tad too dragged out and interpretation will depend on the kind of mood you're in when you watch the film.Thailand has shown that it has no lack of talent to tackle romantic leading roles and I wonder how long it will take for Singapore to come out with something uniquely identifiable as our own as past efforts don't really seem to be burning up the local box office like how the foreign films do. I'd recommend this film for the Kculture and romantic buffs most definitely.".

Hello Stanger is probably the highest grossing movie of this year 2010 in the Thai Box Office and probably among of the top five of all time so something must be right to make this movie to famous among its viewer and for me something was really right.Synopsis A clich love story about two lonely people befriended in the foreign land. The name of the movie came as they refuse to tell each other name so that they don't have to care about one another but just parttime friend whom happens to travel and exploring Korea together.Made by the GTH production house for Thai people  this is like saying the movie came from Pixar  a quality production house that assure its viewer the quality of the flick. Despite being new to the industry with less than 10 years experience four movies from GTH made it to the highest grossing movie of all time.The movie doesn't try to be anything else rather than the romantic comedy and from my point of view that what the movie deliver best. The movie consist some consistence witted humors and some of the scene that will make your eye watery from the beginning to the end.With Korean Fever on the rise Korean Fever is a phase describing the popularity of Korean cultures series movie Kpop singers etc on young people on other countries this movie came exactly at the right time. It will truly help if you watch a lot of Korean Series then you will know what they are talking about.Another thing that I truly love about this movie is the casting. It is a perfect fit and it felt so natural. I guess since he is the one who wrote this movie he know exactly what to give to get the character and how to portray it. Yes that right the main protagonist is the one who wrote this movie. I also love the casting of the female protagonist Noona she was awesome in everyway even thought this way her debut in film industry. Surprisingly she also did an OST for this flick which is truly touching.Anyway overall I highly recommend this movie to anyone who have a good sense of humor and wanted to relax and then this movie is definitely for you. Try it truly worth it.Recommendation I definitely add this to my DVD collection.Reason To Watch Its Humor Korea and Actors.Reason Not to Personal dislike of this genre of movie otherwise I don't see a reason not to at least try to watch it once.Rating 8.010 Grade A".

	schema:headline " It's probably never to happen to anyone in real life but you would be duly entertained by this fluffy romantic comedy";
	schema:reviewBody "This reviewer had always dreamed of meeting his true love while touring the streets of Paris. How romantic would that be to experience love at first sight while strolling in the City of Love. Language barriers aside this would be a dream come true for any die hard romantic. But what if this idealistic reviewer were to meet a fellow Singaporean who spouts the ever familiar Singlish phrase What are you doing here ah?  would things as romantic as he hoped things to be?There is a similar situation in this Thai movie. Just when you thought that the Thais have nothing new to offer except horror flicks Muay Thai action movies and kitschy comedies here comes a refreshing romantic comedy set in Korea. Yes the very accessible movie takes place in the country that has its boybands and girlbands taking over the international pop industry by storm.The plot is simple A guy and a girl visit the Land of Kimchi separately and eventually bond together after coincidental encounters sharing of rooms and confessions of heartbreaks. Do they end up going back to Thailand together to share a happily ever after together?Director Banjong Pisanthanakun Shutter Alone ditches his familiar horror genre to helm this entertaining holiday romance which will be a hit for all you couples out there  there is a reason why the 127 minute movie made big bucks in its home country and became the highest grossing movie of 2010.One hundred and twenty seven minutes? Yes you read that correctly  running at over two hours long this movie goes on quite a bit before you get to find out whether there will be happy ending for the two protagonists. Call this reviewer a unromantic Scrooge who has no one to share the lovey dovey moments with if you will but there are many unnecessary plot developments which make this movie overlong.Grudges aside this Korea funded popcorn movie is still a joy to sit through largely thanks to its appealing cast. Headlining the production are Chantawich Tanasewi and Nuengtida Sopon who are extremely pleasant as leads. Tanasewi exudes a boyish charm which makes him instantly likable while Sopon has a sophisticated personality which makes her girlishly charismatic.

	onyx:emotionText "This reviewer had always dreamed of meeting his true love while touring the streets of Paris. How romantic would that be to experience love at first sight while strolling in the City of Love. Language barriers aside this would be a dream come true for any die hard romantic. But what if this idealistic reviewer were to meet a fellow Singaporean who spouts the ever familiar Singlish phrase What are you doing here ah?  would things as romantic as he hoped things to be?There is a similar situation in this Thai movie. Just when you thought that the Thais have nothing new to offer except horror flicks Muay Thai action movies and kitschy comedies here comes a refreshing romantic comedy set in Korea. Yes the very accessible movie takes place in the country that has its boybands and girlbands taking over the international pop industry by storm.The plot is simple A guy and a girl visit the Land of Kimchi separately and eventually bond together after coincidental encounters sharing of rooms and confessions of heartbreaks. Do they end up going back to Thailand together to share a happily ever after together?Director Banjong Pisanthanakun Shutter Alone ditches his familiar horror genre to helm this entertaining holiday romance which will be a hit for all you couples out there  there is a reason why the 127 minute movie made big bucks in its home country and became the highest grossing movie of 2010.One hundred and twenty seven minutes? Yes you read that correctly  running at over two hours long this movie goes on quite a bit before you get to find out whether there will be happy ending for the two protagonists. Call this reviewer a unromantic Scrooge who has no one to share the lovey dovey moments with if you will but there are many unnecessary plot developments which make this movie overlong.Grudges aside this Korea funded popcorn movie is still a joy to sit through largely thanks to its appealing cast. Headlining the production are Chantawich Tanasewi and Nuengtida Sopon who are extremely pleasant as leads. Tanasewi exudes a boyish charm which makes him instantly likable while Sopon has a sophisticated personality which makes her girlishly charismatic. The two of them are the kinds of friends you want to travel with and that makes this journey extra enjoyable.As romantic comedies go you shouldn't expect much in terms of characterisation or plot developments.

	schema:reviewBody "A rarity these days for filmmakers to be proficient in varying genres. Director of acclaimed horror films Shutter and Alone carves a niche in his first romance comedy showcase that is very much fun and laughter inducing. Fans of Korean pop culture and TV dramas will not want to miss this.Frankly speaking upon knowing that Director Banjong Pisanthanakun of Shutter and Alone fame is doing a romance comedy I'm really not that surprised. In fact I held high hopes as I've seen what he's capable of with his comedyhorror film segments in 4bia and its sequel Phobia 2. With a very good mix of humour and spooks for these two short films he finally ventures away from horror for the first time with good results.Capitalising upon his good comic sense of humour he has written some very engaging screenplay together with his male lead Dhanasevi which probably explains why he seems so natural in his wonderful role performance as the irritating cynic who meets a purehearted homely girl crazy over Korean dramas in South Korea.Besides the hilarious and sparkling presence of Dhanasevi new face Sophon a.k.a NooNa earns a great first feature grade for her film resume. Appearing blissful and bubbly while maintaining a girlnextdoor image that appeals to the boys out there she is one mesmerising newcomer to watch out for. When it comes to the sentimental scenes where she has to get wet in tears she pulls it off like a seasoned natural possibly with an acting coach as credited in the film.Likely to be a reflection of the current Korean television drama craze that has overwhelmed Asian countries like Thailand it sets off to be some sort of a Korean drama spoof attempting to poke fun at it through the cynicism of Dhanasevi. When paired with Korean drama lover NooNa their interactions give rise to an influential synergetic ensemble that easily captivates our hearts. Thanks to some really interesting writing this film is filled with several comical scenes that got us blatantly laughing out loud.It's really all about the fun we enjoy from them.Of course what's a romcom without the soppy melodrama? Unnecessarily long to cause a minor draggy feel this is where we discover the Director's limitations of inexperience with romance. However the romance plot elements somewhat reflect scenarios that are often common of couples in real life. Their development gets me nodding in agreement at times as I can totally relate couples around me to them a credit that I have to give Pisanthanakun for.Standing amidst the extensive humour fun and melodrama one gets truly influenced to hold desires to visit South Korea with a prominent feature of South Korean culture and her scenic urban cityscape and snowscape.Funfilled culture exchange makes for good film material.".

	schema:reviewBody "...how movies like this get rushed into theaters.I honestly believe that when the idea of a Catwoman movie came across someone's desk several years back it was a good idea. Unfortunately what turned up in theaters in 2004 was this mess! Having never picked up a Catwoman comic book I cannot judge the film on that background. Knowing only of the old Batman TV show from the 60's the 90's Cartoon and the brilliant portrayal by Michelle Pfeiffer in Tim Burton's exceptional Batman Returns in 1992. That's all I really have to go on.However this 2004 update on the character is flawed. Halle Berry is awkwardly cast as the lead. Her screen presence was boring and lacked any real motivation.With 3 writers it is no wonder the story goes in all directions never sticking to one line for too long. It is disjointed and incomplete. It almost seems the script was written just to have CGI fight sequences and Berry in that silly though hot costume! Pitof as director strings together a film that has no real entertainment value. Though many scenes are shot beautifully I do not see where he treated the character of Catwoman as the focal point. It just seems like he was making a movie  nothing more nothing less.All in all the film is bland. Trite. Scripted weakly. Sloppily acted. Well you get the idea.Long live the days when Michelle Pfeiffer wore the Catwoman costume. She truly demonstrated the characteristics of a true Feline Femme Fatale. She holds ranks with the women that have portrayed Catwoman  Berry though I love her does not! 2 out of 10".

	onyx:emotionText "...how movies like this get rushed into theaters.I honestly believe that when the idea of a Catwoman movie came across someone's desk several years back it was a good idea. Unfortunately what turned up in theaters in 2004 was this mess! Having never picked up a Catwoman comic book I cannot judge the film on that background. Knowing only of the old Batman TV show from the 60's the 90's Cartoon and the brilliant portrayal by Michelle Pfeiffer in Tim Burton's exceptional Batman Returns in 1992. That's all I really have to go on.However this 2004 update on the character is flawed. Halle Berry is awkwardly cast as the lead. Her screen presence was boring and lacked any real motivation.With 3 writers it is no wonder the story goes in all directions never sticking to one line for too long. It is disjointed and incomplete.

But let's come back to that. Let's move on to Halle Berry. Note to Halle Berry Letting Billy Bob Thornton ream you endlessly on camera is certainly degrading but it was also a good career moveand you won an Oscar feverishly eating catnip and licking people's faces on camera however is not a good career moveand you'll probably win a Razzie this time. They make you return Oscars for movies like this. Oh yeah as for the supernatural explanation for Patience PhillipsCatwoman's superhero statusshe gets CPR from an immortal Egyptian catI am not kidding.And then there is Benjamin Bratt who happens to be a pretty solid actor but could have very likely damaged a good career. If his participation in this movie isn't enough to stigmatize him then I'm sure he had to pass up a lot of good roles because of all the time he spent having his foot surgically removed from his former agent's rectum. There is a scene in this movieprobably the worst and that's no small achievementthat is reminiscent of that ridiculous scene in Daredevil where Jennifer GarnerElektra and Ben Affleckblind superhero have a Kung Fu fight at a playground in broad daylight in this movie it's Halle Berry and Ben Bratt playing oneonone hoops and her doing Catwoman flips and yet no one appears to be too amazed by this much less pantssoiling surprised and on top of that it has a sort of VH1Color Me Badearly New Edition video feel to it. And I'm really not sure what city this is all supposed to take place inGotham Metropolis the land beneath the whole in the cutting room floorbut apparently this place only has one detective the unfortunate Bratt. No matter what the crime isburglary murder domestic disturbance interrupted ballet performancehe's always there.As for the rest of the cast that annoying woman from Mad TVI know that's not specific enough I mean the most annoying one who plays what I guess is supposed to be some bizarre Asian ladywell she plays Catwoman's annoying and sort of slutty coworker comic relief since Rosie O'Donnell was apparently unavailable.And then we come to Sharon Stone. Now I know her career is going down the crapper with all deliberate speed but it's still hard to understand this one. The only thing I can guess is that the opportunity to break into silly pseudofeminist diatribes made this a role she couldn't turn down. Of course Sharon has often lamented the lack of good roles for older women in Hollywood and she's absolutely right about that but this is not the best way to lodge a complaint and plus that's always been a little peculiar coming from an actress whose greatest cinematic achievement is the conspicuous exposure of her labia.Briefly back to this Pitof characterI thought that pretentious onenamed idiot who did the Charlie's Angels moviesMcG I believewas bad enough but this guy is even more shameless and obviously lacking in talent. What's with these guys who've never made a movie and are already going by only one name? Don't you have to work up to that? I mean if is Scorsese wants to go by Marty fine if Tarantino wants to be just Quentin or even just Q whatever but where does a hack like this get off using one name? This movie deserves every Razzie it receives and while some reviewers may say it's not really that bad remember it took a lot of money to make this godawful thing and if people don't speak out about how dreadful it really is they just might make Catwoman 2. Can you live with that?".

It might be inspired by my estimation of the film's display of only 12 minutes of living breathing actors which I will get into more below. Or it could possibly be inspired by the many errors that there wasn't even an attempt to cover i.e. Patience becomes Catwoman after wandering into a restricted area. How did she get into this restricted area you ask? By walking through the door marked 'RESTRICTED AREA' in bold red text which was simply unlocked and didn't even have a significant locking device on it. You know I might've also hated the movie not worthy of the word 'film' because of the pointlessundeveloped story line. And really it's not possible to look beyond the disgustingly audacious 'style' of onenamed director Pitof which can only be described as the style of a headless chicken running through a maze of landmines. Oh yes said headless chicken is also being chased by angry natives wielding machetes.I mentioned above that I estimated that only 12 minutes of living breathing actors were shown during the entire 140 minutes of film. Almost every sequence of the movie featuring an actor seemed to be butchered by the insertion of CGI's. I'm dead serious. I'm not just talking highflying sucky action sequences I'm talking scenes of Catwoman walking to a motorcycle and calmly getting on it and the other one that immediately comes to mind is a sequence where a man a baddie is simply walking. Yeah walking. It seems agents and managers are really watching over their clients these days.Now two questions I'm asking1 What is the point of Catwoman? What the expletive does she do?It's explained in the film that Midnight the 'magical' cat chose Patience to become Catwoman but something is wrong here CATWOMAN HAS NO PURPOSE!! Every other superhero out there has a purpose They save people! It seems Catwoman's only purpose is to kill the people who attempted to kill her and chase a cricket or two. There's nothing else to her!2 Where is the REAL back story?It sure as expletive wasn't in the film! Why wasn't she shocked and attempting to reason and deal with the emotional asskicking that would come with the revelation? She's told she's Catwoman by the clich cat lady she buys a mask and nails and the result is the 'superhero.' It's adds up but not into anything of any value whatsoever. Shame on you terrible writers!Halle Berry is a good actress. I'm not doubting or denying that. She fully deserved her Academy Award nomination and win for 2001's Monster's Ball but something bad happened here. Her acting started awful and ended awful. I'm hoping the talents and reputation of Berry won't be harmed by her inadequate performance. Now My request to Halle Berry Ms. Berry I want my money back. I never thought I could see such a terrible performance from an Oscar winning actress. Maybe you were just doing your best with the material? But you know that really is not a valid excuse. After reading the screenplay you should've thrown it in the face of the agent who dared display it to you. How could you not notice how awful it was? Make some better choices and hopefully your career won't plummet as so many others have.I recall an interview with Ashley Judd the original casting choice for Catwoman who said something along the lines of 'Turning down the role of Catwoman is one the things I regret the most.' Ashley never say that again. You have only been saved by not appearing in this hilariously terrible film.Listen people don't waste your money on this glorified..erum..crap. It's not worth the 615 bucks!So now you ask why not just give it a zero? Why the zeropoint five? Well The editing was sufficiently bad the acting of Alex Borstein could've possibly taken some effort appropriately placed CGI's were okay and I like cats.Directing 010 Writing 010 Cinematography 0.510 Editing 110 Acting 0.510 Overall Satisfaction 010Final 0.510".

Maybe people were expecting a Christopher Nolan type film that takes itself overly serious but I'm very glad that wasn't this film. This film was fun and entertaining and the IMDb rating is a disgrace. Watch some other films with that kind of low rating and you'll soon see the difference between a bad film and this. 810".

	schema:headline " I loved it!";
	schema:reviewBody "Patience Phillips Halle Berry is a visual artist who is stuck working in the advertising division of a large beauty product manufacturer Hedare. When she acquires information that could potentially put the company out of business they try to dispose of her. Because she had previously unwittingly passed a test however she is saved by a group of cats and transformed into a Catwoman.First let me note that I loved this film. It's a 10 out of 10 for me. Since I'm well aware that most critics professional and amateur alike have trashed this film I'll focus on why I thought it was so good. Maybe this will help some new viewers consider giving it a look and possibly encourage some reevaluation by those who have already seen the film.The script immediately drew me into the film and although I'm male I identified with Patience. I'm also a visual artist. I have also worked for a company similar to Hedare in the past although a much smaller and less nefarious beauty product company. I lived in an apartment that looked on the outside almost exactly the same as Patience's apartment complex. I also had neighbors who night after night played loud music or television until three or four a.m. while I first tried to block out the sound in any way that I could then asked politely for them to turn the music down and so on until I finally called the cops on them so I could get some sleep.Not that I need to identify with a character to like a film but that made this one have extra resonance with me in the beginning. Additionally I was immediately drawn in by the fantastic cinematography and set design. Those kinds of things are just as important in a movie as the story is. Film is a visual and aural artform. The whole package is important. Creative attractive visuals such as those in Catwoman are part of the package.The script including the subtexts worked well for me. Catwoman is a film about discovering identities peeling away literal and metaphorical masks and the difference between various stages of public versus private faces. That the plot is centered on a beauty product manufacturer then is perfect. These themes permeate every aspect of the film. For example Tom Lone Benjamin Bratt is continually peeling away the appearances of Patience throughout the length of the film and Patience is doing the same for herselfdiscovering her true self. I can't think of a scene that doesn't touch on this theme in some way. That's very clever and thoughtprovoking scriptwriting and it doesn't end there. There are also themes about femininity cleverly woven through the film for example.I thought the cast did a fantastic job. Berry is great as a Catwoman and subtly referenced most of the previous screen Catwomen. She also incorporated a lot of crafty catlike behavior. I enjoyed the supporting cast especially Alex Borstein as Patience's friend Sally. The effects worked well for me and at times they were also very subtle and clever such as Catwoman's whip representing a tail in many shots most of this was achieved via digital effects. I was also impressed with the creativity and different approach of many of the fight scenes. It was nice to see Brazilian martial arts incorporated for a change.Some of the negative criticism probably stems from a kind of purism that is disproportionately found among comic book fans when it comes to comic book films. I'm not much of a purist but in any event for anyone paying close attention you'd note that Berry's character isn't supposed to be Selina Kyle. In the mythology of as presented here Catwoman isn't a lone token but a type. Patience is just another instantiation of a long line of catwomen. So departures from previous portrayals of Selina Kyle aren't relevant even if we believed that filmmakers were obligated in some way to previous depictions of the same fictional characters which I don't believe not being a purist.Catwoman is worth a second chance if you can leave some of your preconceptions at the door and if you're prepared to think a bit about a comic book film.".

Some actually believe that Matt Damon  all that he represents in our society are Born SupremeThe movie had likable characters that you could care about. Halle Berry mad a nice transition between the meek side  the Catwoman side. She looked fantastic! The special effects were great. They were on a par with Spiderman 2. Benjamin Bratt was a good choice of leading man. I went in expecting the worst  was pleasantly surprised. As for critics I say Those that can...DO those who can't...TEACH those who can't do either...become Critics!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "Don't get it twisted. This is an awful film. Halle Berry cant take full blame for the reason why this movie sucks. The script was juvenile and corny. Halle Berry gives the worst performance of her acting career in this movie. She plays Patience Williamswasn't the original Catwoman called Selina Kyle? a timid beauty ad designer who accidentally stumbles on to an evil plan by the owner of the company she works for. The evil plan involves marketing a beauty cream that is known to cause skin disorder and cancer. Patience is chased out of the building and into a drainage system where she falls to her doom and is revived by a cat.Opinion This movie is humorously bad. Her origin with the cat that revives her is laughable. The way she walks so awkwardlylike she's had one too many catnip in that tacky cat suit is a riot. The way she cracks that whip like an amateur dominatrix is hysterical. The fight scenes as well as the dialogue is laughable too. The most funniest and probably the worst scene in the movie is where she beats her soontobe boyfriendcop in basketball with HIGH HEELS ON!!! She looked like a total goof dribbling that ball between her legs. Then there's those moments in the movie where you have to suspend your intellect like the time Halle slid through those prison bars without getting stuck or the fact that the toxic cream that the main villain is peddling makes herthe villain immune to punches and kicks that would knock the average person unconscious.Closing comments This is the worst movie that Halle Berry has ever starred in and is another blemish is her movie career. The acting is dreadful and the action is a joke. I would be surprised if she could still find work but then again if Eddie Murphy could find roles to play after the crappy The Haunted Mansion then Halle should be able to bounce back from this.To Halle FIRE YOUR AGENT IMMEDIATELY!!!".

This is my first voting on IMDb because I am really lazy to get an account and fill up application form. I just want to read other people's comments. However I am really irritated that there are so many people who are trashing this film when they have either never watched the film or already form judgments before they went watch the movie. That's why I decided to contribute my first vote and first message to Catwoman.I personally found the movie to be really entertaining. I went to watch the movie with 4 other friends and all five of us loves it.This movie may not to be best movies ever but I found it really really cute and sweet. The last summer movie that I think is as entertaining as this one is PoTC. I really like the chemistry between Halle and Ben. They make such a cute couple together. It also has a lot of humorous scenes. For anyone who is giving this movie a 0 rating please go watch this film first before you make your judgments.".

	schema:headline " A film that sways around like a zombie.";
	schema:reviewBody "This film is as messy as a zombie chowing down on guts. Considering it's only 80odd minutes long it takes a good half hour to get going. It's certainly a quirky film there are some bits which are genuinely funny and none at all that are scary or particularly horrifying  not quite sure what the DVD has that makes it unrated to be honest! Billy Zane is okay although UK viewers may find his resemblance to Les from Vic Reeves Big Night Out a little disconcerting. All other actors do their jobs well enough but they can't carry the comedy. The script tries to be too clever andor postmodern for its own good sometimes and any humour irony or subtle comedy just doesn't work. Shaun Of The Dead to which this film owes a huge debt did it all so much better.One scene with Amy and her dad walking through the field dissecting their lives whilst kicking a couple of zombies to death without pausing for breath is the best scene in the film  unfortunately spoiled by inappropriate background music which just does not fit.The director refers to this film as social commentary  he believes the zombies have a lust for consumption of any material goods  but this isn't brought across to the screen. They just look like typical zombies destroying a car it doesn't make you think Wow what a subtle insight into American materialism. Worth seeing only if it costs you nothing you have 85 spare minutes and you'll watch anything with zombies andor cows in it.".

It's certainly a quirky film there are some bits which are genuinely funny and none at all that are scary or particularly horrifying  not quite sure what the DVD has that makes it unrated to be honest!

This movie makes no pretense to being anything other than fun.Nice to see Billy Zane in something other than a dramatic role with luck we'll see more comedic acting from Zane in the future as he seemed to have a great deal of fun with this role.Go 'Team Chris'".

	schema:reviewBody "A father a daughter a future stepmother and a boyfriend are traveling when they stop in a small town isn't it always a small town? for some dinner and a place to sleep. The restaurant gets its meat locally but sometimes local doesn't always mean healthy. There's a new kind of mad cow disease in town.When this film showed up in the mail I was undecided on how to take it. It had Billy Zane written on the cover which seemed like a promising thing. Because Zane for whatever reason seems to suggest greatness  despite my inability to determine why. And then I watched the trailer on my DVD of Bottom Feeder and this looked like a possible American answer to England's Shaun of the Dead. Boy is that giving it way too much credit.The company behind this film is 235 Films a new company behind such greats as Bottom Feeder and UKM The Ultimate Killing Machine. Their gimmick seems to be get a halfbaked script an unknown director and then find one Bleague star and put hisher name prominently on the cover. First Michael Madsen then Tom Sizemore and now Billy Zane.Now Billy Zane Demon Knight Back to the Future is a great actor and a wonderful action star and comedian. I think I could say he was the best part of this film without much debate. But he just couldn't save it. They gave him no good lines and he was just way too big to fill such a small character not a small part mind you just such a onedimensional character.You see the cool parts only take up ten minutes of the film. The rest is mostly a bunch of scenes where the daughter and future stepmother fight with each other. It's overdone poorly scripted poorly acted and really doesn't tie in to the overall plot. I was quite bored through much of this. I guess the daughter was sort of cute but that didn't even come close to making up for the sheer blahness of it all.Best scene was the zombie debate scene where they were trying to determine if the people they were fighting were zombies or not. They were flesheating and not dead... but were they undead? It's a good scene and way too short. This sort of discourse could have carried the movie if it came in copious amounts.Also as with many films I enjoyed the deleted scene. It was a music scene and nothing really happened in it but it had artistic merit. And if you're going to give me a boring pointless film  you can at least make it artistic. Instead they excised it out.This film wasn't worthless. It had some good scenes it had some humor it had Billy Zane and I think the story was interesting. Maybe it had the wrong writer or director or editor. Maybe it had the wrong actors. It's hard to pinpoint it because it seems like something that should have been kickbutt. If someone wants to remake this twenty years from now or even a year from now heck The Incredible Hulk gets away with it I support your cause. Because I think this one has a piece of hope buried under its large bulbous morass.".

	schema:reviewBody "WOW the Zombie comedy genre sure seems to be in style lately. I'll say this much The Mad had a lot of firsts in it and definitely entertained me even though it wasn't quite as perfect as some reviews have made it out to be. first off Billy Zane is a great actor in fact this is totally his movie. I did laugh at his dialog even though I felt his performance was a tad uneven at times. Some of the death scenes were just plain hilarious. I won't spoil it for you with specifics but I will say look for a funny decapitation scene as well as an attack from a possessed Hamburger Pattie.... Now that has to be a first. The Mad certainly has B movie classic potential. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good campy horror film.Spoiler Warning I do have some mild criticism. For one thing I didn't care for the climactic portion at the farm. I felt the villainous father and son duo were just kind of dumb and pointless. I didn't find them funny and certainly didn't find them threatening in any way. Second although the film did have a few generally laugh out loud moments the comedy and performances were a tad uneven at times and just didn't consistently hit for me. But hey I can't complain to much about a film that has freakin Hamburger Patties attacking people. If you enjoy this check out the numerous recent entries in the Zomedy genre like Dead and Deader Shaun Of The Dead Stink Of Flesh Dead and Breakfast and an early example of the genre Dead Heat.".

	onyx:emotionText "WOW the Zombie comedy genre sure seems to be in style lately. I'll say this much The Mad had a lot of firsts in it and definitely entertained me even though it wasn't quite as perfect as some reviews have made it out to be. first off Billy Zane is a great actor in fact this is totally his movie. I did laugh at his dialog even though I felt his performance was a tad uneven at times. Some of the death scenes were just plain hilarious. I won't spoil it for you with specifics but I will say look for a funny decapitation scene as well as an attack from a possessed Hamburger Pattie.... Now that has to be a first. The Mad certainly has B movie classic potential. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good campy horror film.Spoiler Warning I do have some mild criticism. For one thing I didn't care for the climactic portion at the farm. I felt the villainous father and son duo were just kind of dumb and pointless.

But i have no idea of what they were trying to do with this film. I mean did i just not get the point! Zane's reaction to the zombies is bizarre his expression doesn't change the tone of his voice or anything. People getting eaten around him and he just looks bored or again was that the point. The zombies are awful the effects were special needs rather than special effects. I kinda got the impression the director wants to be early Peter Jackson bad taste braindead but he has completely missed the point no humour no acting no plot. I just realised that it was 90 minutes of my life i will never get back. Avoid at all costs".

All these untalented filmmakers don't seem to realize that Shaun of the Dead was actually the exception that confirmed the rule zombies people coming back from the dead to hunt the flesh of the living are no laughing matter. Like the case in The Mad there's absolutely nothing even remotely funny about family members getting killed by walking corpses that died after consuming beef infected with the mad cow disease. People will not start to make jokes or have discussions about the definition of a zombie moments after their beloved partners have been reduced to a pile of blood and intestines on the floor! The Mad really tries to be hilarious with its absurd  stereotypical character drawings and clichd fatherdaughterstepmotherpunk boyfriend relationship jokes but it miserably fails. The other elements to create comedy are either totally pathetic spontaneously attacking hamburgers or utterly derivative inbred farmers and banjo music. The Mad can't even distinguish itself from the majority of lameass low budget horror junk with a good amount of nauseating splatter as the makeup effects and massacres are nothing exceptional at all. It's not a goresoaked bloodbath and we're only treated to a couple of mundane zombieattacks and relatively bloodless annihilations. And then there's Billy Zane the famous name parading the DVDcover hoping to attract more viewers with it. To my surprise I encountered a lot of reviews claiming that his performance was awesome but I on the other hand have rarely seen someone acting so uninterested and hammy and no I don't misinterpreted the fact his performance was supposed to be tongueincheek. Zane more than obviously wasn't interested in starring in this piece of junk and he can't hide it. For crying out loud Billy!

One of the greatest attributes here is the fact that this one manages to both mix the serious zombie action with the humorous comedy which makes for plenty of enjoyment. The film gets some rather great jabs with comedy in here including plenty of silly gags and physical pratfalls that always works well based on their complete unfamiliarity with the situation. The hilarious wordplay between everyone is also worthy of a few laughs especially the argument on the doorstep as well as the ensuing one in the barn as they try to figure out what's going on and a later one with the characters standing around discussing whether or not they're dealing with zombies or just really sick people. Just as good is the segment where the zombies strike at the diner which unleashes a torrent of gags including a dance sequence disguised as a fight to a jukebox playing an appropriate song for such a scene. The seriousness is made up with the graphic zombie attacks which here are actually threatening to the others where the laughs are played more in trying to get away from them not the zombies themselves so they remain a fearsome threat. There's some rather nice gore to this in the multitude of attacks in the form of some rather big action scenes where they attack in the diner which leads to some really big parts later which are just as good. The film also has a frenetic pace able to incorporate a lot of good stuff into it from the zombies to the gags to a couple of really fun moments that make it even more of a blast to watch. This here was a thoroughly entertaining film since this here doesn't have a whole lot really wrong and the few flaws aren't that bad at all. The main one is that the zombies here aren't that well done looking really cheaply and without a whole lot to really make them memorable. The design is to slap on contact lenses and a few blood marks over the face and it's considered a zombie when all it does is really make the film look cheaper and is very hard to take seriously because of it. The other one is the fact that the storyline about the tainted farm's meat is a little too convoluted. First it's mentioned that they're cows were sick which became a big scandal then used an experimental treatment to make them better which no one knew about to make them healthy then gave it back to all of the locals. It's a little tough to understand and doesn't really make much sense. These here are what really strike the film down.Rated R Graphic Violence Graphic Language and mild drug use.".

It wasn't a film to make you scared just a little grossed out with an extra smile on your face. I thought the camera work was very decent. The sound effects as well as visual effects were top notch the only problem I really had with the movie was the script and that it faltered continuously which I think was the only reason this movie took a low rating. I felt Billy Zane's instinctual acting experience almost completely made him avoid this pot hole but unfortunately the other actors seemed to just follow suit and act their way to the finish line. I wasn't seeing characters I was seeing people acting and sometimes not that greatly. Besides Billy Zane who seems to polish up a dirty script even if he is the sole memorable presence of the film another actor which I thought did extremely well was Maggie Castle. In this film acting experience obviously pays off but the cast shouldn't have to construct the film. That's the film makers and the screenwriters position. Of course I'm just an armchair expert I have no experience in the process of film making apart from the countless 'making of's' I have watched as well as thousands of movies. But it doesn't take a film director or an actor or a screenwriter to claim whether or not their movie is good it should be left to the audience who get that untainted first view without reminiscence of the actual process of making the movie.Overall score 510  It was fun!".

Shaun of the Dead as good a movie as it was has encouraged an innumerable amount of imitators which fail to capture the same kind of balance of funnyhumor and horror as it did. For instance there's this entire comedy bit where father Zane and daughter Maggie Castle bicker over the name of the farm which provided the bad meat which started the zombie mad cow plague..it falls as flat as possible and desperate. There's plenty of goremedy using violence as a means to seek giggles failing miserably. I think it takes entirely too long to get going and by the time the zombies are unleashed I reckon many fans of the genre would have laboured in vain. There's heavy focus on the family dynamic and how the disconnect between father and daughter regains momentum as they encounter danger. Eventually they decide to take the SUV of a couple torn apart by zombies confronting the fatherson farmers whose medicine for their cattle caused the zombie disease infecting the meat. If anything Castle in Daisy Duke attire and pigtails should leave an impression even though the humor fails to do so. Shauna MacDonald is the woman that almost comes between Zane and Castle Evan Charles Flock the daughter's beau who doesn't fare well when all is said done. You could call this a treatise on the dangers of eating meat celebrating vegetarianism but I wouldn't dare submit such a theory for a movie this painfully unfunny. When you see Zane and Castle disputing with farmer Sutter over whether strange or strangely applies to the behavior of mad cows then you know a film's struggling mightily to bellylaugh their audience into a stooper.".

They have been handed the difficult responsibility of caring for Bing's father Lin Roy Chiao who has Alzheimer's following the death of Lin's wife Ying Sin Hung Tam.From start to finish this film's ensuing drama is heartfelt as we see the family making sudden life adjustments and sacrifices in order to care for the ailing Lin who's own personality is difficult to deal with. The poignant moments in the film will resonate with you in how it might feel to lose a loved one or see a loved one struggle with a longterm illness. The story reminded me of the time my family and I went through when my grandfather passed.While a powerful drama that can be a tearjerker there are some humor and lighthearted moments where appropriate and they are a welcome departure to the seriousness of the plot. Writer Man Keung Chan wrote a outstanding story director Ann Hui directed a solid plot and composer Yoshihide tomo created a music somber that is both sorrowful and hopeful. In addition handsdown to an excellent cast of characters who each delivered a powerful performance. They all had great chemistry together and connected with the viewers  all making us see what a typical family can be like.Overall it's a film that will make you appreciate what you have including your family and make you not take anything or anyone in your life for granted. A great movie! Grade A".

I have to hype most of all Song Joong Ki's the wolf boy's ability to mime the confused seemingly mentally retarded and overly protective little Kid within an adult man's body. Most of the Dialogues are meaningful and relevant but the best conversation is the silent one between the main characters.

A Werewolf Boy is just so funny and heartwarming on the first half of the movie. But when it hits the second half well you may be as well as crying and dying inside. it's such a tearjerker movie. great movie after all ";

Of course the actress Park BoYoung was splendid but I'd like to give props to Song Joonki the wolf boy. It blows my mind how amazingly he can express everything through his actions and his eyes. He doesn't even need to speak yet his performance was outstandingly breathtaking. The only thing I'd like to point out negatively was some of the graphics. I highly recommend this movie it was breathtakingly beautiful.".

The relationship between soonyi and chulso was built really well from the beginning. How soonyi treats him like a dog to become more than that. For me the chemistry between Boyeong and joongki is the strongest aspect that makes this movie more alive and successful. Especially for joongki he acts really convincing as an innocent wolfboy. Unfortunately there is a big mistake for the make up and visual effects especially when chulso turns into a werewolf. The visual effects look horrible and cheap the studio should hire a professional one to make the werewolf looks real. I think visual effects in korean movie has improved nowadays and definitely not as poor as this movie has. Beside weak visual effects A Werewolf Boy is still a funny beautiful and touching drama. It also very sweet and brings tears even to men. It's not the best ever korean movie for sure but it's still enjoyable to see and I personal love this movie!".

	schema:reviewBody "Wow. This movie was just simply lovely honestly I haven't watched a movie this wonderful since Sunny. I enjoyed Werewolf Boy on so many levels that I personally think whatever movie I watch here after is going to have a hard time following up. ending to this movie according to my friend SPOILERS AHEADI personally felt as though the end of the movie took a risky turn. The movie ending with Park Bo Young's character leaving Song Joong Ki and moving out into the world getting married and even having a grandchild. What broke me was that when she returned to the house years later he was there waiting for her he hadn't aged and was wearing the same clothes she found him in while she had aged and lived her life to the fullest. It highlighted one of things most people hate to admit and avoid realizing through time no matter how much you love a person slowly they become only a memory. Honestly this really upset me for the whole day after the movie I tried to wrap my head around the reason why the director would leave such a sad ending. Until my sister pointed out that yes Suni did move on with her life Chul Soo didn't. Many people we meet in our lives will become a memory to us but that there are people who will be stay never changing and awaiting our return. And with that I say FOUR FOR YOU JO SUNG HEE! YOU GO JO SUNG HEE! Sorry I'm slightly tired writing this review. Seriously though this was a great movie beautifully shot amazingly written a wonderfully portrayed through many talented actors and actresses.Everyone should watch this movie when they get an opportunity. Park Bo Young was endearing as Suni what started off as a troubled and hurting teenage girl transformed into a warm and spirit filled women. But it was of course Song Joong Ki and his scenes with Park Bo Young that captivated me. What surprised me the most about Song Joong Ki was that you could literally count the lines he had in the movie on two hands. Yet he was able to convey so much emotion simply by his interactions with Park Bo Young. His eyes spoke louder then any amount of words could ever convey. Never have I been so captivated by any one character in a movie. I was actually unaware of this but CGV Cinema actually released an alternate".

SoonYi's dedication to teach and help ChulSoo learn to speak and acquire skills not only had adorable written all over it but it also showed that truly meaningful things don't just happen they take time and determination and with that same time those meaningful things don't just disappear...time passed but SoonYi and ChulSoo were still there for each other a few mistakes underwent their way but there they were at the end ChulSoo finally able to read SoonYi her favorite childhood book she giving him the 100 pets she had promised since the early years of their love which was still their love. And it's that same sweetness which touched my heart.

Some may say that the movie is slowpaced but I find beauty in it because it gave way to focusing on little details e.g. facial expression hand movements and other body gestures which have big impact and lasting impression on viewer's reaction.If you're looking for a sweet story which reminds of your childhood sweetheart the one that got away or you let go of due to unavoidable circumstance which I was before watching this movie then watch A Werewolf Boy.

If A Werewolf Boy were to be contrasted with the wealth of werewolf related films and TV shows America has been quick to produce over the past decade this South Korean romantic fantasy drama would undoubtedly be the best.At the same time however though a love story at heart the romantic themes bear no resemblance to plots developed from Nicholas Sparks' novels nor are they similar to the romantic fantasy Painted Skin. A film conceived both tenderly and with much innocence A Werewolf Boy focuses specifically on emotions and feelings rather than desirous outward affection.SoonYi Yeongran Lee is an elderly woman  a grandmother  living in the United States when a phone call regarding family property causes her to return to South Korea. Upon returning to the home she once resided in she is immediately overcome with memories from her short time there as a child.Boyeong Park gives an outstanding performance which is not only refreshingly lively but emotionally powerful as the young SoonYi a sickly adolescent girl who is homeschooled by her mother Youngnam Jang. Although she has a familial relationship with her sister Sunja Hyanggi Kim SoonYi is largely isolated with no friends her own age and we are able to further glimpse how she feels through the poetry she produces. After the death of their father they move from Seoul to a life of poverty in the country under the domineering eye of their vile landlord Jitae YeonSeok Yoo who deserves kudos for portraying such a wretchedly arrogant man.Not long into their stay at the residence SoonYi finds they are not alone at the establishment with the discovery of a young unidentifiable vagrant later named Chulsoo Joongki Song who is more animal than human some suspecting him of being orphaned during the Korean War. Unable to communicate verbally and with lacking social skills Song's ability to convey emotion through growls and facial expressions is truly excellent.Originally viewed as a nuisance by SoonYi and her sister after their mother takes him in Chulsoo begins to adopt an ability to understand those around him and settle comfortably into their lives as SoonYi dedicates much of her time to assisting him. In doing so she begins to reveal the boy inside and despite there been many who genuinely care for Chulsoo there are an equal number of people who believe him to be a formidable danger. As these feelings escalate paranoia and animosity befalls members of the community and Chulsoo's future with SoonYi and her family is put in jeopardy.But after all this time has passed is Chulsoo still waiting for the only girl he ever loved? Although much of the cast is young the talent's intellectual depiction of their roles makes for a deeply emotional experience. Cleverly told with mature likable characters A Werewolf Boy certainly offers its viewers a very unique experience. The effects although infrequent are exceptionally produced and the soundtrack that accompanies the scenes really sets the mood.Much of the film takes place on the land SoonYi's family lives on and though there are many films that require a wealth of locations A Werewolf Boy is not one of them and manages to keep the viewer's attention through the use of character development and plot. Moreover the camerawork brilliantly captures the environment the story is set in revealing the countryside's beauty.Despite there been a couple of story elements that remain largely unexplained answers are not crucial for viewers to enjoy the feature and although the film's final scene is a little anticlimactic I personally am unable to find fault with the feature. A beautiful heartwarming story about love family struggle and humanity A Werewolf Boy is the kind of film that should come equipped with a gigantic box of tissues because by the end you are definitely going to need them.".

A really amazing story The movie is a little long and the werewolf part plays a small role in the movie and the werewolf part was what drew my attention but anyway It is a story about romance love betrayal loyalty it's funny and it is sad makes you furies and in general it makes you feel a lot of things.The plot is amazing you really see the relationship between the actors grow change and mature as time passes. The acting is great and the dialogue is not bad although in some parts it is but this doesn't change the fact that this movie is great. But let me point out as many before me did this is not a horror movie. When I rented it I didn't read the plot so I was expecting something totally different.".

	schema:headline " A far better love story than Twilight.";
	schema:reviewBody "Don't go.A romantic film without a single kiss. It's an amazing feat especially for a film so critically acclaimed. A Werewolf Boy is a Korean film about the forbidden love between a werewolf and a young girl. While the premise may seem shallow and overdone A Werewolf Boy goes a completely different direction from the Hollywood stories. A sickly girl Soonyi Park Boyoung moves with her family to an open countryside where they encounter a homeless boy with wolfdog like behaviors. The family decides to take care of the young man for the time being giving him the name Chulsoo Song Joongki. Soonyi trains Chulsoo resulting in the growth of a beautiful bond between master and boy.The film may start slow for some but the first half is filled with many charms usually just from simple interactions. Song Joongki does a very convincing job acting like a wild canine especially considering that most of his acting comes from facial expressions and body language alone. A lot of the early lighthearted humor comes from him scoffing down meals and fetching objects. Strangely enough seeing him act like a dog doesn't seem a bit ridiculous whatsoever. Even though Soonyi initially treats Chulsoo like a pet their relationship steadily turns into something more he is a good looking human being after all. The chemistry between the two characters and two actors work perfectly. Basically the first half of the film is innocent fun mainly strengthening the ties between Soonyi and Chulsoo in order to make their conflicts more devastating. And Park Boyoung with her superb acting really sells the devastation.A Werewolf Boy easily succeeds in creating a really despicable villain character. Jitae a son of a rich family stops at nothing in order to get rid of Chulsoo and claim precious Soonyi as his own. It's safe to say that the film builds up Jitae to be a bit too nasty to the point where I found myself constantly wishing for him to just rollover and die. The antagonist almost seems to come straight out from a play where his actions and mindset are cranked to extreme levels of arrogance and evil. I hate him more than Joffrey from Game of Thrones.While the film is geared towards young women it still has the potential to be entertaining for men as well. The film is a lot deeper than your average love story relying more on character development story and emotional turmoil rather than CGI love making scenes and fantasy action. Viewers not only see the bond between Soonyi and Chulsoo but feel it as well. However the very end of the film is slightly disappointing and has a missed opportunity to really sink in the emotions and leave the story with some mystery. Even so A Werewolf Boy is most definitely a better love story than Twilight.".

	schema:headline " Maybe not an alloriginal plot. But the compelling and moving story was told very well and acted splendidly";
	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film at the Imagine film festival 2013 in Amsterdam. A seemingly neglected boy is found in the barn. Cannot speak or behave properly but is yet adopted by a young girl who tries to raise him as best as she can to become part of the family. Starting with a dog training book she succeeds very well in her efforts and we see a special relationship growing between the two. Of course there are the usual counter powers who rather see the boy moved to an orphanage. But the mills of government grind slowly. The longer the decision what to do with him is postponed the better he becomes house trained and integrated in family life. Ultimately discussions about his fate falter. Yet he remains unable to make comprehensible sounds let alone speaking sensibly. We see all this in a long flashback lasting nearly all of the 2 hours running time.The film starts with a prologue where grandma Suni is called to her former birth place to decide what to do with the remains of a cottage and a barn where she had spent a considerable part of her youth. This relatively short prologue is followed by aforementioned extended flashback where we see a whole family moving to the country because of their ailing daughter Suni. During a stormy night she finds the wolf boy in the deserted barn. It is the first time that someone treats the boy with affection and they become attached to each other. She is the only one who has some influence on the boy.He eventually becomes a more or less accepted member of the family. The few times he deviates from the civilized route is when someone threatens the family. We observe him changing into a hairy and growling monster as per the standard werewolf routine as shown in other movies. This happens one time too much and people get suspicious in the aftermath of which his only viable option is to flee. Of course Suni chases after him and finds him. Alas she has no choice other than to leave him behind. She promises that she will return and asks him to wait for her.All of the above is acted splendidly. Even the kids that appear as brothers sisters and playmates of Suni act very naturally. The story is well told and two hours pass without much inclination to inspect our watches. There is also nice music under several scenes that were assumed to be moving. There were no particularly scary scenes not even the few nightly visits to the barn. This means that the film belongs to the Fantasy and Romance category rather than Horror. There is no reason to keep young kids away in spite of the word werewolf in the title. warning  spoiler ahead  Pity that some inconsistencies were not properly taken care of. For instance in the finale the boy still looks not very much older contrary to Suni who became a grandma in the meantime and has lived a full live as she says herself while the boy has done nothing but patiently wait for her. The latter is not very believable since we hear him speaking correct sentences now something we did not see him doing ever before. You won't learn mastering the language while all alone and not seeing other people. I think we missed a minor clarification there.A 2rd contradiction is that the young Suni speaks in sentences that are too complex with do not xxx and stop doing xxx for the boy to understand at that time but obviously he gets their meaning anyway. The only way to explain this it that we probably missed most of the dog training they did together understandable for reasons of timing or that he apparently grasped more than we think from her directions. That he could not speak apart from a few words does not mean that he did not understand the language and its basic syntax rules in combination with her tone of voice and body language. Isn't that the way we all learned our mother tongue??All in all still a good feelgood movie with the usual mix of good and bad characters. Even local policemen have their good and bad sides like in real life. The overcaring mother for ailing Suni was annoying some of the time. Overthetop annoying was the ever interfering son of the landlord who from the beginning is portrayed as someone not doing anything useful ever. Finally to wrap up my positive comments I did not feel the above average running time of 122 min as too long meaning that it holds your attention throughout. It is well acted and shot altogether.".

The 'werewolf' makeup was also very 1950ish. The director clearly did not spend much time on effects and substituted that for a good heartwarming story.

	schema:reviewBody "The Asian film market continues to deliver the most diverse films around with more actually working than not. They seem to take a lot more chances with storytelling and visuals than any other market. The latest A Werewolf Boy comes from Korea and offers a unique love story but does it work to tell the strange tale that it hopes too or is it one of those so far out there that it misses the mark and only speaks to certain audiences? A Werewolf Boy follows an elderly woman called back to a cottage that she used to live in when she was a girl. There she had encountered a young wolf boy living in the shed. What started out as a terrifying encounter turned into a lovefriendship as she uses dog training tactics to teach the boy how to live in the real world that will change her life forever. This is one of those fantasy stories that sounds a bit boring and probably shouldn't work but surprisingly delivers. Let's be clear there are no actual werewolves in this film but instead more of a feral young boy. The performances are really well done especially from Joongki Song who plays the wolfboy. He really plays up the dog behaviors making the character that much more believable without making it silly to watch. The film moves at a fairly slow pace with a few moments that could have been chipped to help it flow a bit better but most of it is necessary for the overall story. There are some aspects that are a bit predictable for where this story is headed but it never really continues on the standard path.There is no action or horror here but instead a heartwarming fantasy story of two people finding their own path in the world. The film begins in the present before jumping to the past for most of the film but the finale back in the present offers a tearjerker type ending that is sure to please and makes the film even better than it already was. This isn't a film for everyone as it is character and dialogue based but works well to tell this beautiful story.".

	schema:reviewBody "A Werewolf Boy aka Neukdaesonyeon turned out to be a much more entertaining movie than I had hoped for. I must admit that I was genuinely interested in this movie given the synopsis and also because it is a South Korean movie  and they usually put out some really great movies.I will say that A Werewolf Boy turned out to be more than just entertaining it was also a beautiful story and visually a beautiful movie. Visually I don't mean CGI beautiful but a really nicely shot movie.The story is about an elderly woman who receives a phone call and is brought back to her memories of a strange boy that she had come to know 47 years earlier. The family had just moved to a remote rural house where they found a mute and somewhat ferallooking boy was living by himself. The family takes him in and starts to help him become more civilized.I will not go into further details about the movie at the risk of giving away spoilers. But I will say that this is definitely a movie that has to be seen to be wholly experienced.Director SungHee Jo really managed to put together a memorable and touching movie that is wholly entertaining from the start and right up to the end. And you might actually want to have some tissue at hand towards the end of the movie  just a heads up.The acting in the movie was really good and people were doing fantastic jobs with their given roles and characters. And the characters portrayed in the movie were vivid welldetailed and brought to life so nicely on the screen and they really complimented the movie quite nicely.A Werewolf Boy is a great addition to the South Korean cinema vault because it is a movie unlike most others. You don't want to miss out on this experience.I am rating A Werewolf Boy a solid seven out of ten stars.".

The thought was that if they could breed a group of young men who acted like wolves in combat they would be an excellent fighting force and capable of viciousness that even human soldiers could not duplicate at their worst.Then the scientist dies the war ends the wolf boys scatter  all except one. The house barn and grounds are the only home he has ever known. When the home is rented by a young family they are at first frightened of this animallike boy and then in their innocence and kindness try to feed him clothe him socialize him teach him to speak which they fail at  at first!. However the young teen girl in the home schooled at home because of sickness is pursued by the son of their landlord and he basically is criminally insane and quite capable of rape or murder. So who is the REAL monster? This slimeball young man or the gentle until provoked young man who was raised as a wolf? Although it doesn't start off that way the romance between the girl and the wolf boy becomes the focus of the story by the time it ends. The faithfulness of the wolf boy in loving his owner she pets him on the head like a puppy is the most poignant and unforgettable aspect of the story. He will do anything for her even patiently wait for her for decades if need be. That's the constant love of a tamed animal for his owner. If only most human beings could love unconditionally like that.".

I usually don't mind these types of flick but it's just so darn dull predictable and boring most of the way through the build up. I am not sure if they just wanted to make a Korean Twilight with a werewolf or just cash in on Joongki Song popularity since he is or was the rising popular actor in Korea at the time. I just never found Joongki Song to be able to play tough strong cool or even charismatic characters. So he basically sticks to the the cute characters to win over fan girls which is understandable. But that is all this movie is for the most part just Joongki Song being this obedient cut dog character. It's basically like Twilight where girls can fantasize and maybe even enjoy but guys will be bored while on the date. And the main villain is just super laughable and more of a joke than anything else. It's like they wrote his character so he can act like such a bad and vile guy that just tries so hard to be bad. Everything about the villain in this movie is so darn forced it becomes very very difficult to take seriously. I can see why girls might like this flick but guys should probably pass on this one. If your girlfriend however wants to see this with you just do it. It isn't a unbearable movie to sit through but just not a very entertaining one for guys.5.210".

Stereotypes galore from the prissy ditsy uptown blonde through to the Chinese boy who's family owns a Chinese restaurant and he demonstrates Kung Fu skills. The actors seem very cameraaware talking at the camera instead of each other and it doesn't help that the story is full of woeful clichs and unrealistic dialog. There was no development of the characters i felt no attachment to any of them and towards the end i was wishing the enemy would kill at least half of them. The worst part for me is that the story suggests that they are mostly 17 years old but only 1 character the priests daughter groan actually looks right for the part. I would have turned it off halfway if it wasn't for the stoner character. At this point I started watching it like it was a spoof movie.The story unfortunately is full of holes and unrealistic events that make it so hard to watch. The enemy was made out to be so stupid and wildly inaccurate with their weapons. Please use a military adviser next time you want to make a film containing armed forces. Are we really supposed to believe that they wouldn't have engineers that could rebuild a bridge? On top of all the technical and military logic errors in the story it almost seems to completely ignore the fact that Australia has a defense force.Afraid of political correctness the Asian coalition army invading has no name and it is painfully skirted around making the movie more unrealistic. Trying to keep gender equality alive with woman enemy soldiers did we forget it was an Asian army? another painful reminder of the poorly written script. The lead female gaining inspiration for a wall mural depicting aborigines and English redcoat troops was a vomit moment. You guys realise that the English settled here right effectively conquering?? Just needed a scene with a woman vet holding an injured joey to finish it off.The only good thing about this film is the view of the national park.There is more but I'm over it.

They should have had a grownup check the script before starting production. Dump trucks are not bullet proof! Soldiers don't run away when a teenager blows up a lawnmower. Soldiers don't go for dinner when someone steals their tanker. Soldiers don't sneak up on enemy 'commandoes' with their gunlights on.It kept looking like it could improve and some parts looked very stylish but then ffffttt! Deflation.Paperthin character development dry lines ridiculous action sequences and the final scene... OMG lol wtf...I was embarrassed to have told my wife she should watch this with me she doesn't mind suspending disbelief when watching something like this but she laughed out loud at the final 5 seconds and I cringed!Sorry to the writer and director good on you for having the guts to make a movie no doubt better than I could do but sheesh maybe share the workload next time.";

I won't get into too much detail but even a nonmilitary person like myself knows that the way the invaders take over and police the town is completely implausible and impractical. And don't get me started on using gasoline as a high explosive which is used as a plot device not once but twice.When the main characters start musing on the current situation and how their lives were before the war an hour or two after returning to town no less it comes across as wooden and silly. Maybe if I was a 14 year old girl I'd be more forgiving but I'm not.To top it all off the movies doesn't have an ending. There's no satisfying conclusion to the story and it's blatantly clear they want to start a franchise with many sequels which hopefully will never be made.An awful awful film Red Dawn did it much better.".

	schema:headline " The children of the revolution have arrived too little too late";
	schema:reviewBody "In the Australian country town of Wirrawee Ellie Caitlin Stasey is preparing to organise a camping trip with six of her school friends. They include Corrie Rachel HurdWood and her boyfriend Kevin Lincoln Lewis Fiona a beautiful girl who has never been camping before Homer Deniz Akdeniz a Greek boy who is regularly in trouble with the police Robyn Ashleigh Cummings who comes from a strict religious family and Lee Chris Pang who normally works in his parents restaurant but is invited because Ellie likes him. These varied personalities have different reactions to the bushland but they eventually agree that they should regularly return to this part of the outback labelled as Hell. When they arrive back home though they are dismayed to find that the phone lines are dead and that Ellie's dog has been killed. They are unable to find any other working signals on their phones or in the other houses. Everyone in the town including their parents seems to have vanished. They soon realise that an Asian military force has invaded Australia and is holding people captive. The kids decide to fight for their freedom and work to sabotage their invaders. One of the most significant moments in Stuart Beattie's career as a screenwriter was to pen the screenplay for Michael Mann's dazzling thriller Collateral 2004. The Australian's script reminded Hollywood of many of the essentials that had been lost in mainstream genre cinema the necessity for deep characterisation regularly driven by smart witty conversations that were enjoyable to listen to. Beattie has been involved in various blockbusters since then. He worked on the stories for all three of the Pirates of the Caribbean films. He also penned the script to the film Australia and has been involved with the much anticipated Halo film project. With a desire to be at the helm of his own writing though Beattie has opted to make his directional debut by adapting the first novel in John Marsden's immensely popular young adult series Tomorrow When the War Began 1993. The film's timing could not be better. It is set in the present and hints at Australia's sometimes dangerous nationalist attitudes to other countries. Kevin says at one point you're either in or you're out echoing an infamous catchphrase by George W. Bush. The film also reveals its invaders to be an Asian military force something that is never unveiled in the novels. Frustratingly for Beattie and fans of the novel though this adaptation seems to have been pulled in two different directions for two separate mediums. Potentially interesting material and moral ambiguities are either simplified or minimised to single lines of dialogue. Marsden's stranglehold over the screenplay cannot be understated. He reportedly rejected numerous scripts and film offers prior to Beattie but was pleased with this treatment when he read through it. It makes few changes to the essentials of the novel. The personalities of the characters are just like the novel constructed rather than subtle. Marsden seems to have forgotten that time has moved on and those that cherished the novel in the 90s have grown up and presumably become more sophisticated. There's a lack of nerve here to let the audience think for themselves and allow them to delve into more complex issues. When Ellie kills her first soldier she looks over the body and her voiceover tells us how scared the soldier looked and how she must have been just like her. It's not enough for the camera shot and the perspective to exist by itself replacing the language of Marsden's novel. It's a reoccurring issue with a lot of the dialogue in the film. The characters exist for Beattie to voice moral questions just in case the audience didn't get them. Robyn has an argument with the group about not wanting to kill the soldiers because of her religious values. What happens to her is predictable and exists on a surface level with little reflection. You'd almost wish William Munny would show up and say It's a hell of a thing killing a man. He doesn't and the film's constraints towards it themes and the potential of its subtext are obvious.Some critics have spoken about the problematic decision to employ a novice director to work with such inexperienced actors. It's a legitimate concern as most of the performers bar Stasey lack presence on screen. They have mostly worked just on television and they're only given a small corridor to work in because of the specific outline of what their characters are supposed to be and sound like. There's a lot of clunky wooden dialogue that really only serves as a mouthpiece for the familiar questions relating to warfare. Thankfully the technical aspects of the film are much more impressive. For a debut director Beattie handles the action very well with some genuinely exciting set pieces. There's a very well staged escape from a showground and a slick chase against a group of armoured buggies. Each these action scenes look and sound terrific. They're very exciting and intense. Tomorrow When the War Began might satisfy young viewers with its slick action sequences and its stereotypical character traits. Yet those who grew up with the novels will be disappointed that the material here has not expanded or been updated thoroughly enough. This is a straight adaptation that cannot break from the shackles of the original author. Beattie has not been allowed to delve deep enough into new ideas about warfare or the psychology of the cartoonlike characters here. The probability of a sequel is high but it would seem that the children of the revolution have arrived too little too late.".

I have written a more in depth analysis which does not contain plot or ending spoilers but does partly describe some scenes for critical purposes on my film review site. On other criticisms some logic and laws of physics have been bent for dramatic purposes which in my opinion detract from the effect. Realism if respected on every level always impresses more. The Hollywood multiangle multi shot of the same effect is cartoonish and helps to degrade a drama rather than enhance it. This film does commit some sins but it is head and shoulders above the usual Hollywood fair in the action genre.In closing I recommend you see this film for it reveals a potentially extremely contentious issue regarding the invaders which may have historical sociopolitical repercussions more than any other Australian film before it particularly throughout Asia.This film will be remembered by many for a number of reasons. It is definitely worth the price of the ticket!".

	schema:reviewBody "OK so this was one of those films that I tripped over. It was amongst a list of supposedly worthy scifi action films in the SMH one day about three months ago. Now I pay to go see films in the cinema that I know I want to see. But films that I couldn't be bothered seeing or paying for but still have a curiosity over  I download using bit torrent. And so it was that this film along with some of the others came my way.Now I wish I had paid for it. Because it certainly is worth a proper screening! This film was a welcome breath of fresh air film making in the tradition of Aussie films where character development and story telling mean more than explosions. That's not to say that the explosions weren't good  they were  but this film brings back a rare thing nowadays in feature films  emotion.Give this film a go. It's under rated very delightful to watch and quintessentially Australian. Watching it you begin to truly believe that hey that could be my town my son my house. It challenges and yet entertains. And most of all it's simple to watch. You don't need an arts degree to enjoy it  it flows over you.Be patient with the beginning like many Aussie films and old cars it takes a while to get warmed up. In the end I couldn't fault this film. It's one of the rare recent releases that I know will be watched again and again.Zordmaker".

It is comic to see how a group of young people successfully fight against a powerful army of invasion. It remind me of the old movies about the stupid Nazi and the smart French resistance. It's OK the special effects the battle scene but nobody can ever believe that a golf car can explode like a Chinese fire game. And the romance appears to be pretty foreseeable the couples seems to be settled from the beginnings of the movie. It is a facile movie for young and naive spectators and I consider that it is a waste of time to see that movie.

	schema:reviewBody "Fans of the Tomorrow book series rejoiced at the news of a cinematic adaptation of John Mardson's iconic Australian teen epic Tomorrow When the War Began. As an enthusiast of the first 3 books in a series of 7 I was ecstatic that it would get big screen treatment and not some shitty bgrade telly movie as I had feared. I'm pleased to announce that I walked out of this energised with a racing pulse and a smile on the face. For those unfamiliar with the material the concept of is pretty much identical to Red Dawn  a group of teens from a country town go camping for a weekend to find out their country has been invaded and their family have been held captive. They hide out and guerrilla warfare ensues. Thematically the film captures the clichd 'working together' virtues of friendship corn from the novel. It is definitely in the writing that the film falls downwell more of a stumble than a fall. I found this particularly unusual given the writerdirector is Stuart Beattie  a screenwriter with an exceptional resume. He handles action far better than he handles characters in his directorial debut. Despite the ham and cheese in the writing the broader screenplay is emotionally satisfying.Whilst the acting is not of the highest calibre I would say it was on par with other large franchise films with a young teen cast specifically Harry Potter and Twi. The actor who plays Lee is the weakest link here. Although he has the visual presence for the role his delivery is consistently wooden. Caitlyn Stacey was a standout for me. She displays genuine emotion genuine intensity and fear. I would have preferred if she spoke like less of a 'toff' and ripped into that bogan Aussie accent but she brings a solid and believable strength. As well as capturing the essence of the novel the action sequences have been stunningly realised. The visuals have a polished look and feel on par with films with a much higher budget this had only 20AUD million thus I believe it would stand up well in an international market. By any standards the action is exhilarating and has been directed with clarity. Although I wouldn't have minded a bit more grit to the imagery the cinematography is exceptional and captures the Australian landscapes beautifully. The soundtrack and score was nicely chosen and the balance of humour and darker tones was effective. Whilst not being the major box office success some would have liked The Dead of the Night has been green lit so thankfully there is more to come in this promising franchise. Despite some awkwardness there is an energy in the characters and action that permeates Tomorrow When the War Began making it an entirely gripping experience. For me this was resonant action that sweeps you up and takes you on an exhilarating and emotionally fulfilling ride.".

	schema:headline " A brilliant adaptation and not your average blockbuster movie";
	schema:reviewBody "I was lucky enough to attend the world premiere of Tomorrow When the War Began yesterday evening and I have to say I was blown away. There were a few flaws but overall it was an absolutely brilliant experience.The film tells the story of seven teenagers who go away on a camping trip and return to discover that a foreign army has invaded their home and imprisoned their families and how they cope with this  and also how they fight back to save everything they care about.Soon after the film begins we are drawn into the world of Wirrawee actually Raymond Terrace in country NSW the small country town where these teenagers have lived their whole lives in. Ellie Caitlin Stasey our heroine is called out to her best friend Corrie's Rachel HurdWood house for exciting news and from there the two girls plan to invite friends on a trip into the wild unknown. As the story unfolds from here we are given clear insights into the characters' lives and personalities and the sense of atmosphere that we get is incredible  the relationships between all these characters are believable and already the production design is highly impressive.This film to me is split into two halves. The first half is lighthearted and hugely funny as we get to know all the characters and at this point I should name them  Corrie's boyfriend Kevin Lincoln Lewis Homer Deniz Akdeniz the wild man of the group Fiona Phoebe Tonkin better known as Fi the princess Lee Chris Pang the quiet introverted one Robyn Ashleigh Cummings who has strong religious convictions and later we meet Chris Andy Ryan who is perpetually stoned and is either in his portrayer's words highly intelligent  or highly stupid depending on who you ask. Romances are blooming all over the place and there is just a general sense of fun.The second half when the gang returns home and sees what has happened is much more serious although we still do get a few laughs here and there. It is filled with action  wild tensionfilled chases in trucks and enormous breathtaking explosions. However despite the blockbusterstyle action sequences this is definitely not your typical Hollywood movie where things get blown up and nobody cares. These characters are real people  they fight with each other they have to make incredibly hard lifeanddeath decisions that are in direct opposition to the values they have carried their whole lives and perhaps most believable of all they question the ethics of what they have to do to survive. As Ellie asks the group at one point How many people do I have to kill to keep myself alive? Not your bogstandard Hollywood blockbuster huh? The film also has something to say on the ageold topic of booktofilm adaptations and it was agreed by the characters who discuss this that the books are better which the audience found greatly amusing. I must say a word on the casting because it was absolutely topnotch in every case. However I have to give special props to Caitlin Stasey and Deniz Akdeniz for their extraordinary portrayals in this film. Caitlin is almost exactly as the book describes Ellie  a seemingly ordinary girl who goes on to do incredibly brave things and yet still doubts that what she is doing is right. It was an amazing performance full of gusto and real emotion. Good on you Caitlin! Deniz Akdeniz is also incredible as Homer. Homer starts off as a troublemaker and class clown type never taking anything too seriously and a lover of pulling pranks on his friends. However when the group become fugitives Homer begins to show his serious side demonstrating qualities of strong leadership and organisation. Deniz was able to portray both sides of Homer wonderfully and if he doesn't become a star after this movie is officially released then I will be very surprised. He also seemed to be the audience favourite too! The production values photography and visual effects are also outstanding and a huge congratulations go to the crew for pulling it off so beautifully.Overall this is an incredibly powerful and thoughtprovoking film and I strongly encourage everyone who reads this review to see it if it comes out in your area.".

	schema:headline " The acting and directing inexperience really shows and hurts the adaptation of a good book.";
	schema:reviewBody "I remember my thoughts when watching the trailer for Tomorrow when the war began. I had a good argument with a friend who was confident that the film's focus on character development would help it escape it's comparisons to Red Dawn.But honestly after the first 5 minutes of the film and being subjected to the expositional and awkward dialogue I knew my fears were well founded. I read the first three and a quarter books about ten years ago and remember giving up on the series when it started to become a tad too ridiculous. But in the film that element of ridiculousness bursts through during the first action sequence. In the book you controlled the environment through your perception of the text but in the film the realism being presented just doesn't juxtapose at all with the guerrilla scenes. When Ellie blows up the lawn mower and takes out the enemy soldiers Who look like rejects from a Japanese science fiction film in their black storm trooper gear you just can't accept it. Red Dawn at least was unapologetic and proud of it's gung ho approach. This film tries to ground itself too deeply in reality and as such the action just doesn't mesh well.Getting back to the script which is surprisingly clunky and awkward coming from an experienced screenwriter with various big American projects under his belt. The dialogue is awful and completely unhelped by the fact that the actors just aren't good enough to make it work. Perhaps if the director screenwriter had let them improvise a little it could have helped but as it is almost every line feels like it's being read off a teleprompter by a year 12 drama student. The dialogue also has a distinctly unaustralian flavour which also adds to the awkwardness of the performances. With some lines sounding incredibly B grade and almost straight out of Red Dawn.The action scenes themselves are badly shot with the camera not being able to decide what to focus on or follow. It isn't just the action as most of the shots are boring and bland with only a few exceptions.In terms of adapting the book the small town of Wirrawee and the outback hideout of Hell are painfully under developed as locations. I remember the hike down into Hell being arduous and interesting in the book whereas in the movie it feels like they just walk down a hill and they're there. You never get the sense of this home away from home sanctuary of the land feel that the book really emphasized and emphasized well In terms of character development the interactions feel extremely soapy. The chemistry between the actors is average at best and once again the script doesn't help with some characters being underused for huge portions of the film. This is the problem of the movie following the book a little too closely and choosing to only follow one group in the sequences where they will split up. In the book it wasn't a problem because the prose and inner monologue of the narration would keep you interested and make you generally surprised when the group would meet back up and something disastrous had happened to the others. But in the film it just doesn't work. You want to see what happened not be told. Show don't tell. This is the simplest aspect of filmmaking. It is also blatantly annoying when they meet up with the horrible stoner stereotype Chris who trails off into a horrible comic relief monologue about what he's been doing for the entire film when I've been high the whole time would suffice.The sound design is another element that hurts the film. The noises of warfare sound more like they're from a video game or Stallone film than the noises you'd expect to hear in a realistic environment. An emphasis on the sounds of the Australian bush would have been nice to help hammer home that this is Australia being invaded. This coupled with the bad art direction on the part of the invaders with their silly looking armour and Command and Conquer Nod Buggies just helps to make the action hurt the film even more.Overall I just couldn't get into the film at all. The pacing was too fast when it should have been slow and too slow when it should have been fast and there are some jumps in the story and time that feel a little clunky. This film had such an easy job to set it up so that I'd really feel for the characters and get behind their struggle but the sad fact that they're developed so badly and acted even worse made me actually start going for the soldiers.If this is the film that's supposed to rejuvenate the Australian film industry then god help us. Because if this is what the future holds we may as well just dub cheesy b grade American films with Australian accents because that's pretty much what Tomorrow When the War Began was.".

This coupled with the bad art direction on the part of the invaders with their silly looking armour and Command and Conquer Nod Buggies just helps to make the action hurt the film even more.Overall I just couldn't get into the film at all. The pacing was too fast when it should have been slow and too slow when it should have been fast and there are some jumps in the story and time that feel a little clunky. This film had such an easy job to set it up so that I'd really feel for the characters and get behind their struggle but the sad fact that they're developed so badly and acted even worse made me actually start going for the soldiers.If this is the film that's supposed to rejuvenate the Australian film industry then god help us. Because if this is what the future holds we may as well just dub cheesy b grade American films with Australian accents because that's pretty much what Tomorrow When the War Began was.";

I was laughing most of the way through not because of the 'good jokes' in the movie but because of how much of a joke the movie was!Where to start...the characters is as good as any place since it's all the same garbage. Horribly stereotypical characters from the farm girl who can drive anything to the Asian guy with natural instincts and the airheaded rich girl who just entered puberty. With the exception of Ellie who is well developed as she's the main one each character had no effort in their construction. The fact that the actors portraying the characters were equally bland did not help...Which brings me to the dialogue and acting. Just because there's a former neighbours star in this doesn't give the movie a right to copy eeeeevery boring clich from the show. Good lord it's awful which is very surprising considering STUART BEATTIE wrote the screenplay writer for the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie. I suspect he was being overpowered by the horrible acting by everyone and decided to make the script a bit easier to convey so I'll give him the benefit of the doubt. But some oneonone scenes between actors were so unbelievably boring and pointless at times most times that I actually turned my head and cringed. They are an embarrassment to the Australian Film Industry and are helping to keep us down movie B rated movies forever.Next comes the plot.

It's just full of holes...but at least we get a good lot of teenage drama instead...Next the action and movement scenes. Again I'm sure they're explained well in the book but the movie assumes a hell of a lot. They also portray the invading army as having the dumbest soldiers in history. At times they're in terrible danger and then suddenly they're back at a safe house! And they are also the least discreet group in the world. Seriously motorbikes.

	schema:reviewBody "A group of friends take an extended camping trip into the mountains. When they return they find their country invaded by an unknown force their families forced into a concentration camp and take it upon themselves to begin a resistance movement.I have not read the book but as an Australian I really wanted to enjoy this movie and I did but I also came away thinking that it could be a lot better. This is probably the most controversial film I have watched in a long time because I enjoyed the experience of watching it but I found so many problems with it as wellThe Good Ellie and Homer's character growth is strong and impressive impressive enough to carry the film past its problems.The action scenes are generally exciting.The film manages to maintain suspense even outside of the action scenes. It's good at conveying the emotions one should feel to find that their homeland has been invaded. I cared about the characters worried about the way they fought with each other and gritted my teeth for their success.The BadThe other characters don't grow much.Some dialogue is clunky. The beginning is a little cheesy as all the characters are introduced. The film does not start quickly.The action scenes are generally implausible petrol explosions are all too frequent a crime to intelligence that Hollywood itself has committed numerous times but don't we know better than that now? Petrol is rather hard to make explode because you need to make sure that it's mixed with a specific ratio of oxygen. Yet everything carrying petrol goes off like TNT. At one stage something containing petrol explodes three times. How?I complained to some friends about this issue and they said it was the same as in the book. When I suggested changing the explosive they disagreed because the movie should stay loyal to the book. But the book was about CHARACTERS. It wasn't about the way they did things but for anyone with a bit of technical knowledge it's clear that John Marsden didn't do a whole lot of research if this is an exact representation of the text.None of the characters look like year 12 students. I'm a high school teacher. It's very rare that any female students look like the longlegged tall slim beautiful models used in this movie. Likewise not all boys look like buff sportsmen but in this movie they do. Hence the movie loses some of its plausibility it doesn't look like school children taking the war to the enemy. It looks more like university graduates. Only one character  Robyn Mathers  actually looked like a real school girl except her clothes were so clichconservative Christian that even she looks a little unbelievable.Action scenes were implausible I like the idea of a movie where a bunch of teenagers outwit an invading force. But the director must be careful not to make the soldiers look dumb or incompetent. Instead heshe must make the teenagers look clever or lucky. This movie does not succeed here.Enemy strategy is questionable the whole TOWN was put in a concentration camp! This is not how you invade a country. Are they going to do this for every towncity in Australia? When you're invading a country you dedicate your forces to fighting that country's military and even once that's finished you allow the population to keep going about its daily business and put soldiers on the street to keep order. You try to keep local law enforcement intact so they can do it. You don't herd everyone into a camp because then you need to feed them and clothe them yourselves which even if not done well will draw resources away from where they're needed more.Despite all of these issues Tomorrow when the War Began has the framework of an interesting story and an interesting concept. It's a shame that anyone with a small amount of technical knowledge will be able to find more holes in this than a colander nevertheless if these things aren't a concern to you then here is an emotional adventure with a fair dose of suspense and action. I'll be going to see the sequel and I'll be praying someone remakes the movies in twenty years time.".

	onyx:emotionText "A group of friends take an extended camping trip into the mountains. When they return they find their country invaded by an unknown force their families forced into a concentration camp and take it upon themselves to begin a resistance movement.I have not read the book but as an Australian I really wanted to enjoy this movie and I did but I also came away thinking that it could be a lot better. This is probably the most controversial film I have watched in a long time because I enjoyed the experience of watching it but I found so many problems with it as wellThe Good Ellie and Homer's character growth is strong and impressive impressive enough to carry the film past its problems.The action scenes are generally exciting.The film manages to maintain suspense even outside of the action scenes. It's good at conveying the emotions one should feel to find that their homeland has been invaded. I cared about the characters worried about the way they fought with each other and gritted my teeth for their success.The BadThe other characters don't grow much.Some dialogue is clunky. The beginning is a little cheesy as all the characters are introduced. The film does not start quickly.The action scenes are generally implausible petrol explosions are all too frequent a crime to intelligence that Hollywood itself has committed numerous times but don't we know better than that now? Petrol is rather hard to make explode because you need to make sure that it's mixed with a specific ratio of oxygen. Yet everything carrying petrol goes off like TNT. At one stage something containing petrol explodes three times. How?I complained to some friends about this issue and they said it was the same as in the book. When I suggested changing the explosive they disagreed because the movie should stay loyal to the book. But the book was about CHARACTERS. It wasn't about the way they did things but for anyone with a bit of technical knowledge it's clear that John Marsden didn't do a whole lot of research if this is an exact representation of the text.None of the characters look like year 12 students.

	schema:reviewBody "I finally had the privilege of seeing THE LAST 4 DAYS a few months ago and I was blown away by how amazingly well done it was. The film stars the great Rod Steiger as Benito Mussolini who faces his last 4 days of life. The film features great Ennio Morricone music superb direction and great performances allaround by an allstar cast.Rod Steiger is INCREDIBLE as Mussolini. He faces his last days on earth having to make several major decisions as his life and nation fall apart around him. I can't describe his performance it's just powerful and incredibly believable. Franco Nero is great too as an Italian partisan officer who is assigned to kill Mussolini. Lisa Gastoni is excellent as Mussolini's wife who like any loyal wife wants to be with her husband through the thick and thin. Henry Fonda is very good in a small role as Cardinal Schuster who tries to help Mussolini but ultimately fails. Watch also for Giuseppe Addobbati Andrea Aureli Bruno Corazzari Marco Guglielmi Tom Felleghy Luciano Pigozzi John Stacy and finally Giacomo RossiStuart as an American officer assigned to apprehend Mussolini.The direction is tight and spectacular. Carlo Lizzani brings every aspect to the movie to life. The paranoia and confusion of Italy falling apart to stunning life. There is not a wasted frame in this movie and the pace is set perfectly. The editing is also very good  especially in the scenes where Mussolini is jumping from flashback to current time  are shocking realistic. Ennio Morricone's score is haunting and really penetrates you.I saw this movie as a copy of a copy of the Lightning Video. The print is relatively clear especially for a 3rd generation copy and I don't believe anything has been removed. If there is any missing footage it doesn't show in the editing. The credits are letterboxed about 1.851. See an original video don't be lazy like me and settle for somebody else's dub. The visual quality is essential to the theme of the movie.An amazing drama of a leader that not many people know much about. The film gives a true insight into the last days of his life and we see him as more of a man than as a diabolical Fascist leader. For being so professional and stunning in every way I give it a 10 out of 10.".

Very good acting also from Henry Fonda playing the role of Milanese Cardinal Schuster he worries more about Mussolini's fate than of those innocents who may have died during those days. The film showed well how Germans wanted to keep Mussolini and the efforts of the Americans to capture him. The director Lizzani did an excellent work trying to show these last hours of the dictator and his lover Claretta Petacci Lisa Gastoni. Very interesting dialogues were shown between the guerrilla fighters and Mussolini. He claimed that only Germans guilty of the war and that he had very little responsibility on what happened but the fighters refused all his coward arguments with real facts. Mussolini destroyed Italian democracy eliminated political parties and unions and also killed many innocent people. He supported well Hitler although he was a puppet in the hands of the Germans. I do not know whether Mussolini was killed together with his lover in a way it is shown in the film. What is known is that he tried to cross the border disguised as a German soldier in a convoy of trucks retreating toward Innsbruck Austria. He was recognized and together with Claretta shot in an area closed to Como. Until here the plot must be accepted but I wonder why Lizzani did not want to show further this history i.e. that the bodies were hung head downward in the Milanese Piazza Loreto in Milan.".

	schema:reviewBody "The story of the last tragic days of Benito Mussolini is not well known even by readers and students of history and specifically World War 2. The end for Il Duce came swift and dramatically. It was a fine line of circumstances that could have either seen him escape to Switzerland or return to Germany to join Adolf Hitler in his last days. The fact of what happened to Mussolini is sad tragic a terrible end for a man that was the galvanizing force for the rebirth and revitalization of a new and reformed Italy when Il Duce took power in 1922. For Adolf Hitler it was Mussolini who had always been a role model and an icon of the new philosophy of National Socialism. What happened to Benito Mussolini is a disgrace for such a great and visionary man that only wanted the best for the Italian people. Rod Steiger is superb as always as Il Duce. He reprized his role 6 years later in 'Lion of the Desert' 1980 when he played the visionary leader once more. Excellent film by Lizzani a master Director and sad to hear of his death just 3 months ago. Magnificent film.".

	schema:headline " The Tragedy of Benito Mussolini";
	schema:reviewBody "The film like the almost contemporaneous Hitler The Last 10 Days follows the final hours of one of the leaders of the axis powers during WW2 in this case Benito Mussolini. Rod Steiger plays Il Duce a role he was later to repeat in Lion of the Desert and the bulk of the film concentrates on the former dictator coming to terms with the fact that his freedom is gone and his life may soon be as well. It is a compelling performance as Mussolini begins defiant as the Germans demand to keep him under close guard on the express orders of the Fhrer attempts to wheedle deals with the Church and the Swiss to ensure an escape to neutral territory then falls into a sullen sulk as he is made a prisoner of the Italian partisans realising that he is probably going to be executed. By the time he is put up against a wall with a gun pointed in his direction he is almost catatonic.This delineation of Mussolini's fall from power gives the film an authentically tragic aspect. It is as if the first 4 acts of Macbeth were cut and the final movement with Birnam Woods closing in on the trapped usurper were to constitute the entire drama. There is a wannabe Nietzschean aspect to Il Duce a man who it is emphasised in the film looked on himself and was looked on by others as a God although the slumped wreck we see being executed at the end is quite without divinity. The film strongly posits that Mussolini lost his self entirely when he lost power an idea given vivid visual expression when he is wrapped in a headbandage whilst being transported the godEmperor being reduced to the Invisible Man. The film portrays the dictator as a morally dubious but not utterly condemnable character  although he sheds no tears nor has any feeling for the ruin he has brought on his nation he is a man constantly let down by those he trust whether it be his protg Hitler who invaded Russia against Benito's advice or his own blackshirts who fail to provide the promised cavalry to rescue him.Two other important character studies are intriguing. Mussolini's mistress Claretta Petacci is portrayed as the ultimate in servile love even sacrificing herself at the end in a vain attempt to save the man to whom she has uncritically if jealously devoted her life. In the final third of the film the partisan leader Walter Audisio 'Valerio' becomes a focus of attention driven onwards with a singleminded mission to ensure that Mussolini is executed in the name of the Italian people rather than becoming a trophy prisoner of either the Americans or the British. That Valerio is a rather inhuman cold figure adds a certain odd ambiguity to the film as only on an ideological level could we sympathise with this man against the Mussolini that we see through Steiger's performance. I am not sure whether to call this ambiguity daring or dangerous. The mistress and nemesis of the dictator are played respectively and excellently by Lisa Gastoni and Franco Nero. Henry Fonda has an intriguing cameo as a rather reptilian Cardinal whose sympathies and opinions are impossible to gauge.The film begins at a stonking pace cutting quickly through events and setting out the story admirably. The pace evens a little the tension mounts and the relationship between the dictators and his mistress gets explored with some depth and the negotiations as to what will happen to him get murkier.On the whole this is a rather remarkable film deserving of being much better known. It is a decent history lesson but far more a brilliant character study and chilling portrait of what happens when a human being overreaches himself and is brought down to nothing and death.".

Henry Fonda is a Cardinal trying to bring an end to the madness of the war. Franco Nero is a partisan hunting the deposed leader. From what I could tell of the film from the print included in the BCI Maximum Action set this would be a good drama had I seen the complete film. I mention this because the print I say ran under 75 minutes while the running time at IMDb lists it as having two different versions running 105 or 120 meaning that I did not see 30 to 45 minutes of the film. The result of this choppiness is that a scene that is a meeting between Steiger and Fonda who are the only two people in the room suddenly are joined by 7 or 8 other people when they miraculously appear in seats around the table in the course of one shot to the next.Its a surreal moment. I liked what I saw but There seemed to be so much cut out that I can't be sure that any problems I had was due to the film or the print. Worth trying for those interested in war time dramas assuming you can get a full version.Rating of 7 out of 10 is based on the assumption that all problems I had with the film were do to a choppy print".

Mok was the only character who was interesting and entertaining. Omar was a selfabsorbed narcissist who doesn't give the audience a reason to empathize. Omar's companions were overly juvenile as were Mok's assistants.The story has a great basisdangerous postapocalyptic world of mutants. But we don't really get much of a feeling for this world beyond the initial setup. Also we know that Mok wants to raise a demon but why? Did I miss it or is it never really stated? I assume he wants to dominate the world but it seems to me that he pretty much does already.Overall the movie is lacking character development and follow through on the story.

	schema:reviewBody "Rock  Rule was put out of print back in 1985 shortly after its first video run. Since then it has not really seen the light of day other than on ebay auctions random TV sightings and most recently on Bit Torrent. Now with a two disc special edition DVD being released it is finally time for this film to get the attention it deserves.Rock  Rule most likely failed because it was released in a time when animation was still dominated by the DisneyChildren's market. Ralph Bakshi had a few successful films in the 70's but as the 80's came along he failed. Transformers another PG animated film failed. There were so many experimental animated films coming out but none of them were successful just because of its more adultlike content. Rock  Rule isn't as extreme as say some of the Bakshi film are. But there is a strange use of drugs with orblike balls in the film sexual innuendos language etc. But nothing a young teen couldn't handle.Our story begins with some information about a war that is long passed. Humans don't exist anymore. What we have now are mutant evolutions of street animals dogs cats rats etc.. We are introduced to Mok. He's an Iggy PopDavid Bowie sort of character. His music career is somewhat going under. It isn't as strong as it used to be.He stumbles unto a secret code that can only be unlocked with a certain key. That key is the perfect voice. Once this code is unlocked a beast will come and destroy all that Mok wants to be destroyed.He stumbles upon a struggling band in his local town led by Omar and Angel. Omar sings the first song. Then Angel sings the second. When Mok hears this he discovers the perfect voice. So he does a little heist and kidnaps her and takes her to Nuke York to perform. After Omar and his friends wake up from a drughaze they travel to Nuke York to try and save her.Animation is splendid for its time. Crazy visuals. Especially during the Triumph scene. It's almost like a psychedelic trip. The music is also great featuring Cheap Trick Earth Wind and fire Iggy Pop etc.I suggest any fan of animation check this out once it comes out on DVD whenever that may be but it will be soon. It ain't a cult classic amongst true animation fans for nothing!".

Since then it has not really seen the light of day other than on ebay auctions random TV sightings and most recently on Bit Torrent. Now with a two disc special edition DVD being released it is finally time for this film to get the attention it deserves.Rock  Rule most likely failed because it was released in a time when animation was still dominated by the DisneyChildren's market. Ralph Bakshi had a few successful films in the 70's but as the 80's came along he failed. Transformers another PG animated film failed. There were so many experimental animated films coming out but none of them were successful just because of its more adultlike content. Rock  Rule isn't as extreme as say some of the Bakshi film are. But there is a strange use of drugs with orblike balls in the film sexual innuendos language etc. But nothing a young teen couldn't handle.Our story begins with some information about a war that is long passed. Humans don't exist anymore. What we have now are mutant evolutions of street animals dogs cats rats etc.. We are introduced to Mok. He's an Iggy PopDavid Bowie sort of character. His music career is somewhat going under. It isn't as strong as it used to be.He stumbles unto a secret code that can only be unlocked with a certain key. That key is the perfect voice. Once this code is unlocked a beast will come and destroy all that Mok wants to be destroyed.He stumbles upon a struggling band in his local town led by Omar and Angel. Omar sings the first song. Then Angel sings the second. When Mok hears this he discovers the perfect voice. So he does a little heist and kidnaps her and takes her to Nuke York to perform. After Omar and his friends wake up from a drughaze they travel to Nuke York to try and save her.Animation is splendid for its time. Crazy visuals. Especially during the Triumph scene. It's almost like a psychedelic trip. The music is also great featuring Cheap Trick Earth Wind and fire Iggy Pop etc.I suggest any fan of animation check this out once it comes out on DVD whenever that may be but it will be soon. It ain't a cult classic amongst true animation fans for nothing!";

Being a fan of stories with an apocolyptic bent I really enjoyed this particular film. My friends and I still quote various parts of the film even after all this time. While the story is a little short I feel it captures some of the frustration of being in a smalltown band that is trying to break out. That and the fact this band must battle a vast evil is an interesting angle. Please won't someone rerelease this diamond in the rough?".

Great story great animation great voiceovers great songs  great movie.  In my opinion I would have to put this movie above Heavy Metal in comparison with viewability.  This movie I could watch over and over Heavy Metal always puts me to sleep near the end now.

I won't say it was a 10 though... it's a basic guysavesgirl story but one with a rolling plot gritty animation and like I said before a great soundtrack!

It's a single cohesive story of music power evil and their surprising interactions played out in a postapocalyptic future where the human race's selfdestruction has paved the way for an entire society of anthropomorphically mutated street animals.

If you appreciate the poprock scene from the late 70's and into the 80's then you already know that the melding of Blondie Cheap Trick Lou Reed Iggy Pop and Earth Wind  Fire result in an eclectic and powerful soundtrack. Add a mature atmospheric animation style that combines several different techniques welldeveloped characterization and a quirky sense of humorall within a darklyflavored scififantasy storylineand you have Rock  Rule. This film secured cult status soon after its initial undermarketed release in 1983 and has quietly thrived for years in the secondhand and bootleg universes.

It was supposed to be I'm sure the project that blew Nelvana wide open. But sadly it wasn't supported and so was relegated to cult status  joined recently by 'Iron Giant' and 'Waking Life' which is good company. The animation is superb especially when compared to the FIRST feature film of ANY animation studio fully animated in the league of Chuck Jones Bleuth and Disney. The completely original story does meander a little but provides plenty of fun along the way. The performances are honest fun and full of humor. There are also the great gems of song and story synthesis that without having to make the film a musical are performed by Lou Reed Debbie Harry and Cheap Trick. To my knowledge it also utilized some of the earliest computer animation within a traditionally animated piece. This isn't a film for preteens or adults who expect animation to remain Grated. It's also not the 'Deer Hunter' or 'Chinatown' of animation but it's one of the strongest steps in that direction to this day. It is a film for teenage rocknrollers growing up in the shadow of nuclear apocalypse and therein succeeds 100.".

The story is brought by the director to the brink of tragedy and Esma might well end badly at one point or two but then the plot gently turns a bit and there is no more tragedy that what has already happened during the war and which we sense rather than see through Esma's own reactions at scenes recalling her of those times.

	schema:reviewBody "'Grbavica' is yet another superlative film coming from Bosnia. Firmly walking in the footsteps of Bosnian Best Foreign Language Film winner 'No Man's Land' the film trails a promising future for the fledging Bosnian film industry. This small understated production is the proofpositive of the vibrancy of the Eastern European Cinema. A pioneering feature effort by the writerdirector Jasmila Zbanic the film has already been accoladed the prestigious Golden Bear at this year's Berlin International Film Festival and is sure to be a strong contender when it hits International festival circuit.Ms Zbanic has created a quiet sentimental and feminine picture of the war's aftermath and the emotional toll the war inflicts on a motherdaughter relationship. She assuredly with a hand of a born filmmaker creates a small but potent film which is a startling reminder of cinema's transcendental powers.'Grbavica' is sure to snuggle in the same underrated niche of antiwar movies that deal with lasting trauma on the psyche of war survivors. Movies like Hal Ashby's unforgettable 'Coming Home' or Russian 1959's classic 'Balad of a Soldier'.The picture's lasting impact owes much to the haunting performance of Mirjana Karanovic a consummate artist who has for over a decade been the most decorated and awarded actress coming from wartorn former Yugoslavia. In Esma Mirjana has entered the body and soul of a tormented war victim with a dark secret and thus given us yet another performance to talk about. Her daughter Sara is expertly played by the little Luna Mijovic in a film debut reminiscent of Natalie Portman's careerlaunching role in Luc Besson's 'The Professional'.Variety's Russell Edwards pinpointed film's main shortcoming '...the film is all set up and little pay off'. Indeed although wellrounded and balanced 'Grbavica' lacks complexity and dramatic density. A story thread is missing a counterpoint of sorts that would have enriched its thematic appeal and elevated its dramatic tension. Even the best of war movies intentionally or not on some level or another could be seen as onesided and propagandist. It took more than a hundred years of cinema for a filmmaker to come along who realized this inherent danger in making war movies. 'Flags Of Our Fathers' is a solid war movie with a strong antiwar message. But who could blame some Japanese for seeing it as antiJapanese. That's why the old man Clint creating cinematic history has given us 'Letters of Iwo Jima' the version of the same battle seen through the Japanese pointofview. Unspeakable atrocities are committed in any war. It would be idealistic if not idiotic to expect that a humane war could ever be waged. Both sides commit them the stronger always more than the weaker. Had Ms. Zbanic weaved a story thread that would have touched upon this unfortunate reality her subtle and soulful feature debut would have radiated universality of a true masterpiece.".

It is personal a message to each one of the viewers to try to put themselves in victim's shoes and see how they would cope. Hard core stuff.

The director managed to show normal life of Sarajevo it was so easy to identify with Esma and Sara's problems even for people who never had such traumatic experience.That's why the ending was even more shocking. I had tears in my eyes and that happens very rarely I'm not sentimental at all  and when I secretly looked around I saw all the others have tears in their eyes too.One little offtopic comment I saw here comment that Esma shouldn't swear to Tito in the film because she was too young when Tito died and her generation didn't feel Titoism so strong. I was only 3 when Tito died. But even 8 years AFTER he died we in Croatia still had to sing Comrade Tito we swear to you not to turn off your path and Comrade Tito white violet all young people love you.

What have they done to deserve a life like this and what actually keeps them going but not giving up? Zbanic gives us the answer  it is love the love of your family the love of your home despite it being a kind of contaminated qualified and conflicting love which is eternally tainted with gruesome memories and haunting flashbacks. The nationalistic song sung by the students and in the end an unsettled Sara on the bus sums up this theme neatly and concisely.A very genuine and downtoearth movie which speaks so much for itself and for the victims of war crimes who are and will still be living in a war of their own emotions for the rest of their lives. Besides the direction is simplistic with a classy emotional twist powerfully built up to the climax of the scene of Esma's confession. The ending scene is a lifetime unforgettable. No words just a song but it sums up what Sara has to feel and say perfectly. The acting is superb expectedly from the veteran Karanovic and pleasantly surprisingly from the teenage Luna Mijovic.It is worth in the least Oscar nominations for the best director and the best foreign film .

This is a compelling piece and I hope everyone who is mature enough for it will watch it. It is about a mother and daughter in Bosnia trying to make ends meet after the end of the Balkan war. You do not need to have much if any prior knowledge of the country or culture to appreciate this. Zbanic directs it with great skill nothing is excessive it all fits perfectly and a lot is gone into in 90 consistently wellpaced minutes. Anyone reluctant to try foreign films ought to give this one a chance. This can help prove that not only the West can produce accessible movies. I understand that some feel that this takes sides in the conflict but I cannot claim to concur with that. And in fact this is such a universal story of pain and struggle that it can be applied to countless other locations around the world. If any fingerpointing can be claimed to occur in this it is towards battle. The character are all wellwritten credible and welldeveloped. Every acting performance is completely spoton. Karanovic as the overworked Esma and Mijovic as the rebellious tomboyish Sara are spellbinding. Music is wellchosen. The editing and cinematography are excellent. This gripping tragedy engages the audience and emotionally affects us without being manipulative. I am not aware of dubs and in any case I suggest just accepting the subtitles. Not understanding a word of what was spoken I can't say for sure about the amount however I believe there is at least a little strong language. There is brief nudity and arguably sexuality as well as disturbing content in this. I recommend this warmly to any fans of drama who are old enough. 810".

The film explores the nature of life where many live with their own memories of war it's a sensitive movie although a somewhat obvious one nothing here contradicts the official verdict that the Bosnians were the victims of the Serbs something which may well be true in general but a more interesting film might have probed the exceptions.

	schema:reviewBody "Beautiful City Shahre ziba is an intense universal story of love and death within societal strictures as much as stories by Shakespeare Tolstoy Henry James Edith Wharton I.B. Singer or O. Henry etc. etc. It just happens that here love from parents children siblings friends spouses and suitors has to find an outlet within Islamic law as practiced in contemporary Iran so they are silhouetted against extreme options.Writerdirector Asghar Farhadi is as observant of the power of human emotions as those masters in letting the story and characters unfold slowly like an onion. Each becomes more complex than we see at first each has reasons motivated by strong feelings that teeter between sacrifice and fulfillment.All the characters have choices to make  and feelings they cannot choose to control. A father's grief is as implacable as the undying love of his daughter's boyfriend. A mismatched couple a spirited Taraneh Alidoosti as the woman Firouzeh falls in love without ever touching or exchanging an endearment and completely enclosed in clothes as a lesson to Western cinema. All know that if they compromise they will be diminished or something irretrievable will be lost. As each must ask just how far to go for love they are trapped as much by human nature as by the stringent details of Islamic law with resonance for any country that has legal revenge through the death penalty. The character who takes over the heart of the film is a familiar figure in every culture  the confident negotiator who could talk the devil out of whatever with charm wile and persistence. A thief he is at equal ease creatively debating with his jailer as with an imam. But in a short period of time this incipient Milo Minderbinder as in Catch 22 dramatically learns that the mysteries of the human soul may be beyond even his bargaining. Striving to save his best friend's life and finding unexpected ramifications whatever he does young Babak Ansari as A'la grows before our eyes.None of the characters is a stereotype. The jailer is like a sympathetic social worker. The imam is very practical about life though oddly his quoting of Koranic verses aren't translated in the subtitles. The sister stands up to abuse. The teenage murderers acted out of deep love. Even the strict abusive father is seen as crazed with a sorrow he cannot let go. So there are no Hollywood endings to their lives.The look of the film seems like faded 1940's Hollywood Technicolor with a bluish tinge making it look old fashioned even as we see a Nike cap and other miscellany of modern culture among the evocative atmosphere of crowded jails rooms and mosques. The familiar issues of drug addiction poverty domestic abuse etc. that complicate love are universal beyond the head scarves and unfamiliar architecture. The English subtitles are always legible turning from white to yellow against light backgrounds.".

These include delinquent youth drug dealers and their hoods the very negotiable economically and religiously Islamic death penalty and prostitution on various levels.I wonder whether films like this are shown in Iran? Of course the masses would never run to see this movie. And obviously all these Iranian films are intended for foreign mostly western viewing particularly at festivals. But I wonder whether anybody can just show up at a cinema and see it or is it shown at semiprivate showings for a select audience. If it is how can this distorted Islamic government continue? Anyway that's the most interesting point of the film. It shows whether true or not that the government in Iran is not that Islamic not that intolerant somewhat democratic. But the society under those black clothes and automatic God is great messages is as corrupt as the world's most corrupt and more purely capitalistic than the social democratic capitalism we have today. In the film everything from death sentences to pardons from marriages to an opportunity for a lifesaving medical operation not to mention drugs and people can be bought and sold with Tomans Iranian cash.".

At first the movie's setup seems primitive and there seems to be undue absence of emphasis on the crime itself the immediately sympathetic characters all claim that their friend a murderer doesn't deserve to die but this is merely asserted and never proved. But as the film proceeds it becomes clear that this is not the point instead we see how with the final verdict put in the hands of the dead person's father responsibility for the killer's fate in passed onto those both the father and also those who must plead with him for clemency who cannot deal with it and who will find no closure through being asked to take it on. The film's depiction of the role of women in an Islamic society is also perceptive and interesting. The subtle ending perfectly concludes a quiet tragedy that ultimately delivers more than is promised at the start.".

Knowing that Akbar has repented enough in the two years has a good heart  doesn't deserve this punishment A'la gets out of that place and later accompanied by Akbar's sister Firoozeh tries his best in persuading the victim's father to spare the boy from certain death.The movie also shows that no matter how restrictive a society is money can buy everything including life  death. As the movie progresses we find out that the lives of these characters aren't as transparent as we assumed in the beginning and the story slowly becomes a gritty examination of moral  human complexities and no character is spared from making a lifealtering choice.Covering the themes of love corruption sacrifice forgiveness and how the confinements of society  religion sometimes stops a person from going with what the heart desires Beautiful City is another thoughtprovoking cinema from Farhadi with a universal appeal that in the end may leave you little lost but you'll come around eventually. Also it was after this film that Farhadi started crafting one masterpiece after another so if you've seen his later films before this one like I did I suggest that you don't have the expectations of Fireworks Wednesday About Elly or A Separation from this film.".

Gail Patrick who became Gail Patrick Jackson and produced Perry Mason having married Erle Stanley Gardner's agent does very well as the pretty other woman.This is one of those films where one asks so why wasn't I crazy about it? The only reason is that there was a sameness about it and nothing really to differentiate it  including the cast  from all the other light romantic comedies.

	schema:reviewBody "This is a film that came between two of Joan Crawford's best work in the movies while still employed by MGM Grand Hotel and The Women. This is a film seldom seen these days. Thanks to TCM we had the opportunity to watch it.In fact No More Ladies is an adaptation of a stage play. Even though George Cukor was not given credit for helping Edward Griffith with the direction the adaptation can't circumvent the fact one is watching a theatrical play the way it unfolds on the screen. Donald Ogden Stewart a talented screen writer is among the several people that collaborated with the script. The problem with the screen play is that if feels too artificial.The film is worth a look because of the star turn by Edna May Oliver who as Fanny steals the picture from its principals. Although not a radiant beauty Ms. Oliver makes her presence known from the start because of her wit and the lines she delivers with absolute conviction and flair. As Neil Doyle has commented in this page Ms. Oliver is the best thing in the film.Joan Crawford is Marcia the rich girl in love with Sherry a man who has an eye for beautiful women and who doesn't mind straying. Ms. Crawford dressed by Adrian shows she had a way to show herself at an advantage in front of the camera who loved her features but somehow she comes across as too remote and she doesn't seem to have too much chemistry with her costar.Robert Montgomery plays Sherry the man who can't keep away from women as is the case when he meets Theresa an attractive girl about town who couldn't care less if he belongs to another. Mr. Montgomery was an actor well suited for this type of comedy. He is always effective in the characters he portrays in film.The supporting cast is interesting. Gail Patrick is perfect as Theresa a role she was always good at portraying. Franchot Tone and especially Charles Ruggles are seen at their best. This film marked the debut of Joan Fontaine billed as Joan Burfield in a small part.No More Ladies is a curiosity film made more enjoyable by the presence of Edna May Oliver.".

	schema:reviewBody "For sporadic moments of amusement No More Ladies is perfectly satisfactory. It has the MGM lusciousness and gleam that the other studios envied. Note the great looking costumes on Joan Crawford Joan Fontaine and Gail Patrick wear. The sophistication is showed by the hohoho jokes that are dropped by the likes of Crawford Robert Montgomery Franchot Tone and Edna Mae Oliver. This is the type of film that has the hero with a name like Sherry. People go to night clubs and to fancy restaurants and take drives in Central Park at night it is after all the 1930s.The film is a bore  it occasionally amuses because of the cast but the dialog is brittle for the sake of brittle. It is Noel Coward's world but not the real wit he brought  Coward's best plays show a streak of harshness and mutual malevolence mixed with affection in his couples like Amanda and Elyot in Private Lives. They also tend to be smarter than the characters here.Also the characters are not all that amusing nowadays. Montgomery's cousin is Charlie Ruggles who is constantly drunk. Ruggles is a favorite comedian to me but here he was dull. Reginald Denny is around as a British version of Ralph Bellamy  an available altersuitor to Montgomery for Crawford and while Denny is elegant in a skittish sort of way he is not at all as amusing as Ralph Bellamy was in His Girl Friday or The Awful Truth.After watching this film I stopped to consider the three leads. Montgomery was typecast for most of the 1930s except for an occasional film like The Big House as a happy amoral socialite. Nobody really played the uppercrust cad as well as he did but he got bored by it and fought for meatier parts  and after his brilliant Danny in Night Must Fall he got them. Crawford reveled in parts like the hardworking lower class girl fighting her way to happiness but she did many socialite parts as well. Along came The Women and she played a villainous social climber. After that came the really hardboiled darker parts of the 1940s and 1950s like Mildred Pierce and A Woman's Face and Flamingo Road. Tone in 1935 would start having roles like Bryam in Mutiny On The Bounty  like Montgomery he would play his wealthy cads but he would be able to step into nastier meatier roles like The Phantom Lady and The Man On The Eiffel Tower. When one talks to their fans about the great work of these three actors it is the films where they played characters with demons after them that are recalled. Few really recall a piece of meaningless cotton candy like No More Ladies regarding any of them.".

	schema:reviewBody "One of many sophisticated romantic comedic trifles to emerge from the 1930's this one has its merits but is also fairly unremarkable. Crawford plays a petulant socialite who's tired of the inconsistent attention that her beau Montgomery pays to her. He has a welldeserved reputation as a ladies' man and she wants to be his only lady. On a bit of a whim they marry and settle in peaceably for a few moments. Before long he almost instinctively from years of doing so is romancing his pal Ruggles' lady friend Patrick and standing up Crawford who's staying at the country home. When she finds out about his indiscretion she sets out to teach him a lesson by inviting Ruggles Montgomery's former flame Osborne Osborne's former husband Tone her current husband Treacher and even Patrick down for the weekend! There's also a sizable sheepdog along for the ride. Crawford uses Tone to make Montgomery jealous while he endures the presence of the various characters she's included in the mix. Presiding over everyone is Crawford's snappy sassy aunt Oliver who rarely let's an incident go by without some bit of commentary. Crawford looks terrific in this film all eyes and mouth and with striking Adrien gowns though she does sport one icky set of bangs during one sequence. Her performance contains a range of emotions from anger to tears to sarcasm but it's a bit heavy for something this fluffy. Montgomery is properly charming but plays a pretty unsympathetic character. He's a wolf. Ruggles' tipsy role will appeal or repel an equal number of people depending on their taste. Tone is given little to do but look dashing in a tuxedo and provide a dot of conflict with Montgomery. Patrick gives a knowing and secure portrayal offering some needed carnality in this era of the Hayes code which restricted what could be said and shown. Osborne and Treacher are amusing as a newly married yet mismatched couple. Really the best thing about the film is snarky wizened Oliver who milks her role for every drop of humor wit and presence it is capable of providing. Also popping up for a few seconds is Fontaine as one of Montgomery's jilted girlfriends. It's an attractive film with art decostyle sets and fancy clothes but there's nothing particularly striking or memorable about it. These types of stories have been done many times and often in a more entertaining fashion though it's also not a bad film. Fans of the stars especially of Oliver should enjoy it more than others.".

So when his girlfriend Joan Crawford is bored they decide to get marriedeven though Robert's track record with serious relationships is horrendous. A short time after the marriage Robert decides to start chasing other womenleaving poor Joan to cry and bemoan her fate. Considering he never pretended to be anything else other than a shallow ladies man it seemed odd that she was so saddened by his predictable behavior.So far in the film I was not impressed. The characters either seemed selfish and unlikable Montgomery or hopelessly stupid Crawford. For comic relief Charlie Ruggles did a bad drunk characterization that was supposed to be cute but frankly just annoyed me. So considering that I kept watching the film is a bit of a surprise.Fortunately the film did get much better. Instead of whining at length Joan came up with a clever plan to try to win back her husband's love and attention. While this was much more watchable I kept thinking to myself why would she want him back?! but despite this it at least kept my interest.The bottom line is that I had a hard time caring about the character especially since rich folks who make themselves miserable are hard to relate to or worry about. Because of this the film definitely falls into the time passer category and not much more. Fans of the actors may want to tune it but others probably can just skip this one. There are just better films out there from this time periodones that will engage you.".

Then when he cheats she acts surprised and comes up with a stupid plan to get him back. Franchot Tone figures into this and he's no more likable than in any of his other movies with Joan.The comedy relief comes mostly from Edna May Oliver and Charlie Ruggles. Oliver was the best thing about the movie though that seems overstated somewhat by other reviews I've read. She wasn't THAT good. It's not like she saved this sinking ship. For those of us who have seen Oliver in other better movies we know she has had better roles than this. But still weighed against the rest of the cast she is the best here. Ruggles is awful. He always was a mixed bag. Sometimes I could enjoy him but others he was just annoying. This is the latter with Ruggles doing a terrible drunk act that got old in the first scene. Just a poor movie. I hated the main characters and didn't care what happened to them. Avoid it unless you're a diehard fan of the stars and easily forgive their clunkers. Joan Fontaine makes her film debut under the name Joan Burfield.".

Even though that's the case the two get married but this doesn't stop him from seeing women so Joan decides to throw a party of her own to make him jealous. NO MORE LADIES is pretty much a B story with an A cast and the end result isn't a classic but fans of the cast should at least want to watch it once. I think the best thing the film has going for it are the performances with Crawford leading the way. She's certainly very believable as the woman whose heart is breaking because the man she loves keeps stepping out on her. She's also believable in her scenes with Franchot Tone the man who wants to marry her. The two of them share some nice chemistry and this makes for some good scenes. Charles Ruggles is also very good in his supporting role as a drunk and we also get Edna May Oliver Reginald Denny Joan Fontaine and Gail Patrick in small roles. I think the biggest problem with this film is that it really doesn't have the guts to stand out or try to be anything special. Crawford basically gets walked on the entire movie and once her revenge starts to happen the film just goes extremely soft. I'm not going to ruin what happens but it's quite predictable and leads up to a rather silly and embarrassing ending. Still fans of the stars will want to check this out for them but just don't expect a classic.".

	schema:headline " Obscure Hollandhorror!";
	schema:reviewBody "It seems that Dick Maas' De Lift has become a true horror gem over the years and I even picked up that it's most wanted among cultcollectors. Well here in the home countries The Netherlands and Belgium you can still easily find an old copy in videostores or even on fleemarkets so all you avid fanatics should come pay us a visit! To me De Lift will always remain special because it was one of my very first encounters with the horror genre but even from a more objective viewpoint I still think it's a very decent film with some genuine scares and an impressively grim atmosphere. The plot is far from brilliant on the verge of ludicrous actually but that's widely made up by some effective shocksequences and Maas' talent to build up slow suspense. After several people got injured by the newly installed elevator in a fancy building complex mechanic Felix Adelaar is hired to do a detailed check up. Together with a persistent female reporter he discovers that the production company has been experimenting with new chips that totally haven't been approved yet. There's a painful use of clichs the dialogues are poorly written and  granted  there's a little too much talking going on. But when the characters aren't talking nonsense there's some pretty unsettling stuff to see! In the scariest sequence of the entire film the fiendish elevator plays a deadly game with a young girl while the ominous music will make you move to the end of your seat. The footage filmed in the ugly shaft is really chilling and there's some excellent lowbudget gore as well with a nasty decapitation and a vile hanging as the absolute highlights. The biggest criticism I've come about this site is about the awful dubbing but since I'm Dutch speaking I luckily didn't suffer from that. De Lift was Dick Maas' first longfeature film and he also pleased the Dutch audiences with the happily deranged adventures of the Flodder family before emigrating to Hollywood where he remade his own debut. Even though Maas managed to recruit a great cast for this project Naomi Watts Ron Perlman Dan Hedaya... it totally lacks the obscurity and dark cinematography of the original. Give it a look....if you can find it.".

No. Another thing that was not really good was that Huub Stapel's character is getting in a divorce because his wife thinks that he's sleeping with another women.

Yet there are fun moments such as when an unfortunate security guard is decapitated by an elevator. Also Stapel is an appealing workingclass Everyman sort of hero and he has some chemistry with the striking van Ammelrooy. They receive able support from players such as Josine van Dalsum as Felix's wife Siem Vroom as a police inspector and Hans Veerman as the boss at Rising Sun the electronics company working in tandem with Felix's employers.The script does possess some passing interest for the way that it touches upon the subject of technological evolution with computers that used to fill up entire rooms now becoming much more compact and the advent of computer chips.The Lift is a little light on gore and other exploitable elements but overall it's fairly entertaining to watch. Maas does pretty well working with the limited budget and IS expert at crafting suspense especially the eerie and atmospheric finale with Felix in an elevator shaft. The electronic score composed by Maas is likewise a highlight.One of the set decorators is Matthijs van Heijningen Jr. who 28 years later directed the prequel to John Carpenters' The Thing.Seven out of 10.".

Here you have a elevator in a very big building with one sinister secret. During a dinner party four guests are very drunk and they go in the elevator to their rooms. However it stops midway and the guests begin to overheat.Fortunately they do get rescued and sent to the hospital. The mechanic FelixHuub Stapel takes a look at the building and check it out from top to bottom for flaws. He finds none. But he's still curious about it. After checking it out another tragedy strikes. Then there's the guard who lost his head. Felix's obsession with the lift gains the attention of a reporterWilleke von Ammelrooy who followed up on him. His obsession with the lift has put a strain on the marriage. Which would lead to the company he works for. A super chip has given the computer to give life which proves to be fatal. A very intriguing film. Fun to watch. Recommended for the rainy day times. 3 out of 5 stars".

	schema:reviewBody "Eric Deighton's review of De Lift 1983Warning spoilersEveryone loves John Carpenter's Halloween. De Lift is the Dutch answer to Halloween. Like John Carpenter Director Dick Maas writes directs and composes the music for the movie De Lift 1983. Dick Maas does a great job at all three roles. The plot is well written and slowly builds suspense and intrigue. The movie is slickly directed and contains a number of trick camera shots like the bowling scene and an overall very stylistic camera work. The lighting of the exterior of the elevator is especially effective. The score is a clearly Carpenterinspired synthesized bit of music that really adds to the atmosphere of this movie.Director Dick Maas has created a great looking film. The film looks and feels like a 1980's horror movie should. I felt while watching this movie that Dick Maas must have been heavily influenced by Stanley Kubrick's The Shining but in interviews Dick Maas insists that the Lift is his take on Steven Spielberg's Jaws. Dick Maas has stated that he wanted the same feel in De Lift as the audience felt in Jaws with the elevator taking the place of the shark. Dick Maas uses similar techniques to Spielberg as humor and horror are both presented in this film. Dick Maas has a flair for some pretty funny sight gags that are littered throughout the film. There are several false jump scenes as various characters approach the elevator only to escape unharmed. The elevator like the shark in Jaws is sure to eventually get its prey and each time a victim escapes it only heightens the tension.While the main setting of this film is the fancy Icarus highrise office building the hero is a blue collar working man played to perfection by dutch actor Huub Stapel. This movie is full of great Dutch character actors. None of the characters in this movie seem like throw away parts. All of the characters have interesting little quirks and all seem to advance the plot and bring this story to life. Many of the actors had to take on double and sometimes triple duties to get this film made. The budget did not provide for any stunt men so every actor did his or her own stunts including the dangerous scenes in the elevator shaft. Additionally the nonactor crew was pressed into service as extras for many of the shots.Yes this is a movie about a killer elevator but why does the elevator kill? This movie treats its subject matter very serious to the point where this movie has the feel of a crime drama. There is much time spent following our blue collar hero elevator repair man around as he investigates what is causing this elevator to kill people. The investigation portion of the film includes visits to the factory interviews with computer technicians visits to a mental hospital to interview the last elevator repairman to work on the killer elevator and a crash course on biotechnology by an excited professor. Is the killer elevator part of some corporate conspiracy is there some alien slime that is making the elevator kill or has the microchip developed not only self awareness and free will but also an organic like ability to reproduce? The movie really does not ever provide a satisfactory explanation.I watched the whole movie in Dutch with English subtitles. I tried rewatching it in English but the voice actors that did the dubbing work were awful and gave an uninspired performance. The Dutch version with English subtitles is far superior. Director Dick Maas did a remake of De Lift in 2001 titled The ShaftDown starring Naomi Watts.".

A thriller rather than a horror film although it delivers a couple of the required shocks the occasionally vivid use of colour is also worth mentioning.".

Anybody interested in AI robotics and cybernetics will have a difficult time suspending disbelief as Selleck is forced to fight off a few battalions of homicidal gadgets under the influence of a mod chip programmed to identify specific human targets with all of the cyberevil ultimately under the control none other than Kiss lead singer Gene Simmons. If this sounds ridiculous please understand that this film is not above a little selfdeprecating geek humor  for example after the first action sequence where Selleck has chased down a runaway farm implement he refers to the CPU of the unit as an old 8088. OK if you got this joke you might appreciate the rest of the film's comic relief. If not you should enjoy it for its solidly entertaining suspense. The soundtrack Jerry Goldsmith often hurts but has a few good moments. Some of Gary Numan's darker and weirder stuff from around the time this film was released might have been a better choice or perhaps even Jean Michel Jarre. Tom Selleck does well in his physically and emotionally demanding role playing a police officer with vertigo who is assigned to disable runaway robots. To his credit none of Crichton's robots are the standard ludicrous anthropomorphisms we see in schlockfests like I Robot and The Clown Wars but rather mechanical hardware things as innocuous as boxy agricultural drones which pick bugs from cornstalks and turn them into fertilizer and housekeeping automatons which look only slightly more advanced than today's robotic vacuums. Cynthia Rhodes steals this show. Her performance is so spoton that I was compelled to look her up here immediately after seeing this movie for the second time. See for yourself httpwww.imdb.comnamenm0722407 I am astonished and intrigued by her extremely low profile. Please email me if you have an explanation for this!Gene Simmons is about what you would expect he delivers his lines with little tangible feeling overacts frequently and does well with looking weird and menacing but has little sense of pace or complex facial expression. Kirstie Allie gives a fairly standard performance and Chris Mulkey not unusually puts in a very nice effort for his relatively minor role. The rest of the cast is quite good. I'm not a big fan of more recent Crichton films but I really enjoy his earlier works especially Andromeda Strain and this film. I remembered seeing this about twenty years ago and being pleasantly surprised. My second viewing just an hour ago was just as entertaining. Sure the soundtrack hairstyles and some of the dialog are outdated but the themes characters and even the plot are not.".

As bad guy Luther he does pretty well but there's nothing particularly remarkable about his performance.The other performances are okay.  Tom Selleck and Kirstie Alley are rather good in their roles.  POLICE ACADEMY's G.W. Bailey has a straight role as the Chief of Police the typical bythebook type who always chews the hero out.  The storyline is very good.  As it's written by Michael Crichton it's another tale of technology gone bad although this time it was a deliberate human act which caused the mayhem.  The film book I read about RUNAWAY in said basically that between WESTWORLD and JURASSIC PARK two of the best known scifi films ever Crichton made this film.  This is true but while WW and JP are remebered this film is largely forgotten. Granted this film is hardly a classic but in my opinion there are times when you go 'who cares' and just sit down to a good entertaining picture. I recommend RUNAWAY for a viewing.  Although this movie and some episodes of STARGATE SG1 seem to confirm that some people find tackylooking mechanical spiders scary.  Which I don't.".

Tom Selleck cruises along with a heavily clichd hero character dead wife vulnerable child fear of heights wobbling plastic assistant called Lois however his somewhat boring character is evened out nicely by Gene Simmons who sends the hamometer to dangerous levels with his terrifically OTT performance and dialogue along the lines of MUHAHAHAHA!!!. As with most films of this ilk by today's standards it's heavily dated but then again it's a reminder of a time when action films focused on action and didn't take themselves to seriously.Runaway is an unremarkable but reasonably solid action film. It moves at a speedy pace albeit along the well oiled lines of about nine million other similar films there's little to fault if you're only looking for light techoaction fare.Hardly something anyone should seek out unless of course you want to see Gene Simmons waving a ridiculously huge gun around and trying to outstare the rest of the cast but not something that should be avoided at all costs either if it's on TV and you don't have anything better to do.".

If you're like me you'd say that you wanted to see it as soon as possible and stream it on Netflix. Well that might be either the best decision you've ever made or your worst nightmare. Also if you're like me you heard about this film from the TV show Community which is incredibly awesome. Indeed there's much to love about Selleck and a younger Simmons and a fleet of robots programmed to destroy. Even Kirstie Alley who has a generally repulsive nature is presented as a sex symbol here with mixed results. While I have great difficulty finding her attractive the Selleck character becomes torn between her and his female partner. It's not quite a love triangle but when you're Selleck you can have any woman you want.Yet the film drags at times and the climax seems to go on a bit longer than necessary. As much as I love Selleck and the concept of this film I can't say it ranks up there with Gypsy Warrior or Quigley Down Under. I just didn't feel it. I should not have been bored at any time but I was... if it wasn't for beer in this case Coors Light it may have been a difficult film to sit through. Not good enough to enjoy or bad enough to rip on... just sort of bland.".

	schema:reviewBody "When an evil genius begins manufacturing and testing chips designed to create killer robots a special police squad must try to stop him.In a nutshell Runaway is a banal clichd thriller with a very halfhearted attempt to pass itself off as a scifi film. It has a few flashes of competence but overall it creates little suspense and has little of visual interest.I don't know what the budget of this film was but it couldn't have been much. By some accounts Runaway is set in the future. The only sure way to know this is from the tagline of the film It is the future. Obviously they knew we'd be confused. The problem is that it looks like every other generic crimedrama from 1984 except that stars Tom Selleck and Cynthia Rhodes are on the runaway robot squad. This means that their job consists primarily of apprehending rogue automated devices such as an agricultural robot that's cutting the wrong path through its owner's crops. Why this is a job for the police in Runaway's universe and why the farmers couldn't arrest the machine instead since it's relatively slow moving and nondangerous is difficult to say. But it's a bit like the police coming to take away your iron after it scalds a shirt.To make it even tackier the robots in the film mostly look like everyday appliances circa 1984overhead projectors and those old 14baud modems on wheels or toasters with erector set legs. I can only imagine that 80 of the budget must have went to pay Gene Simmons' salary as surely he wouldn't do a film at a discount.Gene is pretty good as are the other actors but he's not given very intriguing things to do or say. Director and writer Michael Crichton mostly has him stand around brooding giving his best Kisshoned crabby demon look which was often used in photographs when he wasn't sticking out his tongue or snarling. Selleck's role is fairly bland but maybe he plays bland well because I liked him here and Rhodes seems mostly grafted on because they realized they needed a hot chick in the film and Kirstie Alley couldn't show up until further into the plot. Although there are a couple moments of excitementone that particularly stands out is Selleck's bullet removal scene Crichton's script is by the numbers. It could have easily been an average cop television show script or cut and pasted from 10 already extant cop show scripts Frankenstein style. Crichton just adds some technological gobbledygook for spiceto make the film more futuristic I guess.Surprisingly then there are a few admirable directorial moves on Crichton's part. The high tech bullet pointofview shots are really cool. Also the chase scene when the modem robots are pursuing cars is pretty intense. And the climax is very well done at least up until the very last moments. So all of those aspects helped Runaway not receive an F.But as much as I love Gene Simmons and wanted to like the film on this viewing I do remember liking it a bit more on its theatrical release but that was 20 years ago I just can't recommend it. I ended up having to give it a 6 equivalent to a D. You know it's bad news when a film is blas enough for me to start doing housework while watching it and that's just what happened while Runaway was on. See it only for curiosity value if you're a big fan of members of the cast or crew.".

Out of the three movies we got this one was the best not only was I surprised but he loved the movie. After all there years it still has that futurist appeal to it and to a point it makes you think. The movie came out in 1984 and it's about robots that have been altered to become dangerous and in some ways killers. In the beginning of the film you see Tom Selleck and his new partner Karen. They are apart of the police departments Runaway unit. A unit that gets calls about malfunctioning robots and they are the ones that go in to take care of the situation. One day a call comes in a 713 or something like that a runaway call where people have been killed. Once on the scene Ramsey Selleck and Karen Cynthia Rhodes get the info that robot that helps with the house a lot has killed 2 members of the family. The baby has not been harmed but the father on the scene knows more about what is going on than he is telling. Well Ramsey gets the baby out of harms way but the father disappears suddenly.

	schema:reviewBody "In the future robotics has become an important part of society fulfilling roles once operated by humans. Housekeeping robots agricultural robots etc. Well robotics has become such an important aspect in life that a special crimes division is specially directed at robot crimes..such as malfunctions amongst the most serious threat. Tom Selleck portrays Sgt Jack Ramsey once a beat cop who decided to step away from that role when his problem with vertigo leads to a killer getting away and killing a family not long after. He began studying the field of robotics as he explains to his new female partner Karen ThompsonCynthia Rhodes and found that he above every one else in the understanding of such a field. Thompson gets an idea of the rather mundane part of the role when a agricultural robot goes berserk messing up a crop. But she also sees the ugly side as Ramsey has to upend a robot which has killed members of David Johnson'sChris Mulkeyfamily. This sequence is stellar and we see how good Ramsey is at disarming difficult situations. It also shows how those who try to get in without understanding Ramsey's methodsa television cameraman who makes a bad decision to follow Ramseywill perish. Once Ramsey looks inside the robot it is found that a smart chip was planted to force the robot to turn maniacal. That man is Dr. Charles LutherGene Simmons who is very good as a sadistic vile human being who pierces you with his bulging obsessed eyeswho wishes to sell his technology of creating killing robots designed to be terrorist toys. He had maneuvered Johnson and another doctorwho we see killed by a robotic spiderto create these smart chips with the capability to force robots to coordinate and destroy selected targets. Luther has this unique gun he uses which fires a heat seeking missile. It is used to kill Johnson when Ramsey and Karen try to apprehend him. Luther's lover JackieKirstie Alleyis caught in a room with specific computer parts needed to put together the whole terrorsell operation. Jackie is caught unfortunately by a robot which has flipped it's lid. The robot isn't deadly and can only shoot electric bolts which knock you down or annoyingly shock you. After Ramsey is able to successfullythough not without a few bolts which threw him for a loopstop the renegade robot he finds lots of computer property in Jackie's possession. They are successfully able to get information on where Luther isin a meeting with some clientle but Ramsey isn't able to get him for he has that gun hidden in his coat and a floater robot which blows smoke throughout the room.

In a harrowing sequence Ramsey must remove it without hardly any movement..Karen will have to undergo serious agony without moving her arm. The rest of the film consists of Luther and Ramsey playing catandmouse as Jackie's life is now in danger after revealing her information. Not only that but Luther is also able to find and kidnap Ramsey's sonyes the old kidnapping cop's son bit. The film shows Luther's cunning with computers and how he has eyes open at all times. The film's true tension derives from that very fact. I've read countless reviews for this film and none provides any enthusiasm towards Runaway. I don't see what the real problem is. I thought it was well paced with some interesting little robotic creations the cast seems game..it's perfect for a lazy Summer afternoon.".

	onyx:emotionText "In the future robotics has become an important part of society fulfilling roles once operated by humans. Housekeeping robots agricultural robots etc. Well robotics has become such an important aspect in life that a special crimes division is specially directed at robot crimes..such as malfunctions amongst the most serious threat. Tom Selleck portrays Sgt Jack Ramsey once a beat cop who decided to step away from that role when his problem with vertigo leads to a killer getting away and killing a family not long after. He began studying the field of robotics as he explains to his new female partner Karen ThompsonCynthia Rhodes and found that he above every one else in the understanding of such a field. Thompson gets an idea of the rather mundane part of the role when a agricultural robot goes berserk messing up a crop. But she also sees the ugly side as Ramsey has to upend a robot which has killed members of David Johnson'sChris Mulkeyfamily. This sequence is stellar and we see how good Ramsey is at disarming difficult situations. It also shows how those who try to get in without understanding Ramsey's methodsa television cameraman who makes a bad decision to follow Ramseywill perish. Once Ramsey looks inside the robot it is found that a smart chip was planted to force the robot to turn maniacal. That man is Dr. Charles LutherGene Simmons who is very good as a sadistic vile human being who pierces you with his bulging obsessed eyeswho wishes to sell his technology of creating killing robots designed to be terrorist toys. He had maneuvered Johnson and another doctorwho we see killed by a robotic spiderto create these smart chips with the capability to force robots to coordinate and destroy selected targets. Luther has this unique gun he uses which fires a heat seeking missile. It is used to kill Johnson when Ramsey and Karen try to apprehend him. Luther's lover JackieKirstie Alleyis caught in a room with specific computer parts needed to put together the whole terrorsell operation. Jackie is caught unfortunately by a robot which has flipped it's lid. The robot isn't deadly and can only shoot electric bolts which knock you down or annoyingly shock you. After Ramsey is able to successfullythough not without a few bolts which threw him for a loopstop the renegade robot he finds lots of computer property in Jackie's possession. They are successfully able to get information on where Luther isin a meeting with some clientle but Ramsey isn't able to get him for he has that gun hidden in his coat and a floater robot which blows smoke throughout the room. This time Karen is hit by a missile dislodged in her arm intact. In a harrowing sequence Ramsey must remove it without hardly any movement..Karen will have to undergo serious agony without moving her arm. The rest of the film consists of Luther and Ramsey playing catandmouse as Jackie's life is now in danger after revealing her information.

This is one of the most heartwrenching moving movies I have ever watched  and especially so for Malaysians.I do have some bones to pick with the film. I felt the editing was a bit choppy at times and the dubbing seemed rather poor. Once or twice parts of the story strained credulity for me.In spite of these things Talentime deserves a 10. It tells a good story well. It resists the temptation to overreach in terms of subject matter and it avoids the problematic blunt moralising which often characterises the approach to problems like race and love.When the group I watched Talentime with finally picked our jaws up off the floor we raved about the final scene. It's something which I think most people have seen before  a bittersweet almost preachy scene that's always mawkish and offputting. But Yasmin Ahmad somehow pulls it off  it's one of the most moving things I've ever seen on the silver screen.It's very sad that Yasmin Ahmad is no longer with us. Talentime was her masterpiece and it shows a maturity and polished refinement which her earlier works lacked. This should be mandatory viewing for any Malaysian.".

Scenes jump from one moment to another without a proper segue or anything to lead up to it. You're just suppose to accept that things just happen suddenly without rhyme or reason. The pacing is unbearably slow that you'd give up watching it 13 of the way simply out of boredom. So no if this is the pinnacle of Malaysian film making than I am glad that it is dying.

It's followed by various sequels Gendarme get married Gendarme in balade Gendarmes and the creatures of outer space and Gendarme and the Gendarmettes. If you like Funes' crazy acting you'll enjoy this one because he 's overacting with amount mimic gesticulation. The movie is a Funes recital it's a farce by the master comic to be liked for his fans.";

	schema:reviewBody "The Troops in New York is the second opus of the Gendarme series that started a year prior in St Tropez and that had catapulted Louis de Funs to the top of the box office a place he'd never be dethroned from till his death in 1983. Indeed even his lesser movies would garner at least twomillion viewers. He's still in terms of theater's grosses the most successful French actor of all time and 1965 was another defining year of his profitability proving that 1964 was no lucky strike.He starred in three of the most successful movies including two sequels The Sucker with Bourvil the sequel of the first Fantomas and then he wore the gendarme uniform playing his fromnowon forever iconic Marchal des Logis Ludovic Cruchot in The Troops in New York. Of course in terms of viewers and grosses these films were successful but success is all relative a notion and De Funs' success while consistent on the commercial level had its share of ups and downs as far as the critical reception went. The Sucker was a commercial and critical success and there's a reason why it attracted twice more viewers than The Troops in New York. Louis de Funs is one of the best comedic actors of all time and the best of his generation there is just one point where you can't take too much of his antics. The Sucker was based on the pairing between De Funs and Bourvil the sneaky bourgeois sympathetic villain with an Aesopian arc and the lovable loser who proves to be not such an idiot after all. The balance was there and it was fun to switch back and forth between these two schools of laughs culminating with the iconic laughalong ending. That was the stuff for cinematic memories. The Sucker wasn't consistently funny but at least it could afford a plot The Troops in New York took for granted the popularity of the previous film and built on it let's say it wasn't on the level of the Empire State Building not even the highest dune in St Tropez.Sure there are many moments to enjoy a nice rib steak recipe  la Galabru a few welldone overthetop reactions by De Funs and a hilarious do you speak English? delivered to an American woman and naturally the iconic My Taylor is rich that became a French popculture trope of basic English learning. The whole exchange about who's got the most beautiful flowers is another hilarious moment to count on. That scene is perhaps the highest spot of the movie but it occurs in the first ten minutes not that laughs never ensue during the film but talk about a missed opportunity when you have six funny Frenchmen in the most American of all the cities and all you can come up is some plot about a missing daughter and a climax in a construction site outside New York.You can't help but feel a bit cheated by the premise the film is like a can of soda you kept on shaking and shaking but no one ever opens it and by the time someone does you just have a little pschiiit. Another remarkable example is when looking for his daughter Cruchot meets the crazy driving nun in the middle of New York she's just here to participate to some nun congress which is an amusing gag given the reason of the troops' presence in America but she doesn't offer him a ride. Really? My guess is that they probably intended to make a car chase in New York but the big Apple isn't St Tropez budgetwise but still what a wasted opportunity very illustrative though as even the Troop has no more reason to be in New York than the nun since the main narrative was about Cruchot trying to find his daughter.Genevieve Grad as Nicole always illuminates the screen she's beautiful pretty witty and seems to be the only match to her patriarchal father but she's not funny and when you have four fine comedic actors like Christian Marin Jean Lefebre Guy Grosso and Michel Modo who'd become the voice of Mr. Burns and Seymour Skinner you just don't lock them in a lousy hotel or hospital room to inflict us a scene where Nicole is courted by an Italian Carabiniere or some catandmouse fatheranddaughter game in a film that could have been a rollercoaster of laughs. This is why Oury's movies worked better De Funs he never carried the movie alone always another comedian to share the screen Girault got six of them and could only use Galabru.With Galabru playing the straight man or let's say chewing less of the scenery the Troops series was promised to last and it did but its appeal is almost dependent on sentimental values while Oury's movies have aged better. They worked because Oury was a true admirer of De Funs and knew all the comedic talent of the world couldn't work without one element of straightness. Many Girault's movies would work better because they would star Claude Gensac as De Funs' wife or would feature a screenpartner. Of course the Troops series was a great blessing for De Funes it allowed him to create his archetypal character of the authoritarian figure odious with the underlings while kissing the butts of his superiors but even this shtick grows rapidly tiresome.New York underwent a severe drought in the middle of the 60's and so does this film the tailor might be rich the flowers beautiful but this is a beautiful film far from being rich in gags and laughs. I suspect if it wasn't for The Sucker maybe spectators might have grown tired of De Funs he couldn't just be typecast as Cruchot.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am bipolar. I have been that way since I was a young man. I am approaching 60. I have been in treatment for many years. There have been relapses and time spent in hospitals. There have been good times. Before I received good treated I left a trail of emotional professional and relational disaster behind me. It broke apart the lives of others as much as it did my own.I did not know what to expect from this movie. It is a stunningly accurate trip into the mind of a BP sufferer. It shows the disease from the outside too. It is amazing in its accuracy. The mood swings the detachment from reality the failure to learn from past errors are there. Here is a guy who has so messed up he is in the hospital. He is released into the custody of his parents. He improves himself physically yet cannot see what he has done what he is now and what the future portends with any sort of reality.There are other situations in the film which mirror the BP life. There are job losses broken relationships unlimited optimism anger and a feeling that no one understands you. But he doesn't even understand himself. He thinks he is the only sane person around. He is in complete denial yet goes along with treatment just to get along with others.The obsession with his estranged wife drives him. Everything he does is to make himself look desirable to her.Then there is the hair trigger and the propensity toward violence which ultimately put him into the hospital. He has the belief that he sees with much more clarity than anyone else. There is also the hatred of medications and the belief that he doesn't need them.Yet there is hope. There is no miraculous cure. There is a negotiated peace between his illness and the way he must be to survive in the world.The only thing I felt was missing was the crushing depression. But I understand that. Depression makes for lousy movies. The film is strictly about a manic life that wants to be better but cannot accept that he is badly off dead center normal.If you are bipolar and under control see this film! If you live with or deal with a BP see this movie. If you are untreated you won't get it because BP clouds the mind.My new wife and I went to see it. Up front I told her that I had this mental illness. She still married me. She is a health care worker with an understanding of illness and of treatment. After the film she asked me what I thought.I told her that I was a bit frightened to tell her that the portrayal is spot on and that I had seen all of it before.But like all bipolar sufferers I wanted her to know that I was never that bad. The truth is I was....but we BP people don't handle reality all that well.".

The film is exactly what you would expect from a screwball romantic comedy steeped in drama based on bipolar disorder depression OCD Philadelphia Eagles fanatics a ballroom dancing contest adultery Hemingway and a lead character who jogs while wearing a trash bag. Maybe not exactly what you would expect but more likely much more.If you were told instead that the story is based on two damaged souls who help heal each other through dancing you would have every reason to skip this one. However as written and directed by David O Russell The Fighter and based on Matthew Quick's novel this story is a frenetic emotional roller coaster ride that provides a glimmer of hope for the two damaged lead characters while reminding that each of us may be a bit offcenter in some way. Now add in the best young actress working today Jennifer Lawrence just turned 22 a rare performance from Robert DeNiro where he seems fully engaged a pulling back the curtain on Bradley Cooper as much more than a pretty face and one of the best and most precise soundtracks in recent history ... now you have one of the best films of the year.What you notice very early on is that what could be considered a trite story line is instead pounding you with sharp witty dialogue that pulls no punches in directness. The many aspects of family and emotional support are given time thanks to Pat Bradley Cooper being released after 8 months in a mental institution. He was sent there when he snapped after finding his wife in a compromising position with another man. Perfectly understandable if you ask me but clearly he is the explosive one despite his claims to the contrary. An uncomfortable dinner party introduces him to Tiffany Ms. Lawrence whose husband has recently died and her coping skills have been shared with most of those in her workplace. This odd couple spark immediately and the wild ride begins.Pat's wife Nikki Brea Bee has issued a restraining order and Pat's strategy to win her back involves a positive attitude and maintaining control of his emotions. His supporters include his mother Jacki Weaver who was so great in Animal Kingdom his OCD father DeNiro who so wants to reconnect with his son his friend John Ortiz whose own marriage to icy Julia Stiles is a messy mess his buddy from the asylum a funny and not over the top Chris Tucker and of course Tiffany. The only real problem is that each of these supporters are teetering in their own way just like Pat.The brilliance of this movie is the balance struck between the near violent emotional outbursts and the sharp exacting words spouted by each of the characters. Director Russell once again shows his flair for working class northeasterners. He understands these tough as nails people who wear their emotions on their sleeves. These people are as likely to punch you as hug you ... and both are acts of love.The soundtrack deserves special mention. It is very unique and varied with each song serving an exact purpose. Especially keen are Stevie Wonder's My Cherie Amour Led Zeppelin's What is and What Should Be and The Girl from the North Country a Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash duet. When the music strikes a harmony with the scene the movie is all the stronger. Rarely do we get the perfect storm of script direction acting music and relevance.".

	schema:headline " Silver Linings Playbook is a refreshing addition to the rom com genre";
	schema:reviewBody "While most romantic comedies usually contain bad acting sappiness and a large amount of predictable moments Silver Linings Playbook is the exact opposite. There may be a little amount sappiness in this movie but there is bound to be some in any romantic situations. In reality though all of the sap in Silver Linings Playbook can be overlooked due to the fact that the film is completely original extremely funny and contains outstanding acting from the two lead roles.Written and directed by David O. Russell The Fighter Silver Linings Playbook is about a man played by Bradley Cooper Limitless The Hangover who was just released from an eight month stint in a psychiatric hospital. He wants to get his life back on track but is being held back by his parents and his unstable condition. After a little while he strikes up an interesting friendship with a female played by Jennifer Lawrence Winter's Bone The Hunger Games. Both of these characters are going through somewhat of the same type of problems which makes their friendship even more quirky and thoughtprovoking.Because a large amount of romantic comedies are stale and overdone Silver Linings Playbook is a breath of fresh air. Usually movies in this genre follow a very particular road map that entails man is at rock bottom but then finds the perfect girl. After a while man loses girl and must win girl back in a very clich and unrealistic fashion. What's original about Silver Linings Playbook is that it doesn't follow that mediocre story line in the slightest making it unpredictable but at the same time more relateable. Chris Tucker is in this movie and even he isn't predictable. Chris Tucker the loudmouthed actor who hasn't been in a film without the words 'Rush Hour' in the title for almost 15 years was surprisingly mellow. Even though he was mellow he was still very comedic and played a great role in the film.The most surprising aspect of Silver Linings Playbook however was the performance of Bradley Cooper. Even though this is a comedy Cooper plays what is maybe one of the most serious roles he's ever performed. After audience members witness his work in this film there shouldn't be any more doubt if the man can act or not. Silver Linings Playbook is without a doubt Cooper's best work thus far in his career. Jennifer Lawrence has a performance of equal caliber but that is expected from the young Academy Award nominated actress. What was surprising about Lawrence's role in the movie was how adult it was. Fans of Lawrence's work may have been worried that she would be stuck in teenage roles after playing the character Katniss Everdeen in The Hunger Games but she should silence those doubts after this film with a very adult yet professional performance.Silver Linings Playbook is full of creativity and minimal on romance clichs. It is hands down one of the best romantic comedies to be made within the last couple of years. This film contains many laugh out loud moments and a number of scenes that will warm your heart to the point where you can't help but leave the theater smiling. Silver Linings Playbook is the perfect date movie that both men and women can easily enjoy. A".

	schema:reviewBody "I don't even know where to begin when it comes to this film. First of all I think it's about time I profess my love for David O'Russell because he keeps making movies that I simply can't get enough of. If there's one thing I've learned this year when it comes to movies it's find a director you love and follow him or her blindly. There's styles you'll love and styles you'll hate find the ones you click with and never let go.Silver Linings Playbook has generated a lot of hype since its worldwide premiere at TIFF and frankly as far as I'm concerned it deserves all the praise its received. It is by far the best film I saw at the festival and is easily one of the most memorable films of 2012. Based on the novel by Matthew Quick Silver Linings follows the life of Pat Bradley Cooper as he moves back into his parents' house after spending months in a mental institution because of a violent outburst that occurred after he found his wife with another man. The movie follows Pat as he attempts to get back his life back but he meets a new challenge as Tiffany Jennifer Lawrence who is completely girl crush worthy finds his way into his life.I honestly can't remember the last time I enjoyed a movie more from beginning to end. O'Russell brilliantly tells a heartwarming yet complicated and hilarious tale that leaves you on the edge of the seat. The cast is wonderful and all deserving of nominations in the 2012 award season. If people didn't know of Jennifer Lawrence before they will now. She's quirky complicated hilarious and you really just can't get enough of her. DeNiro also delivers a strong performance as Cooper's Philadelphia Eagle's loving somewhat OCD father.If there is one movie worth seeing this year it's Silver Linings Playbook. The story may follow a family in a very serious situation but we can all identity with the truth and emotions that comes with struggling through times. It's a story that's easy to connect with and it's a film that will make you smile from beginning to end. Catch this movie when it comes out in November and I promise you you won't regret it.For more Reviews Check out.".

The story sends such wonderful messages about finding the silver lining and is uplifting even in the seemingly most dire circumstances. Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper are phenomenal and I found myself really attached to their characters. This is a must see for everyone!

	schema:reviewBody "After a great beginning describing pretty realistically the condition of a person with a mental disorder in this case bipolar the movie fails completely in the last 30 minutes where the main character suddenly gets over his obsessions and finds true love his family wins a lot of money and his friends manage to solve their emotional and mental problems in order to celebrate the happyeverafter couple.Personally I felt downright cheated and insulted by the cheesy ending. But the worst part is that many viewers will really believe that it is that simple to overcome a serious psychological illness not only bipolar but also like anxiety depression burnout OCD etc and hence the movie is actually doing a disservice to anyone in this condition.In order to arrive at the happy ending described in the movie which of course I wish to anyone going through such an ordeal a huge effort courage support treatment discipline and time is needed in real life and I am sorry to say it does not happen by taking a bit of dancing lessons and reading a letter. Conclusion good start after which they throw a bucket of pink confetti over the two broken now mended main characters to make the audience feel good.".

	schema:reviewBody "I wanted to like this movie I really did. I had read about the plot and its depiction of mental health issues and I was hoping to see a wonderfully nuanced movie with people fighting to get well. Instead this movie was clichd and clumsy. It was a movie without direction it had no playbook.I'm going to assume that the book has more depth than the director cared to give the characters and that this is just a really poor adaptation to film. The characters are so incredibly flat and one dimensional and not at all a good representation of people with mental health issues. In fact I think some damage was done here as not all depressed people get manic and destroy things at the drop of a hat or run out and sleep with a bunch of people. They're not all at odds with their doctors. There were just so many bad generalizations in this movie about the mentally ill I can't even list them all. The entire premise makes no sense. Why would you even set two people up who are at those points in their lives? It would be reckless to set up a woman still binging on sex with a man who was obsessed with his wife. I could go on and on. The entire story just didn't work. At all.Aside from the script the film craft was one of the worst I've seen this year! I counted about 5 gaffs in the movie before it was even halfway through. These were not small gaffs but obvious things you'll notice and I'm not sure how the editor missed. In addition to that the movie just didn't flow well either. The running scenes looking staged and lifeless. He wears a trash bag to work up sweat...but never seems to sweat. He was supposed to be out of shape but is definitely not out of shape when they show flashbacks. So many gaffs.I'm guessing people were just voting this movie highly because of Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence are attractive together. Their performances are OK but the movie falls apart so thoroughly around them that it's unimaginable why anyone would enjoy this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "First of all I want to say I really wanted to like this movie. I know it's a romantic comedy and it's not my favorite thing to watch but it has its moments. The trailer of this movie made me really want to watch it a story about two depressed people whom meet up. As a person who has been depressed and suicidal for a large part my life this movie seemed like something that could bring up the frustration of being depressed and mentally ill. But was it? No not at all. It made it a silly and meaningless plot point and it dumbed down feeling mentally ill to a small thing that doesn't matter and everyone can get over it in easy if they just want to. The movie begins great the main character is being released from the mental institution. He wants nothing else than to get back together with his wife. He isn't sick he is functioning on a good level and hasn't realised that it is over. No one tries to have a sit down with him and tell him straight out that it's over. If they had done that this whole movie would have been done. They treat him like a five year old that no one wants to correct! And then there is the female main character she is weird in fun way so it makes people laugh but is it? No her character is stupid. No one talks like this in the real world! Who wrote this dialogue? It's horrible it's written by someone that have watched too many romantic movies and seriously believe just having a small thing in common makes them the best damn couple ever!The main character's sickness is like a funny joke. I wanted some emotions I could just think how much I hated him. He has one small breakdown and nothing else. 5 minutes is what sets up his whole character. If they hadn't said that in the beginning of the movie I would have never noticed. I would just think he was heart broken and wanted to get back together with his wife. No emotions at all! That is suppose to be the movie struggling with emotions and mental sickness! Not having a god damn dance contest and at the end he declares his love for the girl! It was obvious it would happen that was not the problem it's a romantic movie what did I expect? But they are not building up to it. Oh I have been obsessed with my wife this whole time but when I saw her I realised I didn't care about her I care about you that I haven't shown any emotions to before! Give me some emotions for god's sake who the wrote this piece of garbage!? And the stupid plot point of having a big ass bet that the whole family relied on being a big deal and they are trying to push it like it's a big risk and no one knows what is going to happen but we all know! This movie is so obvious with everything! I understand it's obvious it's a romantic comedy. But give me a great journey and story of howwhy they end up together! Give me some emotions between the choice of choosing between the wife and the new girl. It just happens in this movie it just does whit no explanation to whyhow he made the decision. The whole movie end with that if you get a girlfriend ALL of your troubles will go away and EVERYTHING will be perfect LIFE DOESN'T WORK LIKE THAT! This movie was made by people who has never had any emotional illness at all and that shows.The movie is either average or horrible. The acting is average nothing really bad and nothing good. The dialogue is horrible no person in real life would talk like this! The plot is interesting but the execution is horrible they butchered the plot no tension or struggle at all and it just flows in a bad way with a absolutely breath taking dumb ending. It had so much potential. The reason some romantic movies are good is because they the character needs to go through something emotional or make a hard decision in their lives. But nothing like that happens the plot points just happens. I am maybe repeating myself here a lot but it really REALLY bothers me. How could this movie get Oscars nominated? When movies like Cloud Atlas or the great Joss Whedon gets left out completely. My final thoughts are it could have been something great a movie to be seen as the great romantic movie of this decade but it failed so hard in the writing and directing it is just horrible to watch.".

Jennifer Lawrence is becoming one of my favorite ladies in Hollywood but she definitely was cast wrong for this part also. She is mean and unlikable and overacts the entire time. Just a lot of yelling and stomping around. 3. The entire movie they just bicker and huff and puff. They aren't cute until the very end and then the movie just ends. 4. There were so many football references and talking over one another that my ears started to hurt. The scenes would drag on with just arguing. 5. The plot was very bland so you aren't really rooting for anyone or excited about what is going to happen next. The script must have been a piece of cake to write because there really isn't anything groundbreaking here. There are hundreds of mental patient movies.".

I can't believe people clapped at the end morons. Other negative posts are right on editing poor story line with weak motivations but the killer for me was ZERO chemistry between Lawrence and Cooper. This movie never figured out what it wanted to be comedy quirky love story family healing story concern for the mentally or emotionally ill Benny and Joon? I think they never figured it out or planned well so they threw it all in. All the actors did a good enough job but the support really let the movie down. I connected with the movie on 3 scenes only the best being when the parlay deal is cut. Shame on Danny Elfman for the music Led Zeppelin's What Is and What Should Never Be for that scene? Really?

I can't believe people clapped at the end morons. Other negative posts are right on editing poor story line with weak motivations but the killer for me was ZERO chemistry between Lawrence and Cooper. This movie never figured out what it wanted to be comedy quirky love story family healing story concern for the mentally or emotionally ill Benny and Joon? I think they never figured it out or planned well so they threw it all in. All the actors did a good enough job but the support really let the movie down. I connected with the movie on 3 scenes only the best being when the parlay deal is cut. Shame on Danny Elfman for the music Led Zeppelin's What Is and What Should Never Be for that scene? Really?

	schema:reviewBody "How do I find a bookie like the idiot played by Robert De Niro who co stars in the surprise hit movie Silver Linings Playbook?Seriously he's got to be the dumbest bookmaker on the planet. Any real bookie who followed his habits would soon be at an intersection holding up a cardboard sign.Silver Linings Playbook is unquestionably the most overrated film of the year. How this twohour bore garnered a whopping eight Oscar nominations isn't so much a testament to this movie's excellence but rather what a terrible past year this has been for cinema.The Bradley Cooper character meets the Jennifer Lawrence character at a dinner party and the rest of the movie is pretty much the story of the interplay between the two leads. They spend most of the time fighting and insulting each other sometimes viciously. But none of this seems to matter. We all know what's going to happen just before the final credits roll.But predictability is the least of this mess of a movie's numerous problems. Perhaps the most disturbing aspect of the story is Cooper's obsession with reuniting with his estranged wife. Remember this man spent eight months locked up behind bars in a mental ward for committing a violent crime. Now he's free on probation and his sole mission in life to to get back with the ex.Trouble is his wife has issued a restraining order against Cooper. That means he's not allowed to visit or call or contact her in any way. Despite this Cooper ignores the law and goes to great lengths to go after what he wants. Sure. Nothing proves a man's true love like acting the part of a stalker.For some reason I found baffling many people seemed to find this endless pursuit to be an endearing quality  including women. There were plenty of laughs as Cooper tries to establish some sort of contact with his ex including visiting her place of employment. How charming! I guess being a wacko stalker is okay if you look like Bradley Cooper and were voted 2011's Sexist Man Alive.The movie takes place in South Philadelphia. Accordingly we're subjected to all the typical stereotypes you'd expect. The only thing missing was Burt Young as the uncle walking in the door with a sack of sausages.There are a few nice moments which were usually tied to the catchy soundtrack. And it's okay to dream and believe in fairly tales. But that doesn't mask the reality that relationships take work. They require sacrifice and commitment from both sides. Yet we're led to believe that once the boy gets the girl they'll leave happily ever after. Never mind that they've been screaming at each other for 90 minutes during the entire movie and haven't agreed on anything. They have virtually nothing in common. Neither has a job or it would seem much of a future. So what's going to happen the first time Mrs. Lawrence tells Mr. Cooper to take out the trash? Or leave the toilet seat down? Is Cooper going to go ballistic again like he did with his first wife?So let's get back to that idiot bookie. Remember  Robert De Niro plays the dad. He lost his job some time ago so he turned to bookmaking to support his family. Fair enough.Trouble is there's not one thing in this movie the least bit convincing he actually works as a bookmaker. On Sundays the phone never rings. He never has a notebook at his side. Where are all his customers? He never once discusses games or point spreads other than those involving his beloved Philadelphia Eagles when he's in action. In fact De Niro is so sickly obsessed with the Eagles he watches them religiously  completely oblivious to games one which his livelihood depends. One might think that a bookie based in Philadelphia might have a rooting interest in Eagles' games and if so  he's likely want the other side to win and cover since most amateur locals tend to bet on their favorite team. But there's De Niro the ultimate sap.That said the most laughable part of the movie comes near the end. I won't give away the final outcome. But De Niro essentially gambles his entire life savings on a single football game. Who does he bet on? You guessed it  the Philadelphia Eagles.A few scenes later De Niro is back at it again. This time he wants to bet a parlay. He learns that the line on the upcoming Philadelphia Dallas game is Eagles 1. De Niro wants to bet on his beloved Eagles so badly that he offers his business partner and fellow bookie a preposterous wager. He says I'll give you Dallas plus ten points! The Eagles must win by ten!On a game lined at 1?This clown is a bookie?How can I get in touch with this joker?To be fair I saw this movie in Las Vegas  where sports gambling in commonplace. But the De Niro segment of the movie was so absurd and annoying that I heard a few catcalls and even some uncontrolled laughter. Not good.It's a bad sign when the most memorable thing about a movie are its flaws. But alas those are pretty much the only parts of the film that kept me interested in what was an instantly forgettable and utterly disappointing film.Silver Linings Playbook has about as much entertainment value as a losing sports book ticket.".

YAWN. THIS is what is getting so much hype? I found Bradley Cooper to be magnetic and intense. Great work. I have enjoyed him since his small role in Wedding Crashers and thought he was just superb in Limitless. He is the best part of this movie. The guy is super talented! I really was not that impressed with the other performances despite the fact I thought I should be. To be fair no one stunk it up or ruined the movie. But I thought anyone could have played the other roles. I like Jennifer Lawrence but I didn't think she was that great in this. I thought the parents were played well but again I didn't think De Niro was that special in this. I'm not really sure I'd recommend this. I'd probably either wait for DVD or even cable. It's OK.".

Russel has outdone himself with this beautiful portrayal of a dysfunctional family searching for a way to come together. Bradley Cooper has won me finally with his odd and hilarious character. Jennifer Lawrence is dashing as ever with the hysterical role of Tiffany a depressed woman trying to find a way out of her issues. This whole film has powerhouse performances a laughoutloud script with heart and a way to get the audience attached to its likable characters. I definitely recommend this film to everyone and you are sure to see this as Osacr buzz.".

And that is probably the only thing I found realistic in this film.The rest is so filled with clichs. First of all the two lead characters are super good looking. What else do you expect? We cannot have average looking people afflicted with bipolar or depressive disorders can we?And while in the real world people who have been diagnosed with bipolar and have been committed to a mental institution have a hard time to keep friends the guy in this movie still has the support from everybodybut his exwife and her lover. Another astounding thing is that a lot of the main characters are out of work and seem to exist without problems. The answer may be that the father De Niro has turned bookie after losing his job. And I have to admit that I know so little about betting that the whole segment about the bet eluded me. I also have never been to a football stadium or watched a game I guess it was football and after seeing the scenes at the stadium I certainly never will. Now we get to the part where dancing becomes the therapy. While I completely agree that physical activity is very important in coping with mental challenges I seriously doubt that somebody without any dance experience can enter a competition again I am not familiar with these kind of competitions but after what they showed it was not a segment of So you think you can dance where anybody gets a go. The dance scenes reminded me of that unfortunately also Oscar nominated movie Black Swan where the camera only showed the dancer waving her arms because she obviously was not a trained ballet dancer and in this movie the dance scenes are so chopped that you get no idea what the girl wanted to achieve with her choreography. And then of course we have the typical Hollywood ending . Everybody is happy and boy gets girl and daddy wins his bet and gets his diner and they live happily ever after screaming at each other. Because as Dr. Phil always likes to point out  you can always judge a person by his past behavior. I have no idea why this movie got all the nominations but that is not the first time that I am clueless.".

In real life outsiders do not even want to be around a person who is bipolar. Perhaps medication would make people like our son manageable but as is often the case people with this disorder can't hold down a job and don't have a safety net to fall back on. Medication is unattainable and don't even think about a residential treatment program. I came out of this movie feeling very sad that our son whom we love very much can't have a chance at normalcy. The movie just wrapped up the situation in a pretty bow and the couple headed off to their happily ever after. The movie wasn't funny enough to be a comedy and wasn't deep or realistic enough to be a drama. It just put a glossy surface over a very real very challenging illness.".

	schema:headline " Science FictionAction Classic and the best Original Batman film from the 80's.";
	schema:reviewBody "The 1989 Batman is the original Dark Knight and Tim Burton's Classic Dark Knight film. This is my number 1 personal favorite Batman of all Batman movies this is my movie and I love this film to death! Jack Nicholson was wellcast as The Joker he was a wonderful in his lead role performance. Michael Keaton was just great as Bruce WayneBatman he acted like the role of Batman was written on his skin. Kim Bassinger did a wonderful performance as her role Vicki Vale. I think Vicky Vale is very underrated character from all other female lead characters in all Batman films. Michael Gough did a wonderful job as the butler Alfred Pennyworth Batman's helper. Seriously Alfred for me will be always Michael Gough not only that he acted much better than Michael Caine did he even showed more heart and caring in the whole Batman franchise than Michael Caine did. The acting in this film is awesome the character developments and the story plot are TERRIFIC! Michael Keaton caused an uproar when he was casted as Batman as fans boycotted the idea yet in Christmas 1988 when the trailer hit theaters the silence was shut as it was a nice teaser. This movie was the most hyped movie of 1989 as months audiences including fans had waited even with a second trailer that showed up in the spring of 1989 and merchandise was everywhere as it was the year of the Batman hell even TV stations had reruns of the 60's Batman show to cashin on the phenomenon. This movie opened on June 21st 1989 and became one of the highest grossing movies of all time and the biggest movie of the year earning acclaim and making Batman cool again just like Frank Miller and Alan Moore did. The Action and fights sequences were great and awesome. At least so much better than they were in Batman Begins 2005. It was my first Batman film I ever saw and this movie just absolutely Kick Ass. The Batwing that appears by the end of this movie is awesome by using to combat the Joker. When the Joker launches a deadly Smilex gas attack through balloons Batman came in the Batwing and destroyed the balloons angering Joker. Awesome! Batman then fired off several missiles and two mini guns killing many henchmen but missing Joker who in turn shot it down with one bullet from his long barreled revolver. The Joker Thugs are amazing. The main theme score by Danny Elfman was just amazing and really beautiful. I absolutely love this movie. I would never compare all other Nolan batman films with this masterpiece. Except The Dark Knight that it is the best Batman film. I will say it again this movie is AWESOME! The Batsuit designed by Costume designer Bob Ringwood who turned down the chance to work on Licence to Kill in favor of Batman was AWESOME! Ringwood found it difficult designing the Batsuit because the image of Batman in the comics is this huge big sixfootfour hunk with a dimpled chin. Gotham City a big city where crime has been occurring lately and a mysterious caped crusader named Batman Michael Keaton is wiping streets clean of criminals it leaves the police especially commissioner Gordon Pat Hingle baffled. A gangster named Jack Napier Jack Nicholson was dropped into a vat of chemicals which leaves him disfigures with paintlike white bleached skin and rubyred lips plus green hair which makes him clownlike as he now calls himself Joker he begins to terrorize the city of Gotham and stalk a sexy photographer named Vickie Vale Kim Bassinger. Bruce Wayne who is Gotham's richest man falls in love with Vickie yet she doesn't know his true secret that he's Batman but can Bruce deal with romance and battling with Joker at the same time?Batman is a 1989 American superhero film directed by Tim Burton and produced by Jon Peters based on the DC Comics character of the same name. It is the first installment of Warner Bros.' initial Batman film series. The film stars Jack Nicholson Michael Keaton in the title role Kim Basinger Robert Wuhl Pat Hingle Billy Dee Williams Michael Gough and Jack Palance.The Dark Knight of Gotham City begins his war on crime with his first major enemy being the clownishly homicidal Joker.This is definitely my favorite classic Action film from the 80's it was always my favorite childhood movie and it will always be. The action scenes are just fantastic and how Batman saves Gotham City from the Joker balloons of a deadly Smilex gas attack was amazing. Burton's Batman is my number 1 favorite film of all times and it will always be and I love it to death! 1010 Michael Keaton will be the only Batman for me!P.".

He pulled off every aspect of the role perfectly  he was better than Val Kilmer better than George Clooney better than everyone. He portrayed the mysterious charm of the winged crusader just as well as he captured the cool and collected character of Bruce Wayne. Michael Keaton is a huge part of the reason that this film was such a huge success the other main portion having come from the tremendous contribution from Jack Nicholson as the Joker. Gotham City is created in incredibly detailed comicbook style which adds to the overall quality of the movie.Director Tim Burton does an amazing job bringing this unreal world to reality and Kim Basinger is excellent as Vicky Vale the film's main female presence. The script is particularly brilliant. The role of the Joker seems to have been written specifically for Jack Nicholson which would not be surprising because of how well he pulled off the role with lines like Why didn't anyone tell me he had one of thosethings?!' and Remember me? When you dropped me into that vat of chemicals? That wasn't easy to get over and don't think that I didn't try.' And of course my favorite we'll be like Beauty and the Beast. Of course if anyone else ever calls you beast I'll rip their lungs out.' Everything from the setting in Gotham City to the characters costumes to the actual dialogue gives the unreal feeling of a comic book but the characters are developed enough so that we understand their problems and we care about what happens. The movie is a thrill ride from the beginning to the end and is enjoyable for all ages. If anyone is going to complain about who was chosen to play Batman there is much more room for complaint among the film's several sequels. Keaton did a spectacular job that no one has ever even come close to.".

Michael as Batman was perfect he had the look humor and mystery that is Batman. Playing Batman for him he became the role and I will always stand by that. For me he is the best Batman no one besides the original Adam West can touch his performance.Jack Nicholson is now the Joker. Who could ask for a better Joker? He has the look and dirty scary side to him that makes you fear but want to enjoy his presence on screen. He has such charisma and appeal his lines were perfectly delivered and every scene he stole. He and Michael were terrific together. They played off each other so well it makes you go crazy almost. The Dark Knight vs. The Joker the perfect super hero and villain. Jack stole my heart with his killer no pun intended performance.Kim Bassigner was also fantastic. She plays Vicki Vale the love interest of Bruce WayneBatman. She is a photo journalist who is looking for the true identity of Batman which leads to the question of if Batman can trust another being with his darkest secret? She was absolutely beautiful and charming. No other woman could've done a better job.Like I said Tim Burton he takes a different turn on this Batman but it's very appealing. Everyone loves this movie and I can't blame them. Batman is the best super hero of all comic book hero's in my opinion. You see Spiderman can fly with webs Super Man has super strength and can fly but Batman just needs himself. He kicks butt by himself.  The only thing you miss in the movie is Robin his faithful sidekick but I don't blame Tim for not adding him for this Batman. It wasn't needed. With a cool soundtrack by Prince and and awesome setting please watch Batman it's a true classic.1010".

Jack Nicholson has really great lines and hes really good as The Joker. A reason why this movie is such a great is cause of its music sequences. This is what we need we need music all the time in the movies. Other reason is its really entertaining with epic humors by The Joker. The story is great. Batman notices that Joker is the guy who killed his parents. Have you ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight is classic.

	schema:reviewBody "No radioactive spider bites or guys turning green or supermodels painted blue here. Campy television series aside Batman has always seemed the most serious the most grounded the most real of all the comic book sagas. Our hero has no magical mystical superpowers...he's just a guy in a suit. But where does he get those wonderful toys? In this film Tim Burton does a very good job of bringing the Dark Knight to life while also seemingly giving the dark foreboding city of Gotham a life of its own. Gotham is dark gloomy and dreary...almost oppressively so. The city is almost a character unto itself in the film...dark mysterious and somehow quite real. The brilliantly conceived stunning visuals are the perfect backdrop for the story which will unfold.The story follows our Caped Crusader in his quest to clean up Gotham which is in the midst of a frightening crime wave. There was much unnecessary angst when comic actor Michael Keaton landed the title role with fans feeling that was a sure sign the film would lean towards the campy style evident in the famous television series. Nothing could have been further from the truth. Batman would be a serious film well as serious as a comic book movie can be and Keaton was perfect in the Bruce WayneBatman role. Keaton's Wayne comes across as an ordinary guy doing extraordinary things. Keaton brings all the required seriousness to the role but also can add a little comic touch when necessary. Inspired casting pays off big time.Good as he is Keaton is actually overshadowed in the film. Who else but Jack Nicholson could cause the actor playing Batman to get second billing in a movie titled Batman? Nicholson's performance as the Joker is simply terrific. Maybe a little over the top at times but hey it's the Joker...he's supposed to be over the top. Nicholson livens up every scene he's in he simply owns the screen. With two terrific actors doing outstanding work bringing our hero and villain to life the film can hardly go wrong. It's certainly entertaining enough but the film as a whole doesn't quite match the brilliance of the two lead performances. The supporting cast led by Kim Basinger as the requisite love interest doesn't add much. Instead of leaving well enough alone with a fantastic Danny Elfman score the whole movie comes to a screeching halt a couple of times while we're forced to listen to some inane Prince songs. And the story just seems to lack a certain zest. We want to see the conflict between Batman and the Joker these two great characters played by two great actors. And for too much of the film that conflict simply isn't there. But all in all Batman is certainly a worthy effort. Some topnotch acting stunning visuals and a story that does just enough to draw you in and hold your attention throughout. To call this film great might be a stretch but one could say it is very very good. Certainly good enough to be worth your while.".

	schema:reviewBody "Released in 1989 Tim Burton's Batman holds up very well 22 years after its release and I actually prefer it over Christopher Nolan's reentry as interesting as his vision is. As for Joel Schumaker's stunning though at times silly vision of Batman I try to forget about those films. Burton's first Batman is pure escapism in a sort of old fashion way. No CGI to be seen here and it works better that way. It's no surprise to me that Burton's Batman has been compared to Citizen Kane 1941 or The Maltese Falcon 1941 Burton and production designer Anton Furst take you into a dark world filled with crime and also mystery. Other films at the time such as Blade Runner 1982 and Brazil 1985 had already experimented with the classic film noir style done in a sort of retrofuturistic way but Anton Furst's design for Gothem City truly feels like you are viewing a modern retelling of the classic noir films from the 40s.Sam Hamm's script is solid and while it has been the target for criticism I feel that he did a nice job his dialog is very witty at times and a little over the top but it's appropriate particularly with Jack Napiar The Joker. The performances are actually quite impressive and even better then what Chris Nolan got out of his actors but that's just an opinion. Micheal Keaton while controversial and unusual at the time gives a really good performance he is very shy and sensitive which is the Bruce Wayne that I respond to the most. Jack Nicholson really needs no analysis for his work here he is just perfect that putting into words is pointless. His joker is fun and even believable Jack is just as great of an actor as James Cagney in my mind. Kim Basinger is actually much better then she is given credit for her and Keaton work well together. The rest of the cast really are supporting characters some are familiar to the Batman story some are new. One of them being Alexander Knox. Robert Wahl plays a very likable guy who the other characters have a hard time taking seriously. His eagerness to find Batman and win his Pulitzer prize is well done and is a very down to earth performance which I guess is what the movie needed.As for Tim Burton's direction he handles the actors very well and as for the technical work I have mixed feelings about that. A lot of moments have really well choreographed camera work but there are a couple of zoom in shots that I felt were sloppy and a little unnecessary. There are a couple of matte painting shots that may not hold up as well today but none of this really matters it still works. Of course Danny Elfman's score left me speechless. He combines the fun the adventurous and the dark side of Batman into one piece. I recommend buying the soundtrack with Elfman's score on it it's amazing!! I think that Batman may be the best Hollywood movie of the late 80s and I still consider it a favorite from my childhood. I know that comic book purists prefer Nolan's Batman but as just a movie guy who loves old fashion Hollywood movies this one appeals more to my taste. Batman deserves its comparison with Citizen Kane or any other Hollywood masterpiece as far as I'm concerned even Casablanca 1942 or The Godfather 1972. Burton's 1992 sequel Batman Returns is equally as great and even takes the series into a direction that's more complex and provoking which Joel Shumaker ignored. While Christopher Nolan's Batman films have stolen the popularity of Burton's I would argue that his will go down in history as Hollywood classics.".

The film noir look is amazing and despite Batman's limited motion during fights it is still amazing. Jack Nicholson is an amazing Joker. He is the definitive live action Joker. It was unusual to modify the origin so that a prejoker killed Bruce's parents but it still works. Their have been many other Batman movies but nothing compares to this one.".

The film was a megahit. People were queueing up around the block for hours the literal meaning of a blockbuster. The marketing team at Warner had to saturate the minds of the public with the bigscreen coming of the Dark Knight. Up until this point the Batman series from the 1960s is how people regarded the Batman character and universe. Tim Burton corrected all that by giving us a dark sinister and Gothic world with rich production design and a great score by Danny Elfman who has made a career out of recycling the same old generic cues in nearly every movie he has scored. The original material is respected to a degree and the characters are deep instead of just campy.Michael Keaton is the best Bruce Wayne in my opinion. When he plays both Bruce Wayne and Batman you have to watch what he doesn't say and doesn't do. He's a rich sociophobic megalomaniac who has more money than sense. This is very different from Adam West's turtleneck playboy.Jack Nicholson is a great Joker too not quite as intimidating or as iconic as Heath Ledger's take on the character but still a role that has defined his career in a way. Nicholson's Joker isn't much more than an attentionseeking lunatic. But it's still nothing like Caesar Romero's campy hoppingskippingandjumping villain.Anton Furst's Oscarwinning design of Gotham City is very original and unique and is very much in the style of the Comic book. The smokeblackened cramped and claustrophobic 1920s buildings look and create a very oppressive atmosphere. This is definitely GOTHam City. Not LA like the TV series.They didn't even make any attempt with that show did they? In fact the Batcave in the TV series was like the set of a mad scientists lab from a 1950s movie. But the REAL Batcave in this movie is a monstrous cavern filled with stalagmites and it actually HAS bats in it. And there's no fireman's pole leading into it. With Christopher Nolan's reboot of the franchise currently the only Batman worth considering for most fans it'd be a shame if you were to let this go ignored. It may not be as mature as Nolan's work but it has an edge that no other recent comicbook movie has.It's NOT an origin story. There's no 60 precious minutes on a buildup it just goes straight to the action. Why can't more comicbook movies do this?".

All the character had for a well enough established origin was 'parents were murdered in a back alley' the graphic novel 'Year One' only hit shelves like one year before the films release. So its no wonder why the Joker almost steals the entire film. Having said that Michael Keaton does make an excellent Bruce WayneBatman depicting a man constantly in turmoil between identities. The plot line initially seems rather basic good vs evil. However after watching it time and time again it actually gets more intriguing. Particularly with how Joker rises to the top of Gotham's criminal empire to further his plot. If you want a Batman story thats still dark but more grittier then watch Nolan's interpretations. They're every bit as enjoyable as this and vice versa. But if you want to watch a Batman that's grim in a graphic novel way this is it.".

On the rooftop two muggers and The Dark Knight. The atmosphere? Misty dreadful unsafe and mysterious places that thrill you the mobsters seesaw between being colorful and being dark etc. However this is not a shallow or childish adaptation. Yes may be to compare Burton's Batman movies with Nolan's Batman movies are wrong but I want to say a few things. Nolan's Batman movies were fundamental reconstructions but they were very conventional on all counts. Tim Burton's Batman movies are not those movies are peculiar. By the way I am one of the people who say that the best Batman was Michael Keaton. Nolan is interested in ideas Burton is interested in details. If you have seen The Dark Knight remember TwoFace's screen time for example or Joker character was not highlighted. Tim Burton's characters are interpreted in great detail with their actions accessories my favorite is the dentures costumes the best Batman costume is here personalities etc. Plus the story telling as said for example the tone of the movie is very similar with the animation series or comic book Jack Nicholson deserves all the titles as Joker. A superhuman performance. I would not just say that Jack Nicholson is pretty good as Joker. The scenes he appears are riot of colors I love this. By the way Tim Burton shows us the personality of Joker by only one scene the goodbye talking when he visits Vicki Vale in her house. By the way in the final we hear a mysterious and sad sound and the commissioner's face when he finds out. That scene effected me when I watched it for the first time I was almost a child. After Nicholson to play Joker would be unthinkable but Heath Ledger did it that happens once in a blue moon. Watching this new Joker was very amusing interesting and Heath Ledger's acting was like Daniel Day Lewis style excellent but my favorite Joker is always Jack Nicholson. By the way I don't want to compare Nicholson with Ledger but want to say that Burton's Joker is much more active than Nolan's Joker. Burton's Joker does many crazy and very interesting things. He kills a mafia boss in a funny and also very sad way he reshapes hundreds of photos paints the restaurant this scene deserves being put in the cinema anthology Jack Nicholson's Joker is teaser acute minded so he leads Batman on a merry chase. Thus Batman Joker encounter does not become disappointing. You care about what will happen because you want Joker to be caught on the other side may be because of your sympathy for Nicholson or for his Joker character he has an accident he losses his magnetism so you cannot dislike him exactly you don't want him to be caught or dead. While I was watching the movie for the first time years years ago I pleased every time when Joker dodges Batman. May be it is because you know that if Joker is caught or killed the movie ends. Action scenes are may be less and mild but great so we get that Burton is good at making action scenes too. I love the restaurant scene the chase scene comes next and the scenes which Batplane arises are great too.".

And the film is largely based on Alan Moore and Brian Bolland's 1988 Batman masterpiece Batman The Killing Joke. This film really nails the spirit of the of the world of Batman.I am a huge Batman fan can't you tell?MM And the sets and direction and lighting all combine to make for a very convincing Gotham City. Some much work from so many talented people went into creating this world I am flabbergasted to think about it.The cast is almost perfect. Michael Keaton before this known best as a comedic actor plays the brooding Bruce Wayne excellently. And somehow manages to out do that as the caped crusader. I mean he managed to wear a silly rubber suit and come off as one terrifying badass. And Jack Nicholson proves what a talented actor he is with his dark and disturbing portrayal as The Clown Prince Of Crime AKA The Joker Batman's greatest foe. Even the supporting cast is good. Kim Basinger as the classic 1940's Batman love interest Vicki Vale. And in a surprising choice we have Mr. Lando Calrissian himself as Harvey Dent the once and future villain TwoFace. And that is only scratching the surface of the cast.The score courtesy of Danny Elfman fit's the film very well. In my humble opinion it is one of his best. The music of Prince is interesting if a little strange. Overall Batman has to be one of my favorite superhero films. Even now after so many more be unleashed upon the world.

One scene I like is when one of the crooks was being held up by Batman said Who are you? and Batman says I'm Batman. I do have to agree that it is a serious comic book movie very faithful to the original comic books.I also consider this movie to be the first official Batman movie because it was not only the first released by Warner Bros. but the first based off the source material although there was a Batman movie back in 1966 that was actually based off the TV series of the 1960s.It's also a little bit of a shame Tim Burton is now doing a take on my favourite children's book Alice in Wonderland because Disney will be releasing it and I like their 1951 animated cartoon version although the movie did screw up the book.I thought some of the action scenes were great like Batman getting chased by the Joker's goons and Batman fighting against the Joker. For any fan of Batman this is an essential movie to watch. As a fan myself I rate it 10 out of 10. I'll be watching the sequel Batman Returns also directed by Tim Burton and starring Michael Keaton as Batman and I'll comment on that.".

Michael Keaton besides Adam West is the real Batman to me his Bruce Wayne character was excellent and he played the Dark Knight beautifully. Kim Basinger and Robert Wuhl played great supporters as Vicki Vale and Alexander Knox the two reporters that are just dying to find out about the winged crusader. Tim Burton did an excellent job in portraying a dark gloomy Gotham City and he made the characters come to life and almost jump off the screen at you great stuff by a great director. Burton has always had that Gothic approach in most of his movies and it fits beautifully here. I couldn't ask for any better of an action flick with a superstar cast than this. I would recommend this film to anyone who appreciates the Batman legacy and is always open to view the different interpretations that filmmakers and the like have had of the Dark Knight over the years. Great Stuff. 10 out of 10 stars no doubt!".

Elsewhere crime boss Grissom's right hand man Jack Napier is trapped in a chemical factory by police.  With Batman's intervention Napier is accidentally dropped into a vat of chemical.  Considered dead he later turns up scarred and twisted with a new sense of humour.  Calling himself the Joker he takes over the city's gangs and begins to terrorise the city. Millionaire Bruce Wayne begins  relationship with reporter Vicky Vale and finds himself personally drawn into conflict with the Joker as both himself and his alterego.This was very much a huge blockbuster and had a great deal riding on it in terms of merchandising and a possible franchise.  As such Burton always seemed like a risk  although his dark toned work and complex characters probably made him a great choice.  The film starts promisingly many questions are asked  is Wayne totally balanced?  What drives him to become the bat? etc  and the tone of the movie is darker than a friendly blockbuster.  This is continued by the investigation by reporters Vale and Knox but starts to wane pardon the pun with the development of Vale as a love interest and the hamming of The Joker.  At some point the film loses the character complexities and decides to become a straight up good v's evil with plenty of effects and gadgets.  That said it's still very dark and the set pieces are well handled.  In fact it's the best of the Batman franchise so far.The problem is that it lacks a bite for Batman fans.  I've always felt that Batman was always a few steps away from the criminals he's chasing surely he can't be totally balanced and right in the head?  Here these questions are half touched but never developed.Keaton is an unlikely Batman but is the best so far.  He deals well with Wayne's past when it is brought up but is an unlikely action hero. Nicholson is pure ham but is good for it.  He hogs all the best lines and is clearly enjoying himself  the only downside being that he regularly eclipses Keaton's Batman.  Basinger's Vale is built up far too much and should have been cut out of the story rather than become a key part of it. The rest of the cast are good and I always like to see Tracey Walters in a big screen film!Overall this is a good stab at the Batman legend.  It's dark tone gives it the feel of the comics without the characterisation but at the end of the day it comes down to good guy v's bad guy.".

	schema:headline " The Greatest SuperheroComic Book Film Of All Time And An Absolute Classic. Tim Burton At His Best.";
	schema:reviewBody "Tim Burton's Batman isin my opinionis the greatest superhero and comic book film ever made and is one of the films that set the standard for comic book adaptations. Filled with Amazing ActionExcellent performancesgreat direction and a brilliant scoreBatman is one of my favorite movies of all timea true classic and is Tim Burton at his best.Set in the fictional town of Gotham CityBatman tells the story of Bruce WayneMichael Keatonwho is a Billionaire by daybutat night he is Batmana masked avenger who stalks criminals and bad guys in the night gives them his own brand of justice. NowBatman must face off against his biggest challenge yeta psychotic criminal in clown makeup named The JokerJack Nicholsonwho is terrorizing the city of Gotham. NowBatman has to stop The Joker and save Gotham at any costs.Batman is a film that I have loved since I was kid and instantly made me a Batman fanit was the first superhero and comic book film I saw and no other comic book or superhero filmalthough they're been plenty great and good ones since Batman's releasehave had an impact on me the way Batman has. One of the reasons Batman is the greatest superhero film ever made and a classic is the way the filmmakers approach the material. Where many superhero films these days have origin stories and start at the beginningBatman starts in the middle where we see Batman already beating up and stalking criminals at night and putting not only the criminalsbut the police on edge. We don't see how Bruce Wayne became Batmanhow he trainsgets the costumes or his useful weapons. It's bold move for this film not having an origin story from the beginning and starting in the middle. What I also love about this movie is the darkGothic style of Gotham City and timeless feel. Gotham City in this film is a darkcynical place that's very much in the FilmNoir styledirty streetsdark shadowssmokefog and harsh lighting during the night and the film also depicts Gotham City as a town where criminals roam and rule the streets. Batman was a film that brought a darkbrooding style to the superhero genre that has been imitated ever since this film was released. Where would Christopher Nolan's excellent Dark Knight Trilogy be without Tim Burton's film. The film at times has almost a timeless feel to it where you're not sure if the film takes place in the 80s40s50s or the 30s. It's great production design by Anton Furst adds to the film's timeless feel mixing the pastpresent and the future and that's one of the things I think set Batman from other superhero films. Batman and The Joker is one of the greatest rivalries in comic booksfilm and television and this film adds to the rivalry of this hero and villain. In the filmBatman and The Joker are at odds over the city of Gotham because Batman wants to save the city and the peoplewhile The Joker wants to destroy the city and it's people and the battle and banter between the two characters is excellent and memorable. The Action and fight scenes are brilliant and welldone and fits with the filmbecause at times the Action can be violentbut also over the top and stylized. I've noticed that for years there's been a rivalry between Batman fans over whose films are betterthe Burton films or the Nolan films and I don't think that's fair because Burton's and Nolan's films are different in tone and style. Burton's films are darkGothic and rooted in comic book style and fantasy where as Nolan's films are more gritty and grounded in reality. I love the Batman films from Burton and Nolan equally and if you're a true Batman fan you should see both as classic takes on a classic and iconic character such as Batman. The ending of Batman is classicunforgettable and one of the greatest endings in film history and Comic Book film history and adds to the legend of Batman. An excellent conclusion to an amazing film. The whole cast is excellent in their roles. Michael Keaton is excellent as BatmanBruce Waynebringing intensitydepth and edge to the role. Jack Nicholson is brilliant and at his best as The JokerJack Napier with Nicholson giving a funnymaniacal and over the top greatness to the role of The Joker making The Joker One of the best villains in film history. Kim Basinger is wonderful and sexy as Vicki Valea photographer who is investigating Batman and is a love interest of Bruce Wayne. Robert Whul gives a fun performance as Alexander Knoxwith Whul bringing humor to the role. Pat Hingle does a good job as Commissioner Jim Gordon. Billy Dee Williams does a good and smooth job as Harvey Dent. Michael Gough is wonderful as AlfredBruce's loyal butler and friend. Jack Palance gives a fine performance as Mob boss Carl Grissomwho is also Jack Napier's boss. Jerry HallAliciaTracey WalterBob The GoonLee WallaceThe Mayorand William HootkinsLt.Eckhardtgive good performances as well.The direction by Tim Burton is amazing with Burton constantly moving the camera and giving the film a darkGothic and brooding feel to it and giving the film a lot of energy and also does a great job with the Action and fight scenes. Great directionBurton.The score by Danny Elfman is just brilliant and it's one of my favorite movie scores of all time. Elfman's score is epicdarkoperatic and definitely fits in with the tone of the film. An excellent score from Elfman. I also loved the Prince songs that are on the soundtrack which include songs like PartymanScandalousThe FutureElectric Chair and Trust. Great soundtrack.In final wordIf you're a fan of BatmanSuperhero filmsComic Book films or films in generalI Highly suggest you see Batmana landmark classic in Comic Book films and Superhero films that will stand the test of time and is a film you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 1010.".

	onyx:emotionText "Tim Burton's Batman isin my opinionis the greatest superhero and comic book film ever made and is one of the films that set the standard for comic book adaptations. Filled with Amazing ActionExcellent performancesgreat direction and a brilliant scoreBatman is one of my favorite movies of all timea true classic and is Tim Burton at his best.Set in the fictional town of Gotham CityBatman tells the story of Bruce WayneMichael Keatonwho is a Billionaire by daybutat night he is Batmana masked avenger who stalks criminals and bad guys in the night gives them his own brand of justice. NowBatman must face off against his biggest challenge yeta psychotic criminal in clown makeup named The JokerJack Nicholsonwho is terrorizing the city of Gotham. NowBatman has to stop The Joker and save Gotham at any costs.Batman is a film that I have loved since I was kid and instantly made me a Batman fanit was the first superhero and comic book film I saw and no other comic book or superhero filmalthough they're been plenty great and good ones since Batman's releasehave had an impact on me the way Batman has. One of the reasons Batman is the greatest superhero film ever made and a classic is the way the filmmakers approach the material. Where many superhero films these days have origin stories and start at the beginningBatman starts in the middle where we see Batman already beating up and stalking criminals at night and putting not only the criminalsbut the police on edge. We don't see how Bruce Wayne became Batmanhow he trainsgets the costumes or his useful weapons. It's bold move for this film not having an origin story from the beginning and starting in the middle. What I also love about this movie is the darkGothic style of Gotham City and timeless feel. Gotham City in this film is a darkcynical place that's very much in the FilmNoir styledirty streetsdark shadowssmokefog and harsh lighting during the night and the film also depicts Gotham City as a town where criminals roam and rule the streets. Batman was a film that brought a darkbrooding style to the superhero genre that has been imitated ever since this film was released. Where would Christopher Nolan's excellent Dark Knight Trilogy be without Tim Burton's film. The film at times has almost a timeless feel to it where you're not sure if the film takes place in the 80s40s50s or the 30s. It's great production design by Anton Furst adds to the film's timeless feel mixing the pastpresent and the future and that's one of the things I think set Batman from other superhero films. Batman and The Joker is one of the greatest rivalries in comic booksfilm and television and this film adds to the rivalry of this hero and villain. In the filmBatman and The Joker are at odds over the city of Gotham because Batman wants to save the city and the peoplewhile The Joker wants to destroy the city and it's people and the battle and banter between the two characters is excellent and memorable. The Action and fight scenes are brilliant and welldone and fits with the filmbecause at times the Action can be violentbut also over the top and stylized.

	schema:reviewBody "Tim Burton has a reputation for directing dark and gloomy films. Like 'Batman Returns' this is a dark film but definitely not gloomy. In terms of introducing us to a new series of 'Batman films' Tim Burton does an excellent job of bringing Batman into Gotham City were nobody knows who or what Batman is. Micheal Keaton does a great job of developing his Batman character from start to finish. His character had to be developed afterall noone in Gotham City knows whether Batman should be trusted or not and is therefore perceived as being a mysterious character. Keatons overall performance is great he plays the best Bruce Wayne role out of all the actors that attempted and his Batman role is solid enough to make sure you would never want to mess with him! He has a brilliant sense of security that makes you feel safe even when your just watching him in this film. The acting is brilliant as he his able to give both characters a separate personality each being unique and entertaining.Jack Nicholson also puts in a fantastic performance. I have always loved to watch Nicholson in comedies and his 'Joker' role suits him down to the ground. After a steady start to the film you will soon see how he becomes the Joker and just how funny he can be with his words and props. What you can love about Nicholson in this film is that although he is Batmans main villain you realise towards the end he is just a joker and no match for Batman in a fight. Kim Bassinger plays Batmans 'lover' in this film and does a good job of showing us just how nosey some photographers can be but Batman makes sure she doesn't get in his way.. too much. Afterall has their ever been a woman in Bruce Waynes life who has not had a good job and become attracted to him? The atmosphere in Gotham City is brilliant and sets the scene very well for Batman as the dark roof tops and roads of the city do far more justice than bright sunshine in hot weather. Tim Burton also used the idea here of a city with no timescale. In other words the buildings and dress styles look very 1930's but the technology is can look futuristic with Batman at times. The quality is in the directing and the acting. It is not a fast paced film but moves steadily. Their are no unrealistic special effects but clever props. Many younger viewers may slag off this film but they will never realise that the quality comes from the story directing and acting. Not from modern unrealistic special effects.".

With his crazy persona Carrey was good choice for this role. The lines he delivers are so hammy they make me just laugh out loud. I appreciated his work even more on the second viewing.The kids are likable goodlooking and decent actors and the baby is given the funniest lines in the movie  all in subtitles.This film is too dark for the little kids but fun for adolescents on up. There is almost no profanity in here and no sex. The sets are particularly strange and interesting from the various houses to the clothing to the computerenhanced scenery with gorgeous colors. Make no mistake this is a very pretty film with so many fascinating objects in here to view that even multiple viewings can't possibly pick them all up.Obviously there is a lot to like. I hope there is a sequel.".

The main characters are introduced the three children and almost instantly we are subjected to the news of the first in a series or unfortunate events. The film is fast paced and sends the children from one unfortunate situation to another with Jude Law doing a splendid job of narrating the story along the way. The children a likable and resourceful characters with good chemistry between the actors. You genuinely feel they care about each other and have a great desire to help each other out of these incredible situations.The real star of the show of course is Jim Carrey. This film provides the perfect platform for Mr Carrey to do what he does best goof around and play over the top and outlandish characters. In this role Jim Carrey excels never goofing off to much to undermine the credibility of the character but being suitably over the top to convey the eccentric old count.Visually the film is stunning the sets look straight out of a Tim Burton film the costumes are fantastic the direction is splendid and does a fine job of progressing the story. The visual effects are tremendous and fit in with the tale perfectly never distracting nor undermining.This film is quite dark for a children's film but not dark in a sinister way but dark in a spooky hallowe'en sort of way that kids love. Watching the film reminded me of reading Rhoal Dahl books as a child with the over the top characters and out of this world situations.The plot of the film is fast paced but contains good character development and plenty of action and adventure. I would recommend this film to children and adults alike.".

It turns out that the film is surprisingly good and apart from The Incredibles this was the only big budget Hollywood film I truly enjoyed this year.Like Harry Potter the Lemony Snicket books appeal to adults as well as to children but they are darker funnier and more eccentric making them more of a cult than the mainstream success of the Harry Potter series.If you've read the books you may miss the clever word play and you may feel that the two older children are miscast. Unlike in the books the boy doesn't come across as particularly brainy and the girl looks just a bit too sexy as Violet reminiscent of a teenage Anjelina Jolie. Still they are better than some of the child actors in the Harry Potter series.On a visual level the film is simply stunning. True some of it is reminiscent of Tim Burton as both Burton and Daniel Handler are strongly influenced by the work of the writer and illustrator Edward Gor ey. The look of the film is a highly stylized mixture of Edwardian times and the 1950's and convincingly brings to life the parallel universe of the books where death is ever present and where the whole world has conspired to make the Baudelaire children's life a misery.Folding books two and three into the storyline of the first one the plot feels episodic but it stays consistently entertaining. Not being a Jim Carrey fan I was worried about his involvement I still think Richard E. Grant would have been the perfect choice but he nails and certainly looks the part of evil failed thespian Count Olaf and thankfully he doesn't end up dominating the film turning it into the Jim Carrey show.The section involving Meryl Streep's fearful Aunt Josephine is the best part of the film. Taking place against backdrops reminiscent of Masaki Kobayashi's stylish horror classic Kwaidan Lake Lachrymose is as beautiful as it is nightmarish. Make sure to stay for the beautifully animated credit sequence.".

Right off the bat I can tell  you that if you are a completely possessive fan of these books you  might be rather disappointed by this movie. The movie condenses books  The Bad Beginning The Reptile Room and The Wide Window by  slicing the first book in half and placing the other two inside of it  like a sandwich. Of course in order for this to be possible the story  has to change to make it work so some elements are not factual.  Combine this with Snicket's usually clever details in the book having  to be cut down and very loyal fans are going to be disappointed. The  movie also adds in a subplot that the first three books do not possess  but that the later ones according to my brother do so I was a bit  bothered by having that element ruined if i choose to read more of the  series.  I however understand the difference between books and movies and  think that on the whole they succeeded in keeping the tone and  uniqueness of this series. Carrey as Olaf is wonderful and adds  something to a character that seems to be rather dry in the books and  the children are believable and easy to sympathize with. While humor  was scarce the tone of the books is more clever than humorous anyway.  Overall my only issues are plotwise and how this creates a choppy feel  to the film but I don't know of a way it could have been done better.  The movie was well done withas many are saying excellent scenery  costumes etc. yet nothing made this film completely amazing. It is  however worth the time and money and one should definitely read the  books. Steven C".

Law's performance is so on target that it never occurs that this voice is not the elusive and enigmatic pseudonym himself. He is the perfect compliment to the often exciting or disturbing actions being inflicted upon the accurately charming and intelligent Baudelaires. as for Sunny they have performed the impossible in giving a perfect performance to an infant from an infant in both the physical acting and the ingenious form of translation. The sequels are sure to be the greatest of series even if the events be unfortunate as they have been.As an artist this reviewer cannot help but give this movie a 1010.

Jim Carrey swallows huge chunks of scenery in his portrayal of Count Olaf one of the most despicable villains to grace the silver screen in a while. The four child actors are all superb especially the very attractive Emily Browning as the inventor Violet.

Certainly this is a fantastically well made movie that is for the most part very well acted but something is amiss in the tone of the film and so it never really is what it should be.The story of three children who's parents are killed and who are forced from guardian to guardian by the murderous acts of Count Oloff is pretty bleak. And with a title like A Series of Unfortunate Events you really can't expect dancing elves but the film makers have chosen to add a vein of madcap silliness to the proceedings that works against the rest of the film. It seems as if they were afraid that the material was going to be seen as too dark which is a shame since its clear from the sequences where they left well enough alone that the film could have stood on its own.Its a good movie instead of the great one it wants to be.Definitely worth seeing.".

	schema:reviewBody "First of all let me go on record saying that I think this is a wonderfully entertaining film. The sets and costumes are perfect even the little details like the odd instruments on the car dashboard were carefully thought through for their effect. Jim Carrey is perfect as Count Olaf and his disguises partially because he has always been adept at creating convincing odd characters with his flexible face and voice. The kids were likable even the cute baby. Thomas Newman's score is a quirky mix that's just right for the film. I want to ask him if there's a reason why one of his themes sounds like We Three Kings gone awry. I'm writing this comment primarily to respond to the wacky criticisms of LEMONY that I've been reading here on IMDb. Most fall into two categories 1 people who don't get the movie and haven't read the books and therefore are offended by its dark tone or 2 adolescents who are obsessed with the books and are disappointed that their little dreams of how the movie should be haven't been perfectly realized e.g. the boy doesn't have glasses so this movie stinks.Let me address the second group. WAKE UP!! The Lemony Snicket books are a prepackaged heavilymarketed series that was deliberately created to appeal to your age group...the Harry Potterites. Unlike the history of J. Rowling and the Potter books the Snicket books were the result of some moneymad marketing guru coming up with the idea and finding a writer to execute it.The Snicket series is not classic children's literature although I must say that the actual author has done a fun job with the idea yes I have read several of the books in case you're wondering. One Snicket book does NOT equal one Potter book in length or quality therefore it's perfectly suitable that they put three Snickets together for this movie. The little gimmicks that made the early books amusing the author's asides to define words the translations of the baby's gurgles become tediously annoying tics in the later books. And if you're going to have a tantrum because someone's hair isn't the color you imagined or an actor is taller than you thought he should be WELCOME TO THE REAL WORLD of movie adaptations! Perhaps if someone took liberties with Jane Austen Dickens or Tolstoy it would be worth getting upset...but this is LEMONY SNICKET for crying out loud! Read some real books for a change not just cynically contrived kiddie lit designed to make big bucks with marketing deals and product tieins.And to the first group I say...lighten up and read a couple of the Snicket books before you lament about the dark tone or the abuse of children etc. etc. It's part of the joke and one of the aspects of the books that the producers did a good job conveying on screen. In fact the movie even softened the tone a bit with the touching flashbacks about the missing parents building a sanctuary etc.And what's with the wonderful yet thrownaway closing credits? Seems to me these were made for the opening but they realized that they would conflict with the faux Elf movie that starts the film. As someone else said this is one of the most delightful parts of the film but my son and I were the only ones who stayed to watch! DON'T LEAVE THE THEATER 'TIL IT'S OVER!".

	schema:reviewBody "It was wonderful. I'm sorry skeptics but it really was.The costumes were really unique. I liked how they seemed to draw inspiration from several different time periods.I really loved Liam Aiken and Emily Browning as Klaus and Violet Baudelaire even though they didn't fit my mental images of the characters they proved themselves over and over again throughout the course of the film. Emily Browning has a history of doing excellent films and after seeing her in the comparatively small role of Ned Kelly's sister I had a lot of faith in her. I wasn't quite as sure about Liam Aiken because I hadn't seen any of his work but I was pleasantly surprised.Sunny Baudelaire as played by Kara and Shelby Hoffman was just done perfectly. Everybody in the cinema laughed at the subtitles. I seriously didn't think that it was possible for twoyearolds to be good at acting but the Hoffman twins convinced me otherwise.The musical score was brilliantly done and the sets were in a word epic. I felt dizzy whenever there were panoramic shots of Lake Lachrymose for heaven's sakes! There were some scenes which were not in the books such as the theme of sanctuary the spyglasses the lost letter from the Baudelaire parents. As a Lemony Snicket obsessive I expected to fume at these scenes but they worked wonderfully.Keep an eye out for the hilarious 'Littlest Elf' sequence at the beginning and the amazing animated credits complete with a song from the film 'The Addams Family' possibly a nod to Barry Sonnenfield who is credited as a producer.I am giving this film a 9 out of 10 simply because I am a fan of the books and there were a couple of story details I felt could have been communicated better.Excellent stuff! If there are any sequels they can only improve.".

But I was looking for a movie to watch yesterday and decided to go ahead and give the movie a chance. While I still think it was too dark for a family film I thought that it was still a great film and the crew did a remarkable job of bringing the story to life. Normally while Jim Carrey can over do his roles that have this type of character he actually portrayed Count Orlof extremely well and did a terrific job. I'm in some ways surprised that he didn't get more notice for this film. He Meryl Streep Billy O'Connelly really brought Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events to life. The sets and costumes were marvelous and the story was a frightening but imaginative one that I'm sure any film fan would enjoy to watch.Three children Klas Violet and Sunny have just lost their parents and home to a horrible fire. They are left in the hands of one of their closest friends the scary looking and crazy Count Orlof. The count makes the kids do his chores and makes them cook dinner for him and his friends but the one thing he does want is the children's inheritance from their parents. After attempting to kill them they are taken to a safer guardian but Orlof isn't going to give up so easily he is going to go through as many guardians as it takes to get back these children.Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events is a terrific film I was incredibly impressed I'm glad I decided to give it a chance. It had good comic relief but also had some thrilling moments while I don't think it's a good idea to give this film completely to the kids it's a family thriller type of film that I'm sure could be enjoyed. I know there are a lot of kids that wanna have a more grown up genre they could watch and this might be the film for them. I do recommend it for watch this film is definitely worth the look. Not to mention for once it was nice that they didn't over do it with the baby comedy she was actually cute and funny. You'll see what I mean when you watch it you'll be happy too the kids are very likable and so are the rest of the characters.810".

The script by Robert Gordon was based on the series of popular children's books Daniel Handler in particular the first three The Bad Beginning The Reptile Room  The Wide Window were used as the basis for the film straight off the bat one has to say it's a children's film first  foremost although it's one of those children films which will probably appeal to adults as well. It's quite a grim film on occasion it has some wonderfully spooky  dark production design  the narrator Lemony Snicket keeps telling us of horrible  terrible things that will happen but disappointingly it never goes too far. It certainly moves along at a nice pace it's never boring but it never really excited me that much it never really grabbed me it never really got piqued my interest  it never really pulled me into the dark fantasy world that it creates. I didn't think it funny at all again maybe because I'm an adult but I didn't laugh once.

The designers have gone to town  the film looks great from foggy beach's with picket fences Count Olaf's gloomy rundown mansion that looks like something from The Addams Family Dr. Montgomery's huge reptile sanctuary Aunt Josephine's impossible house suspended over the edge of a sheer cliff by beams of wood the speeding train  Count Olaf's sinister hearse looking car to a darkly atmospheric cave  lake. Most of the CGI computer effects are good although the deadly viper snake looks terrible. The violence is minimal so don't worry about that.With a supposed budget of about 140000000 this wasn't short of money was it? Most of the money seems to have been spent on a good cast  the sumptuous production design which is nothing short of amazing unfortunately everything else is somewhat harder to find including a satisfying story. Shot entirely within studios the film also features a dummy start where a film called The Little Elf supposedly begins before Lemony interrupts  starts his own story. The acting is good Carrey was born for roles like this Meryl Streep is good  Scottish comedian Billy Connolly has a small role.Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events is a good solid  entertaining children's darkly grim fantasy which serves it's purpose well enough certainly no classic in my opinion but it's definitely worth a watch all the same  it should keep both young  old alike quiet for 100 odd minutes if nothing else.".

I honestly say that I have always liked Jim Carrey's comedy movies and he's also one of my favorite comedians though I'm not much of a comedy fan. Liar Liar and Bruce Almighty were amongst my favorites of Carrey's wild antics. But when I viewed this film I was surprised to see Jim Carrey in a whole new look. His performance here was of the villainous Count Olaf and he was more than just making me laugh but also a villainous character. He's really a villain here but yet you can't help but actually laugh at some of his antics. This is really he's best performance that I've seen. Surely there would be more but this is by far the best that I've seen Though I haven't seen Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless mind. Do I need to say that this movie was great? For I already see that many agree with me on that. A very colorful production with excellent costume design makeup and special effects and yet also a wonderful story well pressed from Lemony Snicket's unfortunate account on the Baudelaire siblings. I wouldn't mind a franchise myself. There are still a few other books still left so why not? Rating  out of 5.".

Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events books in which siblings Violet Klaus and Sunny Baudelaire start off being orphaned by a fire and then having things go downhill from there embraces that philosophy with a dark sly humor that is irresistible.

Olaf pursues them throughout aided by disguises which he considers brilliant and which fool everyone except of course the everobservant Baudelaires.Most of the elements which make Snicket's books so appealing are present here the entertaining characters the cleverness of the children Snicket's delightful black humor given voice by Jude Law and even the cunning reversepsychology promotional scheme of the series in which the readerviewer is told no really you DON'T want to hear this story go find something more cheerful etc.. Carrey gleefully gnaws the scenery as Olaf and indeed with such a character he can do no less. Browning and Aiken are quite appealing but the real scene stealer is Sunny played by twins Kara and Shelby Hoffman. Sunny does not actually speak but her coos and gurgles are translated via subtitle in a dry and witty manner another inspiration taken from the series. The production design combining the best parts of Tim Burton and Edward Gory creates a fanciful but accessible world which modern inventions like remote carkeys are wielded by characters who dress like they just stepped out of a Victorian melodrama.It is perhaps too much to ask that the film could have avoided a Hollywoodstyle attempt to soften its delightfully dreary outlook or that Carrey could have gone the entire movie without having at least one sequence in which he's just required to be Jim Carrey. But this is kept to a minimumas Violet herself says there really is more good than bad here.".

I've never read the books though I've certainly heard of them. The Edward Gorylike end credits are fabulous as is the art directionin these ways the film reminds me of a Tim Burtonlite. This film sort of has a Big Fish feel to it.I think what I liked the most was that these kids depend on two things persistence and knowledge to help them along. In this age of Paris Hilton wannabes that's really refreshing.Anyway read other reader reviews for more about the story but if you've just never thought you'd like it try it out.

I've never read the books though I've certainly heard of them. The Edward Gorylike end credits are fabulous as is the art directionin these ways the film reminds me of a Tim Burtonlite. This film sort of has a Big Fish feel to it.I think what I liked the most was that these kids depend on two things persistence and knowledge to help them along. In this age of Paris Hilton wannabes that's really refreshing.Anyway read other reader reviews for more about the story but if you've just never thought you'd like it try it out. I was really surprised by the joy I found in watching it.";

	schema:reviewBody "I've been a huge fan of these books since middle school so naturally I awaited the movie with some trepidation. Would be as disappointing as the Potter films? Would they get the story and characters right? I sat down in the theater to be greeted by cheerfully saccharine musical number involving a claymation elf and I grinned as the happiness was cut short by Snicket's humorously dark narration. These filmmakers knew what they were doing.The story was adapted very well. You don't need to be intimately familiar with the books to understand what's going on. Even though the plot changed somewhat it all served to make the story work better on screen. Some scenes were cut or changed altogether but all the great characters were done justicethough it seems alas that jusice will never do anything to Count Olaf. The child actors were very likable and relatable and conveyed a real sibling chemistry. Carrey's Olaf was hilariously over the top as he is in the book yet frightening and menacing. It's a difficult balance because the villain really is kind of absurd but sometimes he does something so menacing you really take him seriously. Props to Carrey.The highlight of this movie for me was the soundtrack. It truly captured the unique feel of Snicket's world. Just listen to the VFD track which sounds like a particularly haunting music box and you'll feel yourself getting whisked off to this strange mirror of our own world where lies danger and mystery. The soundtrack sweeps through bars of mournful cellos that convey the dark quirkiness of the world.The costumes and sets were also great. The books don't take place in any particular time. Technology ranges from very modern to very old fashioned. The movie did a great job in using costumes that were a bit of a twist on victorian styles fused in a world with modern sensibilities. It was a great look and feel In short I want Violet's dress.The inclusion of Snicket's narration was a real treat. It has always been one of my favorite parts of the book. Seeing Mr. Snicket in the flesh even if it was only a silhouette or from the back sneaking around a clock tower to write down the depressing chapters of the Baudelaire's story was great. Jude Law captured Snicket's voice very well.This is a fine example to all other filmmakers who wish to make successful adaptations of beloved books. They really outdid themselves.".

For me Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events is an excellent film regardless of how closely it matches the Daniel Handler books that form the creative basis. The film deserves a 10 for production design alone but there is much more to it than that. If you're at all a fan of surrealism especially surrealism with a dark edge although the film is certainly not without humor you can't afford to miss this movie.The story is centered on the Baudelaire kids Violet Emily Browning Klaus Liam Aiken and infant Sunny played by twins Kara and Shelby Hoffman. In a move that could be a satire on the typical Disney scenario they're left orphans when a fire tragically destroys their home and kills their parents. The film tells the story of how they are shuttled from home to home of different relatives with the particularly manipulative and sadistic Count Olaf Jim Carrey in hot pursuit of the Baudelaire family fortune after the state finally sees the error of its ways in leaving the kids with him.If you think of the Do you think it's all right to leave the boy with Cousin Kevin? section of Ken Russell's Tommy 1975 stretched out into feature length made a bit less vicious sprinkled with liberal doses of Roald Dahlian fantasy and set in a delightfully anachronistic mishmash alternate universe that combines everything from Victorian fashion sensibilities to postmodern retrotech Terry Gilliamlike gadgets you'll have a good idea of what the film is like. Tonally and in its visual surrealism A Series of Unfortunate Events is like a very dark and brooding Dr. Seuss. It also bears some resemblance to the visual art styles of Charles Addams and Edward Gory IMDb's autospell correction won't let me spell his name correctly as well as animation styles such as Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas 1993.As that collection of references should make clear Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events is in parental guidance territory. Even though Handler's books are clearly marketed as children's fiction and the film was also pitched towards a young audience the material is darker more twisted and maybe a bit too intense than some parents would like for their preteens not to mention that younger kids may likely find it boring anyway. But if you or your kids like your fairy tales on the more macabre side Lemony Snicket will be right up your alley.Which is not to say that this is a horror film exactly although in ways the Baudelaire kids' misadventures do resemble a nightmare and Count Olaf's name and appearance bear a resemblance to the portrayal of Count Dracula in Nosferatu 1922 called Graf Orlok in that masterpiece. But Violet Klaus and Sunny their last name by the way is a reference to Charles Baudelaire whose quirkily morbid poetry was to 19th Century romantic literature as A Series of Unfortunate Events is to contemporary children's literature solve their dilemmas through cunning using their respective strengthsingenious invention for Violet a wealth of book knowledge for Klaus and biting for Sunny. The message throughout the film tends to be that intellect can overcome any conundrumand that even goes for the villain he just has a bit less intellect than the Baudelaire kids.The actors playing the Baudelaire kids are good and the rest of the cast contains a lot of starsCarrey Meryl Streep Dustin Hoffman Jude Law Billy Connolly Catherine O'Hara Luis Guzman and so on. While that might sound like a bloated roster they're made good use of through the episodic nature of the story. Most are only in the film in their segments. All show why they are stars even if a couple such as Hoffman and Guzman aren't given much to do. The only aspect you might find offputting is if you're not a Jim Carrey fan as he does his usual schtick here albeit far more dark and twisteda bit like the evil Mask 1994 only not as hyper. I love Carrey's usual maniccomic mode and I also love dark and twisted so I had no complaints.Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events is a technical exemplar in every department. The direction and editing are flawless. Thomas Newman's score is attractive and perfectly fits the mood of the film. But what I continually found the most stunning was the production design. The sets props costumes matte paintings cgi environments and so on are all wonderfully imaginative and beautifuleven the stuff that was purposefully very desolate gray and drab. Emmanuel Lubezki's cinematography is fine although it would probably be difficult to execute a bad shot amidst all of the visual marvels. The anachronisms are seamlessly integrated. Even though our cast is wearing mostly Victorian garments and driving classic automobiles complete with dashboard minireeltoreel players it all feels very natural.Although this film did respectably at the box office it didn't do near as well as it should have especially considering its budget. I think it may have been a bit mismarketed. It deserves a first look or a second chance but try to get it out of your mind that it's primarily for the youngit's instead for the child in all of us.".

One such series was the enigmatic Lemony Snicket's Series of Unfortunate Events. The books are easily and quickly read but they are not your customary children's books with the average children's story. These are much darker and do not provide the happy ending most children's books insist upon.Having lost their parents in a horrible fire the Baudelaire orphans must fend for their lives when sent to live with the nefarious Count Olaf their murderous uncle. Olaf is a cold calculating quirky wouldbe actor who will stop at nothing to seize the Baudelaire fortune but he discovers he can not touch it until the oldest of the orphans turns 18. Olaf is over the top in the books and is not above murdering the orphans to achieve his goal.This movie confused some movie goers as it was not based on one book alone but rather the first three of the run. This film succeeds where some other recent children's book adaptations have failed. It is portrayed exactly as the author intended thanks to dream casting and solid adaptational screen writing. These literary works are very descriptive from scene to scene and it transferred perfectly to the screen thereby surpassing the aforementioned other children's book adaptations we have seen lately.Barry Sonnenfield brought the beautifully Gothic comedy The Addams Family with him as he created the look for the sets and homes which the Baudelaire children would visit thereby giving it that same numinous feel we all loved so much. It is as if this film were exorcised straight from the Lemony Snicket literary works themselves.As I have already mentioned this movie was an exhibition of dream casting. The Baudelaire children were perfectly cast and portrayed. Meryl Streep is beautiful and tragic as a Baudelaire relative and Billy Connelly is a delight. Some critics have said that Jim Carrey was over the top. I agree. He was as over the top as was the character he portrayed. Count Olaf if you dare read the actual literary work was as much an over the top character as anyone could imagine. Jim Carrey was perfect as the vituperative Count Olaf and is just as he is in the books.All this dark and lovely perfect casting and performances direction and writing is encased in a gossamer but nebulous cloak which conceals the enigmatic Lemony Snicket who tells us of these Unfortunate Events by way of Jude Law.He cautions us time and time again to leave if we have come for a happy story with a happy ending thereby making us want to stay all the more. Nice device which works well. Another such device which is developed from the series is providing a dialog for the baby Sunny by way of subtitles. That was brought straight from the books as Sunny's occasional outbursts of a language only babies understand often prompts Snicket to offer translations.I've enjoyed the books over the years and although the story is a bit out of sequence and order this film was absolutely 100 successful in capturing the feel and the pace of the books it attempts to document to film. Lemony Snicket's Series of Unfortunate Events is every bit as quirky and beautifully dark as the Addams Family movies. I found this completely delightful and far superior to most works of this genre.I'm a diehard Harry Potter fan so it almost hurts my feelings to rate this where it deserves. But in all honesty it rates a 910 from...the Fiend .".

	schema:headline " Too timburtonish for me";
	schema:reviewBody "When I watch a Tim Burton I almost always walk away with the same reaction the visual world created in the film is fascinating and arresting but the story lacks narrative force. When I watch a Tim Burton film I am reminded throughout that I am experiencing the work of an art director not the more traditional writerdirector.When I watched Lemony Snicket I was left with that timburton feeling. The visual world is stunning and inventive particularly the sets but I was not engaged. It felt a little bit like Felliniforchildren in that the film unfolded like a dream sequence. Each stop in the film's sequence of sets is bizarre and makes a great creative effort to lure the audience but the range of emotions played out by the characters at each of those stops seems both limited and stilted. The characters are very animated but are ultimately very flat and uninteresting. I never gave in to my willingsuspensionofdisbelief  and trust me that's usually not very hard to win.As you would expect from an art director's creation the set design and visual effects of Lemony Snicket are the real stars of the film. If that's your cup of tea then you will probably like this film. It has received a number of admiring reviews and I'm willing to admit that I might be rewarded with some interesting symbolic insights were I too study this film more closely. The starsets do create an aura of dark intensity with a sort of Freudian depth.Generally speaking though I have a very negative reaction to this film. It represents a class of movies  most strongly typified by Tim Burton's films  where too much energy is devoted to the purely visual elements of the work. The directors of this class of film are obviously gifted in the domain of creating unique visual worlds ... but the flimviewing world would be far better off if they would see fit to collaborate with equally talented storytellers.".

The visual world is stunning and inventive particularly the sets but I was not engaged. It felt a little bit like Felliniforchildren in that the film unfolded like a dream sequence. Each stop in the film's sequence of sets is bizarre and makes a great creative effort to lure the audience but the range of emotions played out by the characters at each of those stops seems both limited and stilted. The characters are very animated but are ultimately very flat and uninteresting. I never gave in to my willingsuspensionofdisbelief  and trust me that's usually not very hard to win.As you would expect from an art director's creation the set design and visual effects of Lemony Snicket are the real stars of the film. If that's your cup of tea then you will probably like this film. It has received a number of admiring reviews and I'm willing to admit that I might be rewarded with some interesting symbolic insights were I too study this film more closely. The starsets do create an aura of dark intensity with a sort of Freudian depth.Generally speaking though I have a very negative reaction to this film. It represents a class of movies  most strongly typified by Tim Burton's films  where too much energy is devoted to the purely visual elements of the work. The directors of this class of film are obviously gifted in the domain of creating unique visual worlds ... but the flimviewing world would be far better off if they would see fit to collaborate with equally talented storytellers.";

I like Jim Carey in most things he does. However he has done a few films where he merely plays an obnoxious annoying person think Ace Ventura or the Grinch. If that annoys you at all about any of the roles he's ever played you will not like him here. This is Carey at his most obnoxious. 3. Point? This film just goes on and on without any point.

Some people are British some people are American while Connolly is Scottish? It was like some kind of bad drug trip. Take 4 good movies Lost Highway  Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas  Harry Potter  The Mask and mix them all up and you have this movie. The first two because things just happen that don't make sense Harry Potter because of the costumes and scenery and a few Brits and The Mask because Jim Carey is hopping all over the place being obnoxious.It's hard to believe that so many good reviews have been written about this film. It seems to me that most of the people have read the books. I didn't know that it was based on a series of books until after I'd seen the film so I don't have this bias. The only other reason I can imagine that anyone had anything good to say about this film was the fact that the costumes and some scenes are pretty. But it isn't as though they set a mood like in the movie Underworld but rather the costumes and scenes all clash with one another. For this reason I wouldn't even say the costuming or scenes were well done.All in all I have nothing good to say about this film. I felt cheated as I sat in the cinema watching it.

I have just found out it was a set of twins who played the role of Sunny was so darling and such a unique sort of jester I need to be cautious to not belittle the significance of her character however.In my opinion it was one of Jim's finest roles. I say that because this allowed him so much freedom to really be wild without being too outrageously goofy. The opportunity he took in playing this character is an fantastic and effective display of his talent. And we must not ignore the brilliance of Meryl Streep as Aunt Josephine and Timothy Spall as the clueless banker in his wonderful little idiosyncratic contributions I take great delight. However I could praise each and every one of the actorsactresses because they were all flawless in their roles. And I can't forget to mention that the art and music involved with this film inspire me.I laughed and I laughed and I laughed. And yet it was all while feeling pain pity compassion frustration despair though Jude's voice did bring me a great deal of comfort. I'm in love with this movie. Well done!".

	schema:reviewBody "I will preface this review by saying that I have not read any of the twilight books but I did watch the first movie before going to see this film and I am looking at the series purely from a cinematic standpoint.That being said I thought this movie was a massive failure. The entire movie was very slow long and awkward. As I was watching it it really felt like I was just watching a very long book unfold on screen rather than a movie that is BASED on a book. To diehard fans of the book this could be considered a good thing because all the fans really wanted to see was a movie that depicted all of the events of the book and followed it closely. By what I heard from book fans it seemed to have succeeded in that regard but that is not at all to the film's credit. The film just moved from one scene to the next as if it was counting off a large checklist of scenes that the fans wanted to see most of which just consisted of very uncomfortable and boring oneonone dialogues. The film had very little momentum and was tedious to watch. This was mostly due to the structure and pacing of the film but also due to the characters.To be fair some of the characters were likable but they had very little chemistry. I already didn't quite believe Bella and Edward were in love in the first twilight. In this one I would flat out argue with Stephenie Meyer herself that the two characters were not in love. Their relationship was stiff there seemed to be no real emotions between them it merely consisted of silence staring and Edward randomly throwing out gooey love phrases like you are my everything and i didn't wanna live in a world where you didn't exist that just come out sounding hollow. There was a little more chemistry between Bella and Jacob but even they were a bit awkward together. It seemed like none of the characters could say two words to each other without a ton of awkward pauses. The conversations were incoherent and annoying. There was a little bit of humor in the dialogue that I admit got some chuckles out of me but even that came out of the awkwardness between all of the characters.There were however a few welcome releases from the snaillike dialogue. Cinematically it had a few semiredeeming moments. The score was likable and a couple of scenes were artistically shot but even so it was nothing that would deserve a best cinematography or best director nomination. The other wellneeded break from the awkwardness came in the action scenes. They were very few and far between and rather incoherent with the rest of the film but they were enjoyable. The wolves were obviously CG in a lot of shots but then there were some shots where they actually looked pretty real and they were presented pretty well. They could have done a bit better job of foreshadowing them but hey at this point in the movie i was willing to accept what I could get. There was also a more intense scene near the end that I won't spoil that I thought was fairly welldone.All in all I did enjoy a few scenes in this movie but as a whole it was slow incoherent poorly acted and a bit uncomfortable. If you're a diehard fan of the book there's a chance you'll love it but if you're looking for a truly cinematic experience this isn't it.3 stars out of 10".

And I was smart not to expect anything. She didn't improve AT ALL. Her lines are still rushed and emotionless. Bella's character hasn't developed at all either.When Edward walks towards Bella or enters the scene her face doesn't even light up like a real lovestruck teenager's would. With Jacob it does. I do not approve of being a part of the 'teams' that they've invented for Edward or Jacob but as a thirdparty observer she has much better chemistry with Jacob. When Edward leaves her in the woods do you think that she would shed ONE BLOODY TEAR?! She doesn't even appear to be affected. And when she is 'depressed' for three months could you fix your screams so that they don't sound like you're going into labor and giving birth? Thank you.Now Robert Pattinson His accent was MUCH better. He didn't sound like he had a speech disability this time around. The only beef I have with him is his lack of understanding of Edward's emotions while he says his lines. In the scene when he leaves Bella in the woods the way he relays his lines makes him sound like he enjoys leaving her. Even though I struggled through the books I do remember that Edward is supposed to be 'pained beyond description' while breaking up with Bella. And let us not blame Robert for his lack of abs. We all know that no one can compare to Taylor Lautner. Stifles a laugh His fight scene with the Volturi was very entertaining to watch however. That might just be because I enjoy watching Edward getting his trash kicked but whatever...Taylor Lautner The only thing he had that met any expectation was his muscular figure. His lines were very poorly delivered but his chemistry with Bella was good. A lot more noticeable than Edward's. Jacob does deliver a few witty lines but they are almost thrown away due to his rushed delivery. I liked him better with the long hair too. According to 'Indian' tradition cutting your hair is disgraceful to the culture.I was suffering through the entire film thinking that there was no possible hope of redemption UNTIL the scene with the Volturi rolled around. Despite the fact that it is not NEARLY long enough I was absolutely blown away by Michael Sheen's acting as Aro the leader of the Volturi. Even Cameron Bright who played Alec only had one line but delivered it very well. Dakota Fanning played psychotic Jane very well but the only suggestion I would have to her would be to input some dramatic pauses in her dialogue. It makes the audience hang on her every word. The few she has anyway. I'm looking forward to the expansion of her role in Eclipse. Bella's lack of emotion while Edward is being tortured by Jane's 'pain' power just screams how horrible of an actress she is. Christopher Heyerdahl and Jamie Campbell Bower do a wonderful job of playing Aro's wings Caius and Marcus. Jamie Campbell Bower's glare that rests on his brow adds GREATLY to his character development. I'm almost tempted to skip Eclipse altogether just so that I can see Michael Sheen again in Breaking Dawn! But then again I would be missing Peter Facinelli and Elizabeth Reaser who never disappoint. The rest of the Volturi guard Felix Demetri and Heidi also did a great job of making a good impression with little dialogue.So when it boils down to it every character in the movie including minor ones like Charlie and the Cullens do very well. The only ones I cannot stand are the three main ones Bella Edward and Jacob. If you can get around those then this movie will be mildly entertaining. I only bought the DVD so that I could watch the Volturi scene over and over again!".

	schema:reviewBody "I've read all the books. I know what happens. This never ruins a film for me.I didn't want to see this film because the previous one was lacking in... well... everything. But girlfriend wanted to see it. I went in and was instantly surprised to see the demographic had widened past 1216 year old girls who instantly swoon at any even remotely hot guy so that was interesting. It's not relevant to how good the film was it just reaffirmed to me and should to all of you that hating a series on principle or having preconceived notions of how bad something will be is unfair on it.Not in this case. It was still bad. BUT worth the money I payed to see it because though it most definitely not intended to be entertaining in the way I found it. It was full of melodramatic dialogue and bad acting which if you take ANY Drama classes at school Which Robert DIDN'T you'll notice certain things about how people deliver lines. You notice how they're SAYING lines they have memorised with unnatural and stylised emphasis on the key words in the sentences without giving the cheesy dialogue depth or realism. Quite simply it was so terrible I found myself resisting the urge to burst out laughing in a room full of fans who were probably misinterpreting the melodrama as Good emotional drama. No. This film is ridiculous.As it goes further on it gets less tightly stitched together and I had to become reliant on my knowledge of the books to fill in and pick up the slight gaps in dialogue and plot. They would say things that are based on something that didn't happen on screen probably deleted scene for time or their dialogue would just be terrible unrealistic lines that are work as standalone ones for a trailer but in conversation it seems like they're jumping slightly just to get to say something that is dramatic without it actually making too much sense.BUT! It does have SOME redeeming qualities! The melodrama wasn't nonstop hilarity so thankfully something else held my attention. There was actual effort put into this film. The fight scenes actually used REAL special effects something the first film was a bit cheap on which actually looked kinda impressive. Any action was short lived unfortunately but what little there was they did a reasonable job with.I was impressed at the presence of transition. The previous film jumped and skipped and the next plot point just WAS without having been caused. This film until near the end of course actually had a pace and a coherency to it that allows you to understand it without reading the books. This is a bonus. Certain things you'd think would drag on as the director tries to give you time to let the emotion sink in thankfully didn't take forever and the entire movie fit almost snuggly into its 2 hour length. Too bad it fell apart more and more it went along.The film also shares the semiawkward character interactions that create the same humour as the first one. Not as deliberately funny as the first one though as I said it was pretty hilarious when it wasn't meant to be though.Though it was many failings with only a few things to back it up as being a reasonable film it will definitely make all you little teenage girls out there desperate to see Jacob's hell tanked up body very happy. You can HEAR the audience's reaction the first time Jacob takes his shirt off. He's got all you need Pecs biceps ABS OF STEEL and minimal clothing. Too bad he lacks depth and real character. Girls love obsessively devoted Zombies they don't think enough to complain It is NO WAY even NEAR one of the best films of 2009. NO ONE should say this ridiculous claim.Really tossing up between 3 and 4 stars. Mmm. I guess a movie's highlight shouldn't be how low it sinks. 3.".

We saw the Twilight when it first came out and I wasn't really impressed with that so though hey ho go in with low expectations and hopefully I would be surprised.The only problem was I don't think I could have expected less and still been as bored as I was.When in the theatre I was probably the oldest male at 37 apart from some dads that had been brought along by their kids and several boyfriends which is fair as I guess the film is aimed at the younger ladies than us old folks.So we sat down and I waited for anything to happen well anything really. There was no chemistry at all between the leading actors just a dull numbness which left me bored I really don't know how Kristen Stewart got the role as she's possibly the most boring actress around and added nothing to the film at all unless I guess she was just asked to play a spoilt brat with no brain.I thought maybe there is some suspense? Nope none of that either. Bella does a very good job of not really showing any emotion either way and where in Twilight you there was at least a couple of times it made you think something good might happen there wasn't really a single moment in this film that stood out although I was at some point expecting to see the teleprompter which some of the actors looked like they might have been using so wooden was the performance.It's a shame really that the other film I have seen recently UP you feel more attachment to the characters in that than you do to the actors in this.Yes the CGI was good the Wolves were pretty great. But like in 2012 throw a lot of money at CGI and be amazed but that's about it. There so many little bits of story that really didn't seem to do anything it really reminded me of another film directed by this lovely director Golden Compass anyone?? All in all pretty much a letdown and that's with low expectations if felt like just another suck on the wallet by Hollywood to our pockets.If you are thinking of this film and really if you read most of the reviews on this site I can't imagine why wait until it comes onto DVD. Rent it for 1 and you can get a couple of cheap laughs at the acting and for the ladies buff men apart from that give it a miss.".

	schema:headline " The Twilight Saga Teenage Porn";
	schema:reviewBody "It's that time again Twilight! Ever since last year's release of the megasuccessful movie Twilight our lives have not been the same. With a new director on our hands Chris Weitz I actually had hopes for New Moon. Last year with all the screaming fans Twilight has turned many off. It also made vampires into a joke New Moon had potential to give the series some life. Unfortunately we got trash. Not only vampires are a joke to this story but these movies are a joke and an embarrassment to cinema. I'm trying to not be cruel because I honestly feel so sorry for this cast since they don't have much material to work with. For God's sake they have lines like Your breathing is my gift You don't belong in my world and I couldn't live in a world without you existing. How could you work with soap opera lines like that? Not to mention more than 80 of the film is 5 buff meaty guys in jean shorts which I'm above those jokes but I was expecting as they walked on screen Gonna Make You Sweat was going to play in the background. It seems like this was teenage porn for a while because every girl in the theater kept going crazy with Jacob's 6 no 12 pack abs exposed. It seems like every chance the director got he had to make the little girls happy by exploiting these young actors.The characters are another problem Bella Edward and Jacob. I've read the books Bella never intrigued me. But while last film she was just flat this film I wanted to kill her. She's 18 now granted I know that she'll probably never find another vampire boyfriend who's so creepy in love with her but good God does this girl need to get a gigantic grip on life. Edward leaves and even Hamlet would tell her to lighten up a bit. She goes into this coma state where she's just obsessed on why her vampire boyfriend doesn't want her. It's more sickening a bad influence on young girls and pretty pathetic rather than sympathetic. Edward is introduced in this sequel with him walking in slow motion as if a rock star just came on the screen more to just please the fans and give him an applause. He spends the whole movie pretty much saying how much he loves Bella how he can't live without her basically any preteen's wet dream that a guy will be that devoted when it's actually more so creepy. While Edward is Bella's boyfriend that sparkles we have a sensitive werewolf Jacob. I feel so sorry for him in this movie Bella basically tags him along starting to kiss him but then pulling away but then rubbing up against him but then telling him he can't have her problems in his life but then saying he's beautiful and she loves him. It's Bella's birthday fearing her aging process she's having nightmares that she will grow old as Edward will stay young and beautiful. Alice and the other Cullens throw her a surprise birthday party while opening a gift Bella accidentally gets a paper cut. When the blood hit's the floor Jasper goes into a violent state and tries to attack Bella Edward stops him and saves Bella. After months of Bella begging Edward to change her Carlisle explains why Edward does not want to take her mortal soul. Realizing the danger he's put her in Edward has to break up with Bella. He tells her that he doesn't want her and that he and his family will never see her again. Bella goes into a coma practically spending months inside her home and not seeing her friends. Realizing she could see Edward through adrenaline rushes she convinces Jacob to fix a couple of motorcycles. As the months pass her and Jacob grow closer as she starts to fall for him but of course being Bella he has a monstrous flaw he's a werewolf. Bella accepts it as she tries to move on with her life but Alice Cullen comes back saying she had a vision of Bella dying. After a misunderstanding Edward thinks she's dead too and Alice tells Bella that Edward is about to sacrifice himself for her.To sum this review up this movie was made for the fans which MOSTLY consists of 1215 year old girls and desperate housewives. I'm not looking to insult anyone here but after reading the books and seeing these two movies I feel like my IQ sunk a few points. They insult my intelligence and I will never understand why this story is appealing to anyone. Stephanie Meyer is a genius in some aspect almost every girl in high school doesn't feel special or just average. How cool would it be to have someone who has lived centuries who is gorgeous smart strong and kind who just thinks you're the ultimate catch? That's what sold these stories and I hate it because it makes these girls fantasize about a world that will never exist. These stories are old and over used and Twilight has overstayed it's welcome. The special effects were awful and the material was just lousy. To be kind to the film the action sequences are a major improvement over the last film much more exciting and intense. I could go on forever with this review but I'm going to save some more of my rant for my friends. While I was very kind with the rating in the first Twilight I understood it who it was meant for and took it for what it was. This is trash and could have had so much more potential. This movie was made for the fans so if you're not one there's a very good chance you're going to agree with everything I said in this review.210".

	schema:reviewBody "The first Twilight film was really terrible and had some moments of unintentional comedy but this was actually much worse. I spent the entire time just cringing at the poor lines the acting the Godawful treatment of mythology the misogynistic patriarchal and abusive undertones throughout the film and the terrible special effects for such a blockbuster series.A lot of people will dislike so much scorn directed to a film that's just a fun watch  I understand this argument but there's a difference between fun and forgettable and just being complete trash. There are incredibly entertaining movies that aren't Shakespeare but don't actually manage to offend my intelligence and my gender. This isn't one of them. Additionally popular culture affects our world view more than we can sometimes imagine. Media should be analysed because it's influential. And it confuses me how this could be so popular. Edward Bella and Jacob are some of the most unpleasant and unappealing protagonists I've ever encountered in popular fiction. Bella is shallow and yet pretentious while Edward is controlling and demeaning. These are not people that you would like if one of them wasn't a vampire and the other was snogging them.One of the worst films I've ever seen and it's something devoid of both artistic merit and any sort of meaning message or thought. It really sucks that young women are enjoying this franchise and seeing Edward and Jacob as the ideal love interests.EDIT A lot of people giving this film positive reviews are trying to dismiss criticism by saying it's a 'film for the womengirlsladies'... have any idea how much that furthers stereotypes? I know more than one guy who loves Twilight and more than one girl who loves enter generic action movie which people think only men like. Come on people move behind this shallow 'Boys like this girls like that' already. Popular culture should be analysed and it sucks if you think just because it's developed for one gender in mind it gets some sort of free pass for being sexist badly written poorly acted drivel. It sucks if you think this sort of tripe should be 'for the girls'. Another card being played is the 'Is Romeo and Juliet bad because its unrealistic?' question. Romeo and Juliet though is about the tragedy and immaturity of the two young lovers. The relationship fails and ends in such disaster because of the way they rushed and were consumed by lust. And it's one of Shakespeare's most heavily critiqued plays  a lot of people have criticised it. So if the Bard himself is not above disapproval then why should something like this be exempt?".

Taylor was pretty good for the most part. he over acted at times and it came off as fake to me. like something you would see in a soap opera. but the rest of the Cullen clanthe wolf packand her school mates were excellent. the cgi was goodhad really good stunt work. some lines seemed out of place to me. the leading roles need to FEEL the words and not just say them nonchalantly. the ending was bad to. they cut too many scenes from the book that would make a big difference to. so overall I'm disappointed. why this is such a big franchise i have no idea. fans are too obsessed boggles my mind.i was left dissatisfied but of course the rabid fan base will approve.".

	schema:reviewBody "I loved the Twilight movie that's how I started reading the books in the first place. I've read them about ten times each and I still like them. But New Moon's big screen adaptation was a huge let down.One thing that was improved was that many of the characters actually smiled or laughed naturally when the moment called for it as opposed to the I don't crack a smile cause I'm a seriously deadly vampire routine in Twilight.I liked the portrayal of Alice she seemed more like what she should be according to the book Charlie and I also liked the wolves and the rest of the special effects.But I couldn't feel the bond between Edward and Bella. I couldn't believe that they loved each other. Hell I couldn't believe they even liked each other. Even at the end after their ordeal after deciding that they would never let each other go they were frigid. The actors just delivered their lines they didn't feel them. The score ranged from awful to nonexistent. It seems as though it was not written specifically for New Moon. Carter Burwell's score brings to memory specific scenes in Twilight. This one is an indifferent generic one I guess it would fit in whatever movie you threw it in.However the most important flaw was that the entire movie seemed very rushed like it was originally supposed to be much longer but somebody edited it heavily and really really badly. For example in an instant we are informed that Edward is going to commit suicide thinking Bella's dead she drives off with Alice bang next thing you know you see a plane in the air bang next thing you know Alice and Bella are already inside the stolen car on their way to Volterra and it carries on like that until the end.No character development no bonds between them no space to breathe no explanation whatsoever of how things happened or how decisions were made nothing but a hastily chopped up summary of the book.Is the actual movie coming out any time soon?".

I'm also a guy so as to rule out the whole 'crazed over Pattinson' sensation that'd make me go nuts over the first film just because he was in it. I'm also a big Vampire fan...Twilight despite its many 'original' for lack of a ruder term ideas when it comes to Vampires and sunlight amongst other things had feeling. Had a character development that the books themselves fail to provide with. The lady that directed the first Twilight was what made the movie become bigger than the original book. Deeper stronger. I can't forget the sight of Bella crying in the hospital bed in thought of Edward living her. I connected with her pain at that very moment. Twilight didn't have many action scenes in fact it only had one. But it was a means of exploring the character development of a young girl and a very old vampire. And though the reason between their spark was 'God he's such a hunk' 'Dracula she smells great !' the film reached out to the audience. Tried to remind audience of feelings of romance and falling in love and love in itself. All reasons for which I liked the first film. It had feeling.Back to New Moon. 2 12 hours spent in pointless clichd dialogs. The actors' faces appeared as if the poor souls were in pain. And I think they were as they were giving a script written overnight or so it felt at least. Biggest mistake is how close it kept to the book to the point of ripping out line after line. Basing a film on a book that has less soul than an ancient Egyptian mummy is not a very good idea. The book had interesting ideas Jacob's ascension to Werewolf Jacob and the pack being the only thing I enjoyed in that movie. Bella's pain to explore her need for adrenaline etc etc. But to my eyes it failed ludicrously. It was even worse than the book.The Cullens didn't even have any part at anything. They were shallow empty and standing around like plant pots for the sake of existing.Bella Bella. Remember that Twilight moment that made me cringe seeing her cry? Well it takes a HELL of a lot of directing to have this poor girl weep and slam herself like a widow for the entire movie and the only thought coming to my head being 'Please someone SHUT her up'.Edward Robert...He didn't want to be in this film and it showed. The teenagehormonebased craziness of his mindless zombie fans is affecting him and let us not forget the poor guy's 23. He went from having a normal life to being popular and now he can't even sleep properly probably out of fear a crazed fan might slit her wrists in his name. Praise the star system and the mindless people we bring in our society. I wouldn't be surprised if they'd consider changing him or if he asked to leave.Charlie was one of the BEST characters in the first movie. He brought in the comic sidekickrelief along with Jake's father. Both having disappeared completely in this film. As for Victoria the audience feels her as big a threat to the couple as I feel the moon crashing on earth while I'm sleeping. Typical example of a villain whose only purpose of existence is to get kicked around. Soon.At the end of the day New Moon was a terrible disappointment. Save for the inevitable number of 13 year old fainting and feigning when Robert comes on the screen this movie has nothing to offer to vampire or non vampire fans. a waste of time.Got to give credit to the final cliffhanger though the 'Marry me' part. Though I knew it was coming they still brought that one nicely. That'll help them get some of the audience back for the next sequel which if they keep this director will probably look like a kungfu bmovie remake...".

So far I have seen this movie twice hoping that by the 2nd time it might do something for me. I was disappointed. From the opening scene I wanted  expected something to grab me  be it the scene or the soundtrack.. but it fell flat. The film's director or maybe screenwriter tried to reproduce the book faithfully yes it's closer to the book but in doing so the first half just dragged on and the music score did not help.The pace was so slow the dialogue just fell flat Edward's eyebrows were too bushy they were pluckedtrimmed in the 1st movie the Cullen's contacts looked nothing like the 1st movie. Alexandre Desplat is a great music scorer but his style does not suit this movie..there were scenes that required music but there was none. Whoever picked the songs for the soundtrack ought to be shot. I bought my daughter the CD a month ago and the songs almost sound the same.Nothing grabs you like in the Twilight Soundtrack. Say when you hear Super Massive Black Hole you know it's from the baseball scene or Eyes on Fire when Bella was imagining Edward in her bedroom. Fans still will buy it tho no matter what. The pace picks up on the 2nd half when Bella cliffjumpsand Alice rushes back to see her thinking Bella tried to kill herself. From there the pace quickens to the point where I thought they were rushed from Bella  Alice's trip to Italy to stop Edward from killing himself or being killed by the Volturito meeting them Volturiat last to the Cullens coming back to Forks etc...it looked like the last half was heavily edited  and badly at that. The scene that Alice shows Aro to prove to him that Bella will turn into a vampire eventually made me cringe  that of Edward  Bella running in the woods  people actually laughed in the cinema..it looked really ridiculous and sappy.Twilight was made on a measly 30M budget but Catherine Hardwicke made do with what was available successfully it was a winning formula. Hiring Chris Weitz for New Moon to take it to the next level unfortunately was a disappointment considering they had more  to play with. The CGI was better because they had more money but that's about it. Weitz hired Desplat whom he worked with previously  but it just didn't work. It looked different sounded different but for all the wrong reasons. New Moon should have been bigger  better than Twilight but it's not. I hope the director does not mess up the 3rd movie  my favorite bookand I hope the people behind the production wake up to their senses and hire Carter Burwell to do the music score. He did a great job with Twilight anything less would be a crime.Bitterly disappointed.".

I wasn't expecting anything groundbreaking or spectacular and I pretty much got what I expected  a tweenage love story with 2 dimensional characters and a thin plot line about teenage vampires and werewolves and how they deal with their issues while going to high school. Transylvania 90210 basically. New Moon on the other hand is a movie that looks like they took whatever was left on the cutting room floor and slapped it together and put a couple songs on top of it. The only redeeming quality of the film is the lush forest background. I am pretty sure there wasn't even a script. The actors just showed up on the set and improvised incomplete sentences  I swear to God that's what it felt like Bella You cut your hair! Jacob That's not all that's been going on... Really? You mean that's not all that's been going on in the course of the school year with vampires and werewolves running around town? I'm on the edge of my seat... Did the head vampire guy get an oil change too? I can't stand the suspense. In all seriousness I commend Summit Entertainment on creating the pet rock of the decade and getting people to cough up good money to see... nothing. It's not a horror film because there's no suspense or horror. It's not a drama because there is no underlying tension or tangible conflict... no characters even raise their voices at each other... it's basically a LONG moving photograph of a few shirtless guys and a couple emo girls hanging out. Surely there was a crew member on the set of the film that went home after work and said to themselves I can't believe I'm working on this. This is an embarrassment. I have never been so unentertained in my life. If this is where movies are headed I don't blame people for just staying at home and plugging into youtube for 2 hours instead. No plot no commendable acting no substance and a sequel on the way. New Moon.".

There were TV spots on every every 30 minutes encouraging us to go see it. that we won't be disappointed. Truth is this movie was a disappointment. Disappointing that it made so much money. Wow. this movie was so bad. Crappy directing crappy acting. It felt to me like the actors didn't even care in this movie. Like they just showed up to work and went home at the end of the day. Like they weren't invested in their roles. This movie is supposed to be a love story and yet the two leads had absolutely no chemistry on screen. It felt like they didn't even know each other. And it felt so awkward I was embarrassed to watch them at times and the melodrama which was just about every second didn't help that. By the way before I saw this film I read the screenplay. I wasn't impressed with it I didn't think it was very good but the movie was worse. The lines were delivered dramatically when there was no room for drama. Wow this movie was horrible. Worse than the first which I found mildly entertaining. But this this raises the bar on how Dodgy Hollywood can be. On an upside. The scene where Bella wrecks the bike and Jacob rips off his shirt to help her made me laugh for days. 15".

Even the title takes a minute to show the name of the movie i.e. new moon across a fading full moon. Another thing which amazes me is how the characters react when they kiss? they shiver.. MY GOD!!! Who the hell does that? I like kristen stewarts's acting because it is really natural and she is like that even in award ceremonies but this movie makes me hate bella. Out of the two hours 1 hour and 45 minutes are lost on the line hole in my chest. Edward leaves her right after she gets attacked and she takes till the end of the movie to decipher that it was for her own good...r u kidding me? The wolves are animated superbly but they are given less than 5 minutes on the screen which I think is a lost because a few fight scenes could have paced the movie. You know the end of the movie even before it begins not because you have read the book but because you saw the trailer. Highlights edward leaving jacob's abs and Pec implants and the brief stupid fight at the end. I thank god for piracy and torrents so that I don't have to spend money on these kind films.

The few funny lines weren't actually amusing and i found myself laughing at the unfunny parts like when BellyWelly cut her finger in the beginning and when Edward wanted to kill himself by SHOWING OFF HIS NAKED TORSO!! Which wouldn't have really worked because due to older vampire folklore vampires do NOT have sparkly skin so people would be more likely to think he was being Vince Noir from The Mighty Boosh or David Bowie.However the movie is very pretty. there's LOTS of eyecandy more ways than one! and the forest is pretty. Also I liked the cinematography the movie was shot in a lovely artistic and clever way. As usual Kristen Stewart is wooden and Robert Pattinson either looks like he has a hangover or is passing a rather large painful stool.It's even more ridiculous than the first. I have to rate it 3 stars One for the werewolves one for the visual beauty and one for being full of LOLZ.".

Also I liked the cinematography the movie was shot in a lovely artistic and clever way. As usual Kristen Stewart is wooden and Robert Pattinson either looks like he has a hangover or is passing a rather large painful stool.It's even more ridiculous than the first. I have to rate it 3 stars One for the werewolves one for the visual beauty and one for being full of LOLZ.";

Kristen Stewart is monotonous. She plays Bella in shades of grey sounding exactly the same when she tells Edward she loves him as when she apologises to Charlie for her three day disappearance. Robert Pattinson equals her dullness looking apathetic after Bella is attacked by Jasper  not a shred of care or conflict in his expression. Taylor Lautner might have been good is he didn't find it necessary to pause between every other word adding unnecessary screen time.Props however must be given to Dakota Fanning and Anna Kendrickson. Kendrickson's comedic timing was superb. In fact I enjoyed all the scenes with Bella's human 'friends'  they provided muchneeded comedic relief. And Dakota Fanning with her first line proved that at only fifteenyearsofage she has more talent than the rest of the cast combined.

One look at Jailbait Lautner's naked chest was enough after that it felt like a cheap tease. Add to this Edward's entrance which was so drawn out it was laughable.Special congratulations to whoever chose the locations.

Also whoever organised the soundtrack did a brilliant job  Bon Iver and Death Cab for Cutie on one album is enough for me to buy it although I'll lie to the cashier and tell them that it's for my little sister.Overall New Moon was about as captivating as watching a slug crawl across the lawn and just as slow. The precious few action scenes were sporadic and too shortlived to be interesting. Every boyfriend who let his girlfriend drag him there left with a pair of blueballs thanks to the constant and frustrating sexual teasing between Bella and every other male character which was achieved without a shred of genuine chemistry.

	schema:reviewBody "Firstly I'll set out a few points because I don't want this to come off as biased or a 'Twihard' or 'Twihater'  I'm neither. I'm a guy who has in fact read the Twilight Saga and it's an OK series except for Breaking Dawn  but we will cross that bridge when we get to it. Everything clear? Let's begin.Now Twilight was bad. I'm sorry but it's true  no matter how much you deny it it was. If only Twihards tried to clear their beloved book RPattz and Taylor out of their heads for just a while and watch that movie again they would see the awkward stiff moments which were supposed to be romantic scenes mumbled lines and zero connection between the characters. For me I blamed all these flaws on the director Hardwicke. After the handing of the Twilight reins to Chris Weitz and I truly had high hopes for New Moon seeing all the trailers leaked footage photos etc. The end result? Weitz didn't do anything better New Moon may have even tumbled a few steps below Twilight. The flaws mainly exist within the static acting of the cast  more than half of the dialog is mumbled and said with no emotion. Bella Kristen Stewart manages to maintain only one expression throughout the entire film  whether she's sad happy exhilarated depressed very Channing Tatum. Robert Pattinson hasn't displayed any great talent either. The only considerably good performance was that of Taylor Lautner who has put on a much better show than last time that's speaking with his body out of mindalthough his character did begin to slip near the end.All in all New Moon is a big yawn  there is some action which does help brighten the scene but is very brief and provides no satisfaction. There is nothing drawing the viewer in nothing that keeps you compelled for more  it's almost a chore to watch this bore of a movie through to the end. As I've said already this is largely a fault of the stone faced monotonous acting. Both Twilight and New Moon never showed us why Edward loves Bella nothing ever convinced the audience that they are truly in love. Twilight seemed to have been rushed to get to to the action while New Moon seems to have concentrated on how many shirts we can get off. Box office success or not New Moon has done it for me I have truly lost all hope for the franchise  unless a serious cast change is in order nothing is tempting me to and I don't think I'll be waiting outside Eclipse's doors.".

	schema:reviewBody "Poor Emil Jannings! The first winner of the Academy Award for Best Actor he was indisputably the most respected actor in Hollywood when talking pictures arrived ... and this innovation ruined his career as his Teutonic accent limited his roles. This Swissborn actor had worked hard to ingratiate himself to American audiences in a ghostwritten autobiography Jannings falsely claimed to have been born in Brooklyn New York ... a statement which continues to get reprinted as fact. With his Hollywood career ruined Jannings returned to Germany and soon devoted his talents wholeheartedly to the film industry of the Third Reich starring in Nazi propaganda films. After VE Day the Allied authorities briefly considered prosecuting Jannings as a Nazi war criminal then let him go he was only a broken and embittered old man. Yet Jannings's talents were still considerable during the Nazi period and he gave some fine performances in movies that served unpleasant agenda.'Der Herrscher' literally 'The Master' stars Jannings as Clausen a wealthy industrialist who heads a dynastic munitions firm which has prospered for more than a century. The fictional Clausen family are obviously inspired by the reallife Krupp dynasty. Clausen is a widower approaching retirement age but he is in love with Inken a young secretary in his office the attractive Marianne Hoppe and the two of them are considering marriage. Clausen's adult children had planned on inheriting the family business and his wealth now they're dismayed that these might go to Inken. The Clausens conspire to have their father declared insane so that they can seize his assets.SPOILERS COMING. 'Der Herrscher' was based on Gerhart Hauptmann's play 'Before Sunset' but the screenwriters have changed the ending to fit Hitler's agenda of 1937. In the play the Clausen character ended tragically in this film he disowns his family and then bequeaths his munitions factory to the German people dedicating himself to rebuilding Germany's shattered economy. Jannings gives an impassioned speech He who is born to lead needs no other teacher than his own genius. Hmm does this refer to any person in particular? The lesson for German audiences in 1937 is that the people should unite behind a bold leader guess which one who follows his own rules and ignores his detractors.One of the screenwriters on this film was Thea von Harbou former wife of Fritz Lang who unlike Lang was a sincere Nazi. Von Harbou's other exhusband Rudolf KleinRogge gives a riveting performance in 'Der Herrscher' as a director of Clausen's firm. The photography in this movie is excellent a bit ponderous but it suits the stately mood of the subject matter. Jannings is brilliantly sympathetic in a part which is meant to be a role model for citizens of the Third Reich. This movie definitely succeeds as Nazi propaganda but it's a wellmade and entertaining film which any intelligent and objective nonNazi audience should be able to appreciate for its nonpolitical merits. I'll rate 'Der Herrscher' 7 points out of 10.".

Filled with biting satire and brilliant performances from Michael Crawford John Lennon Roy Kinnear Ronald Lacey Michael Hordern and well the entire cast HIWTW was perhaps a bit too odd for 1967 audiences who expected perhaps a more madcap adventure but today it deserves not only a rethink  but a reissue on DVD. Why this wonderful movie is not available on DVD at least in the US is yet another slap in its face. Richard Lester and writer Charles Wood who also wrote HELP! for the Beatles have crafted a brilliant black comedy that easily stands with Dr Strangelove. It won't be everyone's cup of tea granted but if you forget your preconceptions and let it wash over you you will be richly rewarded. RELEASE IT ON DVD!".

He proudly states at the very end of the film that he won the war. Maybe he did but his actions and his balmy enthusiasm show us just how idiotic war can be.My favourite scene was the one with Goodbody and the German officer who befriends Goodbody for much of the film. Together they talk about how cruel both the British and Germans are and how the German officer has killed many Jews. Goodbody then talks about how he got his commission and why he is fighting. It ends with the German officer telling Goodbody that he Goodbody is a fascist. Am I? replies Goodbody but I don't particularly dislike Jews.When the very affable German officer who is attempting to surrender is blindly run over by an advancing British tank we know that in this war the good the bad and the ugly become mixed up and inseperable.I currently own a very worn out video of the film and am hoping it will be released soon on DVD here in Australia.".

Aside from The Royal Flash and Cuba I believe I have seen most of Richard Lester's films which are of significance. I think too look at this film from a mere political pov is a mistake. It is a good statement first of all about how utterly ridicilous the war process is. Sure there are awful people like Hitler and Mullah Omar out there who threaten the world at large but by and large the war process rarely leads to any resounding political solutions and longterm peace and understanding. I think even people who generally support their government's wars would agree to this sentiment. Lester does a brilliant job of poiting this out through the course of this film and he is helped by some great acting including a surprisingly brilliant John Lenon to achieve this great satire. Lester who was actually born in Philadelphia has a great sense of man's moral faults and he reflects that in this film as well as in Petulia which is considered to be his best film. I think Lester's genius can even be seen in his two most blatant commerical ventures Suprman II and Butch and Sundance The Early Years as well as the Beatles movies. He deserves more respect and I think one day he just might get it.".

Take a small number of British soldiers in a wear against Hitler and Nazism and show them to be a bunch of fools cowards and lunatics. Show that their mission  to build a cricketpitch in enemy territory  is absurd. Show John Lennon's idiot minor character bloodily killed.That's it. Doesn't it make you hate war? Doesn't it prove that soldiers are suckers? Doesn't it make you want to protest Vietnam? Well maybe all Richard Lester really wanted to do was make an amusing service comedy.

	schema:reviewBody "War is the noblest of games specially for the Queen's musketeers. Lt. Ernest Goodbody with his ready learned and endless banalities about duty heroism and just about anything that comes to his mind is in his clumsy foolishness in a league of his own.Jokes come in such rapid fire that this war comedy has to be viewed several times in order to all of them be taken fully in. The pace of cutting scenes and clever dialog is really fast. Dick Lester directs the story from mad screwball comedy to short moments of even madder reality combat wounding deaths and back again without losing any of the films evident power. The continuous use of different film techniques may strike some as tiring or pretentious. I liked the rich variation because it just somehow fits so well and Lester is never in danger of loosing the scarlet thread of irony. Some of the best moments are sprung by satiric takes on war movies and documentaries. A mission for the crew involves them to build a cricket field in the desert to impress their officers.

	onyx:emotionText "War is the noblest of games specially for the Queen's musketeers. Lt. Ernest Goodbody with his ready learned and endless banalities about duty heroism and just about anything that comes to his mind is in his clumsy foolishness in a league of his own.Jokes come in such rapid fire that this war comedy has to be viewed several times in order to all of them be taken fully in. The pace of cutting scenes and clever dialog is really fast. Dick Lester directs the story from mad screwball comedy to short moments of even madder reality combat wounding deaths and back again without losing any of the films evident power. The continuous use of different film techniques may strike some as tiring or pretentious. I liked the rich variation because it just somehow fits so well and Lester is never in danger of loosing the scarlet thread of irony. Some of the best moments are sprung by satiric takes on war movies and documentaries. A mission for the crew involves them to build a cricket field in the desert to impress their officers.

You could see this film as a precursor to MASH but I think that's giving it too much credit.In short the film succeeded in meeting my low expectations.  I've seen my share of British cinema and particularly a lot of Monty Python which this film vaguely recalls and this was a challenging film for me to watch in terms of understanding the humor the language and the slang being used by the characters.  The bits of slapstick are good but there aren't enough of them to save the film.  Michael Crawford is really the star of the film and I discovered that a little of him goes a long way.  Ninety minutes of him is too much.  As for Lennon he's mostly a small supporting character although he's given virtually equal billing with Crawford.  If you saw Help! or A Hard Day's Night you know a little about John's personality and it shines through in the same way here.I'd recommend watching this at home on video where you can stop it and return to it if it gets tiresome which it probably will.  I understand that it's due for a DVD release sometime soon.".

Having been made by an American the film takes a look at 'Britishness' from an objective view  as an outsider. Consequently under close scrutiny it becomes apparent that this is not merely an antiwar film it is an antiBritish film and ironically an antiwarfilm film.But this film is more than a satirical plot with farcical characters. There is a very serious element. Lester integrates morbid battlescenes into the plot spliced in amongst the comedic genius of the cast whilst simultaneously claiming the soldiers as no more than actors playing a game commenting on the way the war is often represented in cinema  with glory and heroism. This is the main point of the film. As Richard Lester himself said It does reflect a desperately sincere attitude towards the glorification of war by show business... One of the gross obscenities about the war is the war film itself ... like a big adventure with extras being killed in the way of a Western. This film is clever  very clever  funny and bitter.

The movie jumps around a lot and is kind of hard to follow and if there is a message of anti war it's not a very clear one but this is the baby boomer era so you have to consider the source. There are some humorous parts to the film but for the most part it seemed to me that it was a bunch of rambling on by the characters in the movie with some Monty Pythonish humor thrown in. I was going to buy this film for my collection but was glad to see it on Netflix so I did not have to waste any hard earned dough. So if your looking for a lost classic you won't find it here I would say check out Bogart in Midnight or currently going as Call it murder at least there for 1934 you will see great directing technique and a great film.".

Director Richard Lester uses various methods including breaking the 4th wall and doing a faux documentary. I am often reluctant to rate foreign comedies when half of it is lost in translation. In this one the thick British accents and unknowable foreignness make much of it incomprehensible. Mostly it's not that funny. The bigger war footage is recycled while there are some smaller action. There is an antiwar message but it's a muddle of outlandish surrealism. On its most basic element it's hard to follow and not that funny.".

Not only do I see a parody of war films such as Lawrence of Arabia whose theme is used but it seems oddly appropriate for America in 2006. By that not only do I refer to the war in Iraq but also the corporate mentality that pervades many quarters.John Lennon does steal the movie! Indeed he had a better chance than Elvis Presley did when it came to a movie career but Mr. Lennon declined the chance to do so. The rest of the cast is fine particularly Michael Crawford Roy Kinnear and Alexander Knox as the US General. This is one brave and prophetic piece of filmmaking.".

Another deficiency the gags are practically all unfunny. It's a typical 60s British comedy good cast but an atrocious script. Well filmed though visually it's pretty decent. However good for only one or two chuckles. And it was more like a hopeful chuckle sort of like I hope this is a sign that something genuinely funny is coming up soon. How I Can Bore You would be a more appropriate title. Very disappointing.A little word about John Lennon for all you leftwing Lennon fans. The music is great hence that's not the issue here. Lennon was a workingclass kid with very little education and even less natural intelligence. His pathetic attempts at spiritual contentment  or whatever he used to call it  with that charlatan of an Indian guru sectleader plus his marriage to the even bigger charlatan the totally talentfree Yoko Ono prove this without an iota of a doubt. He was a very gullible person what Americans would call a sucker. But if that isn't enough his meddling in international politics proved that he had also completely lost his mind by the time he left The Beatles and the 70s arrived. Drugs? Too much fame going to his head?He was also a starkraving hypocrite as most dogooders are. All that the world's dogooders care about is their fame and their image after all they have huge EGOS to feed. An example... Michael Caine in his autobiography What's It All About? relates the following episode from the mid60s when he met Lennon. They were in a luxurious French hotel desperately looking for a bathroom. All the bathrooms were taken. So John went to a room and urinated from a window. Caine saw him and said angrily that John had stained the curtains. And what was John's reply to this? They're rich. F 'em. Of course the fact that he himself was rich at that point not to mention later was of no consequence. Because if someone had decided to stain HIS curtains in HIS home with urine or excrement I guess he would have blown his top screaming injustice. And he'd probably have called the police. The pigs. Yes he was so antiauthority except of course when he needed them to serve HIS little purposes. Just another dogooder hypocrite...All we are saying is give peace a chance. If peace is responsible for heroes like Lennon then I'm all for war.For my review of Imagine go to httprateyourmusic.comcollectionFedor8To make this IMDb's most unpopular comment ever please click No below.".

The target here is war and just how silly men get when caught up in the middle of it and this is pretty obvious by the five minute mark of the movie. The production looks very good recreating the appearance of WWII's North African Theater quite well but the key weakness is the central story conceit that a unit of the British Army would be sent into a hellishly dangerous area to set up a cricket pitch. The idea must have had some appeal on paper to somebody since the movie got the goahead but unless it had actually been based on a true incident or something the idea is just too obvious and far a reach to build a movie around and the occasional shots at army tradition and military thinking there's an oxymoron just aren't funny enough to keep things interesting while the absurd story plays out. Michael Crawford a brilliant comedian in other material such as Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em tries hard to keep an edge to his work but the material for the large part just isn't there. John Lennon for all that he is second billed doesn't have much of a character or much screen time. He just pops up occasionally as a kind of PFC Greek Chorus to comment on the goings on. This would seem a good use of the eccentric and sardonic Lennon but once again the problem is that he is simply not given much to work with. Richard Lester can be a funny and creative director but here he isn't and as cowriter of the thing he should have realized that the material was lacking. He didn't. Not a terrible movie but definitely lower echelon stuff. Catch22 is a better and more ambitious movie and so is Oh What a Lovely War.".

She suffers torment and loss when Stewart sells her piano to a neighbor George. Ada learns from George that she may earn back her piano by giving him piano lessons but only with certain other conditions attached. At first Ada despises George but slowly their relationship is transformed and this propels them into a dire situation.";

	schema:reviewBody "Directorscreenwriter Jane Campion started at the movies in the early 1980s at the Australian School of Film and Television... She clearly emerged from her cultural heritage to become one of the world's premiere female directors...Campion's films typically have a treacherous terrain of searing emotional intensity... We recognize ourselves in the ways her characters think and behave... Her work signifies a break with the tragic the Gothic and the sentimental... Her exquisite film which won three Academy Awards including one for Campion's screenplay is not about sex but about passion...Jane challenges the viewer on many levels... Her film literary inspired from 'Wuthering Heights' explores new territory in the delicious handling of female sexuality and pleasure with the ecstasy of a loving relationship... In one scene Ada with tears of anger hits Baines hard across the face as if she has spoken words of love... With each new breath with every moment that their eyes remain locked together the promise of intimacy is confirmed and reconfirmed and detailed... Only their feelings and emotions guide their instincts... No woman artist had approached sex in such a direct and liberating manner... Campion's scenes shows Baines' face crumpling with the exquisite pain of his pleasure... Ada moving his head to her chest and Baines struggling through her dress anxious to touch her skin... Nominated for eight Academy Awards the film tells the story of Ada a strong willful 19thcentury Scotswoman who hasn't spoken since she was six years old... Ada has been set up in an arranged marriage to a British emigrant in New Zealand...The film opens with Ada who is carried to shore on the shoulders of five seamen to meet her husband Stewart a landowner who is without much emotion or real love... Her large Victorian skirt spreads across the men's arms and backs... On her head a black bonnet... Around her neck her pad and pen... Campion manages to chose a cast to suit her purpose and style... Ada is not any easy role and Holly Hunter plays her without vanity... Her face is alight with facial expression sometimes tender sometimes sad sometimes humorous sometimes soft while her hands and fingers are quick and neat...Ada speaks through signlanguage translated by her young daughter Flora and through her beloved piano which happens to be the prime source of her expression... She takes great delight in feeling her fingers on her piano's keys... But in the way she eyes the illiterate uncultured Baines there is an insolence and lack of respect... We watch her stopping abruptly indignantly as he touches her neck... Harvey Kietel plays the lonely neighbor George Baines a depressive man who is everything Stewart is not... He has never seen a graceful woman behave with so much abandon... Ada moves to the piano... She wants to touch it but she is torn by her feelings wanting it but not owning it... Baines views Ada totally absorbed in her piano music... He seems satisfied to watch... He finds himself edging irresistibly closer magnetically drawn to the spectacle...Baines enjoys her fingers moving on the keys and the small details of motion on her face... Twice he closes his eyes and breathes deeply... He is experiencing a strange sense of appreciation and lust... He feels powerless... He is desperate and romantic... He no longer admires her absorption with the piano... He is jealous of it... His attention finally focuses on her neck as it bends further or closer to the piano... Ada's long white neck proves irresistible... Baines comes across the room kisses her and asks 'Do you know how to bargain nod if you do. There's a way you can have your piano back.' Anna Paquin has been proclaimed one of the best child acting roles ever... She gives a subtle and complex performance as the very cute little girl torn between her mother and stepfather... She looks over at the house suddenly aware that the piano playing has stopped suddenly... She investigates the mystery peeping through the various cracks and holes in the loosely built hut... Her venture is one of challenge and curiosity... Her complex portrayal of Flora won her the Best Supporting Actress...Sam Neill plays the intense moralistic and veryVictorian husband Alistair Stewart who never understands his woman's nature... He surveys Baines' hut suspiciously... There are sounds inside which are worrying him... By wondering around the hut he finds a hole where he can see the two lovers kissing and undressing... He reels back angry but just as we might expect him to burst through he steps up to look again...Jane Campion creates an unusual film poetic and lyrical complimented by a beautiful cinematography of the haunting woods which by many critics has been named as a masterpiece... She is the first female director to win the Palme d'Or at Cannes...".

He surveys Baines' hut suspiciously... There are sounds inside which are worrying him... By wondering around the hut he finds a hole where he can see the two lovers kissing and undressing... He reels back angry but just as we might expect him to burst through he steps up to look again...Jane Campion creates an unusual film poetic and lyrical complimented by a beautiful cinematography of the haunting woods which by many critics has been named as a masterpiece... She is the first female director to win the Palme d'Or at Cannes...";

Jane Campion is one of these precious few a director who carefully paces and sculpts her works so that they magnificently flow like a musical interlude. The Piano is her ultimate masterpiece a film of such simplicity described with calm and tense complexity. Holly Hunter received an Oscar for her fascinating performance as Ada a mute woman who is forced into an arranged marriage with a New Zealand landowner played convincingly by Sam Neill a native Australian actor himself. Ada journeys to New Zealand with her young daughter Anna Paquin also an Oscarwinner that year few other possessions and her treasured piano a part of her that amplifies her voice that she cannot express through vocal communication.I believe it would be wrong to assume that any of the characters are martyrs in this tragic story nor would it be right to think Sam Neill's character a villain. You may think this is crazy but I think the piano itself serves as both a good and bad omen for all that are involved. I would relate it to a Pandora's box of sorts a treasure that exposes all the evil and sin in the world but which also provides hope as well. The piano is Ada's sounding box a tool that allows her to escape from a world that does not understand her but that also threatens her moral compass removing her from marital conventions and forces her to lose herself.The performances in The Piano are particularly good especially Holly Hunter's. It is interesting to note that all of Hunter's piano playing in the film is actually Hunter herself performing in front of us. You can visually and aurally feel the mood of Hunter's character through the music she plays. We the audience lose ourselves right along with her lost upon a sea of music. We see why Keitel becomes enamored by her and why Neill becomes overcome with jealousy and betrayal. Not many films would allow us to enter the emotions of all three main characters but this film is truly an exception.Rarely do we witness real beauty captured on film. The Piano is such a visually stunning film it's almost intoxicating how its atmosphere sweeps across the screen. This landscape is equaled by the performances bringing understanding and mystery to this wonder. Sometimes symbolism of this nature can be distracting to an audience. The Piano dares to follow this symbolic path and hits a bullseye with full emotional force. Rating Four stars.".

The first thing I did after seeing this was look at the list of nomineeswinners in '94 and saw who SHOULD HAVE won the Best Actress Oscar that year.Angela Bassett!!  Anna Paquin won Best Supporting Actress.... why?  She was good but not THAT good. Campion winning for Best Screenplay?  The script' was horrible!  It must've been a pretty bad year in Hollywood for this trash to be nominated for so many awards and win 2 big ones.  In no way do I live  swear by popcorn movies' but this was just dreadful.  Anyway onto the film'.I now know Jane Campion's M.O.  After seeing the AWFUL In The Cut' last year The Piano surprisingly has the same inadequacies  fetishes as 'In The Cut' did.  It gives NOTHING of a story nothing is developed...we're just thrown into these weird occurrences and frankly don't give a damn about anyone.  A mute girl is arranged to marry some guy who lives in the woods somewhere wants nothing to do with him is forced to teach his friend George Baines the piano who is a perverted sicko Keitel.... after numerous crude passes and sexual harassment by George suddenly the feeling is mutual for her her husband' Sam Neill finds out about the affair cuts off one of her fingers then finally allows her to leave with George his former friend who takes care of her.  This is the plot'.  From here now we're supposed to read into the ohsosubtle' images that the piano is her voice' pretty obvious and from reading other people's reviews she's exploring taking control of if you will her sexual qualities due to the suppression of them by society at this time 19th century.  Well I'm sorry but I did not get that from the movie.  Tell me  how was she in control?  She's forced to teach George piano lessons who only uses these sessions' as an opportunity to fondle flirt and grope her every chance he gets.  From the looks of things she's not at all happy with what's happening.  But she does them only to buy' her piano back which she loves so dearly and is her voice' I got that.  But it's George that's in control there.  The husband?  I don't know what his story was because he was the most neglectful spouse he could've possibly been.  What was he supposed to do rape her?  It was obvious she didn't want him.  So she doesn't like her husband wants nothing to do with him and then suddenly falls for George who was only degrading  offensive to her the whole time? How did that happen?  WHEN did that happen?  He shows her a little guilt and she switches her feelings?  Was it that easy???  There was NO evidence of her EVER enjoying what he was doing....but then all of a sudden she's in love with him??  SPARE ME!!  Meanwhile the husband sees her committing adultery when it first happens but doesn't dosay anything until Flora her DAUGHTER of all people Anna Paquin rats on her to him when Ada goes back to George after being told to stay away.  WHY did Flora do this?  See this is where we needed to see previous evidence of animosity by the daughter towards her mother enough at least to warrant this...but there's nothing of the sort.  I guess Campion wants us to just write this off as pure ignoranceinnocence by Flora always wanting to do right even if it means getting her own mother in trouble.  Give me a break....that act definitely looked malicious to me.  But again why was this the case when she was truly Ada's only real companion...her DAUGHTER for crying out loud!?!?!  Anyway he finally grows some 'cojones' and punishes her by cutting off one of her fingers with an axe...he must be really good with an axe to only cut off one finger!  LOL please!  It's here in which we get a really bad acting job by Holly Hunter.  I understand she can't scream but come on!  Simply kneeling down on the ground just didn't convince me...I thought she was Supergirl for a second there she didn't even wince!  Her whole performance was emotionless and dry....I felt NOTHING for her.  The only time I sat up in my seat was when she apparently tries to drown herself I was practically laughing thinking to myself yea kill yourself so this trash could end'. At NO POINT in the film did I feel she was in control of things except her lame  minimal attempts at showing affection to her husband by rubbing his body in which he then trusted her again not to see George and remove the barricades from the windows.  Some control she had with her hand was on the chopping block!  I've seen a pattern with Jane Campion.  She just throws things together and puts you in a place with no background or characterstory development we hardly know where they are!!! tries to make it artsy and throws a woman in there to try and make a point about her sexuality and sexual selfrealization..that's probably her own stance on the issue.  If that's what The Piano was about I shouldn't have to ASSUME it.  That's the main problem with this movie it doesn't give the audience anything to take in and appreciate.  It doesn't present anything..it only throws them into a situation a weird  somewhat illogical one at that and expects them to buy into it.  I'm sorry but I have to know where she's from WHERE SHE IS whyhow she became either by choice or not mute its very hard to believe the daughter's story what her past relationships with men were like why she didn't like her assigned husband whyhowwhen she falls in love with the sadistic George why her daughter her only confidant rats on her to her husband' etc etc.  The story is extremely weak and fails to explain anything.  One would probably say a film like Memento was artsy' too but at least Christopher Nolan gave us something of a STORY there.  The fact that this was praised and rewarded as much as it was is a travesty in my opinion.  This was one big waste of time that I will only remember as one of the worst movies I've ever seen.it offers absolutely NOTHING!  And that's the grade I give it...ZERO out of  stars.".

	schema:headline " In a word Stupid";
	schema:reviewBody "Yes stupid.  I can't find a single word that more accurately describes this movie.  I was looking forward to seeing it and expected to see a good movie. I do have some spoilers later so be warned.There's a woman who refuses to speak for seemingly no reason at all.  I guess so that a movie can be made about it.  Stupid.  She's forced to leave whatever land she's from because her father has forced her to marry a man who lives in the New Zealand outback one who she has never met or seen. Stupid.I guess the biggest problem I had with this movie was that Holly Hunter's character the heroine is NOT LIKEABLE!  She is cold and unfeeling and lacks any personality except when she pours her heart into her piano. Like that's supposed to be enough to show us any real depth to her personality.  But I went with it.I actually liked Harvey Keitel's character but I didn't buy his actions. He becomes enamored with the piano and with Hunter's character again for seemingly no reason.  Again probably so they could make a movie about it. She's cold and unfeeling.  She plays a few bars of something or other and all of the sudden he's infatuated with her.  Then in an effort to impress and sweep his new bride off her feet Sam Neill's character decides to trade Holly's piano to Keitel for some land. Uh yeah.  OK.  Like he'd really do that.  Like she says in the movie IT'S HER PIANO!  HERS!!!  But again they wouldn't have had a movie unless he did it so it's OK.  So to get her piano back Keitel who uses the piano as an aphrodisiac for some reason agrees to trade her keys for favors which are initially just weird then turn sexual in nature.  Again it doesn't make much sense but I went with it.Then Neil's character finds out and gets insanely jealous and angry.  Why? Holly had given him NOTHING.  She has NO PERSONALITY.  What is there to be jealous of?  Throw her out and forget it.  Why does he even care?  I can't believe that he loves her or even LIKES her.  Stupid.  Then when she tries to contact Keitel again and Neil finds out what does he do?  He CUTS HER FINGER OFF.  Actually he CHOPS IT OFF WITH AN AXE.  This is where the movie reached a new plateau of stupid and ridiculous.  So much so that I laughed out loud when he chopped off her digit.Neil then has a remarkable change of heart about the whole thing again for seemingly no reason and allows Holly to leave with Keitel.  On the boat ride out Holly decides she doesn't want the Piano anymore and orders it thrown into the sea.  Now I understand what's happening here.  She's found love and doesn't feel she needs the piano to express herself anymore. That's fine but she still loves the piano.  She loves to play it and she loves that one in particular.  So she just wants to throw it overboard? Again it's utterly stupid but I guess they couldn't express the metaphor any other way.  However the stupidity of throwing the piano overboard just to express that metaphor pales in comparison to the stupidity of what happens as the piano goes over.Holly's foot gets caught in the rope tying that's tied to the piano and she gets dragged down towards the sea floor along with the piano.  Wow what are the odds.  And I knew it was going to happen before they even shoved the piano over.  Again it was done only because they needed to have a metaphor of Holly truly escaping the piano which is what she miraculously does underwater.Finally the movie comes to a merciful end with a COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY they lived happily ever after scene.  This scene is unnecessary whether you liked the movie and bought what it was selling or not.It's really disappointing to me that this type of high class drivel is made. It's even more disappointing that this drivel is so highly praised.  The only thing redeeming about this movie is the performance of Anna Paquin who is adorable as Holly's daughter.  Unfortunately her performance is tainted because her only real purpose in the movie is to serve as a translator when writing and sign language might slow a scene down too much.  I also expected a great score but thought it was extremely mediocre.  Any actor could have learned to play what was in the movie in a matter of weeks.STUPID.  Grade  D".

I'm not against art films per se I loved Bergman's Wild Strawberries for example but this opus came across to me as pretentious feminist claptrap and no I'm not antifeminist. It is never explained why the Holly Hunter character is mute so I suppose we're to understand that her muteness is a great big metaphor for the silencing of woman in a patriarchal world.  She expresses herself on the piano OK.  But the music she plays is New Age treacle it made me long to hear Rachmaninoff or even Cecile Chaminade real romantic music not muzak. The utter brutality of Sam Neill cutting off her finger is totally unprepared for but in this ohsosymbolic film we're not supposed to find any sense or coherence on the realistic level are we? compare Dante who works on both levels. By that point in the movie I was so exasperated by Hunter's utterly selfcentered character that I wouldn't have cared if Neill had cut off her head!  Harvey Keitel's native character is merely absurd when he makes love to the hole in her stocking.  But after all he's the noble savage who is so much more sensitive than the plebeian white exploiter of the natives that Neill represents. Since the native women mock Keitel as old dryballs I suppose he's been saving himself for a truly westernstyle romance with Hunter like something out of an 18thcentury sentimental novel. At the film's end when Hunter is tempted to follow her precious piano to the bottom of the sea I was really hoping she would. But of course she has to AFFIRM LIFE and struggle back up to the surface of the water. To quote Fenimore Cooper's Chingachgook Ugh!".

I was not a big admirer of her Angel At My Table which had enormous possibilities but was suffocated under the filmmaker's penchant for what I refer to as 'ugly beauty'. Even the beautiful passages in this film are undermined by either something ghastly something about to become ghastly or something borne from ghastliness. A New Zealand woman in the 1800s becomes a mailorder bride for an uninterested working man she's a selfelected mute and communicates through her wizened little daughter Oscarwinner Anna Pacquin a bit overthetop and through her passion for playing the piano which becomes a point of contention in her marriage. Engrossing human drama with a torrid undercurrent of sexuality and violence. Many people I've talked to about this film could not get with it but perhaps that's the fault of watching movies at home. In the theater this was a slightlydazed rapturous and enveloping brew that held me spellbound until the lights went up. Movies like this don't hold the same spell when butchered up by ads for the CBS comedies. Holly Hunter Sam Neill and most especially Harvey Keitel all do terrific work. Hunter deservedly won a Best Actress Oscar. 12 from ".

Then as the story progresses he turns into a Peeping Tom and a few scenes later performs a very shocking and brutal act that was very unbecoming of what we knew him to be at first.Ada Holly Hunter is a rigid coldhearted selfish unbecoming bride who only knows how to stomp her feet when she doesn't get her way and sell her body for her real true love the piano.

A few scenes later we see him asking her to leave when she comes of her own volition because he only wants her to be with him if she truly cares.  Since when did he become so concerned for her feelings??I couldn't decide whether the scene depicting his schoolboy interest in the hole in her black stocking that bore a dimesize portion of her starkwhite bare leg was more comical or just plain ridiculous.Flora Ann Paquin seemed to take after her mother's disgraceful behavior with her bratty selfish manifestations.  Seeing far more through the cracks in Baine's hut than she should have this little girl didn't have much of a role model in her mother.The plot...anything said here may give too much away...that's how little there was to it.The only real depth to this movie was in the ocean as the most colorful character in the story the Piano took it's final plunge in what seemed more like a suicide after all it had been through to it's watery grave where it could finally have some peace. ...Now where are those rotten tomatoes?".

	schema:headline " A few metaphors found in The Piano";
	schema:reviewBody "Spoiler Piano Lessons No Strings AttachedThe 'Piano' was a tragedy that crescendos from an entangled web triangle of deceit. The movie is a conglomeration of metaphors. Like pearls on a string the examples from scene to scene were priceless literary jewels mounted on the cellulose reel. From the beginning we are exposed to the wizardry of cinematography and literature fused in imagery to culminate a plot with a gradually revealed presentiment. The opening credits appear to express the structured pyramidal scheme that was characteristic throughout the movie. All of the title letters were arranged in a condescending order and formed triangles which resembled stacked building blocks of pyramids. If the intent was there then they were very subtle. If you look carefully at the following scenes you will know why. The first thing we see is a triangle formed by the fingers of the main character Ada McGrath as she covers her face. This is followed by the ornate architectural design seen on the bed headrest also containing triangles. Moments later Ada and her daughter Flora arrived at the coast of New Zealand the sailing crew formed human pyramids to carry them ashore. It seems to me that the analogous triangle represented the three people that were to form the wrongangles to a crumbling love affair pyramid. Another detail that kept reappearing throughout the film was the strings and ropes that were so prevalent until the end. At first I didn't think anything of it but then it became more obvious to me anyway that the pattern of strings ropes and even Mangrove roots carried some significance. It began with the skate shoestrings that Flora was wearing and could not remove. Afterwards we see the mother cutting the laces with scissors. A few scenes later we see the natives placing a rope on top of the piano and the little girl swiping it off with her hand. More hints of something to come having to do with ropes are shown perhaps symbolizing the entanglement that the main character is going to encounter as the plot develops. She is shown being bound by the laces of the corset. At one point the roots of the mangroves appear to be an entanglement as well. In that scene the characters appear to be caught in a web except the roots of the mangroves create the web. During one of the climactic moments of the film a closeup shot of a spool of sewing string falls and it begins to unwind. This shot was strongly emphasized by the director. It was at this point that I came to realize that there was something significant about the strings. Finally towards the end of the movie the rope attached to the piano entangles Ada taking her down into the abysmal waters off the coast of New Zealand. The meaning behind strings is left to the viewer's speculation. I subscribe to a few possibilities that I deduced. Let us start with the piano. The piano is the complex string instrument that has to be stricken in such a way that the very application of force can designate the instrument to the category of percussion. In which case the complexity of the character using the piano as her way of choice to express herself acquiesce her physical punishments for the privilege of projecting her feelings through the instrument. The other possibility is the entanglement of the love triangle between the three adults. There is the bondage that the lady is subjected to through the unwarranted betrothal by her father. Her original husband the father of the child is complacent as he encourages the engagement to a strange man no strings attached. The seductive and passionate neighbor in the forest has a type of relationship with the native women that seem to be another situation of 'no strings attached'. This dark character harbors the piano that eventually becomes the bond between him and his lover. The director deliberately filmed the spool of thread rolling off the table as a metaphor for the unraveling of everything that held the affairs together. Finally The main character departs with her lover and her lover wants her to bring the piano. She doesn't want the piano anymore because she realized that she doesn't need it anymore now that she has found love. The piano has to be sacrificed. When the crew untied the piano a loop of rope wrapped the lady's leg and brought her down to the bottom of the Ocean. She left everything of her past and rose to the top for a rebirth. She was set free and chose to live with no strings attached.".

	schema:reviewBody "After a game of poker takes a turn for the dark side three inmates find themselves trying to cover up the brutal beating and torture of the fourth inmate in their cell. Stoic starring Edward Furlong Shaun Sipos Sam Levinson and Steffen Mennekes leads you through the horrible acts using flashbacks and interview style QA with the inmates involved. Stoic is also based on the true story of an inmate from a German juvenile detention center who was brutalized by fellow cellies.I had huge doubts going into this movie knowing that it was directed by Uwe Boll Who's only movies I had been exposed to before this were video game related. The fact that I happen to be a big Edward Furlong fan caused me to give this flick a try. After all If I was able to sit through the third crow film I can survive anything. This movie takes every fear a man has about going into the prison system and rolls it up into one nonstop ride of fear and uneasiness. The worse case scenario of jail is unfolded in front of you in a very graphic and unforgiving manor. You can really feel the tension rise to higher and higher levels as things continue to spiral further out of control with each passing minute. It's very rare a movie ever makes me truly feel sorry for a victim because I'm always able to tell myself it's just a movie it's all in good fun. Stoic does a really impressive job at making you feel for the young man being tortured for no real reason at all.Now the things that bothered me about this film first of all when in prison guards check on cells on a pretty frequent time frame it seemed like a lot of time passed in this movie with no guard in site beyond when they got food. Of course that can be overlooked but there is one scene in the film which I won't spoil just for the sake that some of you may go watch this after reading this but let's just say huge shenanigans called on the red button incident with no one double checking on the claim made.With that said I'm shocked and kind of disturbed to say I enjoyed an Uwe boll movie and not just because Edward furlong was involved. I was very impressed with the raw and realistic nature of the film for the most part and also its ability to make you feel something. I recommend you give it a watch especially you Netflix users out there as it is currently viewable via instaqueue.710  Ritualistic The Liberal Dead httpliberaldead.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "I won't go into discussing previous Boll Movies because it won't help talking about Stoic for its completely different at least from the trash I've seen by Boll. Stoic is a pretty straight movie about 4 guys in a prison cell and the dark automatics that group dynamics can take. The movie is pretty slow which makes sense because it follows all the little steps that lead to a giant disaster. It focuses on the 3 guys torturing their cell mates beginning with macho humiliation games that turn into a murder masked as a suicide. The visuals are gritty and the atmosphere is dark and kind of nihilistic yet this movie is based on a true recent case in which the convicts were just around 20 years old. Stoic is no masterpiece sure but its a movie that serves its purpose... the acting is believable the intercut interview sequences with the depicted real events work the atmosphere is cold and realistic in that the motivation by fear is pretty obvious for all involved. There are now winners here but luckily the picture painted is not black and white but a dark gray. I hate when cases like this one are put aside with the bare argument that the killers were animals or something like that because it almost never is simple like that. I like movies like Stoic for forcing the viewer to look at a side of humanity that is dormant in all of us until we are dropped into situations like the one depicted here and who knows if you or me wouldn't do things we can't think of now when fear messes up our rationality.I think the possibilities of group dynamics were depicted in a raw and realistic way... kind of reminded me of the bleak outcome in Eden Lake. And in that it made me think after the credits rolled it sure was a good movie. I can understand if some people consider it too slow or too exploitative yet I wouldn't say that myself. But a rating of 3 points with most reviews positive seems to finally prove that a lot of people really just hate Boll whatever he does. Up to now I saw no reason to argue for Boll but with this film I do since it is definitely far better than Bolls previous outputs.".

That said this is by far cult director Uwe Boll's most accomplished and mature work thus far albeit a film that many will find hard to stomach.Based on a shocking incident which occurred in a German jail in 2006 Boll uses the premise as an opportunity to launch a searing polemic against a system which locks men up like caged animals for 23 hours per day with nothing to do in the name of punishment and then is somehow surprised and outraged when these men behave more like animals than human beings.We get to watch helpless as Mitch Sipos absolutely superb here a quiet young man imprisoned for a petty criminal offence is bullied brutalised tortured and cruelly degraded as a human being over a period of 18 hours or so by his three cellmates who began the day as his friends. A series of events that is set in motion by an illadvised poker bet with a sprinkling of swaggering bravado soon gets way out of hand and swiftly descends into an insane packmentality survivalofthefittest situation that cannot be stopped simply because it has already gone too far. As you might imagine this does not end happily.Filmed on a shoestring budget in a grand total of two locations with almost all of the dialogue being improvised by almostunrecognisablefromhisT2days Edward Furlong the excellent and probably destined for much bigger things Sam Levinson Steffen Mennekes who gives a memorable turn as the mentallyunstable German skinhead Jack and the aforementioned Shaun Sipos Stoic takes the audience on a raw intense brutal and emotionallydraining journey into the pitchblack heart of the human condition and graphically portrays the most base animalistic aspects of Man's nature as they explosively erupt to the surface as they tend to when people freed from all concepts of personal responsibility.Stoic contains graphic violence and scenes of a disturbing and upsetting nature however I must credit Dr. Boll for his restraint and sensitivity towards the subject matter here. It would've been all too easy to film Stoic as some sort of tacky exploitationtorture porn flick using Mitch's suffering as entertainment for a horror audience. Instead he gave us something entirely different  something that leaves the audience completely drained numb with shock at the end and with little option but to sit and contemplate the events just witnessed think Gaspar No's Irrversible or Takashi Miike's Audition for the effect I'm talking about. For that I salute him.If Uwe Boll is ever going to win an award a good award not a Razzie for one of his movies this will be the one.".

Yes it's a tough movie to digest but it's raising awareness on a much larger issue which I think people completely overlooked. Had this movie been based on a prison cell in a less developed country it probably would have had the critics going bravo. But picture this happening in Germany? In terms of directing Boll did an excellent job. The rawness of the movie adds to the effectiveness of the characters and leaves you at the edge of your seat wondering just how much worse can it get.A lot of people have complained about walking out of the cinema hall which is baffling to me. If you were in one night tormented beaten up peed on raped and then had a broom shoved up your ass before you were forced to hang yourself  wouldn't you hope that individuals would actually have the humanity to understand what you've been through? Apparently not as critics are more concerned about Boll's directing than the guy who endured this in 2006. Nobody should have to go through this insanity for any reason whatsoever. And looking back at the sentences the 3 guys received for what they did  well it just goes to show you the value of human life. Is more jail time really going to solve this problem? I don't think so. A flawed system is just the beginning. Why exactly are taxpayers paying to cloth and feed such animals beats me.All in all I was hoping IMDb would have more information on where these guys are now and of course a better rating for a really well made film. My advice please go watch this movie. If you're super sensitive then at least rent it. The movie sticks with you and when you wake up the next day you'll still be thinking damn that really happened to someone. I'm grateful to the guys that made this movie for bringing this incident to the forefront. The movie is very powerful and as painful as it might be to watch you'll be glad you did.Now should this movie win an award definitely. Should people stop talking about Boll and focus on the issues raised  I can only hope.".

	schema:reviewBody "Now I am familiar with the director's questionable reputation and I am aware that Uwe Boll bashing is quite a popular sport on Internet forums heck I also agree that most of his movies are utter rubbish but there are a couple of remarkable things about this man's career that you can't possibly neglect and even have to admire in some strange sort of way. First of all the man is a hard laborer. Few directors have released an average of four movies per year especially when they also write and produce their own garbage. Secondly Boll's repertoire is getting more and more versatile and accessible to wider audiences lately. Initially he specialized in adaptations of gory video games but recently he made cynical comedies Postal as well as action flicks Far Cry and gritty thrillers Seed. And then last but not least the man is not ashamed to experiment innovate and  if necessary  to blunder ingloriously. This newly released movie Stoic for example all things considered it turned out a failure but nevertheless a mild and intriguing one with still a whole lot of merits and praiseworthy factors. I feel I should start with a warning to the squeamish as Stoic is a deeply unpleasant movie with an unceasingly guttural atmosphere and a large amount of inhumanly barbarous shock sequences. At the Fantastic Film Festival in my native country where Uwe Boll and lead actor Edward Furlong came to introduce the film themselves several people walked out of the theater because they couldn't cope with the harshness of certain bits of footage. I realize this works as a recommendation more than as a warning but be advised this is not a movie for everyone. You'll notice during the opening sequences or here on the film's website page as well that nobody is credited for writing Stoic. That is simply because there isn't a screenplay. Uwe Boll based the concept on true events as they occurred in a German prison in 2006 and only gave the most principal of instructions as his cast of four improvised all their lines and dialogs at the spot. This is obviously a risky undertaking but admittedly it suits the tone of the film which is primitive and raw. Four petty criminals share a minuscule cell and spend most of their days playing poker and exchanging stories on how badass they are. One day a game of poker runs out of hand and the mentally weakest of the four  Mitch  loses a bet which ordered him to eat a complete tube of toothpaste. He stubbornly refuses and the other three team up against him. What starts out as a silly macho contest quickly escalates into a sickspirited and vile series of humiliation torture vicious rape mutilation and eventually inflicted suicide. Stoic is imaginatively structured with interview scenes of the three culprits mixed with the footage of what actually happened inside those four prison walls. Initially the three convicts claim it was an ordinary case of suicide but the truth gradually comes to the surface as they only want to protect themselves and begin to blame the other ones of having the lead. The main malfunction of this movie is that it actually has no reason of existence. It's an exploitative and unimaginably gratuitous piece of tortureporn without added psychological or socialist value whatsoever. Boll pretends to give an insight in human behavior but basically only stills his own personal hunger for sleaze and violence. We only know the formula is based on true events but this film draws its own conclusions that are unquestionably far more sensational and grotesque than what really happened. There clearly went very little research into this production prior to shooting so it would be immensely hypocritical to label Stoic as a dramatic portrait of our modern day prison system. Nevertheless I don't want to criticize Mr. Boll's accomplishment any further as he definitely improved a great deal when it comes to directorial skills and competence. You can sense that he was in control of his filming set and had the luck of working with four adequate young actors including Edward Furlong and Sam Levinson. Stoic is a mean and uncomfortable film that I don't exactly intend to watch again any time soon but it's undeniably a memorable and outoftheordinary experience.".

	onyx:emotionText "Now I am familiar with the director's questionable reputation and I am aware that Uwe Boll bashing is quite a popular sport on Internet forums heck I also agree that most of his movies are utter rubbish but there are a couple of remarkable things about this man's career that you can't possibly neglect and even have to admire in some strange sort of way. First of all the man is a hard laborer. Few directors have released an average of four movies per year especially when they also write and produce their own garbage. Secondly Boll's repertoire is getting more and more versatile and accessible to wider audiences lately. Initially he specialized in adaptations of gory video games but recently he made cynical comedies Postal as well as action flicks Far Cry and gritty thrillers Seed. And then last but not least the man is not ashamed to experiment innovate and  if necessary  to blunder ingloriously.

Its just a really childish and insanely stupid thing to do.I personally have really enjoyed his past few films... you just never know what to expect when you sit down and watch a Uwe Boll movie and I commend that! In The Name of the King in particular for its insanely overthetop obviously made to be laughed at entertainment. I mean really  KING Burt Reynolds??? best last conversation before dying scene I've ever watched... I laughed for like 15 minutes... and a Ray Liotta Magi who constantly says the most hilarious stuff throughout the movie. And the choreography of the fight scenes was actually quite commendable sadly not violent but its all good  anyways....... and then Seed Postal Tunnel Rats best war movie I've seen in years  phenomenal flick  all 3 are fantastic movies in their own right. Far Cry was god awful and so was Alone in the Dark 2 sorry Uwe And then we have STOIC!  In the same darkdepressing vein that made Tunnel Rats such a kick ass movie... this thing takes you on a wild ride. A ride NOT for the squeamish to be more precise... and not for people who can only watch Hollywood blockbuster crap to be entertained. Thankyou to the other reviewer for this movie I did not know most the movie was improv on the actors part and that's an incredibly awesome move on Bolls part to boot... gave the movie a feeling of reality you don't see much anymore. The last half hour in particular is some seriously intense stuff. The acting was also very good... after watching American History X like 19 times  Animal Factory highly underrated movie and of course Detroit Rock City  even Dark Reel was pretty damn entertaining... I've always really liked Furlong  and I'm really happy to see him again in top form. The other actors too were excellent especially Sam Levinson as the most sympatheticremorseful of them all.So go find this movie and watch it  then find Tunnel Rats and watch that... and then STOP giving this man the automatic 1's he does not deserve except for maybe Far Cry... dude that was just BAD!!!".

The movie has a way a putting you in with those cell mates on that night when a poker game goes awry seriously awry. You see the struggle for power and how far they will actually go to maintain their stature in the hierarchy. It's interesting to see the confessions play linearly to it and how their story changes as the movie progresses. And I loved the acting it was fantastic. So all I have to say is if you wanna see a horrific and heart wrenching night in a prison cell watch this film.".

But in this case brutality is not shown to entertain entertaining graphic violence has mostly a fictional aspect which is not present here it is shown to make the audience uncomfortable to disturb.To watch this movie means to participate with to be in a small room together with three young men who are torturing and killing another one who is too weak to help himself. And we can't help him. Boll did his homework for this movie. The story follows exactly the real events the young actors are very believable  for me Furlong does the most convincing part  the dissecting camera is always where it should not be and the cut is wellmade to give the audience some air to breathe at least we get some insights about what drives such twisted minds.Stoic is not a big movie it's not for a big audience at all. It's not even an artwork. But it's a good honest documentary horror movie about what people are able to do if civilization is only a few steps away.".

More like mindless snuff and torture porn elements that will make you puke. This doesn't qualify as a film. It simply is something you make for fun or just to show how ignorant you are. What a cruel and distasteful film. With bad acting and directing from god help us Uwe Boll.Uwe Boll has been criticized for the worst director of all time. In which is a dubious honor but must be awarded like all in opinion. I have to say anyone who thinks Boll's directing or overall work is great needs to watch this trash. Its a cold and heartless movie that is just the worst you can expect from anybody. Even Uwe Boll.The film is supposedly a nonfiction tale about four cellmates who get into a heated poker game which results in the quiet cellmate not living up to his bet of eating an entire tube of toothpaste if he looses the hand. He is brutally beaten and forced the toothpaste down his throat. That is only the icing on the abuse cake. He is rapes beaten mutilated and left for dead in most cases. What kind of film is this? A crappy low class mess that should've been scrapped when the idea was pitched.I honestly had to blink twice to see that Edward Furlong. Funny man from Detroit Rock City is in this crap. Honestly I couldn't believe it. Maybe those drug problems gave him some bad karma. Who knows. Stoic is one of the few Uwe Boll films that is not based off a video game of the same name or concept. If this was a video game I couldn't expect it being banned seeing the movie wasn't. Althoug I don't think the goal of raping and mutilating a man for no good reason is a great concept for a film.My uncle warned me about this film but since I'm an idiot I must see or have the forbidden fruit. If he said this movie caused Cancer I would have watched it. I'm sorry to say this and would hate to again. He was right. The film sucked. An easy candidate for the worst film of 2009 and a possible candidate for the top five worst films ever.Starring Edward Furlong Shaun Sipos Sam Levinson and Steffen Mennekes. Directed by Uwe Boll.".

Also it was scary not like trash as Cannibal Holocaust or The Shining.BloodRayne was dark stylish and sexy.In the Name of the king was simply epic Even when I have to admit that The Lord of the Rings films were good I have to say that I liked this film more.Postal was hilarious and satirical The satire and the humor were way more accurate than Doctor Strangelove. Also it was funnier.Stoic was shocking and heartbreaking much more than A Clockwork Orange.1968 Tunnel Rats was a better war film than Full Metal Jacket.As you see Uwe Boll is way more talented than Kubrick. I just can't understand why there is so much hate against his films he is one of the most talented filmmakers of our time.".

Also it was scary not like trash as Cannibal Holocaust or The Shining.BloodRayne was dark stylish and sexy.In the Name of the king was simply epic Even when I have to admit that The Lord of the Rings films were good I have to say that I liked this film more.Postal was hilarious and satirical The satire and the humor were way more accurate than Doctor Strangelove. Also it was funnier.Stoic was shocking and heartbreaking much more than A Clockwork Orange.1968 Tunnel Rats was a better war film than Full Metal Jacket.As you see Uwe Boll is way more talented than Kubrick. I just can't understand why there is so much hate against his films he is one of the most talented filmmakers of our time.";

	schema:reviewBody "Stoic explores the question of weather or not prison turns minor offenders into hardened criminals by telling a true story that happened in 2006. The story is most defiantly an eye opener but the truth is that it doesn't make for a very good movie. Four inmates are trapped in the same cell twentythree hours a day. Most of them are in prison for minor offenses with sentences ranging from six months to six years. As the men play cards three get suspicious of the fourth and once they decide he's a cheater they begin to torture and humiliate the man until the next morning when one of them winds up dead. Edward Furlong is the only actor of recognition in this film usually one of my favorite actors but even he has a hard time making this story work. The truth is that no matter the situation anytime you place four guys in a room and watch them for an hour and a half it's bound to get boring. Stoic goes to extreme lengths to be beyond boring because of it's perfectionist director Uwe Boll. Boll has a reputation of doing things his own way and being a perfectionist about it. The constant changing of the camera angles as well as the inmates telling their own stories in cutaways is somewhat clever but ultimately there really isn't much here to base a film on. Stoic was a good idea that poses an important question through a shockingly true story but it lacks the substances needed to entertain an audience. In other words it was one big bore of a movie that you should absolutely avoid.".

He has besmirched the good names of countless video game franchises and now he has taken a stab at a serious story. Prison movies have a knack for being easy homeruns for directors see Shawshank Redemption Escape from Alcatraz American History X The Green Mile etc. But somehow Boll has ineptly chosen a story which relies almost entirely on shockvalue to upset the viewer into thinking they have watched something of substance. At its best the film is ridiculous and at its worst it borders on gore porn. By the way where the heck are the prison guards? I have a friend or two who have spent some time in lockup and they've informed me that it's nearly impossible to pick your nose without a C.O. peeking in on you. The idea that these guys somehow turned their cell into a 10 hour nonstop torture oasis is laughable. It just couldn't happen. The story makes no sense. There are an infinite number of bad stories out there but only a handful of directors incompetent enough to think of making one into a movie. The reason this film gets two stars rather than one is because Edward Furlong reminds me of his heyday in T2 Judgment Day. That and that alone is the redeeming factor in this film.".

I hoped that one day he would emerge like a stunning butterfly from a cocoon of abysmal effort that did nothing but ruined countless video game franchises for their fans across the globe. Stoic and following it Rampage and Darfur all three made in 2009 were to change prevailing opinion about Boll's lack of talent and test his skill in a more serious context. The first of them a gritty prison drama is far from the lows set by i.e. Alone in the Dark 2005 but is it sufficiently competent to redeem Boll? Supposedly based on facts but in fact difficult to verify Stoic is restricted to the space of one cell and a tragedy that plays out within it between four cellmates. Film is divided into interviews with three of them in the aftermath of their cellmate's suicide death and footage that leads to this incident. Both unfold together slowly revealing the true nature of the tragedy and each prisoner's role in it.Although structure allows for interesting escalation of both guilt and violence it is in no way reminiscent of Rashomon 1950 and Boll remains objective as to what we see leaving no questions about intentions of the violators. Extended from merely a treatment film is filled with improvised rant that fails to capture the true essence of this story. All three aggressors come across unnaturally and their solid performances are wasted on an aimless direction that resorts to their monologue every time the narrative runs out of steam.In the end 80 minutes long feature is carried forward by several acts of brutality that turn to be disturbingly engrossing beats sustaining the collapsing tension. Stoic aims to be gritty and realist but lacks focus and talent to achieve these qualities. What materialises on the screen is a bore repetitive and at times moronic dialogue and an apparent agenda that packs a punch but misses its target by miles. It fails to shock because it lacks any competently realised context for its content.Verdict It's better than any of the countless videogame adaptations that Boll unleashed in his fury upon the world. But even still it is stagy amateurish filmmaking that makes a point by showing brutal animalistic behaviour but lacks either will or talent to turn it into anything relevant. There is simply no reward in enduring the violence for its sake and no interesting insight into why it was committed beyond the obvious capacity for it that we all share. We come already equipped in that knowledge Stoic does nothing that we wouldn't already know.".

Whether you're the perpetrator or just having fun watching the kid's play for lack of a better term it's a part of ANY prison system and in some cases I'd like to think I'm responsible for at least one person never going back BUT obviously what happened in this prison just does not happen in 99.99 of cases. In a larger group dynamic this situation wouldn't even be possible you could get beaten up raped  shanked but not this type of situation you need to have the perfect storm of personality traits for this. The people in this cell were just the rightwrong mix with the wrong string of events. Some people have mentioned being shocked that this was a juvenile facility when in truth this bizarre event could likely only have transpired in an environment housing young offenders.

Whether you're the perpetrator or just having fun watching the kid's play for lack of a better term it's a part of ANY prison system and in some cases I'd like to think I'm responsible for at least one person never going back BUT obviously what happened in this prison just does not happen in 99.99 of cases. In a larger group dynamic this situation wouldn't even be possible you could get beaten up raped  shanked but not this type of situation you need to have the perfect storm of personality traits for this. The people in this cell were just the rightwrong mix with the wrong string of events.

Carefully directed it never crosses the line into outright sentimentality although it does come dangerously close.

Wilbur Wants to Kill Himself set in gloomy Glasgow a city with a collective depression syndrome to begin with polarizes audiences into It's great and It's awful groupings. Director Lone Scherfig handles both the city and the characters with a light hand. Moods are created by settings that reflect the unfolding drama.Wilbur Jamie Sives and brother Harbour Adrian Rawlins inherited a small dusty bookshop  shelves groaning with misplaced volumes  from their just deceased father.  Wilbur has a record of selfdestructive acts some silly and others very dangerous. He's in a therapy group run by a German psychologist Horst Mads Mikkelseen and a ditzy nurse who thinks husband hunting amongst the suicidal is a good option.  Horst seems more enervated and down than his patients with whom he has a decidedly detached relationship.A nurse's aide Alice Shirley Anderson supplements her inadequate income by bringing books she finds at the hospital to the brothers' book store for a few quid.  A single mom she and her preteen daughter Mary Lisa McKinlay share a warm relationship.  Chronic lateness brings the Scots equivalent of a pink slip and Alice ends up working at the bookstore after she quickly falls in love with Harbour.  Their wedding takes places in a Chinese restaurant featuring an owner whose Highland brogue is thicker than congee.Alice agrees indeeds almost insists that Wilbur live with them in the cramped flat behind the store.  His selfabsorbed attempts at suicide continue until he seems to rebound by falling in love with his sisterinlaw who returns the affection.Oh boy a not atypical film menage a trois with the good guy husband unaware that he's in a roiling threesome.  But there's a twist.  A sudden collapse in a supermarket leads to a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer for Harbour spelling out a quick and deadly fate that he attempts to keep secret.Harbour's concealment of his illness is futile and wrong but his deepening relationship with Horst becomes the foundation for the psychologist's belated but imperative need to reconnect with the reasons that brought him into clinical therapy.  And we also learn that grand Kentucky bourbon is available to Glaswegians.What follows is the relationship between four people with Mary the child taking on an increasingly important albeit quiet role.  The store facing financial ruin she offers her own money apparently a trust fund from somewhere to float the emporium.This is a serious film about complex relationships told nonjudgmentally which may be what has bothered some who reviewed the movie on IMDb.  An excellent cast turns in credible and moving performances.  Alice isn't very prettyshe certainly isn't glamorous.  But she has a sensuous love of life and a deep caring for her child.  Harbour loves his brother and his new wife and his almost instant bonding with Mary is believable the realization of a long missing need.  Mary is bright curious and vulnerable.  She's dependent on the adults and is shielded from their various dilemmas and delinquencies.  And Wilbur really doesn't want to dieanyone intent on suicide succeeds.  He wants a life with a rewarding love.  Who doesn't?Set in Scotland there are quite a few Scandanavians associated with the film.  An alert reader of end titles will note that director Lars von Trier Breaking the Waves Dancer in the Dark and now Dogville was a script consultant whatever that means.  One problem  it's time that makers of films set in working class Scots cities bite the bullet and provide subtitles. 910".

	schema:headline " A celebration of life... and suicide";
	schema:reviewBody "Wilbur wants to kill himself is a somoving parable about how easy is to let yourself die when everything seems meaningless and how hard is to live when a disease is mining you. Wilbur looks like a nice guy the kind of man women like he's goodlooking he has a brother who loves him... it doesn't seem like his existence is that miserable. Nevertheless he wants to leave this world that's one of men's last rights so he'll try to kill himself in any possible way. On the contrary his brother Harbour is full of life he's an enthusiastic person he's in love and he's just get married... how ironic he has an incurable cancer but that won't stop him from clinging to life till the last consequences. Scherfig has moved away from the stupid DOGMA corset and creates a perfect balance between the smile and the crying tenderness and misanthropy between life and death. She reduces the roughness of the hardest moments with a sarcastic turn or relying on the darkest sense of humor that's always the best antidote against tragedy. Step by step she shows Wilbur the right way and to all of us. No moral judgments no dogmatism... there's no need to. Wilbur is a celebration of life but is also a show of respect for those who don't wanna live anymore. Eventually it is a celebration of the best cinema the one that makes you feel better. My rate 8.510".

Nevertheless he wants to leave this world that's one of men's last rights so he'll try to kill himself in any possible way. On the contrary his brother Harbour is full of life he's an enthusiastic person he's in love and he's just get married... how ironic he has an incurable cancer but that won't stop him from clinging to life till the last consequences. Scherfig has moved away from the stupid DOGMA corset and creates a perfect balance between the smile and the crying tenderness and misanthropy between life and death. She reduces the roughness of the hardest moments with a sarcastic turn or relying on the darkest sense of humor that's always the best antidote against tragedy. Step by step she shows Wilbur the right way and to all of us. No moral judgments no dogmatism... there's no need to. Wilbur is a celebration of life but is also a show of respect for those who don't wanna live anymore. Eventually it is a celebration of the best cinema the one that makes you feel better. My rate 8.510";

	schema:reviewBody "Wilbur who is seemingly unreasonably yet persistently suicidal cannot live with himself. Harbour his caring and gentle brother can't live without Wilbur. The deaths of their parents has affected both brothers differently making one unable to live normally and the other unable to live without the abnormality of having someone to care for. Into this dysfunction comes Alice a struggling single parent who has a sad sweetness that Harbour cannot resist. They woo and marry and as their happiness begins to infuse the lives of all four a family begins to take shape despite the resistance that each feels. It is from the quadrangle they form that Wilbur finally finds what is missing in his own life and wants what his brother has so easily grasped that love in the forms and shapes around us is all that will eventually make life worth living. So enlightened he unwittingly grabs hold of his brother's love and takes some for his own Alice though guilty is not unwilling. She has fallen in love with both brothers equally but differently. Her daughter somewhat underplayed becomes a pivot around which the three focus their energies trying desperately not to hurt each other anymore than will be absolutely necessary. A bit of deus ex machina takes over or perhaps it is simply fate stepping in? and Harbour must bow out due to incurable cancer of the pancreas. It's hard to watch both the despair as well as hope rising in both Wilbur's and Alice's eyes as they find out what the ultimate conclusion will be and they struggle with both their guilt and their excitement. But Alice does not waiver in her love for Harbour and even though they can hurt him neither she nor Wilbur is willing to go that far. What will become of Wilbur and Alice and the child? It is not obvious. It hurts to watch the transitions each makes in their thought processes at times but would any of us have done any differently? Still there is satisfaction in the ending and one is left with the aftertaste of something larger than oneself probably knowing more and better than we do. Though the story can be a bit contrived it is worth watching. We aren't brought to tears by the poignancy nor are we appalled by the actions of the characters we are simply aware that they are humanand fallible. That's enough sometimes.".

I really enjoyed the film the music was very fitting to the flow of it and the characters were very well developed.

The plot however i thought turned very sharply from one direction to another wilburs suicidal tendencies to his relationship with his brothers wife and then the end scene.Overall I thought the film had a very original idea and was very enjoyable and i would definitely see it again.

The story itself is pretty average but the way this film treats suicide and the absurdity of wanting to finish life makes it worth watching. The film is made with subtle humor tenderness and love.Well acted this one is. I liked the characters. It is well filmed also. Almost every scene takes place in the bed in the bathroom in the book store or the hospital. All places that cry out desperate decadence. You can actually sence death in the scenery which is no coincidence. A major theme of this film is death and  as a direct consequence  life.What is not so good about this film is that it is about virtually nothing. There is almost no development and unlike films of who are kindred in pace Virgin Suicides The Ice Storm the story is way too structured and too narrow to just watch and experience. There is a point this film is trying to make which is a shame. A bit less narrative could have done a film which is about so little very good.Still it is a good film. Very good. I am beginning to use 5 as average. 10 as perfect and 1 as complete rubbish. And giving that I will give Wilbur wants to dieWilbur begr selvmord 8. A lot of thought and care has gone into this little film and it does show. From good cinematografy and a good script to a well polished melancholic score this film is worth viewing. It won't kill you even if you will.8 of 10.".

The overall story line is in fact quite straightforward but little unexpected things are always waiting around the corner. The characters have their flaws and do not always act rationally as it is the case in real life. In this way they become true human beings and no patterns thereof. The film does not try to find explanations for all things happening but accepts life in its unfairness and inexplicability which also makes it valuable and beautiful. Allow life things to happen and do not throw it away since the outcome is unknown.In that sense allow this movie to happen in its slow pace and you may rather be rewarded than disappointed. The solid acting performances do support the film's intention.".

The characters are grotesque selfcentered disloyal and dysfunctional. Harbour is the only likeable person a man who gives selflessly of himself to his suicidal younger brother and everyone else in his life only to be betrayed and scorned even by his own parents. No one can give a reason for living to Wilbur because life is just here with no ultimate reason or reference to God. Harbour nevertheless tries to help Wilbur best he can. Wilbur procedes to repay his brother by having an affair with his wife who claims to love Harbour. The affair continues even after Harbour is diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. When asked what a near death experience was like for Wilbur white light?he responds nothing. Just blackness and silence. Lovely. Harbour rather than try to go on fighting a almost certain death sentence from cancer commits suicide in the hopes his brother will honor his promise to look after his wife and stepdaughter giving Wilbur a reason to live. His grave not even cold yet Wilbur visits hand in hand with his brother's widow and stepdaughter talking of marriage we all know how sacred those vows are to them. Why even bother?The movie ends at a graveyard replete with bleak scenery that leaves you disturbed angry for what happened to Harbour and perhaps even wishing everyone else BUT Harbour had killed themselves. Sartre would have liked this movie but not even one as twisted as he would  dare to have labeled this trash as comedy.".

The first half hour or so is actually not bad and has some funny parts but then it quickly loses focus and just kind of plods around for another looong hour. Instead of fulfilling the promise of it's chosen subject matter the film oddly chooses to practically abandon it's initial theme and instead wastes a lot of time with incredibly generic soapopera plot contrivances. As a whole the film just seems rudderless and oddly uninspired. No sense of tone or craft. Did anyone working on the film really think the horrible sentimental music was appropriate? There are too many unnecessary minor characters each with a tootidy arch and a lot of pointless scenes that seem like they were added just to pad out the running time even though the movie already seems too drawnout. Overall this movie is more just strangely flat than outright bad in almost any sense full of an overwhelming feeling of dull underachievement.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one helluv a title isn't it? Why would anyone want to see a movie with a seemingly deathimpending title? I remember hearing about WILBUR on cable IFC's Independent Film Channel At the Angelika film previews. It's a film in English by writerdirector Lone Scherfig from Denmark. I rather enjoy her previous film Italian for Beginners 2000 in Danish Italian and English. Might want to check out her minibio on IMDb  quite interesting to learn about a filmmaker's background. WILBUR wants to kill himself is a small quiet film that actually has much human pathos. The three 'and a half' main leads Harbour the older brother who's closely protective of Wilbur is sensitively played by Adrian Rawlins Wilbur the younger brother is lively played sounds like an oxymoron considering what the title suggests his role is by Jamie Sives Alice the young woman who came into their lives is subtly played by Shirley Henderson and the critical 'half' being her little daughter Mary aptly played by Lisa McKinlay  the portrayals and interplay were flawless. Didn't realize Rawlins is so talented  he was Dr. Richardson in Lars Von Trier's Breaking the Waves 1996 with the tour de force pair of Emily Watson and Stellan Skarsgard. Noticed from the ending credit roll that Lars Von Trier was one of the two script consultants on this film. The music by Joachim Holbek complements the daringly subdued theme and tone of this unusually titled film. Well let's not be hung up on the title. Kudos to Scherfig for being so venturesome with the story and her script. Isn't life just so  uncertain risky not as one might expect all the time? Cheers to the full cast and crew for their willing participation and creative energy on this filmic journey. The film's a tearjerker  wouldn't you know it  with dashes of bemused humor little details and vignettes like at the Chinese restaurant at the hospital ward or by the river and of course in the bookstore and in the bedroom  it's basically about where one's heart is. The plot creeps up on you  gradually the viewer is drawn into this three and a halfsome world we see on screen caring for the characters worrying with them sighing with them smiling with them and pulling for the best possible outcomes. We want them to somehow succeed  succeed in what? Now isn't day to day living about coping with whatever comes and listening to one's heart? Grand and unattainable philosophy? Not at all. It's also being attentive to the dear persons around us in our lives and give a little  don't wait. Wilbur just might learn to let go of himself think less of himself and surrender to loving life. That just might be what the title implied perhaps? It may not be for everyone  see for yourself. WILBUR wants to kill himself deservedly worth your while.About the talented Shirley Henderson from Scotland I've enjoyed her performance as Shirley the wife  mother and love interest opposite Robert Carlyle and Rhys Ifans in wd Shane Meadows' Once Upon a Time in the Midlands 2002  almost a similar menage a trois situation but less assertive than her role in WILBUR. She's also in director John Crowley's Intermission 2003 script by Mark O'Rowe  taken on among the stellar cast the rather offbeat yet still demure role of Sally the script itself is plucky and unyielding alright  then again it's probably quite 'normal' in the setting described  another amusingly enjoyable film from Ireland if you're so gamed.".

	schema:reviewBody "Lone Scherfig's previous movie Italiensk for Begyndere was very praised around Europe and not the least here in Denmark. It was a well directed dogma movie with excellent acting but when it comes down to it the story was very vague and I for one did not find that movie very interesting at all.However Wilbur Wants to Kill Himself is an excellent and beautiful film about the Scottish Wilbur Jamie Sives who makes use of every other moment to attempt suicide. It's done with a semihumouristic twist which makes it not all too sad through the movie but is still meant to be taken seriously. He moves into his brother's home in a used book store where the brother HarbourAdrian Rawlins must watch over him to keep him alive. As Harbour discovers love in Alice beautifully played by Shirley Henderson they become four in the home as Alice and her 9yearold daughter Mary moves in and Wilbur discovers love in both of them as well as he gets to see death from a new and unexpected perspective.It was a good choice to make this movie in English rather than Danish and the result is an excellent drama which will apply to most people even though they like me may not be much for that sort of movies. If you liked Breaking the Waves Wilbur Wants to Kill Himself should apply to you as well.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Gendarm is one of these movies which get aired in Germany at least twice a year on television on public holidays. Shame on me I never took the opportunity to give it my full attendance. So now when it got rereleased on DVD in a box containing the first 3 flix with Louis De Funes as Gendarm Cruchot I gripped my chance  and was in no way disappointed.In the first 10 minutes of his movie which I never saw before we are introduced to the choleric character of a county policeman arresting fish and chicken thieves and singing in the church choir. This piece of film is in black and white contrasting the colorful scenes at St Tropez later on. Already these first 10 minutes are the work of a genius in humor. De Funes never fails to amuse with his extraordinary combination of being the law abiding correct police officer and same time unable to control his overwhelming emotions as depicted in his facial expression and excessive gestures. With this he is throughout the movie never overacting like in some of his later works.About the main part of the movie we see him elevated to lead a fearless four of flics in the mundane town of St Tropez on Mediterranean Cote D'Azur. Some story lines are welded together about nudist bathers are they in existence still? young folks doing some vandalism and finally a big robbery of a classical painting which he can by chance for sure resolve. These are used to include some extraordinary political and social satire subtones like Louis leading his flics into assault on nude people on the beach like famous French Foreign Legion soldiers in desert wars.I was brilliantly entertained by this comedy and could laugh out loud on some of the punchlines and almost dadaist slapstick. Oh and you won't forget the catchy St Tropez tune performed by his film daughter and featured 3 times in the film. I give it 8 out of 10.Additional trivia for German version In the restored version on DVD we see some short scenes which were cut from the theatrical version recognizable by not being overdubbed with German synchro. They do not add much to the story but fit into the picture of a great comedy.".

	schema:reviewBody "Of all the genres comedy is the one which gets more easily dated. That's because the conventions for each moment in time and for each culture are very volatile they change quickly. And for some reason we don't pile new notions over old ones which is to say with humor once we have new conventions we reject old ones unlike for instance the detective film. This means that what makes people laugh now won't work in a very short time. I'm still young and i've seen that happen with films i saw as a teen. But than we have another aspect to be reckoned the fact that though audiences adapt to new conventions regardless of their age as long as they keep seeing new films and live active social lives they still gain a cinematic memory. So many times people know that they will rewatch a film which is funny they remember they laughed out loud when they saw it the first time.I saw this film with my mother and i registered this effect on her. To me this was something i had seen 10 years ago to her it was a memory from childhood when these gendarme films were fresh.Now they aren't fresh. Social criticisms here are totally out of date for European societies even for the Portuguese! so that's a card out of the deck.The kind of gimmick Funs uses are also no longer so watchable. Physical acting has evolved to play with the body as an object Jim Carey type more than with the placing of the characters in a funny situation like here Chaplin made both things.I do sympathize with his unlikable character. The witty policeman despicable overprotective about his girl that's social commentary as well caring for appearances. It's a matter of attitude and Louis de Funs was a valuable performer.One thing is remarkable about this film and its context St.Tropez. What is remarkable besides beautiful beaches and pleasant lifestyle is how cinema was an important even fundamental piece of the publicity machinery the french created to promote the place. It starts with 'Et dieu crea la femme' and it goes through a number of other films including this one. Here we even have a song about the village obviously made to promote both the film and the place. So here as with 'and god...' we have the key elements that were important to highlight beach sand summermood boats high life openminded relaxed living youth attractive girls. The story exists to show off these elements. Well you go today to St Tropez and compare it to what we have here in this film and specially in 'and god..' and you have to admit they were successful in their campaign.My opinion 35 httpwww.7eyes.wordpress.com".

	onyx:emotionText "Of all the genres comedy is the one which gets more easily dated. That's because the conventions for each moment in time and for each culture are very volatile they change quickly. And for some reason we don't pile new notions over old ones which is to say with humor once we have new conventions we reject old ones unlike for instance the detective film. This means that what makes people laugh now won't work in a very short time. I'm still young and i've seen that happen with films i saw as a teen. But than we have another aspect to be reckoned the fact that though audiences adapt to new conventions regardless of their age as long as they keep seeing new films and live active social lives they still gain a cinematic memory. So many times people know that they will rewatch a film which is funny they remember they laughed out loud when they saw it the first time.I saw this film with my mother and i registered this effect on her.

Although the exact relationships between the Pink Panther movies on the one side and the totally 6 Le Gendarme De SaintTropezmovies directed by Jean Girault has as far as I know never been revealed or scrutinized the latter ones starting in 1964 can surely be seen as an answer to make fun of the French provincial police by some people from Paris.A short comparison between Sellers who has been considered widely as the best comedian of all times and De Funes who never got really famous in the US despite the release of such movies like Rabbi Jacob and the VHS release of La Grande Vadrouille De Funes' comic is devastatingly different from the one of Sellers. De Funes who was a trained pantomimic used this special capacity of his in most of his films his beingacomedian has elements of vaudeville  yet not in the sense of the Marx brothers of slapstick  yet not in the sense of the early American silent movies  of horseplay yet without striving tastelessness or primitiveness. However his comic is never intellectual Funes could never have played Dr. Strangelove  as Seller could never have been Balduin or Oskar.Nevertheless the characters of Cruchot and Cluseau are closer than one would expect yet still radically different in their basics. While Clouzeau never seems to be ridiculous when he hunts criminals Cruchot does because he is more interested in chickenstealing than in felonies. How Cruchot treats his caught thieves reveals that he is not to much different from them. On the other side Clouseau is different from everybody he would be too clumsy to associate with his victims. Clouzeau is much more the French guy as he is seen by foreigners than Cruchot Quiet with a tendency to be elegant womanizing polite. But now quite the opposite is Cruchot He walks around with his uniform even at home he is loud rude slaps and hits and beats his subservients has mostly a daughter in later Gendarmsequels a wife but does not come in flirting contact with any other women. He uses politeness and respect strictly to get to his purpose  as he uses otherwise rudeness and disrespect. However both Cluseau and Cruchot are behaving strictly against police rules but in their anticyclic behavior they reach the goal where probably everyone else would fail.Louis De Funes has often being criticized for having played the allegedly primitive but funny Gendarmmovies after having been for decades a revered but outside of France completely unnoticed stage actor. It is true that especially his work that he did with Gerard Oury belongs probably to the best that French comedy of the 60ies and 70ies had to offer but without the Gendarmmovies he possibly would never have reached his enormous popularity. It is time that these 6 movies are edited for the international audience too.".

	schema:headline " The film that made De Funs the De Gaulle of French cinema...";
	schema:reviewBody "Said differently this is the film that launched the career of Louis de Funs in 1964. He was no newcomer and had already twenty years of experience collecting small roles on the screen and bigger ones on the stage but fate was only waiting for the last scraps of hair to disappear on the top of his head so he could get on the top of the box office for almost two decades. The movie would also span a series of sequels and become the most emblematic role of his career. See there are many elements of history movie buffs will enjoy in this film so I'm afraid it doesn't leave much to say about the film itself but the elements of context are vital because they help to understand the reasons begind one of the most successful careers of French cinema.We are in the middle of the 60's at the culmination of what they call the Glorious Thirties France has become a major international political player intoxicated by the aura of General De Gaulle the Algerian war is over and the first baby boom generation is coming to age and can enjoy their first great summer holidays. But as far as summer was concerned there was one place to be and it was Saint Tropez. You don't know how big Saint Tropez was in the 60's? Are you kidding?The place's story is almost as legendary as Las Vegas it was a remote beach station in the Mediterranean South that became cherished by the New Wave stars one of its most memorable ambassadors was the loveliest mermaid Brigitte Bardot. One running gag in the 1972 comedy The Annuity is that the film starts so early in time the name Saint Tropez never rings a bell and this is where the poor schmuck bought a little house at a cheap price. To end on the trivia the dubbing in The Sword in the Stone had Bermuda replaced by Saint Tropez.So the town was the Mecca of fun vacation and amusement and when a screenwriter came to a real St Tropez gendarme station after his camera was stolen he was told to come after nap time a joke worthy of an Astrix album that convinced him to make fun of them in his next project. The premise was in line with the city's popularity all they needed was an actor. De Funes had made a few successes in 1963 the most notable one was Pouic Pouic but producers were rather reluctant they only hired him in exchange of several cuts in the budget and hiring secondrate actors. Michel Galabru would eavesdrop a conversation revealing that they were looking for such a cast and a few time later he got the offer. His career was launched as well. And so was the team made with Louis de Funs as iconic Ludovic Cruchot and Galabru as Adjutant Gerber. The masterstroke of the script where De Funs was involved was to make Galabru the superior. So there's a very interesting opening in the Alps region where we see Cruchot operating with some cattle thief and then getting a letter of promotion. The opening is full of comical moments but it's the choice of monochrome shooting that creates the exhilarating feeling when it jumps to color and to the catchy music of Do You Saint Tropez so typical of French youth passion for American music.This transition is literally De Funs career in microcosm from the black and white little roles to the thundering and joyful sixties. And his arrival at Saint Tropez with his daughter Nicole Genevieve Gard who sings the song is actually one of the most pivotal moment of comedic and French popular cinema. It's not just about De Funs but popular cinema had just stolen the thunder from snobbish New Wave directors. And that feels good too.But there's more in casting De Funs as the newcomer and not the highest ranked it allows him to plays what would become his most famous shtick authoritarian and overzealous with the subordinates look at me in the eyes with the pointing fingers was his first catchphrase and honeymouthed with the superior. The interaction between the gendarmes are some of the film's greatest moments and they work so well you actually don't wait for a plot to spoil these moments.And yet the plot involving the nudist camp is actually very well done and contribute to some of the film's best moments when Cruchot improvises himself a drill sergeant instructor and when for the first time the catchy theme of the Gendarme march composed by Raymond Lefebvre is played the tune echoes the iconic Colonel Bogey March and became a standard of French cinema. Many elements from the movies would be used in the later sequels the relationships between Gerber and Cruchot their challenging authority moments the crazy driving nun the march but they all carry a special charm for the simple reason than we're watching them for the first time and because this is De Funs finally being given his leading role and being at the top of his game. In the context of the film it's fresh and original. Although I conceded it suffers from the usual De Funs syndrome where the second half is less interesting than the first. Still this a real product of its time it has De Funs it has baby boomers it has twist it has St Tropez and even a nod to Gnral De Gaulle at the end it is one of the most emblematic movies of the 60's with one of the most emblematic actors and for all the budget it took it was the most successful movie of the year with more than 7 million viewers not bad?".

This is based on a true story and the 13 and 0 record really happened so this true story was what created the predictable film stereotype. I love the choice of actors in the film. Each person seems to be able to tap in to the feelings of their character which creates a much more realistic film. It depicts the nature of racism within peoples lives very well and shows how common loves for different things can pull people together so that simple and wrong beliefs are forgotten. Needless to say this film makes me feel better about the world while making me want to be a winner as well.".

Herman Boone has to bring blacks and whites together for a highschool football team to play with each other. Of course it's the 70's and racism is still rampant. I love the message that people will mesh anyway despite outside complications. Julius' and Gerry's relationship was really profound and special. It crossed a lot of lines. Denzel was remarkable as Coach Boone. He took no crap yet was scared to lose his position underneath. There was tension everywhere and it worked for the film. The players were really memorable to me. Blue Rev Sunshine Petey and Louie Lastik were adorable and hilarious. A great ensemble cast effort. The guy who played Yoast was good as well because he had to learn to overcome prejudices he had that he never knew he did. Even better was the fact that it's a true story which makes it all the more sweet. I watch this movie over and over and can practically say every line by heart. Great great film. The Titans really were greater than the gods of Greek myth and these guys were greater than any stereotype.".

	schema:reviewBody "By looking at REMEMBER THE TITANS you are probably saying oh geeze another football movie.  How can this one be any better than the last one?  The only good recent football film is RUDY.  Well after seeing this film you'll be taken by surprise just like I was.In 1971 in Alexandria Virginia the town's high school football team the T.C. Williams Titans are very popular.  T.C. Williams High School current football coach Coach Yoast Will Patton is nominated for high school Hall of Fame.  But a few weeks before the start of the school year a white store owner shoots and kills a black man who was suspected in stealing a product.  This causes a racial seperation between blacks and whites in Alexandria.  Then just before the start of the football season Coach Yoast gets demoted to Assistant Coach in place of Coach Boone Denzel Washington. What's bad is that Boone is black and Yoast is white.  Most of the town's residents are angry and even some of the players are willing to ruin their football career's to quit the team to make a statement.  But at the start of football camp Coach Boone won't take any racial diversity.  Boone treats all of his players equally he has his football camp practices appear to be a mixture between boot camp and group sessions.  If the player misses catching a football he has to run a mile.  If the player doesn't know anything about the person of the opposite color that they are rooming with they have homework to get to know one another.  With this it creates a special bond between these men.  Men who act more mature and humane unlike most of the residents of Alexandria.  But when Coach Boone and Coach Yoast prove that the Titans are a winning team the issue of race is erased and the true meaning of teamwork is born.The way to make a great sports movie is to have it be adapted from a true life story.  Like PRIDE OF THE YANKEES HOOSIERS and RUDY all are films that show that what appears to be a sport is the true triumph of the human spirit.  I really did enjoy the characters in the film since they are factual they have very humanistic qualities.  While one loves to hum Ain't No Mountain High Enough another gets excited while listening to Act Naturally.  And although you can guess what happens in the end you don't care.  You enjoy and like the character's so much that you are cheering for them.I highly enjoyed the acting in this film.  I think if Denzel Washington should get his long overdue Oscar for Best Actor it should be for this film.  He teaches his team that black or white these men are a team and that the only way to win is teamwork.  Washington gives a bravura performance that it will stun the people who think that Washington usually plays racist roles.  I also enjoyed Will Patton a lot he's not playing the cliche coach who gets demoted and wants to ruin the new head coach. Instead he understands the message that Boone is giving to the team that he helps as much as he can to help the team succeed.  I thought Patton's role is the best assistant coach role that I have seen since Dennis Hopper's role in HOOSERS.  And the football players are also great the ones I thought stood out were  Preston Brant Jerry Buck the team's captain Donald Adensun Petey the team's runningback Kip Perdue Sunshine the team's quarterback Craig Kirkwood Rev the team's defense player and Ethan Suplee Lastik the team's leading defense and by his size he should be!  I was glad to see Suplee change his roles in his career.  The last time I remember seeing him he was the vicious skinhead along with Edward Norton and Patrick Furlong in AMERICAN HISTORY X.  In REMEMBER THE TITANS he's the exact opposite he's the first white player who makes friends with the black players!!!Director Boaz Yakin and producer Jerry Bruckheimer should be commended for this film.I am pleased to see Jerry Bruckheimer made a really enjoyable and intellectual film which is the complete opposite of the type of films that he's famous for.  In fact I think this is the first one intellectual film Bruckheimer has made! The message that it sends out is really powerful and if it doesn't convince you to change then you are probably dead.  And director Boaz Yakin does a fantastic job with this film that along with Cameron Crowe Wolfgang Petersen and Ridley Scott he should be nominated best director.This is quite a film in fact I think this is the best football movie that I have ever seen!  I really really enjoyed this film and as I left it led me to believe in the message that this film was sending to it's audience. And this being only PG and put out by Walt Disney Pictures I would love to see both junior high schools and high schools to show this film to it's students.  If they did then chances are the violence in schools will go down.  And it took Jerry Bruckheimer Boaz Yakin and Walt Disney Pictures to do it.  Great job guys!  Don't miss this enjoyable film!  out of five".

Remember The Titans is laced with strong performances from Will Patton Ryan Hurst Wood Harris Donald Faison and Greg Alan Williams.Based on a true story Remember The Titans follows the 1971 T.C. Williams High School Titans football team and their struggles with integration. Washington is Herman Boone who has run up against racism after he has been brought in to coach the Titans. Patton is Bill Yoast the man Boone replaced as head coach. Washington and Patton are just two pieces of the puzzle which makes Remember The Titans a real gem. However the strength and real beauty of Remember The Titans does not come from Washington or Patton but the Titan football players because they are the ones who give the strongest performances in the film.I must say that the best performance of the whole movie other than Washington and Patton is the young actress who portrayed Bill Yoast's daughter Hayden Panitierre. In Remember The Titans this young actress single handidly made it worth watching this film. Her talent shines through and her presence on screen is as fresh as the daily air furthermore every time she is on screen she sparkles. It is so pleasurable to see talent like this being discovered.I hesitated to see Remember The Titans because I didn't want to see another football film but it is more than just another football film.Remember The Titans is a special film that has special performances and is well worth every dollar you spend to rent this film.".

	schema:headline " Exceptional movie";
	schema:reviewBody "Being a former white athlete and coach I am sick of sports movies where the story involves a team eventually winning a championship so I passed this one by when it first came out. Big mistake!! Like Hoosiers this one was an exception and what an exception. Remember the Titans is in my top five movies of the past ten years. Denzel Washington as the coach gave another of his consistently outstanding performances.Like Hoosiers this is a true story and it is not just a story about sports but a strong story about race. I probably appreciated it more than most because of my background I connected to the movie. During the 1940s I attended schools which were well integrated and students of different races and cultures existed harmoniously. To a large degree it was because the high school had a very successful football program in which unlike almost all of the other schools minority athletes were welcome. In my junior year we went undefeated and won the State Championship and the team is still considered the best high school team of all time. The only time the team came close to defeat was in the State final when we played another well integrated team.Consequently the community while generally middle and upper class except for its minorities was well integrated. As a result although I knew racism existed I never encountered it in my community. But then I began to see its ugly head. First the AllAmerican end on our team a superb athlete was denied scholarships both to USC and Stanford because neither school accepted minorities. I had always wanted to go to USC but because of what USC did to my friend I turned down its offer of a scholarship the next year as I did to Stanford which I considered a snob school then as I do today.But my college was cut short when the Korean War began and I was in the service. I was sent to bases in the South and I spent much of the next thirteen years in the South witnessing how bad it was for the blacks and I was involved in the civil rights movement in the South which got me into a lot of trouble with my military superiors.During my tours in the South I became head coach of a football team at a Southern base. Filled with excollegiate stars and some pros we regularly played Division I colleges and universities. However because I had black players on my team I couldn't schedule games with any white southern colleges. Instead we scheduled one black college and several state universities in the midwest.Some critics have compared the summer camp at which Washington as Coach Boone brought the blacks and whites together as a team as like a Marine Boot Camp but everyone missed the subtlety of this. I went through Boot Camp at a time when the military was just integrating and we had southern blacks and whites as well as a mix of races from other parts of the country in my platoon as well as all classes. It didn't take very long for us to become as one unit. The first part of boot camp is sure hell and the reason for it is that it reduces everyone to the lowest common denominator of misery and you quickly learn that the only way to escape that misery is to work together. This is just the way Coach Boone made it work.What I liked about this movie is that it showed how all this played out. Most moviegoers today are not really aware of how bad racism was in 1971 but this movie illustrates it well. Even though the movie has a few corny moments and the actors playing the roles as football players look old for high school these faults are minimal and do not detract from the power of the film.".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILER Based on real events in 1971 where T.C. Williams High School a now hot bed integrated school becomes a beacon of unification via their mixed race football team.As is normally the case with films of this ilk it quickly comes to pass that certain artistic licence has been taken with the truth. In reality the issues of race integration and the near powderkeg atmosphere portrayed in the picture were long past their worst in Virginia 1971. However that should in no way detract from the thematics and truthful aspects of this Disney production. As is told in the film the Titans did have what became known as the perfect season whilst the bond formed between the black and white members most definitely existed. All told the film soars high as an inspirational piece not only for the mixed race community coming together plot's essential being but in the crucial tale of one Gerry Bertier.That this film urged me to seek out the story of Bertier is a testament to the power of film regardless of any sort of sentimental prodding from the film makers. It's hoped that this film also prompts newcomers to research further the topics within the story.The cast list is impressive Denzel Washington and Will Patton find instant chemistry as the head coaches thrust together by outside influences with both guys beautifully doing credit to the real life friendship that would be born from the situation. Ryan Hurst Wood Harris Ethan Suplee Donald Faison Kip Pardue Craig Kirkwood and a prefame Ryan Gosling fill out the integrated football team. With two important family roles nicely portrayed by Hayden Panettiere and Nicole Ari Parker. The soundtrack is nicely put together with the core offering of Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell's thumping rendition of Ain't No Mountain High Enough particularly potent and uplifting. Though not primarily offering up anything new in the pantheon of race and sport related movies Remember The Titans does have so much good going for it. It's hard to be picky even churlish about the little faults are these actors really the age of high schoolers for example?. So hopefully come the end after the credits roll you will be suitably inspired and perhaps a touch more better off for having spent time with this particular football team. 8.510".

You would figure that it'll be a nice little picture since it comes from the Walt Disney Company and I think it's perfect for the whole family. Remember the Titans is a comedydrama based on the true story of a high school in Virginia that is integrated with white and black students white and black teachers and white and black athletic coaches. Oscar winner Denzel Washington gives another one of his fine performances as the new head coach of the high school football team and Will Patton is equally good as the current head coach who is now demoted to assistant coach under Washington. Together they try to get their players of both races to get along and put on a winning team. In addition to Washington and Patton there are some other terrific performances by the young actors who portray the football players. I see some future stars here. The movie has plenty of dramatic moments with some delightful comedy thrown in the middle of it. It obviously gets a little predictable towards the end which keeps Remember the Titans from being a perfect movie. But so what? This is a sports movie and usually sports movies almost always ends with the big game. Who's going to win that big game? I won't say who wins the big game in Remember the Titans but in the end you'll be rooting for the Titans to win win win! And that's all that matters. Bottom line Remember the Titans is an excellent film very well made and very well acted by everyone involved.12 out of four".

	schema:headline " I remember";
	schema:reviewBody "Although it was quite a few years ago when I watched Remember the Titan the first time I do remember how good it is. When it came on TV I wouldn't want to miss it even when it came with the commercial interruptions. It was just as good the second time around and there are new discoveries. For example the first time I saw it Ron Gosling The Believer Murder by Numbers The Notebook had not yet proved to be such a good actor.What attracted me to the movie was the football set around the time Joe Nameth took the Jet's through its most glorious season in snatching the Superbowl from the heavily favoured Baltimore Colts. But this is college football. In the movie in a vital game when the opponents tried a shotgun someone in the Titans quipped Who do they think they are? The New York Jets? While the movie seems to concentrate on the Titan's defence it was just a little before the time when the Minnesota Viking's defence the purple gang became legendary. But then the Titans set an example for the NFL to follow they had a perfect season a feat the Miami Dolphins repeated in the NFL a few years later.But this is more than football. It is a wonderful movie about racial harmony uplifting feelgood and touching. As one commenter so beautifully puts it let the cynics sit out on the sidelines on this one and groan about clichs and all that. This is a movie that will warm your heart and don't let futile vanity cheat you out of enjoying it.Nor is the movie a fairy tale. It is based on a true story. It is also realistic.

	onyx:emotionText "Although it was quite a few years ago when I watched Remember the Titan the first time I do remember how good it is. When it came on TV I wouldn't want to miss it even when it came with the commercial interruptions. It was just as good the second time around and there are new discoveries. For example the first time I saw it Ron Gosling The Believer Murder by Numbers The Notebook had not yet proved to be such a good actor.What attracted me to the movie was the football set around the time Joe Nameth took the Jet's through its most glorious season in snatching the Superbowl from the heavily favoured Baltimore Colts. But this is college football. In the movie in a vital game when the opponents tried a shotgun someone in the Titans quipped Who do they think they are? The New York Jets? While the movie seems to concentrate on the Titan's defence it was just a little before the time when the Minnesota Viking's defence the purple gang became legendary. But then the Titans set an example for the NFL to follow they had a perfect season a feat the Miami Dolphins repeated in the NFL a few years later.But this is more than football. It is a wonderful movie about racial harmony uplifting feelgood and touching. As one commenter so beautifully puts it let the cynics sit out on the sidelines on this one and groan about clichs and all that. This is a movie that will warm your heart and don't let futile vanity cheat you out of enjoying it.Nor is the movie a fairy tale. It is based on a true story. It is also realistic. The camp is an isolated environment where wonderful things can be made to happen. The kids themselves understand this when the come back to the real world as one puts it. But then through determination and good will they bring these wonderful things into the real world. Finally anything with Denzel Washing in it is worth watching.";

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is more extremely annoying. In 1971 I was in 10th grade at WashingtonLee High School in Arlington County Virginia. We were about 5 miles from T. C. Williams Titans and we played them regularly in every sport including track which was my sport. I have personal knowledge of the events in that film. First of all the idea that T. C. Williams had just been integrated is incorrect. Schools in the area had been integrated for 15 years. By 1971 it was routine to have blacks and whites in the same school. Come look at my yearbooks and I'll show you. What happened at T. C. Williams was this the Alexandria school system decided to change the status of three schools..........Hammond HS George Washington HS and T. C. Williams HS. Hammond was reduced to a junior high and its students were sent to Williams. GW was closed and its students were sent to Williams. Everyone in the ENTIRE AREA knew that Alexandria had just created a super sports school and it was true. With the best athletes from three schools combined into one there was no beating T. C. Williams. We played them in football that year and they beat us about 490 but it sure as hell had nothing to do with integrating a school and everything about creating a super school. Next the idea that Alexandria was a small backward town with rampant racial prejudice is laughable. Alexandria is a MAJOR suburb of Washington DC. You can stand in Alexandria look across the Potomac River and see the Washington Monument Capitol Hill Lincoln Memorial Jefferson Memorial etc. It was and is a rich suburb of DC and racial prejudice was about as far from being mainstream as I am from marrying Miss America. In my school the white kids were afraid of the black kids. We didn't initiate fights we tried hard to avoid them but sometimes they were forced upon us by angry groups of students who roamed the halls and you sure as hell better look out if you didn't cringe to the side and let them pass. There is one scene in the movie where a white football coach calls the T. C. Williams coach a monkey on local TV. Good Lord.........that sort of thing would NEVER have been put on a Washington DC sports channel and that is where ALL the channels received in northern Virginia originated with the exception of channel 20 which had no news at that time. The people who made this movie had an agenda. I know the facts. I was there. I ran track in that T. C. Williams stadium and they beat the hell out of us because they were a super school. It is both sad and annoying that people will watch this movie and believe that how things are portrayed is actually how they were. They absolutely were not!".

	schema:reviewBody "Tossing it out there like a football this sport movie produced by Jerry Bruckheimer isn't really much about football but preaching against racism. Inspired by real events the movie starts out with a new football coach of the TC Williams High School Titans Herman Boone Denzel Washington must put a newly desegregated school football team together. He faced pressure from a staff and town not yet ready to be racial diversity. Denzel Washington portrays Boone as a hardass man. Most of the scenes we hardly see him lightly up. He puts his team of real life athletes made out of yet famous oncoming actors through the grinder through football camp. Look out for Donald Faison Ethan Suplee and Ryan Gosling all new whom gone off to bigger and better roles. This team is lead by team captains Gerry Bertier Ryan Hurst of 'Son of Anarachy' fame and Julius Campbell Wood Harris or as they are mostly known as Main White Guy and Main Black Guy. After returning from football camp Boone is told by a member of the school board that if he loses even a single game he will be fired. Not only that but there is hatred for him replacing long favorite coach Bill Yoast Will Patton. Note to audience look out for a really young Hayden Panettiere playing his tomboy football fan daughter. Bill decides he wants move on to other coaching opportunities. In a show of respect and in an attempt to ease racial tension Boone offers an assistant coaching position to Yoast. Yoast at first refuses Boone's offer but is then tempted to join after the white players pledge to boycott the team if he doesn't participate. Dismayed at the prospect of the students losing their chances at scholarships Yoast changes his mind. Subsequently the Titans must go through the season undefeated while battling racial prejudice. The movie has a good message but it's so predictable and formulaic. It's always there to remind you that racism is bad. Sometimes the movie can be a little bit too preachy. The longsuffering heroic black players are all portrayed as decent if understandably angry given the atmosphere of overt hostility but with few flaws that might flesh out or sully their characters' purity as symbols in the civil rights struggle. The white players on the other hand range from the villainous to the buffoonish to the saintly. You see this time after time in Hollywood movies before and after. It's become too much of the same. The film also suffers from historically inaccurates and fabrications substories while it's doesn't hurt the film at all it shines some reallife characters in a bad light or misleading such as Bertier's girlfriend being racist and Ronald 'Sunshine' Bass being bi or gay. The people of Alexandria were rarely racist at all but also sophisticated and multicultural at the time as the streets were suburbs rather than a small isolated town picture in the film. I'm not saying there wasn't racial tension but not in what they made picture in the film. One of the worst thing about the film is the third act and ending the film goes off into 'Win one for the gipper' mode to demonstrate the essence of the film that despite differences the team was united and the legacy of the monumental alloutvictory football season carried on. Rather than ending the film at the final game the film leaves the audience in a sournote by explaining what happen to one of their team members 10 years later. The epilogue reveals what many of the Titans are doing today was kinda cheesy. The film does a great job on the use of music both in film score composer in Trevor Rabin 'Titan Spirit' which is epic and the use of popular music of the day such as Ain't No Mountain High Enough of Marvin Gaye  Tammi Terrell  'Na Na Hey Hey Goodbye Steam. All three songs has been associated for years after this movie with the Titans. Most known those tunes by this movie. The movie is a family friendly movie. So check it out and remember the titans.".

The problem with all these movies is that while they may have gotten the very general details correct character names opponent mantres era costumes etc. all these films fail where it really counts character dialogue and story.Set in a 1971 D.C. suburb and starring Denzel Washington who really had gotten long in the tooth at this point in his career! plays yet another typical inyourface takenojunk proud black man a hodgepodge of pretty much all the characters he had played up to that point in his career and it's annoying! Virtually all the characters in REMEMBER THE TITANS including Washington are all onedimensional and clich. The ever reliable Will Patton does his best to overcome a thankless role as the white assistant coach that Washington's character deposes and pretty much runs over for the entire movie! of course Patton's character turns out to be a closet liberal and completely understanding of the man who took HIS job from him! Hayden Pannietierre as Patton's annoyingly spunky and supersmart daughter certainly shows talent for a child actor at the time but what kid in the history of the world has ever acted like this?! Then you have a bunch of nameless onenote footballers and assistant coaches of both races who somehow learn to LOVE each other! The absolutely most annoying character was that fauxgay transfer surfer dude from California who is one of the weirdest characters ever to grace the movie screen!The only tolerable characters in the film are played by Ryan Hurst and Wood Harris as the prospective leaders of the white and black players and help bring them all together.

In real life which this movie is supposed to be based on even post 60s 1971 to be exact I find it hard to believe that opposite races would have hated each other so vehemently at the start of the film only to end up getting along so famously by the end of it especially on a team that was literally FORCED to be together!".

It was a joke to play TC in any varsity team sport football basketball soccer... it didn't matter. Everyone knew that a school three times their size was going to destroy us  the only question was how badly. They were never ever an underdog in any sport  to suggest otherwise is absolute bunk.To add insult to injury they changed the name of our team from the Tigers to the Lions because they felt that Tigers was too close to Titans and they depicted us as backwater hicks... which was laughable since Groveton served Hollin Hills the most intellectual and progressive community in the entire DC area as well as other uppermiddle class neighborhoods filled with career government professionals.The problem of course is that Hollywood dreck like this becomes gospel to those who have no knowledge of the actual events. Rather than accept moral responsibility to make a film based on real life events reflect the truth they purposefully pervert it to satisfy their biased fantasy and obliterate the historical record.I wish I could give this grossly insulting film a negative rating to help make up for those who have embraced it as heartrending truth given that they know nothing about the events it claims to document.".

They were never ever an underdog in any sport  to suggest otherwise is absolute bunk.To add insult to injury they changed the name of our team from the Tigers to the Lions because they felt that Tigers was too close to Titans and they depicted us as backwater hicks... which was laughable since Groveton served Hollin Hills the most intellectual and progressive community in the entire DC area as well as other uppermiddle class neighborhoods filled with career government professionals.The problem of course is that Hollywood dreck like this becomes gospel to those who have no knowledge of the actual events. Rather than accept moral responsibility to make a film based on real life events reflect the truth they purposefully pervert it to satisfy their biased fantasy and obliterate the historical record.I wish I could give this grossly insulting film a negative rating to help make up for those who have embraced it as heartrending truth given that they know nothing about the events it claims to document.";

	schema:reviewBody "Rememmber the Titans is a wonderful film compelling compassionate funny and often moving. It tells the story of a dedicated coach seen tackling the explosive combination of football and racial desegregation in 1970s America. The film is quite ambitious but it not only really does pack an emotional punch but it does linger long into the memory and is several notches above sports movies I have seen. For one thing it is slickly directed by Boaz Yakin and benefits also from wonderful cinematography and a music score of sweeping grandeur almost epic. Even better than any of these put together is the marvellous lead performance of Denzel Washington that was worth an Oscar it seems as though in every film I've seen of his he manages to give a compelling performance and this includes the underrated Cry Freedom. Will Patton matches him perfectly in a smooth quiet and perhaps low key performance as his counterpart that isn't at all clichd. Hayden Pannetiere also gives a fine performance even though I didn't see how her character would ever overcome her differences with her sister. The script is extremely sharp and decisive the editing is crisp and fast and the football parts are enough to pump up your adrenaline. The epilogue could bring tears to your eyes as it is so beautifully put. All in all wonderful film. 910 Bethany Cox".

Not all black people break into song every few minutes of their lives.2. Not all white people listen to country music.3. All state championships are not won on the final play.4. A team would not be running the ball with 20 seconds left in a game risking a fumble. They would have just taken a knee and the game would be over.5. There were more than 8 songs released in the 1970's. Apparently Hollywood never got that memo.6. The little girl. Enough said.7. The transformation of the Gerry character happened way too fast to make it realistic. Over the course of a 2 week football camp he went from telling the coach he didn't need any of them on the defense to being the main guy who brought the races together.8. Even without knowing the real story you could see the car accident coming light years away.9. No football team would ever just throw guys into a game on defense in the 2nd half of the state championship game who had never played on defense previously.10. Awesome waste of Kate Bosworth. Now that you've won some football games with both black and white players I'm willing to shake your hand Julius. If only she had gone to the training camp. Then she'd understand it all so much better.11. Let's throw in a California hippie to show that white people can be discriminated against too. The audience will never see that coming.12. We're supposed to believe that the Sunshine character would actually doubt whether he should go into the game because he can't throw an option pitch?? 13. Way too many impassioned speeches about being perfect and this being our time. I was afraid they might run out of music to score these scenes.14. Love the slow clap and standing ovation for Gerry's mother. Of course the TV commentators would announce when she enters the stadium as well. By the way did they really televise high school state championship games in 1971? 15. Ryan Gosling's character giving up his spot to Petey because Petey's just better coach.16. This whole racism thing is important and all but I really wanted to make the Virginia high school sports hall of fame. Now that's some big time stuff right there.17. Let's use the white coach's trick play on the last play to show just how far these two men have come so they're winners in life as well as on the field.18. Apparently every time a new player comes into a game he makes a game changing great play within the first two plays that he's in there propelling the team to an easy victory.19. Darn those crazy backup quarterbacks. They'll getcha every time. Can we see a movie where the starting QB gets hurt and the season goes to hell because the backup QB sucks? There's your reality.20. And finally what a great message the movie gives by showing how winning football games is the solution to all the world's problems. Want to end racism? Just win some football games.".

It's in the North the South and everywhere overseas. Prejudice is counterproductive and ugly. This movie sort of pretends to rise above it. It's a feel good movie in some respects. While racism is at the center of the film the answers are just a little too pat. It's just a little too easy. Granted it's just a movie but I wish it got a little more down and dirty. A trip to a training camp out of town and a lecture on the Gettysburg battlefield just wouldn't do it. Some of these kids are going to hold onto stuff their parents have driven into them a lot longer than this. Now all that said I still enjoyed the film. The characterizations of Coach Boone and Coach Yoast are well drawn. They are both good men who love their players. They are both excellent role models. And the players and the game scenes are believable although I am getting tired of every hit on the field sounding like a Buick hitting a concrete wallthis is happening in most football movies. The growth of Gary and the Rev is nicely done and we hope that it really happened that way. I enjoyed the two white guys who just kind of matter of factly walked into practiceSunshine and Louiswho just wanted to play football. There are some kids out there who don't think about race very much. They are pretty naive but they are charming. I loved when Louis hugged Coach Boone and told him he was going to college. That's a nice touch. I could go on but others have said so much already. It's a good action movie with nice human characters. It just gets a little simplistic at times and it needs to answer for that.".

	schema:reviewBody "You've got to wonder about wrestlers. They're always on the road they're always carrying knocks and injuries they don't get paid much except the few at the absolute top they get no respect from the public at large they don't actually compete in the legitimate sense of the word and the vast majority of them are quickly forgotten. Yet nearly all of the wrestlers in Beyond the Mat continue to seek the spotlight. Why? I guess Terry Funk sums it up best It's fun.However it's a strange type of fun. After all I'm not sure that most people would class being hit over the head with steel chairs as 'fun'. Nor would most people relish the thought of being thrown off a steel cage. But as the film points out wrestlers are hardly normal. At the same time though they're still people. They have the same problems as all of us. It's just that they earn their living by running around in spandex and by beating the crap out of one another.Of all the different strands in Beyond the Mat I like the Terry Funk section the most. It just shows how bizarre wrestling is. Here you have a man in his fifties who has degenerative arthritis and who wakes up in the morning like many old men in his yfronts. Yet in the ring he's a bloodthirsty maniac. But at the same time he's a loving father who cries at his daughter's wedding and he has an excellent rapport with the man who he has his most brutal matches with. As dimwitted as wrestling is nothing out of the ring is simple.And the Funk section illustrates the problem that most wrestler face they can't give up the spotlight. I mean just take one of Funk's friends Dennis Stamp. He hasn't wrestled in years but he still trains by jumping up and down on a trampoline in his underwear in the vain hope of getting another match. And when he's finally made the referee in Funk's 'retirement' match he's beside himself with excitement at the prospect of being part of the main event. It seems like when you don't get paid much when you're forced to do lousy jobs and when no one really knows who you are the only compensation for such a depressing existence is a few cheers.But although the film touches upon the dark side of wrestling it's quite touching seeing Funk trying to persuade his friend Stamp to be part of his match. The man may be vicious in the ring but outside it he's warmhearted. And I like the way that when he persuades his friend to be part of his match and when he walks away he nearly trips over. Despite everything he's just a lovable old guy. However I also like the scene because Stamp is such a fool. He's so desperate to be someone and so desperate to be recognised that he cuts a promo when he's explaining why he can't make the event I'm not booked!. It's as if reality and wrestling are blurred. He can't tell them apart.Another wrestler who's been messed up by the business is Jake Roberts. He doesn't get on with his daughter and he's forced to pay for his drug habit by wrestling in fourthrate events in backwater towns. He's even filmed urinating into a bucket and then falling asleep backstage. It really does give a depressing picture of what it is to be a professional wrestler  your existence revolves around the road run down hotels and small towns. No wonder so many of them are screwed up. But Roberts has even more reason to be screwed up than most. He's the product of a rape and his sister was kidnapped and murdered. And he has a terrible relationship with his father. They can barely look at one another. There's no connection there at all. And it's quite shocking hearing Roberts describe how he gave up his dreams just to shove wrestling down his father's throat his dad was a wrestler and Robert's resolved to be better than him. Suddenly you can see why Robert's created such a compelling character. He was just drawing on his own life. Again reality and wrestling is blurred.Perhaps the only one in the film that has a decent handle on things is Mick Foley. He has a clear plan he wants to retire by the age of 35 and he has a solid family to support him. Somehow you know that he's going to be fine. Not that there aren't a few bumps on the way. In one scene he's forced to watch footage of his wife and kids screaming when he's repeatedly hit over the head with a steel chair. It's a real wakeup call. I mean as entertaining as it is for sadistic bastards like myself you just can't make you family endure that time after time. But it's his family that will keep Foley on the straight and narrow. However for the other wrestlers who don't have stable personal lives they'll have to seek love in cheers and applause. It seems like wrestling is a drug that most wrestlers can't crack.Not that a few don't try. There's an amusing scene when a wrestler called New Jack who has four justifiable homicides auditions for a Hollywood casting agent. The people there are slimy beyond belief. They make the carnies in wrestling look honest in comparison.But why the film succeeds so emphatically is because everything is just presented as it is. No judgements are made and nobody is looked down upon. Yeah wrestling may be something on the fringes of society but the film shows that as weird as it is the people aren't really that weird after all. They're just people with the same problems we all have.".

	onyx:emotionText "You've got to wonder about wrestlers. They're always on the road they're always carrying knocks and injuries they don't get paid much except the few at the absolute top they get no respect from the public at large they don't actually compete in the legitimate sense of the word and the vast majority of them are quickly forgotten. Yet nearly all of the wrestlers in Beyond the Mat continue to seek the spotlight. Why? I guess Terry Funk sums it up best It's fun.However it's a strange type of fun. After all I'm not sure that most people would class being hit over the head with steel chairs as 'fun'. Nor would most people relish the thought of being thrown off a steel cage. But as the film points out wrestlers are hardly normal. At the same time though they're still people. They have the same problems as all of us. It's just that they earn their living by running around in spandex and by beating the crap out of one another.Of all the different strands in Beyond the Mat I like the Terry Funk section the most. It just shows how bizarre wrestling is. Here you have a man in his fifties who has degenerative arthritis and who wakes up in the morning like many old men in his yfronts. Yet in the ring he's a bloodthirsty maniac. But at the same time he's a loving father who cries at his daughter's wedding and he has an excellent rapport with the man who he has his most brutal matches with. As dimwitted as wrestling is nothing out of the ring is simple.And the Funk section illustrates the problem that most wrestler face they can't give up the spotlight. I mean just take one of Funk's friends Dennis Stamp. He hasn't wrestled in years but he still trains by jumping up and down on a trampoline in his underwear in the vain hope of getting another match. And when he's finally made the referee in Funk's 'retirement' match he's beside himself with excitement at the prospect of being part of the main event. It seems like when you don't get paid much when you're forced to do lousy jobs and when no one really knows who you are the only compensation for such a depressing existence is a few cheers.But although the film touches upon the dark side of wrestling it's quite touching seeing Funk trying to persuade his friend Stamp to be part of his match. The man may be vicious in the ring but outside it he's warmhearted. And I like the way that when he persuades his friend to be part of his match and when he walks away he nearly trips over. Despite everything he's just a lovable old guy. However I also like the scene because Stamp is such a fool. He's so desperate to be someone and so desperate to be recognised that he cuts a promo when he's explaining why he can't make the event I'm not booked!. It's as if reality and wrestling are blurred. He can't tell them apart.Another wrestler who's been messed up by the business is Jake Roberts. He doesn't get on with his daughter and he's forced to pay for his drug habit by wrestling in fourthrate events in backwater towns. He's even filmed urinating into a bucket and then falling asleep backstage. It really does give a depressing picture of what it is to be a professional wrestler  your existence revolves around the road run down hotels and small towns. No wonder so many of them are screwed up. But Roberts has even more reason to be screwed up than most. He's the product of a rape and his sister was kidnapped and murdered.

	schema:reviewBody "I've seen this movie a few times and as a wrestling fan for over 20 years I was glad to see a movie that showed a glimpse of what goes on behind the scenes. Blaustien does an amazing job and it was no surprise that it was seriously being considered for an Academy Award nomination sadly it never ended up being actually nominated.Wrestling fans have had to defend their love of the art of pro wrestling for many years. When the topic would come up that I am a wrestling fan I would be faced with the same idiotic question with a tone of disbelief in their voice You know it's fake right?. My response has always been to follow that question with And what is your favourite TV show? I usually get an answer like Friends or something similar and I then mockingly explain to them that Rachel and Ross never dated and Monica and Chandler are not really married and that that isn't even their real names. Soon they began to see the stupidity of their proclaiming that wrestling is fake. Whew sorry kind of went on a rant there.Blaustien's film allows non wrestling fans to see exactly how fake wrestling can be. The blood sweat and hard work that these athletes and their families endure is vividly shown. We finally see a human side of the often larger than life characters that these men and women of the squared circle portray.One thing that I found very profound was the drab dark and gloomy colours Blaustein used in segments showing that human side as opposed to the colourfulness of the slick production of the athletes performing. We go from the glamorous pyro and bright lights of a live Pay per View event to shots of the wrestlers in their concrete black and white dirty and sweaty dressing rooms. I don't know if the director did this on purpose but I thought it was quite effective.Bottom line this movie is a must for any fan of wrestling but I feel it is even more important to the nonwrestling fan interested to see why all these people watch this fake form of entertainment.".

It showed us another side to Jake Robertsthe human side who has sacrificed a lot to become a wrestler including family.This is a thought provoking movie which helps remind us that wrestlers are human after all and that they spend a lot of time away from their loved ones putting their bodies on the line purely to keep us entertained.

The much younger Mick 'Mankind' Foley is a creation of the media driven World Wrestling Federation a syndication leap years away from the Amarillo Texas of Terry Funk.  The deeply hurting Jake the Snake has fought so many battles in his long and troubled life that his only solace is crack cocaine and fighting in the ring.  But the blood that Funk and Mick and Jake spill is the same blood of wanton brutality.  It is the spectacle of harm and harming others.  And yet in a cruel and twisted way Beyond the Mat reminds us that wrestlers are as normal as anyone just different.  'Mankind' and 'The Rock' can talk pleasantries before a match  before each tries to pulverize the other in front of their stunned wives and children.  Terry Funk as a gesture of forgiveness repeatedly begs an old nemesis to referee his supposedly final match  a match in which he knows he will lose and will get brains bashed in.  Beyond the Mat' is a well made chronicle of wrestlers who care less if they win or lose the promoters see to that but more on how they play the game.".

	schema:headline " The Two Sheds Review Beyond The Mat  Film Review";
	schema:reviewBody "It's been about six years since what is regarded as the best wrestling documentary was released. Director Barry Blaustein spent three years travelling up and down the highways of America in an attempt to find out what the wrestling business is really about. The end result was the compelling and controversial Beyond the Mat.Even six years after it's release Beyond the Mat makes compelling viewing even if it's just to see how the lives and careers of those documented in the film have progressed. For some a great deal has changed while for others time has more or less stood still.For me the three main focuses of the film were Mick Foley Terry Funk and Jake Roberts. The scenes with Mick spending time with his wife and children were particularly compelling especially for those people who were only familiar with his sadistic inring characters Cactus Jack and Dude Love. As Blaustein himself comments Mick Foley is probably the sanest man in the history of professional wrestling. But the scenes during his Royal Rumble match with The Rock where his kids are in tears and his wife has to take them away from the action are both compelling and distressing at the same time.Then we have the legend that is Terry Funk as he helps launch Extreme Championship Wrestling onto a national stage with the company's first payperview Barely Legal before moving onto his retirement an emotional moment as he lost his final match to Bret Hart.Then there's Jake The Snake Roberts Blaustein's most vocal critic in what are possibly the most controversial segments of the film. Jake's story is a tragic one of his battles with drug addiction and of his strained relationships with his father and daughter. While watching the tearful reunion with his daughter you get the feeling that Jake isn't being entirely truthful with himself and that this scene would have been better played out in private.But as I mentioned at the beginning of this piece it's interesting to see where some of the film's main players are now six years later.Mike Modest who received a WWF tryout during the film is still wrestling having achieved a great deal of success with Pro Wrestling NOAH in Japan.Shortly before the film was released Darren Drozdov was paralysed after an inring accident. Droz continues to make progress today but is still confined to a wheelchair.ECW signed a national television contract with TNN during the making of the film Two years later the company went bankrupt.Terry Funk's retirement was like his many other retirements shortlived and he continues to compete to this day at the age of 61.Jake Roberts continues to battle his personal demons. Having fallen foul of the law while living and working in Britain Jake returned to America this year appeared on Monday Night War and signed a merchandise deal with WWE. Rumour has it that Vince McMahon is personally paying for Jake's rehab treatment. In a shoot interview with Rob Feinstein five years ago Jake said he would be taking legal action against Blaustein because of his portrayal in the film but nothing ever came of this. Jake has been extremely critical of the director in numerous interviews he has given since the film's release.In conclusion Beyond the Mat is indeed compelling viewing and one of the best wrestling documentaries ever made on a par with Wrestling with Shadows. Barry Blaustein did a hell of a job portraying the wrestling business in a positive light. It's a hell of a film and one that any wrestling fan should make a permanent part of their collection.".

Roberts is a Sad Junkie who still does the small Curcuit.Funk is a near Cripple who is battling with himself and retirement and Mick Foley who is one WWF's top stars. What this film shows is that these people REALLY do get hurt badly even though the shows are staged and the fighters are good friends behind the scenes. As i was saying the only thing that exposes the WWF in any way in this film is that the fights are staged but we knew that anyway. Call me cinical but i would say this film was funded by Mcmahon to show that the fighters get hurt and the the bouts are a risk to the fighters giving the fans another reason to watch the pay per view. If you want to see a film that exposes the WWF better watch Brett HartFighting in shadows. 7 out of 10.".

We see Mick Foley get hit hard with a chair from the Rock when he was a bad guy while his kids and wife look on. His wife is in tears as she sees her husband take a beating.Anyone who says that wrestling is fake should try out for the WWF and see how fake it really is. After only a couple of minutes getting backdropped slammed and hit with a chair by these guys  I am sure you'll see it's not fakeas Hulk Hogan says its choreographed.The biggest controversy of the movie is when Vince McMahon corporate mogul and CEO of the WWF decided to have this movie pulled off during commercials of the WWF and to ultimately turn his back on the whole project. Thereby making this film an Independent Film since it would no longer receive any help from the WWF.Nevertheless Vince makes several cameos in this movie trying not to look like the greedy pig he really is.The timing of this movie is ironic only a couple of months before this movie came outBrett Hart would get screwed in his final match in Canada with Shawn Michaels then in late May his brother Owen would die in a freak accident where he would fall to his death in front of a capacity crowd in a WWF pay per view event that footage was edited out of the event.Recently November 2000 the Hart family made a settlement with the WWF for a whopping 18 million dollars for the lawsuit the Hart's filed against the WWF. The Hart's say they will use some of the money for charity. I can just see the smile on Vince McMahon's face go down right now  . Now On to the review.The film is excellent and is a must see for all you WWF fans. It is already out on DVD with extra footage not seen in theaters. EBAY currently has several auctions for it starting at 1020.A bargain for a really emotionalentertaining film.The Director Barry Blaustein who did some of the writing for the Nutty Professor has shown here that he can do drama as well as comedy.If you're kid is foolish enough of thinking of getting into wrestling you might want to show him this film it will definitely change their mind.Which is the other theme of this movie Wrestling is definitely something that is done by professionals.Kids don't try this at home".

	schema:headline " Skip Rourke's Wrestler Watch This Instead";
	schema:reviewBody "A few years ago I was very excited to watch Mickey Rourke's film The Wrestler. However upon viewing the film I was left feeling disappointed with the project but couldn't quite put my finger on why. After watching Beyond The Mat I now fully realize what that feature film was missing it the case of professional wrestling the truth is undoubtedly stranger and more compelling than fiction.For a basic summary of this documentary it focuses on four primary areas1. The independent or minor league pro wrestling circuit conducted in gyms and town VFW's across the nation.2. Jake The Snake Roberts former WWE superstar who now battles fierce demons smoking the bottle crack family troubles just to stay alive.3. Mick Mankind Foley a man with an unnerving pain threshold that while making it big worries about the effects his punishment may have on his children.4. Terry Funk a wrestling lifer who reflects upon his career in an insane business...the ECW.As a fan of professional wrestling WWE in particular this documentary really pulled at the heartstrings. Whereas the glitz glamour and pageantry all look great on screen the horrors and tribulations that often result from such antics gives one serious pause. Each one of those four stories showcases a different type of battle that professional wrestlers face and they are all very interesting.The Jake Roberts story is especially intriguing as it portrays a man so deeply conflicted about his past present and future that one wonders how a person could get so screwed up.Overall this is an incredible documentary that is well worth a watch if you have an interest in professional wrestling whatsoever.

	onyx:emotionText "A few years ago I was very excited to watch Mickey Rourke's film The Wrestler. However upon viewing the film I was left feeling disappointed with the project but couldn't quite put my finger on why. After watching Beyond The Mat I now fully realize what that feature film was missing it the case of professional wrestling the truth is undoubtedly stranger and more compelling than fiction.For a basic summary of this documentary it focuses on four primary areas1. The independent or minor league pro wrestling circuit conducted in gyms and town VFW's across the nation.2. Jake The Snake Roberts former WWE superstar who now battles fierce demons smoking the bottle crack family troubles just to stay alive.3. Mick Mankind Foley a man with an unnerving pain threshold that while making it big worries about the effects his punishment may have on his children.4. Terry Funk a wrestling lifer who reflects upon his career in an insane business...the ECW.As a fan of professional wrestling WWE in particular this documentary really pulled at the heartstrings. Whereas the glitz glamour and pageantry all look great on screen the horrors and tribulations that often result from such antics gives one serious pause. Each one of those four stories showcases a different type of battle that professional wrestlers face and they are all very interesting.The Jake Roberts story is especially intriguing as it portrays a man so deeply conflicted about his past present and future that one wonders how a person could get so screwed up.Overall this is an incredible documentary that is well worth a watch if you have an interest in professional wrestling whatsoever. If you watched Rourke's The Wrestler and came away wanting something more this little film will likely satisfy you.";

I don't think they've ever made a film quite like this before. There is quite a lot of ugly in it  and I can see why most people think the world is a dark place. Regardless of this it's a piece of wrestling history and it's important it was captured. Nice to see where everyone is now after almost 20 years later!! WWE is still going strong and there is just something in this sport that keeps on giving. I also get quite emotionally during some of the scenes with Foly and Jake  not easy to watch and borders on exploitative but again I think it's the time period it was made.

	schema:reviewBody "I'm a casual wrestling fan who's more interested in occasionally watching a YouTube clip out of nostalgia then in regularly following the sport. This documentary still was very compelling though because it examines some very fascinating and charismatic people. You don't need to know a thing about the business the narrator himself doesn't refer to the more technical aspects and the doc. doesn't resort to the sports movie clich of an athlete perfecting a move or style.The focus is primarily on several men who've achieved iconic status in wrestling. Their upbringing their current status in wrestling and the way they relate to family fans and other wrestlers. Terry Funk gets the lion's share of attention understandably so since he's a rare example of a wrestler performing capably well into middle age he was over 50 in the late 90's when this doc. was made. Funk helped pioneer a very gritty style. The fans grew to appreciate his spirit and skill he and his opponents don't get seriously hurt an essential part of being a good wrestler is making things look dangerous without getting hurt. Just the same the years of competing have taken their toll on both Funk's body a doctor says that he should barely be able to walk and his family's patience. We're presented with his farewell match in which he graciously loses to the younger but more famous Bret Hart only to be told near the documentary's end that Funk found the paycheck and the fan cheering too tempting as he made a comeback just 3 months after the B. Hart match.More haunting is Jake the Snake Roberts. An enigmatic figure with an unforgettable gimmick a python wrapped in a bag ready to be unleashed on frightened opponents his drug addiction and obviously stricken psyche have relegated him to the lowest level of wrestling. A performer known more for his personality than his athletic feats he still can mesmerize a crowd and build a good rapport with his opponent. Out of the ring he often speaks of the bleak loneliness of life on the road without any kind of steady relationships. We see him struggle through a meeting with his estranged daughter who fears that Jake will never fulfill his fatherly duties. Jake matter of factly relates his shocking background being conceived in a rape his sister being murdered among other things. Will he overcome these things? No way to tell especially after he goes on a drug binge and the concerned doc. crew can't find him.Amiable and somewhat spaced out Mick Foley is a rather odd case. A top level performer for the biggest wrestling company the WWF his gimmick of being a glutton for punishment has led to the company pushing him harder and harder eager to excite the fans and boost ratings. Foley himself encourages this push as we see youthful footage of Foley performing stunts. Bearded missing several teeth and with a thick mane of curls he seems much older than he really is. A doting husband and father of several young children it's quite distressing to watch his family endure a match in which Foley's head is lacerated open. In a postmatch haze Foley and the company boss reassure each other that the fans got what they wanted. Later on when Foley watches his family's reaction to the match he admits that for the first time he's concerned about his profession and the way it batters him. Unlike the majority of performers Foley went on to retire and stay retired at a fairly young age. Several successful autobiographical books helped him do it.We see shorter segments on other less notable performers. A black wrestler named New Jack with obvious tattoos and scars who brags about being violent goes to a Hollywood casting agency. We see him reciting a script with a male agent. Said agent enthusiastically praises New Jack. A woman agent is more grounded saying that New Jack might be better cast as a best friend type. Well have you seen New Jack in any big movies lately? A performer is signed by the WWF and given the gimmick of puke who is slated to be promoted based on his ability to vomit. Ultimately this didn't really go anywhere but the performer did go on to have moderate success as Droz an abbreviation of his real name. Liked by his peers his career was cut short after being paralyzed by a clumsy performer.Another study is two products of a California wrestling school which puts on amateurish shows. These two fellows are invited to perform and be evaluated at a WWF show. One is a soft spoken rather thin and young black wrestler. He's told by the WWF to upgrade his build and get a better costume. The other wrestler a very muscular and older white guy who is an airline mechanic when not pursuing his dream fares better. The WWF and the crowd likes his aggressive attitude and technical skill. We're not told if the WWF ever signed either one leaving us with uncertainty as is often the case in wrestling. The wrestling school manager tells students upfront that pay is minimal outside of the biggest promotions and few ever make it big.After examining the ups and downs of the business the director a lifelong fan of wrestling admits that he's still drawn to the spectacle but still can't explain why. Perhaps it's the sincere admiration that both crowds and performers have for the best competitors. The backstage footage of wrestler camaraderie and of the efforts put into shows by so many down to the crews that put rings together string up the lights and speakers and choreograph and evaluate the way that wrestlers are used are a testament to a thankless profession.".

These three will make up the bulk of the documentary time focus on them. Mick Foley aka Mankind Catcus Jack and Dude Love is a man on the top of his career famous for taking increasingly risky bumps Stunts whom family is worry about his safety. In one famous scene Mick Foley's family watching ring side is nearly put into tears after seeing their father and husband be beaten up by Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson at a WWE PPV 'Royal Rumble'. Mick can't see that the abuse he takes on his body is hurting his family. Another wrestler focus on is Terry Funk whom can't find himself retiring even with him being 53 years old at the time of shooting and past his prime. Terry Funk represent the man who would die in the ring rather than quit the business. A Randy 'The Ram' Robinson like personality whom just looking for the next big comeback. Lastly the film focus on a wrestler who is at his rock bottom. Jake 'The Snake' Roberts whom popularity height reach in the 1980's is now in the late 1990's a crack cocaine addict that estranged from everybody he call family. His daughter wants no part of him and his father doesn't want to speak to him. Yes there will be short knit bits of other wrestlers in the film such as short lived career puking Darren Drozdov the movie star dreaming New Jack and two wrestlers Tony Jones and Michael Modest trying to get a try out. The director spent three years endeavoring to understand the mindset of someone who would voluntarily choose to become a professional wrestler. Blaustein interviews a wide variety of wrestling personalities and ascertains their motivations. What the movie lacks is interviews with the big time wrestlers of the time Undertaker Stone Cold Steve Austin Triple H and The Rock. It would be nice to see what their take on the business is. Another problem with the film is while they were able to film both in Extreme Championship Wrestling and World Wrestling Federeration I felt that when World Championship Wrestling refused to participate in the film it really made the film missing opinions of those wrestlers. The interview questions could have been more driven to talking about more serious key issues dealing with prowrestling such as steroids wrestling union and the sense of faking violence. There are a couple of laughs in the movie but the overall effect is much more depressing than it is humorous. The selfmutilations in the movie might be hard to watch for nonwrestling fans. For the wrestling fans this is a must watch so check it out.".

	schema:reviewBody "Adult professional wrestling fans aren't stupid we know wrestling is fake and the outcomes are predetermined. What none fans don't realize is why we like it. It's the drama the pageantry the cheesy stories the costumes and most of all the action. Yes it's predetermined and choreographed but you still need to be charismatic and athletic and night after night these guys put their bodies on the line just for our entertainment. People have been killed and paralyzed doing this so to anyone who says it's not real and takes no skill I point to this documentary. Beyond The Mat looks into the lives of these guys outside the ring and show the ancient Terry Funk whose body has been ravaged from years in the ring. He can barely walk anymore but still has to get in there and has to do this because it's all he knows and what he loves. Jake The Snake Roberts is also featured and he talks about how eight years on the road with WWE and how it made him a neglectful father a bad husband and a drug addict. Roberts says between the pain and the constant moving around he could never have done it without drugs! Finally they look at Mick Foley AKA Mankind Dude Love Cactus Jack and show how he's this normal family man and while his family knows it's for show how much they worry. In the last 30 years hundreds of prowrestlers have died under the age of 45 most of them due to the physical trauma they've put their bodies through or the dependence on drugs that has resulted from it. If those were NFL or MLB stars instead there would be massive reform and congressional intervention but the truth is no one cares about these guys except of course their families friends and fans. Beyond The Mat is important because it shows just what these guys put on the line and just how little the people at the top care.".

I was a Wrestling Manager in several Outlaw shows in the mid90's...so I knew some of the inside...tricks and such. But this movie was so insightful. It was wonderful all around. The Terry Funk segment is great and The Jake Roberts section....will make you cry...and the Mick Foley segment will make you ask why over and over again. The flick was so great that I watched it twice in a matter of just a couple of days. The only thing that made it a 9 instead of a 10...was the fact...that in my assessment...it ran about 30 minutes too long....and drug in spots....but all in all...you've got to see it.".

It has excellent acting and production values and had me engrossed throughout. Though to a Serb it may seem at first that the film falls into the usual demonization of the Serbs actually all sides are portrayed as ready to commit terrible acts. This is true for the scene where the Croats are ready to force the actors to clear the mine field. They are saved only by the chance arrival of Serbian troops who then in turn force the Croats to clear the minefield. It is also true for the scene where the Serbian nationalist poet is taken prisoner by Muslim troops and we are given ample clues that he will meet a horrible end though this is not shown on screen. I am an American antiwar activist with ties to what for me will always be Yugoslavia not in agreement with the American bombing and not in agreement with savage nationalism either no matter whose nationalism it is.".

Markovic also wrote the script that is vaugely based on factual happenings.Naive halfmember troupe from Belgrade National Theater embarks on an dangerous tour through Serbian Krajina in Bosnia. The time is 1993 and there is bloody difficulty and abstract war between Serbs Croats and Muslims. Company's intention is to perform Feydeau's vaudveville A Flea in Her Ear and to reanimate unwilling and disastrought folk in little town Srbobran. But the situation soon gets worse and worse. In only three days the actors founds all horrors of Bosnian war.The whole story try's to explain this conflict from very essence of spirit of the art. For me this is by far most objective movie about civil wars in exYugoslavia. There is also very fine amalgam of comedy and tragedy for example we have ridiculously and burlesque moments when leader of the troupe Stanislav tries to assure Croat Commander that they are Croat actors and just few minutes later there is distressing and touching part with 'Panther' Leaders and actress Sonja in mined territory.The cast is superb. The great turn from main lead especial from Chaplinlike tragicomical Tihomir Stanic Stanislav and ingenuine thrilling Jelena Djokic Jadranka gratefully movie inventions. Other four players from the troupe Dragan Nikolic old charmer Misko Mira Furlan middleaged leading lady Sonja Josif Tatic tippler Zaki and Gordan Kicic young star Lale give us irresistible performances. There is also series of brilliant supports Slavko Stimac as Djuro pacifist driver Vojislav Brajovic as Ljubic fascist war firebrand Svetozar Cvetkovic as absentminded surgeon Bogdan Diklic as sharp cold hearted Croat Commander Sergej Trifunovic as violent and hot blooded 'Panther' Leaders and many many more.Watch this great antiwar movie and you'll probably understand Balkan conflicts better. But you'll also understand and take a liking to the actors too.".

	schema:reviewBody "I just came back from the cinema where I saw this film. I rarely go to the cinema but since this is our Oscar nominee I thought that it is worth watching. And I was right.Don't get me wrong. I saw this film tonight and hopefully never again. The plot is simple. A group of famous Belgrade Serbia actors come to Krajina Bosnia which is caught by a bloody war on a tour hoping to earn some quick cash. Through a series of unplanned events they end up on the front line face to face with all the horrors of war. They eventually run into all the sides involved in war Serbs Croats and muslims. This is what bugs me the most about this film. Although this is a Serbian film with Serbian actors except for Mira Furlan who probably did the best job the Serbs from Krajina are portrayed like a savage blood thirsty lynch mob. This is what hurts me the most. Although we are one nation the people from Serbia think of us as primitive barbarians especially most the people from Belgrade. While on the other hand Croats and Muslims are represented like most civilized. I'm not saying here that Serbs were better than them but the image shown here is just too harsh.Apart from that this movie has many realistic scenes like for example the fight between two Serbian military leaders which actually happened or the story about Muslim groups which fought each other. The film looks somewhat cheap at the times a couple of scenes look like they were dragged out of some home made video. Since this is supposed to be a comedy I can say that in that aspect the film delivers. It has enough laughs to keep you interested during the while film and a couple of scenes which will make you cry from laughter. But definitely the best feature of this film is Gordan Kii and his portrait of Lale. In my opinion the role of Lale is also the best written one. His points about the war and his cynic comments completely correspond with opinion of most of young people about the war although the scene where he shouts ''I'm not a Serb!'' is a bit too much for me. I also have to commend the performance of Aleksandar Stojkovic who did a good job.I don't believe that this film is a good choice for Oscar because if nothing else if you do not know many facts about the sides involved in the war you just won't be able to understand this film. It is no wonder that the world considers us to be savages when we alone represent ourselves in that light. Go see this film and if possible forget it soon. My grade is 510 mostly due to great Kii's performance.".

	schema:headline " Nevermind the war story this is terrible as a film";
	schema:reviewBody "If this film was made 10 years ago maybe it would have worked. If it was taped as a theater play maybe it would work. Made as a feature film it doesn't work in any way.For starters the production for this film looks terrible. It looks like a TV film most of the time. Direction is awful. Everything looks like it was shot in first take. Editing is often slow and often nonexistent too many shots that go nowhere. Cinematography is awful. Scenes are either overexposed in your face and without subtlety or underexposed boring and too subtle. It's like the camera was turned on and left running without anyone behind it. Everything looks gray lifeless and dull. Sound often cuts off or is completely unintelligible but this is a common problem in ex YU films.However all this wouldn't be so bad if the screenplay was any good in the first place considering who wrote it it had to be. Unfortunately screenplay and story are the biggest flaws in this film.First off the characters are incredibly stupid and completely stereotypical dumbass Belgradians in their high heals get to see what real horror is. However even that wouldn't be so bad if the characters ever had a chance to develop. Changes in them do come throughout the movie but they are obviously forced all of a sudden a character has learned a lesson. Even that could have worked if the characters weren't completely lifeless and if they ever got the chance to show their individuality. In the end the audience can't really care about any of them unless a cinemagoer likes a certain actor or actress. Actors and actresses do an awful job here. They are not even trying most of the time. Often they just look confused or they put on their serious acting expressions for a scene and then they go back to being idle again. Most of the characters here have no real purpose except to be used for a five minute scene at some point to force the stupid plot further. Plot is terrible from the start and then it gets worse and dumber by a minute gee our driver is off let's walk through a war zone in the middle of the night 'cause we can't wait for him. Also the movie can't make up it's mind if it is a character piece or a moral story. Dialogs in the movie show that there was an idea behind this mess but they are terribly executed most of the time and often just turn out stupid crude or unnecessary.This is a dark comedy but a fifteen yearold could write better jokes. a thirteen yearold probably wrote these. The war scenes that should teach us something are ridiculous superficial forced over the top or dull and pointless in your face instant morals get old pretty fast.There are only three saving graces here therefore the stars. One The first scene at Jackson's one time that character Lale is actually funny concluding with Ljubic's nationalistic poem. Two Jelena Djokic who actually tried to act out the ridiculous script. And three The noble effort with some good ideas to make an antiwar movie that somewhere along the lines went terribly stupid and wrong.This script should have been made ten years ago when it actually mattered like Bure Baruta a.k.a. The Powder Keg and when the crew was still in their top form. Unfortunately it got staled in the meantime and the crew with it.If you want a good forgoten antiwar ex YU film forget this mess and try Pun mesec nad Beogradom Full Moon Over Belgrade if you can find it.310".

Sound often cuts off or is completely unintelligible but this is a common problem in ex YU films.However all this wouldn't be so bad if the screenplay was any good in the first place considering who wrote it it had to be. Unfortunately screenplay and story are the biggest flaws in this film.First off the characters are incredibly stupid and completely stereotypical dumbass Belgradians in their high heals get to see what real horror is. However even that wouldn't be so bad if the characters ever had a chance to develop. Changes in them do come throughout the movie but they are obviously forced all of a sudden a character has learned a lesson. Even that could have worked if the characters weren't completely lifeless and if they ever got the chance to show their individuality. In the end the audience can't really care about any of them unless a cinemagoer likes a certain actor or actress. Actors and actresses do an awful job here. They are not even trying most of the time. Often they just look confused or they put on their serious acting expressions for a scene and then they go back to being idle again. Most of the characters here have no real purpose except to be used for a five minute scene at some point to force the stupid plot further. Plot is terrible from the start and then it gets worse and dumber by a minute gee our driver is off let's walk through a war zone in the middle of the night 'cause we can't wait for him. Also the movie can't make up it's mind if it is a character piece or a moral story. Dialogs in the movie show that there was an idea behind this mess but they are terribly executed most of the time and often just turn out stupid crude or unnecessary.This is a dark comedy but a fifteen yearold could write better jokes. a thirteen yearold probably wrote these. The war scenes that should teach us something are ridiculous superficial forced over the top or dull and pointless in your face instant morals get old pretty fast.There are only three saving graces here therefore the stars. One The first scene at Jackson's one time that character Lale is actually funny concluding with Ljubic's nationalistic poem. Two Jelena Djokic who actually tried to act out the ridiculous script. And three The noble effort with some good ideas to make an antiwar movie that somewhere along the lines went terribly stupid and wrong.This script should have been made ten years ago when it actually mattered like Bure Baruta a.k.a. The Powder Keg and when the crew was still in their top form. Unfortunately it got staled in the meantime and the crew with it.If you want a good forgoten antiwar ex YU film forget this mess and try Pun mesec nad Beogradom Full Moon Over Belgrade if you can find it.310";

The events are too contrived. The whole thing is theatrical rather than cinematic  it's filled with overacting acting and speaking for the last row rather than the lens music a tool of the filmmaker is barely used the story explains that war is complex and multidimensional but our characters are simple and onedimensional almost clichd. The cinematography is poor. There are very few if any establishing shots the whole thing is brown grey muddy. Indoors outdoors it's all the same. There are no interesting camera tricks moves or anything of modern film whatsoever. The script is not interesting enough to be read as a screenplay so why make a movie out of this? The lines let the actors down who did nothing to save this film. With music playing no part and the camera doing the very minimum and nothing more there's very little value in this film.The jokes are few and far between not enough to keep you laughing. It's also not absurd enough to hit that absurdic bone unlike Apocalypse Now or Pretty Village Pretty Flame.The production is quite poor more like Yugoslav films of the 80s than something made in 2008.The story is about a group of stage actors who go a war zone and discover that war zones are dangerous and terrible places to be. That's the synopsis and there's nothing to spoil because that's the whole film.I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.".

I don't know if it is his strategy or simply the guys from the commission simply didn't want to finance him all these years lets not forget that this films scenario was written like 20 years ago and only in 2007 it became reality. I have to admit that we are sick of seeing films about the Golden Era or directly made in the communist times. I don't mean 43 and 2 at all that's a great film made by a great director but I want to see more films made about the great times of our country if not the interwar period this story is placed perfectly before the First War or the Great War as they called it during and after it. And I don't mean maybe all of us all I mean us the youngthe ones that heard all those criminal stories from our parents of course its OK to see it on screen but where are those glory days of our Romanian Kingdom? Just seeing images that bring back to those times makes you feel different then seeing a secret service agent following you at night coming from a party a bit drunk and makes you see something else then the gray boxes and the House of People. The young Romanians need to take those times as an example. Of course it's a comedy after all but all we know is how Romanians were driving all Dacia 1310  proudly  hailing the leader and now after 1989 showing stories about the life then from another point of view an objective one. Back to the film the scene with the King is a very nice one if all communist showed was the Morometii when the peasants were laughing at the royals  romance by Marin Preda clearly influenced by the communists  now we can actually see people calling him Sir I was really surprised by that scene  probably at the Cotroceni Palace  maybe just because of rarity of such scenes with important leaders of our past. Even though its still a comedy it tries to represent a very important part of our history. The war for Independence against the Otoman Empire strongly supported by a leader  Carol I  witch wasn't even Romanian he was part of the Royal European family but dedicated his life to this country like nobody else of Romanian blood did in the last century. The young director who wants to do something new rather then theater is fighting his father who was a well know theater director who didn't accept his son to do dirty business. It also has a very important word to say with our relation with Western Europe we wanted to be in the same step with them we didn't want to completely ignore what happens in Paris and the thing the young gun  only 19  starts something like this shows the new generation is responsible even now after 1989 to bring this country back to its glory days.".

This movie is a needed change of rhythm in the Romanian cinema because it is depicting an episode of pioneering cinema in Romania . The year is 1912 but INDEPENDENCE WAR do not forget  is not the very first Romanian movie  maybe it is the first historical movie  even from the historical point of view the real UNION came in 1918 with Basarabia and Transilvania joining Valahia and Moldova ...but we are getting too much into national history .That era depicted in film is when Bucharest was opening more to European influences and especially french culture  it later became LITTLE Paris and it was not an exaggeration at all. French was spoken by aristocrats  intellectuals  artists and even common people. Of course the movie is got a lot of comic moments  we are Romanians N'EST CE PAS ? Do not forget also that haughty people they despised cinema  they preferred theater . I know they we're right but  let's get over it . Cinema was incredible cheap  even in those days  it was a sort of entertainment for low social classes  for the mob . But of course in time people they changed up minds  it is to admire the passion the people involved in this project they sacrifice to see their dream come true . Also it is showing us how VOLATILE and transient the films are ......they burn so easily .I enjoyed watching this movie  and is a nice feeling to know that they are still people who cares about CINEMA .".

Really liked Nae Caranfil's other films  especially his last one Filantropica a dark and cynical comedy that manages to be both original funny and thoughtprovoking. Now this one is different. Not that it's bad  but it's serious. It's about the first or one of the first movies ever made in Romania about the war of independence with the Turks. The action is set in 1911 and the events depicted in the film in the film had happened some 35 years earlier.The film does avoid the most basic traps  like being overly patriotic. But in my opinion it does not avoid the folklore reconstitution of the early 20th century Bucharest. It has all the expected clichs all Romanians know about  like Bucharest supposedly being then a little Paris. It has some standard characters  the young idealist the hot actress the patron of the arts ... none of which are very believable. It has some pretty heavy metaphors  the hot actress gets sprinkled with water twice in the movie only to die in a fire towards the end ... come on...It also has its good moments. I liked the old generals quarreling about who arrived first on the battle scene and loved the scene with the King to whom in is explained that the film's director is a kind of an accountant! Another one I liked was the projection of the Independence movie  a bunch of elderly gentlemen in fancy suits getting all excited watching the battle scenes almost like at a soccer game!I could have ended right there. Unfortunately it did not  it goes on for another half hour probably to provide information about the fate of the film in the film and of those who made it. And the very last scene nails it to the ground  an actor saying the rest is silence. Could have included himself in that...So overall a disappointment maybe because I was expecting too much.".

But things are as they are and I can't make them any different. All I can try is change my optic of things which I can't seem to do in this particular case. Some films sway you to others don't. It's just as simple as that.In Caranfil's style Restul e tacere is a jolly new film about film but also about jolly old Romania and the people inhabiting it. It looks good and is decently acted as a young protagonist tries to make a film about the Romanian battle of independence against the Turks which leads him on a road of enlightenment about the people of that world. A lot of character types pop up in this morally vile Romania which bear a lot of criticism to the contemporary one as well.What disappoints me is that subtlety is often sacrificed for clarity with an ending so full of itself that it just undermines many of the things said and done along the way. It is undeniable that the film has moments of poignant humor and all in all manages to sketch a very true form of the ill society which rules the land now and then but it isn't round enough to be placed on the shelf it wishes to place itself.I may be overly harsh about Caranfil's latest effort but I do not wish to ignore the underlying themes and motifs he ties in with the story the allegorical parallels of other stages of the world and some of the great single elements which are part of it. However it isn't enough  as far as I'm concerned  to be really smart about the things you say if the way you say them doesn't fit.".

	schema:headline " Another Romanina slasher movie contains spoilers";
	schema:reviewBody "I mean slasher cause after you see it you reach for a razor blade to slash your wrist. When all Hollywood movies have a happy ending Romanian movies have a killmyself ending haven't seen a single Romanian movie made after '89 that had a happy ending oh well .. maybe Asphalt Tango had a quasihappy ending.Back on topic Nae Caranfil manages to capture the 1911 Bucharest atmosphere very accurate. An old civilized world without vulgar language and gratuitous violence a time when honor and social statute where extremely important a time when falling in disgrace of a member took the whole family down with it. Also a world on the dawn of a new era when corruption started to spread and conartists began to thrived.What strikes me is that this is not a movie about making a movie but a love story that takes place while making a movie. Its that kind of movie that makes you think about it days after you see it ! Is Emilia a lead character ? No ! Did she influenced dramatically the lives of the male lead characters ? Definitely yes ! Director Nae Caranfil manages to tell a story within a story which in my opinion this makes hes best movie one of the best Romanian movies in fact. One minor criticism  German soldiers which actually where not even Germans as the caption said they where in fact AustriaHungarian soldiers their uniforms looked like Wehrmacht World War II uniforms especially the combat helmets. AustriaHungarian helmets had a small sharp vertical spike on top of the helmet. Im not a history buff to dwell on that too much.  SPOILER INCOMING Emilia character played masterfully by Mirela Zeta at first looks like its not fully developed as a character her story has plot holes and loose ends but thats intentional how can you portray a female character accurate when shes's lying as often as she breathes. She's not a peasant girl that lives in the city as she said in the harvest dance scene. At that time no peasant girl would dare leaving to the city and returning as she pleased without her father beating her senseless. I suspect she was a stowaway among the extras trying to get noticed as an actress by the young director or anyone in the movie industry by a matter of fact. She lies and screws everyone and with everyone that can help her achieve her goal to become and actress. And she did became an actress in a theater bought by Leon character for her in a time where he dint afford that eccentricity. She has a son who is the father ? Plot hole ? No it doesn't matter whos the father mostly because even she doesn't know. Five years passes and the young director Grigore still didn't forget her. He founds a portrait of her he takes it and he keeps it tight in hes arms like in an embrace. Definitely he loved her more than he shows throughout the whole movie which fits very well in that age of time when men didn't showed so transparently how they felt. He loves and hates her at the same time which can be seen in the scene near the end when he throws a glass of water on her painting in a dual gesture he threw a glass of water on her face first time she met her and he also threw a glass of water in her face last time he saw her marking the beginning and the end. Which leads to the final scene Grigore character doesn't lie in court because Leon actions harmed her ! He lies to punish Leon because he had her. Well done Mr. Caranfil ! Bravo !".

Trapero's Leonera offers something else an inquisition into how a life behind bars can change the human psyche and create a bond between a child and a mother. Echoing the early movies of the French New Wave that placed the gynecoissues front and center and the point of view objectivity of the Dardenne Brothers it is a worthy addition to what can be called the postmodern woman's picture. What is it like to give birth to your child behind bars? To have your child taken away the rejoinder and enjoinder are all explored.

This movie is not only about a mother's struggle about raising her child in a prison but it goes much beyond it in a bold brutal and beautiful way. The whole movie is about love mother's love for his child love between two human beings and the extent to which a mother will go to get her child back. Shooting the movie in a real prison and adding this to a very clever use of background prison noises creates an atmosphere which makes the whole presentation even more gripping. Usually the prison movies will depict the prisoners and the prison guards as brutal heartless and inhuman beings but in this movie Trapero tried to touch the softer more humane side of the inmates and the guards. Even though I don't know Spanish  but I loved watching this movie. Martine Gusman's wonderful performance makes this movie a must see for the serious cinema lovers.".

	schema:reviewBody "Where to start with Leonera a tale of unexplainable love strength and growth? Well I could say that to make a movie as powerful as this one would require not only love for cinema but strength and growth acquired with the years? Pablo Trapero is in love with his work he lives with it as his characters live with their stories fighting.Just as Zapa fought for a place in the police force and had it tough in El Bonaerense Julia Zrate has to fight for respect when she arrives to a cell in a prison and later on for her son Toms. The 'love' factor may not be the best way of expressing the power of Leonera but it's certainly a good one because it's a characteristic that's present throughout the entire ride and that you might not take so much into account. Trapero is so very in love with his wife Martina Gusmn too. She plays the main role of Julia and she does it with tremendous expertise and maturity appearing younger than she really is being strong when she must and completely defenseless when the circumstances requires. Yes Gusmn is the driving force of Leonera but it's fair to say that it wouldn't be the same if the camera didn't love her like it does. Here as in Familia Rodante inside the van and also in El bonaerense though with not the same impact the director's collaboration with cinematographer Guillermo Nieto is crucial. The camera's focus on Julia is constant with closeups that sometimes are even repulsive when we see her in her worst state as she goes through the most dreadful experiences. I could tell you these experiences one by one but it would be pointless. When I wrote about Familia Rodante I said Trapero directs so close to reality that we could be watching a documentary. This is a compliment because to move the viewer there's nothing more effective than reality. If Julia goes through all these things is because she must have done something because reality involves people and in the end is always going to be about people. More than ever Trapero's eye for reality makes the difference of what's going on in Argentina with the film industry today. The script of Leonera which he wrote with his collaborators is sharp and harsh with a strong vocabulary that resounds through the wall of this ward of this prison another main character as in the best Frank Darabont tradition the ward in The Green Mile and the whole prison in The Shawshank Redemptions.In the objective of representing reality that no other national filmmaker today Trapero observes the prison during the film presenting shots of the installations from different angles during the day during the night while it's raining. This way we can identify with Julia's situation without having to defend her position something Trapero never demands us to do. There's one sequence in which Julia's baby starts crying and the camera goes through the windows of every cell where every baby in the prison starts crying. The crying becomes so loud that we want to cover our ears. There are villains and best friends in Leonera because they have to be. There must be someone who wants to keep Julia away from her son and there has to be someone who will help her with her problems inside the prison. In Julia's relationship with these characters if you try to see it that way what rules is going back to the beginning love.Though it sounds like a clich and there are many other reasons and I tried to develop some to explain Trapero's latest film's magical quality we can't deny that there's nothing like motherly love. Trapero knows it and he makes us feel it surrounding us with real people you have to watch this you'll see really real people.Renowned critics say that we can't talk about New Argentine Cinema anymore that we have to say Argentine Cinema. You can call it whatever you want I'll just tell you there are incredible films like Leonera being made and you shouldn't miss them beyond every prejudice you could have.".

Ramiro who was also involved sexually with Nahuel is wounded.For reasons that aren't explained we never get to know the reason behind the murder. It is never made clear whether Julia was the killer although everything conspires to land her in jail. Ramiro has survived and he is telling a different story that seems to be the opposite of what Julia confesses to the authorities in charge. We don't get to know the motive for the crime.What follows is an account of Julia's life in prison. The first thing the guards find out is that she is pregnant. Instead of going to the regular ward for criminals Julia is taken to the maternity section where women with children are allowed to keep them until they turn four years of age. Julia begins to see what life is going to be now behind bars. It isn't a pretty sight. Luckily Marta another convict with two children comes to her rescue one day when Julia is assaulted in the communal showers.

The relations between mother and daughter aren't exactly the best. Julia gives birth to Tomas. Not having any guidance Julia is awkward in the way a baby has to be fed among other things.

To make matters worse the case is brought to a formal trial and Ramiro lies about the crime which allows him to leave the prison.Pablo Trapero is an interesting director. His previous films reveal he is an artist that loves to tackle themes no other men would. Mr. Trapero cowrote the screenplay of this complex story that is more than a 'women behind bars' story. He makes a case about how strange justice works for someone like Julia a woman caught in a web of red tape and because of her status as a female in a macho dominated society.The best thing in the film is Martina Gusman who is married to the director and who has served as producer for all of her husband's films. Her Julia is one of the best performances in the Argentine cinema bar none. She is an actress to consider even though she has only appeared in 'Nacido y criado' before. Elly Medeiros plays Sofia the distant mother that suddenly has to face her daughter's imprisonment at close range. Laura Garcia and Rodrigo Santoro are seen as Marta and Rodrigo the other two main characters of this harrowing account about a woman entangled in a web where she can't escape.".

I do not recall any other movie of this theme showing a mother raising her son in this environment especially in a Third World country. The humanity of the guards in the Argentinean prison surprises. However the screenplay of Leonera is a complete mess in the development of the lead character Julia. If this story was based on a true event I could understand the nonconclusive situation however it is fictional and there are many flaws in Julia's character and the most obvious is whether she is guilty or innocent. The viewer never knows if she killed her lover Nahuel or not. Then she rejects her baby and tries to provoke an abortion hitting her womb several times why she changes her behavior after the birth of Toms is again never clear. I recall that one prisoner tells her that the wing where she is imprisoned is totally different from the rest of the prison.
