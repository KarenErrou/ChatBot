Other than that 'Legionnaire' feels more like a war movie than a Van Damme movie. Then again you can tell Van Damme cowrote it He gives himself a lot of acting time and not much arsekicking time but then you have various action clichs popping up and the odd oneliner here and there.Van Damme's martialarts skills are not showcased here as much as in his other movies. There are a few boxing scenes and maybe one kick in the entire movie. The rest of the action is standard war stuff explosions and gunplay circa 1924 to be precise.'Legionnaire' is surprisingly good in the end. Van Damme gets to do something different for a change and I'll give him credit for it. It is more dramatic than most of his other movies but that should not stop Van Damme fans  and even nonfans of Van Damme  from seeing it  710".

Not his usuall puncherkicker film he tells the story of how it is for a legionnaire watching people he knows being picked off onebyone in the heated Hell of war! Although it's not a true story it IS however true to the way it is with any heartfull man who joins the Foreign Legion and gets caught up in such Hellish realities of hatred in combat. Leaving behind all he's ever known  felt comfortable with and fighting for a whole different cause and finding out later the trespasses that happen which can result in hatred. You can feel the loneliness he felt as the Arabs ride away  he's the only one left standing there in the death rubble and smoke of what was his fort in Northern Africa. Certainly a welcomed change from Van Damme's usuall martial arts mayhem. It's a keeper!".

Not his usuall puncherkicker film he tells the story of how it is for a legionnaire watching people he knows being picked off onebyone in the heated Hell of war! Although it's not a true story it IS however true to the way it is with any heartfull man who joins the Foreign Legion and gets caught up in such Hellish realities of hatred in combat. Leaving behind all he's ever known  felt comfortable with and fighting for a whole different cause and finding out later the trespasses that happen which can result in hatred. You can feel the loneliness he felt as the Arabs ride away  he's the only one left standing there in the death rubble and smoke of what was his fort in Northern Africa. Certainly a welcomed change from Van Damme's usuall martial arts mayhem. It's a keeper!";

The movie doesn't know exactly what it wants to be. There were times when the film was a little too slow and some of the actors seemed a little uncomfortable in the scenes that demanded some acting abilities. On the other hand the film makes good use of its setting desert and it has a good atmosphere. I also found the ending to be pretty good and thought that Van Damme did a decent job as an actor an improvement from his previous roles.In the end Legionnaire is a nearly good movie but I had the impression that they could have made it better. Also if I were to compare it to Van Damme's other effort from 1998 Knock Off this is a lot better.My rating 5510".

This proves that he can actually act and not just be a musclebound man who kills everyone. The battle scenes are epiclike the acting topnotch and the script brilliantly done.Legionnaire is set in the 1920s France about Alain Jean Claude Van Damme a boxer who was payed by the French mafia to lose a fight but he breaks his promise and tries to flee the country with his muchloved girlfriend but that plan goes wrong so he's forced to join the French Legion and fight rebels in Morroco. There he meets makes three men he befriends Luther Adewale AkinnuoyeAgbaje an AfricanAmerican man trying to have a better life Guido Daniel Caltagirone a Spainish man trying to prove his bravery to marry his girlfriend and Mackintosh Nicholas Farrell a British man trying to redeem himself. They're under the command of Steinkampf Steven Berkoff their commander who will do anything to win. They go to battle with the local rebels which is hell. Not only this but mafia hitmen also join the Legion to kill Alain.This is a seriously underrated Van Damme film and is surely his best work. It's a crime that this didn't make it into the cinemas and get all the acclaim it deserves yet pieces of shit like My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2002 get in and it's a massive hit. This is a classic from start to finish even it's brilliant perhaps corny to some ending. I hope Van Damme keeps making these types of films and continues showing his true acting ability. Slyvester Stallone was thought to have not much acting ability but he made Copland 1997 which got him a lot of acclaim. Perhaps one day people will finally see this and let him back into show business.Rating 55".

Legionnaire was the highest straight to DVD movie ever made. Yes Van Damme was so huge back in the day's of 90's action films that this film's cost was over 20 million dollars and it didn't even get Cinema release. Which was a shame. The film is definitely not as bad as some of the action movies we see today. Van Damme plays Alain Lefevre a boxer who is paid to take a dive. Alain is to proud to do that and win's the fight that costs gangsters a lot of money he tries to flee France and go to America But after being the fight Alain ends up being chased by police and finds himself in the French Foreign Legion and deployed to Africa to crush an insurgency in a French colony.You can tell Van Damme cowrote it He gives himself a lot of acting time on screen as to try and break away from the typical films he usually does and not much asskicking time but then again you still have various action clichs popping up and the odd oneliner here and there.Van Damme's martialarts skills are not showcased here as much as in his other movies. There are a few boxing scenes and some fighting scene in the end but really different from all of his other films fight choreography. This really does film like a whole different genre for Van Damme to tackle. 'Legionnaire' is surprisingly good in the end. Van Damme gets to do something different for a change and I'll give him credit for it. It is more dramatic than most of his other movies and I can say that the film was still enjoyable to watch and much more enjoyable to watch because of Van Damme's performance.".

The filmmakers also did something else that was smart they surrounded Van Damme with interesting characters played by rather good actors which automatically raises the interestlevel for this film. Steven Berkoff is clearly having a lot of fun with the villainous character Sergeant Steinkampf and we have just as much fun watching him. An underappreciated talent Adewale AkinnuoyeAghbaie does a really decent job playing Luther who decides to join the French Legion to escape the racism of the South along with a bogus murder charge. Then there is Nicholas Farrell who delivers a wonderfully well conceived performance as the British recruit Mackintosh a man with a compulsive gambling habit who is renowned for his witticisms and even capable of speaking a few Arabic phrases which are most useful in a brothel. The Arabic phrases are completely unnecessary but much appreciated all the same. Finally Ana Sofrenovic makes for a beautiful love interest Katrina who we would like to see reunited with Alain and broken free of the clutches of the evil mob boss. As a result of all these factors in addition to some great cinematography and some pretty good action and survival in the desert scenes Legionnaire hums along quite entertainingly right until the end.710".

	schema:headline " I don't think I want to hear any more whining about Van Damme. The man is the king.";
	schema:reviewBody "It seems to be the popular thing to do to jump on the bandwagon and badmouth Van Damme for being a bad actor or for making one bad movie after another. I have always claimed to be a fan but mostly just because when I was a kid I watched movies like Kickboxer and Bloodsport and Death Warrant over and over. To be honest I hadn't really seen many more of his movies for years except for Hard Target which I found less impressive than his early martial arts films.But recently I bought 16 Van Damme movies on two DVDs for 20 yuan  about 2.75  thanks to mainland China's total indifference to copyright laws and as I watch them I have noticed something important. It seems that most of the reason that Van Damme is criticized is because of things like goofy camaraderie or cheesy heroic lines things like that. But it seems noteworthy that in just about every movie he is in he is fighting for justice or to be a good father or good husband or to protect his fellow man from criminals or to avenge a loved one's violent death. Van Damme represents good human values in a way that most other action stars don't. I feel like he deserves a lot more credit for that than he ever gets.Besides that the guy can speak five languages. Did you know? WOW.In Legionnaire he plays a boxer who's paid to take a dive in the second round but when he ah accidentally beats the tar out of his opponent he suddenly finds himself being pursued by mobsters and police which quickly dashes his and his girlfriend's plans of getting out of France and going to America. Soon he finds himself an unwilling member of the French Foreign Legion which employs the psychotic idea of training soldiers to exist solely for the honor of dying in battle and is run like a prison with racks of guns. They are sent to Africa to crush an insurgency resulting in more of a war film than a martial arts film.But I have no problem with that. There is a notable appearance of Adewale AkinnuoyeAgbaje a clearly talented actor who recently wasted his undeniable on screen charm on such backwards TV shows as Lost and Oz and here is again asked to do something terrible  he takes on an American accent complete with ridiculous lines like The only thing that keeps a man livin' you gots ta have a dream But there is a friendship that forms between Alain Lefevre Van Damme and Adawale's character Luther that is pretty good and allows for the most tense and moving scene in the film.Given that so much of the movie plays like a prison film since the Legionnaires are generally forced members some of the scenes are a little strange such as the one where they argue about the best way to hand wash laundry. Then again it seems like some of the lines between soldiers were put in for comic relief What's the matter don't like girls? Of course not I'm British!.Speaking of which for how moving the friendship between Alain and Luther is Alain has an undeniably cheesy friendship with the British guy although it is also a very unstable but powerful relationship in many ways and also allows for some good dramatic tension near the end of the film. Alain is also the good guy that sticks up for the underdogs who can't defend themselves against the more brutish soldiers very well which doesn't seem to make him many friends. Also soon after their first battle he walks around shirtless showing off his chiseled body and making enemies effortlessly.The battle scenes by the way are also pretty good much better than I would have expected from Van Damme if only because war scenes are not what he usually does. But here they're impressive although the end of the movie is a pretty significant disappointment. It builds up this remarkably indepth story and then just stops like they ran out of money. The leader of the enemy insurgency lets Alain live so he can tell his leader that this is what they can expect if they keep invading their country and then Van Damme heads back into the sunset. It seems like what happens next should have been considered important and it leaves me with the feeling that the movie ends just as the real climax was set up.But nonetheless I remember I was working in a video store in Fresno when the movie was released ten years ago and for some reason I never watched it but I'm glad that I have. It has plenty of shortcomings but it is definitely worth watching.".

I love the kicking action but this movie has but one kick it's to the shin and Van Damme's lying down when he gives it.  Right off the bat that proves that this is not your typical Van Damme film.  It all about dreams.  All the character primary and supporting bring their dreams into the story and show how following these dreams has led them into the Legion Etrangere.  From there we get the bonus of having a sort of inside look at a military element that's not very well known. This part could be a spoiler so if you have not seen this movie and don't want to know then stop reading. The story of friendships that are forged then lost as they all bite the dust leaving Van Damme alone in the desert still clinging to his dream. The ending is not happy as not all ending are and it leaves a tear in your eye.  In this movie maybe the first Van Damme proves what a lot of people have been saying all along that he actually can act.  It's top class for him and it's just too bad it wasn't released in theaters because it could have really bolstered his dwindling career.  The supporting cast also did a great job ALL of them.  This movie was great.".

Watching this film recently for the first time in many years I was reminded of other stories that came both before and after it 1963's The Haunting and 2001's The Others coming immediately to mind.There is nothing better than a good ghost story with mood and imagination and The Hearse claims these properties to some degree. That it is an overcliched film with comic relief that doesn't quite fit counts against it as does the unlikely and disappointing ending. Trish Van Devere a competent if not supremely talented actress and the always pleasing Joseph Cotton are the lead players although Ms. Van Devere's screen love interest David Gautreaux as Tom came close to stealing it from both of them. I did not feel that Joseph Cotton had enough screen time to please his fans but as they say Always leave them wanting more!' The story Jane portrayed by Ms. Van Devere inherits an old house in the country. Jane's aunt had practiced Satan worship in it and the local town folks were not pleased to see her niece move in. In a nice addition to the storyline we learn that Jane had a nervous breakdown after a messy divorce and her mental stability quickly comes into question. Jane sees images in the house and is convinced that somebody is stalking her in a sinister looking funeral home hearse. Throughout the course of the story she has interesting encounters with such diverse people as the local estate attorney hardware store operators and their son an oddball minister and her new love interest. Who was after her and why did heshe want Jane out of her aunt's house? There are many red herrings and barely enough chills and thrills to attract the younger audiences that were just then in 1980 two years after Jamie Lee Curtis and Halloween making their presence felt at the box office and soontobe neighborhood video stores. As stated the ending was a real letdown after it seemed the film had come to a satisfying conclusion.Perhaps that is why this film generates strong emotions it tries to be too much to too many. That it has something for everybody and for the most part succeeds in putting it all together is one of it's major strengths. The fact that this also causes it to be disjointed and somewhat awkward at times is the downside of this but remember The Hearse was never intended to be a summer blockbuster. That a film such as this can still generate intelligent discussion 22 years after its release is remarkable in itself.".

Should she call her shrink in the city...or face the fact that events in her life have taken a supernatural turn? That's THE HEARSEif you analyze it it doesn't deliver big on story. It's more about the setup than the payoff. It gives you just enough of a situation to make you nervous and then straight into the scares. Then it wraps up in a vague manner that doesn't answer your questions but if you're on the film's wavelength this really doesn't matter.This was one of several movies I saw as a kid in the early 80's and this particular one I came back to see a second time dragging a friend along to share the popcorn fun. Seeing this in a theatre was amazingimagine yourself going to see a PGrated film in the early 80's and watching the audience around you literally jumping out of their seats with fright over and over again. This film actually generated one of the strongest audience reactions I've been witness to. The film established a very unnerving vibe and made the audience worried about the vague evil forces that were lurking out there in the darkness. And when the creepy hearse driver finally showed up and started doing his menacing thing the audience was primed up and ready to scream. And scream they did. There is also the strong feeling that the sleepy secluded town the story takes place in is REALLY far away from everywhere else in the world and that these strange supernaturalish events could really happen here without too many people even noticing. This is fun on home video but if you ever have a chance to see it at a revival theatre not likely but you never know! go check it out. Maybe the days of really good popcorn budgeters are gone but this was very effective in its day. Nice musical score too. Trish Van Devere and the whole rest of the cast are excellent. I thought Perry Lang was especially good as the local boy who takes a shine to Jane and experiences some misfortune because of it. An inexpensive nongory horror movie that does its job. It was worth the 2.50 and popcorn money.".

	schema:reviewBody "the Hearse came out in the middle of 1980 at a time when Rrated horror features were pulling in most of the box office money. the Hearse is rated PG and was one of the few films I was able to see without adult supervision. Looking through old newspaper ads from 1980 I noticed this film was often paired up on a double bill with DON'T ANSWER THE PHONE throughout 1980 and again in 1981 at a local secondrun cinema! Talk about mismatched couples! I first actually saw the film when it premiered on Showtime in 1982...and I watched every broadcast after that. The new DVD is quite a surprise as it's widescreen and it's enhanced for widescreen TVs! I tend to watch the beginning of the film often because there is a shot of a famous row of houses I live across the park from one of those homes was used as Brooke Adams' home in 1978's Invasion of the Bodysnatchers and countless other films and TV shows. Also I walk by the house where Trish Van Devere is carrying her luggage down the steps to her car just about everyday. The rest of the film is a rather classy ghost story which is intriguing and nonexploitive. There's no gruesome violence that say DON'T ANSWER THE PHONE had and it's refreshing. I think anyone over the age of 10 can appreciate this film and it's somewhat suitable for the whole family. Trish Van Devere is a strong lead and very appealing in her role. She carries the movie just fine and in a distinguished female lead. Joseph Cotton plays an obnoxious nemesis and pretty much sets the stage as to how the rest of the small town reacts to her being there. They are far less than hospitable and it's not until further on in the film she finds out why. It's at this time a mysterious menacing hearse appears to be showing up at her country retreat on a nightly basis or following her on one of her quiet drives. Recovering from a previous breakdown after a messy divorce and soon feeling as though she may have a relapse when the nightly hauntings start to wear down her nerves she finally gets a little braver and starts investigating the ghostly goings on. In the meantime she finds herself attracted to a mysterious young man who seems to know a lot more about the history of the town and her house than the townsfolk are willing to share. There's more but I'll stop there  view the film at least RENT IT! and see for yourself. It's a decent film and may be just the ticket if the usual horror trends in violence or overdone special effects have worn your nerves down. Even in 1980 a good ghost story was hard to find  by that the Hearse is still a refreshing feature.".

The pallid story never grips or inserts much interest as it becomes a wearisome tale of neverending suspicious tedium. The slow grinding pace doesn't help matters either. It seems to be all build up but director George Bowers' predictable touch can't seem to raise much in the way of suspense and really overuses the usual scare tactics with miserable results. This even goes for Webster Lewis' generically telegraphed score. One or two effective surreal setpieces involving the hearse and its driver and Mori Kawa's nicely atmospheric photography just can't makeup for the lame weak and overly boring presentation.

It's a very creepy and engrossing haunted house story however the ending just doesn't cut it. i liked all of the characters especially Trish Van Devere's!. It's a little cheap at times but there were quite a few moments that made me jump and i was really getting into it unfortunately the ending sucked!. The finale is excellent and very creepyand although it's somewhat predictable it has enough tension and scares to keep you satisfied. There is no gore.I got this off an 8 movie 2 disc horror set The Direction is good for the most part. George Bowers does a very good job here creating lots of creepy atmosphere good lighting with some great zoom in's  and keeping the film at an engaging pace! solid job. The Acting is very good. Trish Van Devere is excellent as the main lead she is beautiful had good chemistry with David Gautreauxand was very likable and was a perfect choice to play this part!. Joseph Cottenis good as the old drunk and brought some class to this. David Gautreaux is creepy here and did well he had good chemistry with Trish Van Devere and was likable. Donald Hotton is okay as the priest was unconvincing at times but he was okay and got the job done. Christopher McDonald is okay in his short role. Perry Lang is good as Paul i liked him. Overall highly recommended! 12 out of 5".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS The movie The Hearse seems to hit all the wrong notes at all the right times to make it look more like a comedy then a horror film. This eerie black hearse with a creepy and scareface driver behind the wheel is always stalking and trying to run down poor Jane Hardy Tris Van Devere who's spending the summer at her late Aunt Rebbecca's house the Martin Place in the town of Blackford. Jane trying to get over a very stressful divorce left the big city of San Francisco to the quite country town of Blackford in order to get over her depression how wrong she was. We find out that this weirdo hearse driver is actually the man she falls in love with at Blackford the strange eerie and unearthly Tom Sullivan David Gaulreaux. Who also turns out to be the ghost of Robert who was Jane's Aunt Rebbecca's lover back some thirty years ago who turned her on to Satanism. You notice right away that this guy Tom is not of this earth he looks and acts more like he's come from under it. Nobody in the town of Blackford sees him but Jane who doesn't see what we all see that's the obvious about him that Tom is Robert's evil spirit. Were later told by the drunken Walter Pritchard Joseph Cottonwho's Jane's lawyer and real estate agent that her Aunt Rebbecca did practice Satanism with her lover Tom. Later after she died Tom was burned to a crisp when the hearse taking her body to the cemetery exploded into flames leaving nothing to be buried. There's a weird dreamlike sequence in the movie where Jane goes into the hearse and ends up at the local church attending aunt Rebbecca's funeral. Then she gets up from her coffin and scares the hell out of Jane as well as the theater audience. At the town everyone is very cold and avoids Jane because of her living in the Martin's house except young Paul GordonPerry Lang. Paul is very much in love with her Jane even though she's much older then him and looks at him as a friend not a lover. Jane is in love with the weird Tom Sullivan who's trying to get her like her Aunt Rebbecca in league with the Devil.Pritchard later tries to scare Jane out of her house as he smashes the windows of the Martin Place in a drunken rage. Only to get himself killed by the runaway hearse and ending up hanged in the shower  by his tie in the Martin Place's bathroom. Paul is also killed when he goes to the Martin Place to save Jane from her crazed and demonic lover Tom with Jane running for her life from Tom and his deadly hearse. Late in the movie there a scene where the local preacher Reverend Winston Donald Hotton runs to the Martin Place and does an exorcism on it in what looks like a wind tunnel. The exorcism is so funny that it comes across as an episode straight out of Mystery Science Theather 3000. Tom chasing Jane with his handy hearse ends up being slammed by Jane's car and knocked down a cliff and burned to a crisp like Aunt Rebbecca was some thirty years ago. The ending of the film The Hearse calls for a sequel but luckily for us the movie wasn't that successful to warrant one.".

	schema:reviewBody "Trish Van Devere stars as Jane a troubled school teacher from San Francisco trying to recover from a terrible divorce and her Aunt's death who moves to a small town country home which lives in infamy as the local boogeyhouse. The locals resist her often even appearing hostile or standoffish just because of the house she lives in. Her aunt was known as a devil worshiper so Jane will not be given a fair shake by the citizens. Jane's archnemesis is Walter Pritchard..an ornery Joseph Cotten a bitter misanthrope who wanted the house she resides. He handles the deed and proper papers that Jane needs to sign if she wishes to remain in her aunt's house or sell it off. There are signs of her Aunt's presence in the house..the music cues definitely inform us of thisand she meets a handsome yet mysterious young man TomDavid Gautrauxfor whom she begins a relationship. But Jane is tormented by a hearse..and it's sinister chauffeur which often tries to either run her of the road or pull into the yard. Soon the chauffeur begins invading Jane's house threatening danger. Is Jane losing her sanity? Or is the chauffeur real? All of Jane's problems began when she started to read her aunt's diary which reveals her secret affair with a man while engaged to anothereven mentioning that her lover worships Satan promising eternal life if she joins his cult.For about an hour or so this is a nice little surprise..a kind of haunted house creeper you might see on a chiller theater program. But the ending descends into a demonic chase thriller with a rather disappointing close which lets Jane off a bit too easy. I think the one tormenting her is rather predictable for those who understand strange behavior and love unrequited. Donald Hotton portrays the local priest who challenges the demonic power which threatens Jane's life in the house. Med Flory is the unsubtle flirtatious sheriff who provokes Jane with his sleazy smiles and aggressive attitude. Perry Lang is the affable Paul the son of a hardware store owner who helps with the repairs of Jane's house carrying a torch for her. It's a drag that the film builds up to such a rather flimsy close with Jane being chased by the menacing chauffeur wishing to capture her soul which leads to a lackluster conclusion. Might be a bit entertaining for haunted house fans but even this group will find that The Hearse doesn't quite fulfill expectations. Might even be a bit dull for those expecting thrills and chills and only coming away with a pounding score that builds suspense gradually only to a whimper instead of a thrill. This could've been a real winner instead it's an interesting failure a curio perhaps worthy of pursuit for one viewing. Not particularly a film which stays with you either. For the exception of some profanity this has the qualities of a decent madefortelevision feature. Fans of Christopher McDonald might get a kick out of seeing him as a foulmouthed highstrung youth who questions whether Paul was getting laid with Jane. The house itself is an appropriately spooky enough place and the director sometimes uses POV when the spirit..or personinvades Jane's home unannounced. The chauffeur has a memorable appearance stalking Jane in the house while a nightmare sequence provides a creepy sense of dread as she is led into a church where her burial is being held. Ultimately I think the film works best of it's fishoutofwater theme where a big city girl is treated unceremoniously by the rednecks of a small town..with Jane trying to cope with all those who wish for her to leave. I think also that her sanity being tested by the hearsedriving ghoul adds to the film's allure because the locals are provided with reasons for wishing Jane to leave. The major flaw of any film regarding haunted houses is why would Jane remain in such a hostile place with her life clearly in danger?".

Is there a connection?While The Hearse admittedly borrows from a great deal of lateseventies supernatural horror films it has a fantastically unique set up with the ghostly hearse and the dead aunt who also just so happened to be a witch. It's entirely made up of stock horror elements sure but the combination is too fun to dismiss. The first act of the film is surprisingly languid taking its time to build a crescendo. Granted the last act is a bit extravagant as the film really cuts loose but it's wildly amusing even at its cheesiest of moments.Atmospheric photography and northern California sets lend the film a nice atmosphere somewhat akin to The Silent Scream released the same year. Trish Van Devere who would also star in The Changeling the same year is solid as the lead while Joseph Cotten and Christopher McDonald offer decent supporting performances. I've read some criticism of the film where the claim has been made that it runs too long which I didn't find to be the case. The conclusion is somewhat ridiculous but then again we are talking about a supernatural horror flick made in 1979.Overall I found The Hearse to be a sufficiently amusing and somewhat creepy offering. There are films that do what it does far better but it is an earnest effort that really took me in mostly on the basis of its successful capturing of atmosphere. It's silly and it's spooky but it's consistently amusing. The clever writing and ominous atmosphere make it worth a watch. 810.".

It would only be fair to say that The Hearse is fairly derivative of some of the big hitters of its day but I have to say I found it to be a pretty good effort on the whole. Trish Van Devere puts in an engaging performance in the lead role while Joseph Cotton veteran actor of various classics from the past like Citizen Kane 1941 appears in one of the numerous genre flicks he pitched up in in the last decade of his career. Aside from the ominous black hearse the sinister events incorporate an odd reverend a satanic church and ghostly appearances of a woman at a window. By the end of things it's true that the relevance of everything has not been fully established but when it comes to stories about ghostly goings on this is not exactly a problem in my book.

A simple plot centres around 30something Jane recovering from a bitter divorce and the death of her father by deciding to stay at her aunt's house which unbeknown to her is haunted. Strange phenomena starts as soon as she settles in lights going on and off windows suddenly opening and closing and the main point a suspicious looking Hearse appearing at her door.....You obviously wonder what is going to happen next is the Hearse simply a matter of imagination on Jane's part or is it something a lot more serious? The Hearse as a whole contains very little in the way of gory blood dripping scenes it is in fact a movie where the viewer has to go into the mind of the central characters and try and discover their motives as to why certain events happen. Why are the local people against Jane what is the suspicious nature surrounding a nice young man called Tom that she unexpectedly meets? Many questions arise that are quite albeit QUITE addressed come the end of the film.Lead star Trish Van Devere sets a good example of a strongminded woman who is understandably spooked and scared by the unusual goings on. You actually feel for Jane! Her costars however can't be so easily forgiven  atrocious acting in some parts.What makes this film work in some respect is the sense of coldness and eeriness surrounding the Hearse despite the driver's constant smiling and the strange goings on in this house it is very reminiscent as another reviewer mentioned of the 2001 movie The Others. Admittedly the final 15 minutes or so of The Hearse is a let down I obviously don't want to give it away but I'm sure for viewers who have witnessed the film it could have been done with a lot more style and a lot more vigour. Then again The Hearse was never meant to be this big budget horror movie in the first place  a typical Bmovie flick that does recommend a slightly better IMDb rating than the current 3.3 I feel. 510".

But what are they supposed to be afraid of? The creature? It's ghost? The curse? The return of the creature? What then? It's pretty funny. Check it out on youtube. Anyway this film is kind of like that. Which clich are we supposed to be afraid of here?The Hearse is simply a dull collection of about every old horror film clich you can think of. A recently divorced woman moves into her late aunt's spooky old house in the countryside. On her way into town and on several other occasions a big old black hearse seems to be trying to run her off the road! A bad omen. The locals are outwardly hostile since they hated her aunt and know the house is haunted. The only local who seems to like her is a horny teenager whose parents own the hardware store. And then there's this weird gentlemanly dude who shows up to court her in an oldfashioned way...The plot thickens kind of when the woman finds her aunt's diary and learns that she was about to marry a preacher but then dumped him for a Satanist! Yikes. And then the spooky old house seems to come to life. Windows break for no reason. Pipes clang together. Music boxes play on their own and move around. And all the while this old hearse keeps showing up on the roads or in her driveway. What does it want? Who is the mysterious Tom who wishes to win her over? Honestly you'll figure it all out pretty quick.The film just can't decide what is at the center of all the strange happenings. All the writers seemed to want to do is add a bunch of supposedly spooky elements into a pot and stir until something watchable came out. The acting is passable. Trish Van Devere isn't bad at all. Joseph Cotten needed more screen time but they likely only got him for a few days of shooting. The film borrows heavily from other horror films such as The Car Let's Scare Jessica to Death The Amityville Horror and maybe even The Fog. There really isn't an original idea to be found. The hearse itself is just a plot point that isn't really explained. It looks menacing but almost seems like an afterthought that could have been written out altogether. Not a drop of blood or any real suspense to be had. Really no reason to see this one. I'm frankly amazed it ever got a DVD release. 4 of 10 stars.The Hound.".

It's understandable that they hated the Satanworshiping aunt it wasn't her fault she was under a spell but the house then passed to the mother before the niece received possession. Did Joseph Cotten's character poison their minds against an innocent woman? This film is neither scary nor frightening. Unfortunately it's not entertaining either unless you enjoy bad acting boring scripts and lame plots. For the most part it was only annoying until the end finally arrived.

	schema:reviewBody "I got to see this film recently. I was not disappointed despite the many negative things I had read about it. The Hearse of the title is a truly menacing vehicle especially with the creepylooking Dominic Barto as the silent driver who starts to appear in our heroine Jane's nightmares.Jane rather than being a screaming victim 247 is a very strong character who eventually takes charge as she starts to see strange visions in her aunt's old house. At first he thinks her mind is playing tricks as she is still recovering from a breakdown caused by her recent divorce but it's nowhere near that simple. It is a bit ridiculous with the hostility she receives from most of the locals I really hated the bratty kids who break one of her windows at one point because of her aunt's past but she sticks it out. I like how she finally gets her act together and fights back against the evil force in the film.Trish Van Devere is great as Jane and is given good support by Joseph Cotten as a greedy alcoholic lawyer and Donald Hotton as the local priest one of the few locals who helps Jane. The scary scenes are handled excellently with a lot of eerie POV shots and a great nightmare bit where the Hearse takes Jane to the Church to see her own funeral. The slow revelations of her late aunt's fall into evil are very wellhandled.David Gautreax is very good as the mysterious Tom and the twist ending will blow you away. What happens to the priest at the end though. There's a great car chase at the end which is very wellhandled. In all THE HEARSE did not disappoint me. I ask you to give it a chance.".

	onyx:emotionText "I got to see this film recently. I was not disappointed despite the many negative things I had read about it. The Hearse of the title is a truly menacing vehicle especially with the creepylooking Dominic Barto as the silent driver who starts to appear in our heroine Jane's nightmares.Jane rather than being a screaming victim 247 is a very strong character who eventually takes charge as she starts to see strange visions in her aunt's old house. At first he thinks her mind is playing tricks as she is still recovering from a breakdown caused by her recent divorce but it's nowhere near that simple. It is a bit ridiculous with the hostility she receives from most of the locals I really hated the bratty kids who break one of her windows at one point because of her aunt's past but she sticks it out.

But there was a problem. This movie isn't good. I hate to say that because i strive to find positive attributes in every film i see but this film simply is badly made. How more contrived can a haunted house script be? The film begins with a woman realizing she needs to spend time alone because she's been having difficult times so we can later explain why she thinks she must be crazy when she sees things then the big house inherited from her dead aunt low angle shots here with blue lights behind dead trees a la Amityville horror and a bunch of bad acting locals who act unkind to this lady almost as if just because the script calls for it. But here's the biggest fault The musical score. Sorry Mr. Webster Lewis but your score took away any possible strength this film could have had. Not only have they reused the the same 3 cues through out the film which i can understand to some degree considering recording costs but each cue within itself is bad. They begin with this short piano lick which everytime you hear it you're supposed to realize that something ain't right here. It becomes tiring it becomes overpowering. In other cues you hear this Jaws' themelike piano motif pounding away which is supposed to build the tension but give me a break guys. And next time hire a composer who knows that writing original film music is more than trying to create suspense by using diminished chords or pounding low piano keys. By the time this film was over i couldn't figure out how or why it ended up on my must see list for interesting horror films. And the director should stick to his editing career instead looks like from his filmography he's been more successful at that. And that's not a surprise after seeing this bad film.".

And unlike the modern successful horror films of today they don't work to hit that thick atmosphere that can easily be found in the horrific score heard by the playing of a piano.Even Scream and The Blair Witch Project which I thought was a snoozer only reached the level of shock in the theaters.

	schema:reviewBody "J. Lee Thompson's The Evil That Men Do casts tough guy actor Charles Bronson of the Death Wish franchise as a nononsense professional killer who reluctantly comes out of retirement on his desert island to eliminate an individual who specializes in human torture. Dr. Clement Molloch Joseph Maher of Heaven Can Wait interrogates and tortures prisoners for Third World Latin American dictators. The villain's surname 'Molloch' is a variation of the word 'Moloch' an Old Testament god of the Ammonites and the Phoenicians to whom children were sacrificed by burning. The Molloch here doesn't torture children but he is appropriately nefarious when he makes his adult victims suffer. Unquestionably the evil doctor is a human rights violator like few you will ever see in movies. The scene at the outset of the action where his men and he attach electrodes to the nipples and genitals of a highly respected journalist Jorge Hidalgo Mexican actor Jorge Humberto Robles and gives him bursts to electricity to learn what he knows is pretty strong stuff even for an Rrated movie. Mind you Thompson doesn't show the devastated areas we simply see a completely nude man hanging in a sling with the wires trailing from his chest and pelvis. Dr. Hector Lomelin Jose Ferrer of The Shrike visits Holland Charles Bronson on his island where he resides in a kind of selfimposed exile and asks him to kill Molloch. Holland is saddened by the news of his journalist friend's death and then he watches several videos that Lomelin provides of interviews with Molloch's victims and hears about the man's horrendous crimes against mankind. Nevertheless Holland refuses to accept Lomelin's offer until a later scene when he shows up unexpectedly at the professor's class room.Nothing gets in Holland's way once he takes the job. He refuses to work for pay. He arranges for Lomelin to get him a woman and a child to pose as his wife and daughter so that he will attract less attention from the locals. In one amusing scene Holland and his faux wife Rhiana Hidalgo wife of the death journalist Theresa Saldana of Defiance enter a dive of a bar. While Holland gets their drinks an enormous Hispanic guy decides to join them and fondle Rhiana. Holland surprises this gigantic hombre by knocking the table out of the way and seizing the dastard by the testicles and crushing them in the iron grip of his fist. Of course this hulk crumples into a huddle of arms and legs at Holland's feet and offers no further interference. This display of selfdefense attracts the attention of Molloch's bodyguard Randolph Raymond St. Jacques of Cotton Comes to Harlem and he joins our hero and heroine. Shrewdly Holland tells Randolph that Rhiana and he are looking for someone else to have sex with and the deal is sealed. They go back to Holland's motel and Holland immediately kills Randolph with a knife and hangs him upside down to bleed his corpse out in the shower.Guns of Navarone director J. Lee Thompson pulls no punches in this hardasnails thriller with his depiction of either Molloch's savage torture techniques or Holland's icy methods of disposing with his antagonists. Consequently The Evil That Men Do still retains its edgy quality some twenty years after its initial release. On the other hand Thompson doesn't resort to sensationalism for the sake of sensationalism and this thriller is fairly straightforward without any outlandish or unbelievable scenes. This is one reason that I think makes it so good. The closest that you get to exploitative sleaziness involves Molloch's evil sister Claire Antoinette Bowerwho is a lesbian. Another scene has our hero wielding a mean pump action shotgun with deadly proficiency. Although he was past his prime at this point in his career Bronson is nevertheless in fine form as the gimleteyed tightlipped assassin. The grim finale at a mining compound where Molloch gets his comeuppance from past disfigured victims resembles the ending of Todd Browning's horror classic Freaks. The miners surround Molloch's car and shove long spikes through it with the villain trapped in the back seat with nowhere to run. The wild thing is that Joseph Maher is totally convincing as the heinous villain but as an actor he didn't specialize in villainous roles. Theresa Saldana is convincing as Jorge's wife who accompanies Holland on his mission. People who prefer their crime dramas with a hard boiled intensity will savor this grim saga. Ken Thorne's offbeat music is a plus.".

Yes this movie was basically made for the viewers to grow hate towards El Doctor and be really happy at the end when Charles Bronson wins and the village folks who the doctor has been torturing over the years come out corner him and simply tear him apart.Sure the movie is very graphic and the writers could have written a better script but the way the previous comment was written it leads me to believe the writer should stick to watching Disney or Pixar movies only! Guess what? The type of torture that is shown in the movie is VERY REAL and being from Central America myself I have heard the horror stories about real life sadistic bastards.I see the movie in a different way an educating way to let the rest of the world know what does REALLY go in my poor countries and although in real life there is no Hero like Charles Bronson's character at least the movie allows us to escape and dream of these sadistic bastards getting what they truly deserve in the end.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Evil That Men Do is at once typical and atypical Charles Bronson 1980s fare. On one hand it contains the grind house trademarks of graphic violence and gratuitous sex that characterized most of Bronson's eighties output. At the same time it touches on serious political themes that most of his other action films shied away from.In particular the film examines the torture being carried out by right wing Latin American regimes during that decade with tacit American support. Unlike most of the right wing vigilante films that Bronson appeared in this film takes a subtle if not particularly well explored left wing tack.The film's violence will not disappoint action or gore fans. The opening torture sequence reportedly heavily cut is still quite gruesome. Furthermore the villains meet some of the nastier deaths in action film history particularly in the bloody climax. The Columbia  TriStar DVD release renders all this in a beautifully restored print making it look like it was released yesterday rather than 26 years ago.However one cannot help but wish their had been a more open examination of the political themes that underlie the film particularly the American involvement in human rights abuses. The film itself begs for a remake focusing on torture during the War on Terror.".

	schema:reviewBody "During an eightyear stretch of the 1980s when Charles Bronson made nine films only one was released by a company other than the Cannon Group 'The Evil That Men Do' a TriStar Films pickup from Sir Lew Grade's ITC Entertainment firm. Bronson was already in the thick of his collaborations with director J. Lee Thompson which ran through numerous actioners until 'Kinjite Forbidden Subjects' in 1989.Expectations should run pretty high with Bronson and Thompson working for a betterfunded outfit like ITC but 'The Evil That Man Do' is a great disappointment on many levels. While still from the low budget Bmovie mold of the 1980s 'Evil' has tantalizing potential for a great film. Everyone in the production department however took an easy way out and sold hack work undeserving of Bronson's imprint. 'The Evil That Men Do' had a concept and technical resources that could have been used to make one of Bronson and Thompson's best films but instead will go down as one of their most average.This 1984 political thrilleractioner opens in brutal fashion with Clement Molloch Joseph Maher a British doctor holding his special training class for political leaders in Surinam. The grayhaired passive Molloch is an expert on torture methods who is employed by numerous political regimes. In the opening seven minutes we witness Molloch using electrical current to inflict unbearable pain on Jorge Hidalgo Jorge Humberto Robles a dissident journalist. As you may expect the scene is awful to watch and was cut from the original VHS release.Hidalgo was none other than a friend of Holland Bronson a retired assassin who is enjoying life in the Cayman Islands. Holland was approached by the journalist years before to rid humanity of Molloch but turned the offer down. A Mexican professor named Hector Lomelin Jos Ferrer visits shortly after Hidalgo's death to talk Holland into finishing the job bringing videotapes of testimony from The Doctor's victims. While in denial at first Holland eventually agrees to the dirty work targeting Molloch and his doting sister Claire Antoinette Bower in Guatemala.Holland enters Guatemala City with help from an adviser Max Ortiz Ren Enrquez he poses as a tourist with Hidalgo's widow Rhiana Theresa Saldana and young daughter Sarah Amanda Nicole Thomas in tow. As with most of Bronson's later output his character knocks off Molloch's henchmen one by one crossing paths with a sleazy American diplomat John Glover and his supporting hitman Roger Cudney along the way. A brutal ending takes place in the crevices of an opal mine where The Doctor gets just deserts from several of his victims.'The Evil That Men Do' is based on a forgotten novel by R. Lance Hill and jumps at American political dealings in Latin America during the 1980s. Indeed 'Evil' is hardboiled in every sense of the term as it uses sensationalism and doses of brutality to cover up huge weaknesses in plot and character development. For every plus this film has there are three or four minuses resulting from shod craftsmanship.While 'The Evil That Men Do' has a great concept the film is never truly more than an excuse for Bronson to wipe out foreignbased scum. In the style of bad pulp fiction 'Evil' is filled with cardboard characters that we never get to know or understand. Holland despite being played strongly by Bronson never talks about his inner feelings or explains what motivated him into becoming a killer for hire. Rhiana a terribly weak part for Theresa Saldana is disgusted by Holland for much of the way but later feels an affection for him. Where does her love come from especially after watching Holland kill several people and wanting to go home just a few scenes before?The most interesting characters are actually Molloch and his sister Claire because so many questions can be asked of them. Naturally we never find out what has brought them so close together how and where their torture dealings started what Claire's exact role in their business isThese plot holes can go on forever especially with the paintbynumbers storyline that seems to make things up as it goes along. Why is Hidalgo's daughter brought into such a dangerous situation other than for her to be conveniently taken hostage by Molloch? If Molloch's bodyguard Randolph Raymond St. Jacques clearly saw Holland and Rhiana in the cockfight arena why is he so friendly with them in a bar afterwords? Is his memory that short? And what really was the purpose other than cheap theatrics of Holland throwing Molloch's chauffeur Cillero Jorge Luke off a window ledge when the murder could have been handled more discreetly in Claire's apartment?The overall acting is decent and somehow Bronson gives one of his strongest performances. J. Lee Thompson's direction is lacking at points but may have been compromised by limited time on site. Besides Evil's filming in Mexico the presence of ITC is clear through better production values cinematography and music. Rural locations are wellused to convey the hot and dusty atmosphere of Latin America and cinematographer Xavier Cruz provides rich color and clarity. The orchestral score by Ken Thorne 'Murphy's War' is refreshing in an era of synthesized junk. Oddly enough these positives only add to the frustration of a good movie that is screaming to come out. Peter Lee Thompson's editing is better than usual although with more laughable continuity errors.'The Evil Than Men Do' was perfect grindhouse material for the early 80s and I find it hard to recommend for 21st century action fans. The DVD from Columbia TriStar Entertainment is an okay presentation offering widescreen and standard format with fourlanguage subtitles. While the video quality is well above average 'Evil' was originally recorded in plain mono audio. The theatrical trailer is offered and actually has a grindhouse feel with eroded color and fuzzy sound quality. out of 4".

	schema:reviewBody "One of the most widely hated films with the great late Charles Bronson The Evil That Men Do of 1984 is the nastiest most brutal and in my opinion one of his better collaborations with director J. Lee Thompson. I haven't seen The White Buffalo yet but their other collaborations include the decent 10 To Midnight the mediocre Murphy's Law and the godawful Death Wish 4. Even though far from flawless The Evil That Men Do is another highly entertaining Bronson flick with a supertough Bronson nonstop action and extreme brutality  can one ask for more? Bronson plays Holland a professional assassin who has retired to a tropic paradise on the Cayman Islands. When an old friend an oppositional journalist in a South American dictatorship is tortured to death by the English torture specialist 'The Doctor' Clement Molloch Jospeh Maher Holland decides to come out of retirement to avenge his friend and free Latin America of its most despicable torturer The Doctor who travels from one dictatorship to another in order to fulfill his evil deeds...Bronson is great and supertough as always and Joseph Maher makes a particularly evil bad guy. Bronson has had better roles playing a professional assassin  Sergio Sollima's great Citta Violenta is just one example. But he nevertheless kicks ass as Holland in this movie even if it is far away from being one of the masterpieces he has starred in. The only character that annoyed the hell out of me was that of Teresa Saldana who plays the wife of the friend Holland is out to avenge. On the one hand she wants Bronson to avenge her husband and put an end to the Doctor's evil deeds but on the other hand she keeps complaining when people get hurt. The violence is omnipresent and bloody the film begins with a torture scene that is more than a bit nasty. People keep complaining about the lack of character development and plot and about the violence. I wonder what people some people expect from a mid 80s action flick with Bronson that runs 87 minutes. Citizen Kane? Charles Bronson is one of my favorite actors and director J. Lee Thompson was doubtlessly talented which great films like Cape Fear 1962 prove. I admit that their collaborations were not exactly masterpieces but most of them such as this one are pure violent fun made strictly for entertainment purposes. And that is exactly what The Evil That Men Do provides Pure violent entertainment! Enjoy!".

Bronson plays on that to get his man.Also note some good work from Raymond St. Jacques as Maher's number one assistant and from John Glover a sleazy CIA station chief in Central America who apparently Maher and company can call on for help.Jose Ferrer is in the film all too briefly at the beginning as he hires Bronson on Saldana's behalf. He's always been a favorite of mine I wish there was more of him here.As for the climax Director J. Lee Thompson took his inspiration from Tennessee Williams's Suddenly Last Summer.

	schema:reviewBody "Yet again director J. Lee Thompson unites with actor Charles Bronson for a violent and uncompromising action flick. In fact this is probably Bronson's most brutal film quite a feat for a man who appeared in Death Wish Ten To Midnight and Chato's Land. However brutality doesn't on its own make for a good film and The Evil That Men Do is ultimately a disappointment. If you were to take away its brutality the film would have precious little else of interest. The story is about a retired hitman Bronson who lives a cosy life on a Caribbean island. He is persuaded to come out of retirement to track down and eliminate a sadistic torture doctor who has been plying his vile trade around various South American hellholes. Throughout the film especially at the beginning we are treated to some graphic torture scenes to show us just what a nasty piece of work he is. These themes are actually quite serious. Torture does go on in suppressive Latin American dictatorships and everyday folk are made to suffer some despicably painful experiences simply for voicing an unpopular viewpoint. But The Evil That Men Do  for all its worthy posturing  isn't really bothered about the plight of these poor people. It is bothered purely with giving Charles Bronson an excuse to blow away some unpleasant scumbags. It's just an exploitative actioner which hangs its coat on genuine issues. The torture sequences make you the viewer feel like a dirty sickinthehead voyeur rather like someone who gains pleasure from viewing snuff movies. The script is full of horrid dialogue including some excessive descriptions of acts of torture. The Evil That Men Do fails to explore its disturbing ideas... its serves them up as entertainment and asks us to enjoy them. Sorry but that's just wrong.".

	schema:reviewBody "In recent times I've been watching the collaborations between director J. Lee Thompson and actor Charles Bronson with pretty decent results. The Evil that Men Do was somewhat an interesting and cynically effective little shocker. From the very beginning you realise this gritty bgrade fodder is looking to simply shock you with its sadistic subject of torture for political ground and the hidden acceptance of it in the governments that makes Maher's pitiless character believe his actions of the trade to be far from evil. The material stays powerful scathing and covered with moral questioning. It's always seems to be about retribution and finding it in themselves to take that next step. Even when it isn't visually hardhitting the despairing oral context can get under your skin. Strictly the tone and style Thompson opts for is unpleasant rough and icecold.I was engrossed but then the formula but still packing an excessive sting changed to a bythenumbers revenge spin and an unconvincingly irate Theresa Saldana floods the screen. I just didn't buy her and the chemistry with Bronson felt weak. Joseph Maher easy performance drips with a strangely subtle intensity of callousness that's purely evil. He's not some demanding towering presence but those vile sadistic acts and unflinching cruelty comes second nature for this character that just listening to his softly spoken voice is very uneasy. Charles Bronson's calculated stalwart and quite mystique turn is hard to switch off because he makes this character an allout professional killer with a more humane view of things and managing to keep his selfrighteousness intact.Thompson's raw tactical direction utilises the lowbudget and working in its favour is the grimy fadeout look from the authentically seedy urban consolidations to the sparse desert locations. A harrowing music score by Ken Thorne has a slight and edgy tinge and Javier Ruvalcaba Cruz's tight voyeuristic cinematography hit's the mark. When called upon the tension stays hardboiled and some scenes pack an abrasive bite as the meaningful violence is highly explicit and explosive. However it's not an allout torture parade full of senseless snapshots. Antoinette Bower Jose Ferrer and Max Ortiz offer strong support.Rather a effortless manner by all but certainly it does the daring job it sets out to do.".

	schema:headline " Dignity in Death";
	schema:reviewBody "Not the simple 'Death Wish' variant that one might expect from the title posters and casting of Charles Bronson as an assassin 'The Evil That Men Do' is actually light on violence and heavy on atmosphere as the plot focuses on Bronson working out how to stop a sadistic doctor from operating. Joseph Maher is excellent as the doctor in question clearly modeled on Josef Mengele who is employed by various governments to devise the most torturous ways possible to kill death row inmates. As such the film walks an unusual moral line as Bronson is hired by those who believe in dignity in death rather than those against state sanctioned killings. However one feels about the film's stance on vigilantism torture and violence the project looks and sounds great with the reliable J. Lee Thompson at the helm. There are several effective handheld shots throughout the unsteadiness of which sets one on edge and Ken Thorne's music score is spinetingling. The chief setback here is the acting. Bronson does okay within the confines of his role pretending to be a family man by travelling with a friend's widow and daughter however the young actress who plays the daughter is terrible with rehearsed line delivery all the way and Theresa Saldana is even worse as the frantic widow reacting melodramatically to everything. Maher is great as mentioned though and the talented supporting cast includes Jos Ferrer and John Glover.

	onyx:emotionText "Not the simple 'Death Wish' variant that one might expect from the title posters and casting of Charles Bronson as an assassin 'The Evil That Men Do' is actually light on violence and heavy on atmosphere as the plot focuses on Bronson working out how to stop a sadistic doctor from operating. Joseph Maher is excellent as the doctor in question clearly modeled on Josef Mengele who is employed by various governments to devise the most torturous ways possible to kill death row inmates. As such the film walks an unusual moral line as Bronson is hired by those who believe in dignity in death rather than those against state sanctioned killings. However one feels about the film's stance on vigilantism torture and violence the project looks and sounds great with the reliable J. Lee Thompson at the helm. There are several effective handheld shots throughout the unsteadiness of which sets one on edge and Ken Thorne's music score is spinetingling. The chief setback here is the acting. Bronson does okay within the confines of his role pretending to be a family man by travelling with a friend's widow and daughter however the young actress who plays the daughter is terrible with rehearsed line delivery all the way and Theresa Saldana is even worse as the frantic widow reacting melodramatically to everything. Maher is great as mentioned though and the talented supporting cast includes Jos Ferrer and John Glover. The action scenes are also solid if a long way coming and the final showdown is hard to forget with Maher's past almost literally coming back to haunt him.";

But still any avid fan of 80's action cinema is likely to track this baby down because A Charlie's the man and B his collaborations with director J. Lee Thompson practically always resulted in violent and excessively sadistic action vehicles. Remember 10 to Midnight and Messenger of Death? Well the violence featuring in The Evil that Men Do is even more gratuitous and explicit including extended sequences of people getting tortured and mutilated for sheer kicks and Bronson himself aiming his shotgun at his opponents' faces just for the sake of making the carnage messier. Hit man Holland leaves his tropical retirement island to assassinate a sadistic professional torturer who of course secretly works for the government of an oppressed South American nation. The doctor's character is clearly inspired by Dr. Josef Mengele the Nazi surgeon infamous for performing experiments upon concentration camp inmates. Holland goes after Dr. Molloch accompanied by a fake nagging wife and child and quickly notices that the doctor is surrounded by a whole army of security guards and government paid henchmen. The Evil That Men Do is far from the best Charlie Bronson action flick but it nevertheless contains a handful of effectively repulsive moments  among which the uncanny albeit derivative climax sequence  and a few remarkable performances. Bronson is his good old self here but he receives impressive support from Joseph Maher as the evilpersonified doctor. Before seeing this film I only knew Maher from playing one of the jolly old dudes in the 90's comedy I.Q and I assure it's quite a shock to now see him as one of the most relentless and malignant villains of 80's cinema. Yup it's an overall mediocre and very forgettable movie worthy of the bad reviews it receives but it's also occasionally exciting and good for a few thrills.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Evil That Men Do 1984  out of 4 A killer Charles Bronson comes out of retirement after he learns that a close friend was tortured and murdered by a sadistic man known as El Doctor Joseph Maher.There's really not too much plot in THE EVIL THAT MEN DO which will probably disappoint fans of the novel. The film is actually based around some very political events and I think had the producers decided to go into a different direction then you could have had an above average thriller. Instead the political side is pretty much sucked dry and we're given your typical Bronson picture with him playing a vigilante. As much as I love Bronson I must admit that this here is probably my least favorite of the films he made during the 80s.One of the biggest problems with the film is that it just seems to be missing a certain something. As I said the film could have been a lot more political and I think it's rather obvious that this is missing. There are times where certain government members are missing but none of it goes into great detail and instead we just see Bronson going around and killing members of the party until he can track down the doctor. Even the revenge aspect is pretty silly at times and especially since so much screen time has Bronson sitting in a car outside various locations. You'd think his obvious sitting would be noticed by one of the countless men watching for people looking at the compound.I will say that Bronson turns in a good and believable performance. I thought he was obviously believable in the part but he also managed to be funny at times as well as show a more tender side when called for. Maher is also extremely good as the sadistic doctor and we also got nice performances from Antoinette Bower and John Glover. Raymond St. Jacques is also very good in his supporting role. Theresa Saldana plays the semi love interest but I found her to be extremely weak in the film. It also didn't help the story that there's really no reason for her to be in the film as it's highly unlikely that a professional killer would have her tag along.THE EVIL THAT MEN DO also suffers from some poor pacing but director J. Lee Thompson does bring some nice suspense to the ending. However that just comes along way too late and in the end this is just your typical B action movie.".

One piloted by Walker manages to crash land on a nearby uncharted island which happens to be inhabited by a small contingent of Japanese soldiers.  Directed by Sinatra in his one and only try the film demonstrates the parallels and differences between these small units of soldiers on opposing sides and with varying backgrounds.  Much of the film is devoted to the Japanese point of view as they are led by Mihashi and most of it is presented in their native tongue with subtitles.  The rest concerns Walker who takes charge of the remaining men Sinatra a boozy medic Sands a hopelessly eager upstart and Dexter a grizzled Sergeant. Hostility between the enemies finally gives way to a sort of truce or at least a ceasefire until finally the men must live up to their country's expectations of eliminating each other.  There's a lot of good in the film. It was an early example of showing more than one perspective with regards to enemies of America and it demonstrates at times rather well the ultimate futility and wastefulness of war.  However Sinatra as a director is in a bit over his head and the film is often static or choppy in it's narrative. There are also a ridiculous amount of scenes in which characters stay alive simply because either the enemy stops shooting for no reason or else misses by a mile.  A lot of this could have been rectified in the staging of the battle sequences.  Sinatra's role in the film is actually a supporting one mostly consisting of one queasy unbearably nervetingling sequence in which he is traded to the Japanese in order to perform surgery on one of their men.  Otherwise he is just onhand to provide the occasional snarky remark.  Walker is a tower of virility and quiet strength.  NO ONE wore a helmet like him or filled out their fatigues with more monumentlike beauty. His enthralling baritone voice and piercing iceblue eyes make sitting through this film a little more enjoyable than it could have been without him.  Sands is so unintentionally hilarious and so jawdroppingly bad that his scenes ascend into some crazed parodic comic stratosphere!  WHAT was he thinking?  It's like some teenage punk decided to portray a soldier the way he always dreamed of when in his sandbox as a child.  His jaw his posture his accent.....all combine to create a memorably uproarious caricature. Dexter the alwaysforgotten member of The Magnificent Seven has a couple of decent moments notably in a conflict with Walker.  Other soldiers are portrayed by healthylooking earnest actors who fit their roles well though most of them don't get a chance to really shine.  There are two very brief flashbacks by Mihashi and Walker that present the lady loves of their lives.  Walker's is played with hair and makeup that are about as 1940's as Sharon Tate in Valley of the Dolls! by Stephens in her film debut. Though uneven the film succeeds in presenting the enemy as human and in promoting the power of goodwill.  The fact that Walker in every frame is breathtakingly handsome is gravy.  Oddly he is pictured NOWHERE on the video box even though he is actually the leading man of the film!".

	schema:reviewBody "It's probably a mistake to say that this is Frank Sinatra's only effort at directing. Truth be told starting with Ocean's 11 he directed about half the films he was in whoever's name is in the credits was just a puppet. Frank was also producing as well probably though he didn't want the public to get the idea he was Orson Welles.Maybe it would have taken an Orson Welles to have made None But the Brave a classic film but Sinatra in his only formal effort at directing doesn't do a bad job except for his then soninlaw Tommy Sands. In fact he anticipates Clint Eastwood's Iwo Jima films by 40 years.This isn't Iwo Jima exactly it's a small backwater island in the Pacific where a squad of Japanese soldiers have been cut off and are living off the land so to speak. A Navy transport plane is shot down with a squad of U.S. Marines on board. Pilot Clint Walker crash lands safely on that selfsame island and saves most of them but they are also cut off. After a lot skirmishing mostly between Walker and Sands with Walker trying to prevent newly commissioned second lieutenant Sands from doing something stupid like charging the Japanese headlong the two groups agree to opt out of World War II. An interesting thing happens both find that they have a lot in common. We already know that in seeing the film from the Japanese point also with subtitles.The Japanese players are unknown to we occidentals for the most part but I looked and found several like Tatsuya Mihashi as the Japanese commander Takeshi Kato as their sergeant and Homere Suguro as the corporal who has his leg amputated by Frank Sinatra had substantial careers in Japanese cinema. The player on that side I liked most however was Ryucho Shunputei as the simple Japanese private who fishes and quite frankly is the key to their survival. I'm betting he wasn't exactly in the Samurai tradition in combat but his skill at the profession he left behind is keeping his whole group alive.For himself Frank Sinatra took the part of a Navy Corpsman who is the only nonMarine beside Walker on the American side. The part fits him quite well indeed. This was the film where Brad Dexter who's the Marine sergeant in the film saved Frank Sinatra from drowning when old Blue Eyes was swimming and was nearly swept out to sea by the undertow. Bing Crosby's son Phil had a small role as one of the Marines no doubt a favor from Old Blue Eyes to the Old Groaner.Frank Sinatra could be vindictive however and I had never thought about it before but another reviewer's comments about Tommy Sands made me reconsider his performance. Maybe Frank was actually trying to mess his career up. Sands as the green second lieutenant is almost a caricature of one. He's so bad in the role maybe it was lousy directing for him only.Other than that Frank did not do a half bad job. It's not a great film but it's not bad either and it does raise some interesting questions about people in combat situations.".

Hard to decide if Tommy Sands' performance as the hardasnails rookie lieutenant is howlingly funny or just outrageously bad. This is Hollywood's version of war. It's watchable only if you don't mind being clubbed over the head with the message every few minutes that being why can't we all just get along? As a lifelong fan of Sinatra I'm hugely disappointed.";

	schema:headline " Enjoyable Sinatra film in which an American plane crashlands on an island already inhabited by stranded Japanese forces";
	schema:reviewBody "The title is from John Dryden's poem Alexander's Feast stanza 1 None but the brave deserve the fair . Sinatra's directorial debut  it results to be an efficient effort  a straightforward and gripping movie  being the first JapaneseAmerican coproduction . During WWII  an American bomber aircraft is gunned down and crashes on an island the plane flown that was shot down was R4D C47 transport . American and marooned Japanese soldiers survivors from a Japanese battalion are stranded on a tiny Pacific island  in the Salomons  during World War II . But in this uninhabited island in the Pacific Ocean there is one Japanese military group and both of them stranded together . There takes place a physical and psychological battle between AmericanJapanese with antiwar allegory . After a skirmish  the two bunches initiate a fragile truce with the understanding that fighting will resume if one or the other sends for help . The Japanse detachment who are mercifully allowed to speak Japanese is commanded Lt. Kuroki Tatsuya Mihashi  as the film being told through the eyes of this Japanese unit commander . The American group is commanded by Capt. Dennis Bourke Clint Walker who must deal with an atmosphere of growing distrust and tension between their men . They confront each other in a violent miniwar but then come to terms with each other . . There  they must cease their hostility and unite themselves if they want to survive until a disappointing and unexpected ending . The Marines hold heavy weapons  M1  Grease gun  carbine and 45 cal pistol against the Japanese rifle and hand grenade . Soonafter  the American attempt to capture a boat laboriously built by the Japanese . The American repair their radio unit  then  things go wrong and they must decide on their next unsettling actions . This movie's closing end coda states Nobody Ever Wins .Nice and well executed film set during WWII  containing a brief antiwar declaration . The plot is plain as well as simple and prefigures John Boorman's Hell in Pacific  dealing with a platoon of Marines crashlands on a tiny Pacific island occupied by a small Japanese unit and must make a temporary truce and cooperate to survive various tribulations . The film has a carefully constructed mood as the two groups warily circle each other and spasmodically clashing in battle  including an antiwar message ingeniously overplayed . However  being stupidly fractured by two inappropriate flashbacks  obviously designed to provide the ordinary love interest . The movie sometimes lapses into tedium and slowness  though contains striking images with moments of great power and adequate scenarios . Here Sinatra gives a very good acting as the sympathetic but drunk doctor . Known as OneTake Charlie for his approach to acting that strove for spontaneity and energy rather than perfection  Sinatra was an instinctive actor who was best at playing parts that mirrored his own personality . The remaining cast is pretty good  such as  the tall Clint Walker who bears the main role  Brad Dexter from Magnificent seven  Tony Bill  Rafer Johnson as Pvt. Johnson  Tommy Sands who costars in the movie divorced Nancy Sinatra Frank Sinatra's daughter  the same year this picture came out and Richard Sinatra  Frank Sinatra's cousin appears as Private Roth . And special mention for Tatsuya Mihashi as Lt. Kuroki . This is the first JapaneseAmerican coproduction produced by Kikumaru Okuda for Toho Studios and by Frank Sinatra for Warner Brothers  being professionally directed by Frank who displays great competence as an action filmmaker with some scenes that are decently choreographed and memorable fight shots of both sides when they destroy their means of getaway . Frank Sinatra's only film as director and his 6th out of nine films as producer  though he also made 2 episodes The Frank Sinatra Show TV Series . Sinatra's biggest hit was his role as Maggio in From Here to eternity 1953 . He won an Oscar for best supporting actor and followed this with a scintillating performance as a coldblooded assassin hired to kill the US President in Suddenly 1954. Arguably a careerbest performance  garnering him an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor  was his role as a pathetic heroin addict in the powerful drama The man with the Golden arm 1955. He continued to give strong and memorable performances in such films as Guys and dolls 1955 and Some come running 1958. In the late 1950s and 1960s Sinatra became somewhat prolific as a producer turning out such films as A hole in the head 1959  Sergeant 3 1962 and the very successful Robin and 7 Hoods 1964. Lighter roles alongside Rat Pack buddies Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. were lucrative especially the famed Ocean's eleven 1960. On the other hand he alternated such projects with much more serious offerings such as The Manchurian Candidate 1962 regarded by many critics as Sinatra's finest picture . That same year Von Ryan 1965 was a box office sensation . In 1967 Sinatra returned to familiar territory in Sidney J. Furie's The naked runner 1967  once again playing masterfully in his only film to be shot in the U.K. and Germany . That same year he starred as a private investigator in Tony Rome 1967 a role he reprised in the sequel  Lady in cement 1968. He also starred with Lee Remick in The detective 1968 a film daring for its time with its engaging theme and it was a major boxoffice success.".

When we use war to achieve a right event such as the defeat of Nazism in World War II it was often avoidable had some other peaceful action been taken earlier. Proper humane treatment of Germany after World War I may have prevented the outbreak of World War II. None But the Brave is an earnest attempt to show that the differences between men in war can often be settled peacefully and working together for mutual survival often assures peace and serenity.The plot of the movie is rather straightforward. A plane carrying about a dozen American soldiers crashes on a small Pacific atoll where the remnants of a Japanese garrison have been all but forgotten by their superiors. About equal in numbers the two opposing parties attempt to fight it out but then realize the hopelessness of confrontation and instead form a peace in order to share fresh water food and medical supplies.The two leads Clint Walker The Dirty Dozen and Tatsuya Mihashi Tora! Tora! Tora! both shine in their roles. The two men are parallels both have a sense of patriotism and devotion to their nation and the men under their command yet both are humanists who see no point in destruction. During the truce the two form a true friendship coming to understand their respective backgrounds and personal life stories with respect and admiration for each other.The supporting cast is generally filled with clichd familiar characters a tough sergeant a grizzled corporal some inexperienced grunts etc. but the story really isn't about them. Tommy Sands The Longest Day plays a green lieutenant out for blood and his acting is far over the top. There's a story behind this and it's unfortunate that his delivery strongly distracts from the story. Frank Sinatra has little to do as he was busy in the director's chair but there is a great extended scene revolving around a leg amputation where his limited dialog and great facial expressions more than deliver the goods. When Sinatra had substantial screen time he used it well but unfortunately he didn't give himself enough to do and his character is basically a waste of energy.Director of Photography Harold Lipstein Hell is for Heroes does a fantastic job with the Pacific locations. The steamy tropical jungle truly comes alive especially during a fabulous scene in which a monsoon sweeps over the island. Sinatra's direction lacks flair and most of the action sequences are straightforward and bland. The firefight revolving around a Japanese boat is also grim and gritty and the final confrontation between the Japanese and Americans really delivers mostly because of the blatant antiwar message which comes about 30 seconds after the shooting stops.The movie features a rather boring score by John Williams who was just starting to break into writing film scores in 1965 most of his work had been in television prior to this film. Eiji Tsuburaya of Godzilla fame supervised the special effects work and unfortunately I have always found his work belowpar when compared to some of the innovations Hollywood could afford during this period. There's a scene in which two model planes on strings blast away at each other in the same manner toy airplanes fired rockets at monsters as they attacked Tokyo. I can understand the Japanese cast and crew since this was a joint production but someone else should have been running the special effects department.These are just minor nitpicks. Sinatra does a very good job directing this film and he has taken far too much criticism from other reviewers. The statements made in this film are bold and honest and there are many moving moments. The final act is a brilliant exercise depicting the waste and futility of war. If everyone could not only watch but understand the philosophy portrayed in this movie perhaps the world would be a more peaceful place.".

	schema:reviewBody "No one really doubts Sinatra's prowess or talents as an actor. When he got a part he could sink his teeth into From Here to Eternity or one that fit him like a glove The Detective he could be brilliant. At other times he could just walk through a part Ocean's 11 or be actually lousy the Tony Rome series. There are flashes of all these facets of Sinatra in this movie and the premise of the film itself is a good one but Sinatra's shortcomings as a director pretty much torpedo whatever chance this movie had to stand out as something really different. Obviously the film meant a great deal to him as it was the first time he decided to direct a movie himself. The three scriptwriters two Japanese one American put together a good story about two groups of opponents stranded on a deserted island who must at least tolerate each other in order to survive and soon realize that not only must they tolerate each other but they actually have to depend on each other. Part of the problem is in some of the performances. Clint Walker is OK a bit better than in many of his films but not especially noteworthy. However he is Laurence Olivier compared to Tommy Sands. Sands who plays an inexperienced lieutenant hasn't the slightest inkling of what he's doing his idea of exercising authority among his men for example is to thrust forward his jaw lower his voice look angry and bark. It's an entirely onenote performance and that note is offkey almost beyond belief. He is so unalterably unbelievably bad that your first reaction is Where's a sniper when you need one? I don't buy the theory that Sinatra directed Sands to act that way as revenge for his having divorced Sinatra's daughter. The other performances range from adequate to quite good especially the lead Japanese actors so it looks like Sands' performance was entirely his own idea. That explains why he only made one more movie. Sands just wasn't a good enough actor to make a go of it as a perusal of any of his other movies will attest especially 1958's Sing Boy Sing where his performance is almost as jawdroppingly awful as it is here showing that he had learned absolutely nothing in the seven years between that picture and this one.The film starts out well gets a little sluggish in the middle and has a bit more pontificating than is really necessary but overall it's not really a bad picture even though you could see the ending coming a mile away. It's just that if the film meant so much to Sinatra he should have hired an experienced director suited to this kind of pictureJohn Sturges comes to mindand concentrated on his performance which is frankly uneven. This was actually an innovative idea for its time 1965 offhand I can't think of any other film of that period that portrayed the Japanese as even remotely human Cornel Wilde's Beach Red did but that came two years later. Sinatra had a good idea in this film. It's just too bad that he really didn't know how to get it to come across.".

Not one of his better performances. He plays a boozy doctor also named Francis like him !. When he isn't drunk and spouting moralising stories he manages to expertly amputate the leg of a wounded Japanese soldier.Others have mentioned Sands' performance. It really is awful and amateurish. Frank should have cut his whole sorry performance out and that would have improved the film...a bit anyway.There was also too much insubordination and disobeying of orders especially on the Japanese side I thought. I don't think the Japanese would have behaved like that with their code of honour and obedience.Overall a very poor film and maybe that was why Frank never tried directing again. Although to his credit he didn't try to come across as the big star and gave others a fair chance.".

Had anyone wanted to make such a film in the 1940s they might just have been strung up for the film's very unusual sensibilities. Unlike older war films in this one the Japanese are humanized a great deal and it's obvious that the film was made during the antiwar 60s though early in the antiwar years. In many ways this is a good thingshowing that people on both sides could be decent. Though in some ways the whole thing seemed a bit hard to believeafter all very very few Japanese officers would have admitted to not having faith in the warthis was a very 1960s sentiment.As for the acting it was generally good. Clint Walker was clearly the star though Frank Sinatra had a decent costarring role in this film that he both produced and directed. The Japanese actors also were pretty good. The only weak point was the way Tommy Sands' character was writtenhe was like a onedimensional caricature instead of a real soldier. No young lieutenant is THAT obnoxious and stupid!! Overall an entertaining film but one that strains credibility as the concept behind the film just doesn't make much sense for the 1940s. Still if you can stop those voices in your head from complaining about the plot it's a good and very different movie.".

	schema:headline " The Best WW2 Movie of 1965";
	schema:reviewBody "I was very impressed with this movie. The Technicolor was amazing and Frank Sinatra was good in it. The movie was basically about a bunch of Marine's that crash onto an island in their plane. Once they are there the Japanese start to attack them at every opportunity. The lieutenant was over the top. He would yell stuff like I AM TIRED OF THE WAY YOUR ARE RUNNING THIS PLATOON! ARE YOU QUESTIONING MY AUTHORITY? He would open his mouth literally as WIDE OPEN as it could go with EACH AND EVERY WORD. I am not kidding either. In once scene he said I AM GOING TO KILL ME SOME DIRTY JAPS to which Frank Sinatra replied Dirty Japs lieutenant? Why they invented the bathroom! Anyway the Japs and the American's eventually discover that nobody will come to rescue them from the Island so they decide to have a truce and become friends. There was this one FAT Japanese soldier that looked like the guy from Gilligan's Island round glasses. It was quite funny. Also the Japanese in this movie were not as ruthless as they were in reality. Another unrealistic scene was when this Japanese fisherman was being held at gunpoint by a Marine. So the Japanese fisherman starts laughing. The Marine instantly started to laugh as well and traded a few cigarettes for some fish. The ending was very violent and unrealistic as well. However  the highlight of this movie was definitely the lieutenant. I have tried to imitate him and it's literally hard on the jaw muscles to talk that way.".

	schema:headline " A Director's Dream Come True";
	schema:reviewBody "How lucky can you be to get a script like this and a cast like this all in the same movie? I've been shocked at some of the negative comments by other viewers. I was quite young when the movie came out and didn't realize for years that Peter O'Toole wasn't the fifty year old he was playing and Hepburn was exactly Eleanor's age at the time so I fail to see the age mismatched some have mentioned. I'm fifty myself now and I still find O'Toole perfectly plausible as a fifty year old in this movie. Although DAMN he looked GOOD! What a gorgeous man!As for the 'anachronistic dialog' it was extremely intentional and would have been totally wrong without it. To our ears the possibly more elegant speech of the period would have sounded unnatural only by using modern language could these people sound to us as they would have sounded to each other  normal.The acting is brilliant  it would have been very hard to find any other actor who could share a screen with Hepburn without fading away to nothing or an actress who could have done the same with O'Toole  only two of such power could stand up to one another. And this was absolutely right for these characters  as best we know Henry and Eleanor were both that kind of person  brilliant witty strongwilled powerhouses. Then the supporting cast Hopkins Castle Terry and Dalton. Granted they weren't known at the time so Harvey the director may not have realized right off the bat that he had the cast of a lifetime but he surely must have realized it fast.Then there's the script. Like most of Oscar Wilde's plays you could pick it up open it to any page and find at least half a dozen quotable lines. No people aren't normally that witty in real life but a these were VERY bright people as historical fact and b it's a playmovie! People don't speak in real life as they do in Oscar Wilde either but it's enjoyable as hell to watch. Get over it!Some things I love about the movie are that it's made clear that no matter what Henry tells Alys Eleanor or himself for that matter his real love and true equal is always Eleanor just as he is hers. Also that despite the at least a dozen apparent power shifts in the course of the movie at the end ABSOLUTELY NOTHING has changed. And you can tell that with this bunch nothing ever will change unless it's due to factors out of their control like death.A matter of slight historical correction to other user comments Alys was legally betrothed to Richard that's why she'd been raised by Eleanor. A historical correction to the script is that John while thoroughly detestable personally was not at all stupid sniveling or whining his actual character was actually far closer to that of Geoffrey's in the script. Very little is actually known about the historical Geoffrey except that he was actually if anything more of a warrior than Richard and of course he died quite young leaving behind two children the son being the legal heir to Richard and who died at the age of twelve or so ostensibly of disease possibly in reality of John. This wasn't considered that bad a thing btw as no one wanted a child as king and John was the only one of the whole bunch who'd spent most of his life in England itself. The English nobles had seriously resented both Henry's in his later years especially as he tried to carve an inheritance for John out of Europe in general France in particular and Richard's neglect Richard had barely set foot in England in his entire life and was utterly indifferent to it except as a source of revenue. Also of course there's no historical evidence for an affair between Henry and Alys EXCEPT that I've read at least one source suggesting that Richard used this as an excuse to not go through with the marriage itself. And there's CERTAINLY no historical suggestion that Richard and Philip had an affair although it seems highly likely that Richard was gay insofar as he was sexual at all. Bastards of royalty were a dime a dozen in those days but NONE are attributed to Richard nor a whiff or rumor of any affairs he ever had. Both Henry and John on the other hand would chase anything wearing a dress and this was considered perfectly normal and even admirable in a bad boy sort of way. However John took it too far resorting to rape and starvation of wives of political enemies and this was one of numerous driving forces for the imposition of Magna Carta on him by his rebelling nobles. Ironically by contemporary standards at a national level John was a far better king than Richard Henry at his best was better but was too often not at his best being too bent on conquest to bother to rule effectively what he already had. However John was nonetheless personally a rather nasty man to put it mildly once again proving that the best men don't necessarily make the best rulers. His personal character and actions more than his policies drove his own nobles into nearly successful rebellion resulting in Magna Carta one of the great steps in English history.Sorry for boring you silly with the history commentary  it's a period I've always found particularly interesting. You can wake up now I'm finished.Anyway great movie in every sense  script acting score cinematography editing it just doesn't get better than this.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Lion in Winter is a crowning achievement in cinematic storytelling. Adapted by Oscarwinning James Goldman from his witty triumphant 1966 Broadway play that originally starred Robert Preston and Tonywinner Rosemary Harris the story evolves around aging King Henry II mulling over a successor to the Plantagenet throne among his male progeny while bringing his estranged hateful clan together for the Christmas holidays.Sparks really do fly in this wickedly elaborate chess game as the  family player pieces weave thick webs of deceit and hatch insidious plots against each another forming unholy protean alliances that put those Survivor contestants to shame.  The pure joy comes from seeing all of them try to outmaneuver each other with every new and different playing piece put on or taken off the board hatching alternative schemes as fast as one can say Long live the King!Robust boisterous Peter O'Toole is a raging marvel as the battered but not yet beaten monarch agonizing over the untrusting Machiavellianlike brood he's sired yet relishing the absolute power he holds and dangles over them. The glorious O'Toole is alternately barbarous and bombastic in one of the best roles of his career and his loss of the Academy Award over of all people John Wayne remains a travesty of justice.The king's brood includes eldest son and heirapparent Richard known as The Lionhearted whose fierce courage and burly warrior stance masquerades a forbidden tenderness detrimental to his standing as a king.  Anthony Hopkins in an auspicious screen debut embodies these tortuous complexities within Richard perfectly especially in his scenes as mummy's favorite. The youngest and pruniest of the three princes is John a rumpled drooling inane manchild impossibly spoiled as the King's favorite played to pathetic amusement by a terrific Nigel Terry.  Neglected middle son Geoffrey excellently portrayed with jaded slivereyed cunning by John Castle is a human blueprint of treachery and deceit.  Resentful at being overlooked as even a possible contender he's willing to sell his parents and brothers down the river for exact change.Also invited to Christmas court is King Phillip II of France on a revenge mission himself who locks horns with Henry over lost lands and becomes a willing participant in these underhanded games.  Timothy 007 Dalton drips with smug venal charm as the slender softer inexperienced king who can only battle Henry with words and wit not weight.  The only unblemished pawn here is Alais the King's adoring young mistress who is maliciously thrown to the lions by all as ladyinwaiting bait for the dueling princes. Demure fragile Jane Merrow is the perfect choice for this innocent songbird with nothing and everything to loseI have saved the best performance for last.  As the King most duplicitous irritant the inimitable Katharine Hepburn portrays Henry's duly banished Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine with all the unparalleled skill and inspired passion imaginable.  Handed on a silver platter the lion's share of the best lines Hepburn more than delivers the goods here stealing the ripe proceedings from her talented costars.  To watch her consummate Eleanor is to see the art of acting in its most passionate form.  She is a revelation of perks and prods of vibrant colors and shadings.  She inhabits the passion the power the breeding the deceitfulness the desperate longing owed this character.  Imprisonment for inciting rebellions against her husband has not dampened the fighting spirit nor dulled the sharp calculating mind of this Queen.  As in chess this player is the game's most venturesome and versatile piece and Hepburn more than lives up to its reputation a worthy opponent with the best odds to checkmate her King. I have been known to say that the fourtime Oscar winner was awarded for all the wrong movies  excepting this one.  She is unforgettable.Topped with a glorious inspiring sometimes furious score Oscarwinner John Barry The Lion in Winter makes up for its stark onenote surroundings with its bold rich characters and ingenuous plotting.  It is a hallmark of Gothic temperament and tone. As the old adage goes it's not who wins it's how you play the game.  'Tis so true.  So let the games begin!".

	schema:reviewBody "This by all means should have been the film to do a clean sweep at the Oscars come 1969 but as fate would have it only three wins Best Actress Writing from Another Medium and Music. The storytelling is so simple yet so powerful and the acting is of such a high order that it seems timeless despite being a Historical Drama set in the 12th century.Set on the course of one night King Henry II Peter O'Toole has a family reunion to see who of his three sons will be his successor to the throne although he has his eyes set on John Nigel Terry but his imprisoned wife Queen Eleanor of Acquitaine played to perfection by Katharine Hepburn has other plans which involve her own favorite Richard Anthony Hopkins in his film debut. Matters get complicated when neglected son Geoffrey John Castle pretends to be on John's side to serve his own interests and when Eleanor encounters Henry's mistress Alais Jane Merrow and will not cede the Acquitaine to Henry. Into the mix is a revelation from newly appointed King Philip of France Timothy Dalton in which he states that Richard had raped him when in fact they had had an affair. Floating above the overlapping intrigues is Henry not quite able to decide just what will the course of action to take and when he learns that his sons have been conspiring to overthrow him thanks to Eleanor he almost gets painted into a corner and makes an impossible decision.This is a fascinating story written so eloquently and performed so powerfully onscreen that one forgets this was originally a stage play with Robert Preston and Rosemary Harris in the leads. No sumptuous decorations this while being a family of noble extraction they live devoid of the commodities that one would imagine coming from them. Of course chemistry just overflows whenever Hepburn and O'Toole are together onscreen it makes one think of the best matches in cinema history and is a shame they never worked together again as she was fond of him. If anything they alone are the movie and never for a moment does one get bored even though the only action sequence is a scene where O'Toole drags Merrow to force her to marry Hopkins while Hepburn quietly monitors them. A beautiful film timeless in its theme of family and inheritances with shrewd performances the best movie for 1968.".

It combines drama tragedy razorsharp comedy great performances and the best dialogue that has ever been spoken on film period.I found this movie quite by accidentI was a sixteenyearold with a Katharine Hepburn fixation. She mesmerized me I wanted to BE hersmart beautiful sexy and unwilling and unable to take anything off of anybody except for Spencer Tracy but that's another story. Honestly I had no idea that there really had been such a person as Eleanor until I saw this movie. After watching my heroine portray her I was determined to find out though...so I have Katharine Hepburn to thank for my discovery of a new personal hero and for my passion for medieval history.It is true that this movie is not 100 factually accurate not only because movie making dictates tinkering with history to create an interesting film but also because unfortunately not too much is known about Eleanor herself. In the middle ages women even powerful intriguing women like Eleanor were not considered important enough to merit full biographical treatment. Most of Eleanor's history is recorded in the context of her sons and husbands. A good deal of this history was written by her detractorspeople who disliked or disapproved of her for one reason or another. The simple explanation is that they felt that as a woman she overstepped the bounds of what was considered acceptable behavior for a woman of the period.That being said this movie is 100 spiritually accurate. It perfectly captures the intrigue the complexity of emotions and relationships and tone of the age and the situation at hand. Though the sharp and witty dialogue is often considered a historical anachronism this is not strictly true. Contrary to popular belief people WERE educated in the middle ages even women if they were fortunate enough to be brought up in noble households as Eleanor was. She was a brilliant woman raised in a household where poetry and intelligent conversation were staples her grandfather after all was one of the first troubadours. Henry was an intellectual powerhouse as wellhe was a voracious reader who was often caught reading in church instead of paying attention to the sermons! It is unthinkable that these two minds would have produced stupid children and the notion that the entire family should have only spoken in grunts and simple phrases is equally ludicrous.Though not historically accurate as other reviewers have noted the strength of this movie lies in it's perfect portrayal of some of the most fascinating and complex personalities in recorded history. Henry Eleanor Richard et al. make today's political and royal figures seem like lowrent bumbling hucksters.".

It is of course not to be seen as wholly accurate historically as it would be near impossible to achieve such for events that took place 800 years ago but the major themes are true to form and the film is wonderfully engrossing.

Lion in Winter is quite simply one of the strangest and most beautiful movies that I have ever seen.  It is some wierd amalgam of a 'home for the hollidays' type family drama and Machiavellian political intrigue.The essential plot is that it is 1183 and Henry II must declare his successor to the Plantagenet throne.  He invites his wife Eleanor of Aquitaine played by Katherine Hepburn who is in exile and his sons to along with king of France to Christmas dinner.  Over the course of the evening truths are told and arguments are had the film rolls over all of the conventions of the many genres that it plays with and turns them into something new and beautiful.The film could have been written by Machiavelli himself and often smacks of the Mandragola.  The film demonstrates family disfunction within a very interesting medieval paradigm.  While the film is about issues such as family loyalty and love ultimately is most gratifying as a vehicle for O'Toole and Hepburn to chew the scenery and dig into a few truly juicy roles.It is fantastic film that any lover of dialogue driven dramacomedy should rent and watch over and over again.".

	schema:reviewBody "It is very rare to find an actor who has played the same historical figure twice. Charleton Heston was Andrew Jackson in THE PRESIDENT'S LADY and THE BUCCANNEER 1958. Edward Arnold was Diamond Jim Brady in DIAMOND JIM and LILIAN RUSSELL. Reginald Owen was Louis XV in VOLTAIRE and MONSIEUR BEAUCAIRE. Raymond Massey was John Brown in SANTA FE TRAIL and SEVEN ANGRY MEN. But only Peter O'Toole played the same historical figure in two major productions that were made only four years apart and that showed the character seriously aging.O'Toole had played King Henry II of England in BECKET 1964 as a young vibrant monarch who makes the serious mistake of appointing his best friend to the one post that will make them enemies. The period that BECKET encompasses was roughly 1165 to 1171 when Henry allowed himself to be whipped for the murder of Becket the year before  apparently at his orders. In THE LION IN WINTER 1968 he was King Henry some twelve years later. Henry is now the most powerful monarch in Western Europe but he has problems of dynastic and political natures.His power structure in 1183 is dependent on his hold of the marriage dower of his wife Eleanor of Aquitaine. In BECKET Pamela Brown played Eleanor as a sharp tongued and jealous woman who arranged the murder of her rival Gwendolen Sian Phillips on the night Henry was going to have sex with her. Henry who hates the sight of blood has a nervous collapse upon seeing the results of Eleanor's activities. In THE LION IN WINTER Eleanor was played by Katherine Hepburn. Now older she is still a match in terms of political abilities to her husband. He has let her out of her castle prison to visit him and their three surviving sons Richard Geoffrey and John as well as Princess Alais of France and her brother King Phiip Augustus of France.Henry's family gettogether is not for holiday reasons although it is occurring at Christmas. He has taken a dower from King Philip's father King Louis for Pincess Alais Jane Merrow to marry his oldest son Richard Anthony Hopkins. But Alais has become the mistress of the monarch who is considering divorcing Eleanor and starting a proper family with his second wife Alais. Richard and his two brothers John Castle and Nigel Terry are not happy with this prospect  nor with dynastic ambitions of each other. Of the three sons Henry favors John Terry over Richard although Richard is the better fighter. The reason is that Richard is the favorite of his mother and has been implicated in some of her attempts to stir up civil war against Henry. Geoffrey Castle has brains but he is untrustworthy and finds that he is constantly dismissed by both parents. And King Philip Timothy Dalton is furious that due to the highhanded actions of Henry his father was reduced in power in Europe and he is forced to report to a man who is technically his vassal due to the French lands that Henry controls.THE LION IN WINTER had been a Broadway success in the middle 1960s starring Robert Preston as Henry. The film is a successful transition with the elderly monarch and his elderly consort tearing at each other in a kind of medieval WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF. O'Toole is wonderful as the still intelligent vigorous and bullying monarch he was in BECKET except now he is facing his own mortality. Hepburn who won her third Oscar for this film  one year after winning her second for GUESS WHO'S COMING TO DINNER and tying this time with Barbara Streisand for FUNNY GIRL is able to display a woman capable of any political damage be it encouraging her sons to revolt or threatening future harm to Alais and any child she and Henry may have to torturing Henry with the suggestion that she Eleanor slept with Henry's father before they met.Hopkins' hapless Richard is the most sympathetic of the three sons with his humiliation when Philip maliciously reveals that Richard is a homosexual the first time this trait was revealed in any film about Richard the Lion Hearted. Terry's John is properly pimple faced and immature on the surface but showing when he betrays his father that twofaced ability that would lead to his disasters as King. Castle is properly sinister throughout  one realizes that both parents will not suggest him as heir because he'd kill them as soon as he could safely plan it out afterward. Dalton's Philip is galling to O'Toole as he keeps showing that unlike his father he knows how to harm the British monarchy  by disgracing it's leading hero Richard and by simply waiting for time to take it's toll on his enemy Henry. And Merrow is the most sympathetic figure in the film genuinely loving Henry but finding even he regards her as a dynastic pawn in the end. The movie was that rarity a sequel as thoughtful and intelligent as the first film had been and filling in the results of that first film's background and story very well indeed.".

But the final indignity was in giving the best picture award to an overpraised undeserving insignificant musical called OLIVER! If they had a least half a brain in their heads they could've given to FUNNY GIRL but they only shoot themselves in the foot when the deserving go unrecognized. It only goes to show the Academy's just jealous. The script and Kate's performance at least were given the royal treatment but it still leaves bitter resentment when Cliff Roberston one of Hollywood's most lessthanadequate actors cops the best actor away from O'Toole... possibly Hollywood's most underrated not to mention unrecognized actors of the highest caliber. Hepburn's Eleanor of Aquitaine had witty lines quiet but still present anger and fire underneath the surface but O'Toole as Henry II gave the more powerful performance... an aesthetic that echoed Taylor and Burton for WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF? only Taylor was the gutsy performer and Burton doled out the cutlows and the intellect. To coin a phrase from the British... he O'Toole was bloody robbed!The story is set in Britain 1183. Henry II is on the throne and has ten years earlier imprisoned his wife Eleanor of Acquitaine after coconspirating a civil war against him. She and their three sons Richard the eldest a brave warrior on the battlefield whom Eleanor wants to succeed Henry as king Geoffrey the quietly vicious unappreciated middle son of whom neither of them love with a plot for every occurrence and John the piggish dirty thieving brat is their youngest whom Henry for some unknown reason wants on the throne are all requested to appear at their palace of Chinon for the Christmas holidays. Also invited is young King Philip II of France whose elder sister Alais is the treasured and muchloved mistress to Henry. Philip wishes to have Alais mearried off to one of Henry's sons preferably Richard in order to form an alliance between England and France made between Henry and Philip's father the late King Louis. But meanwhile Philip is also plotting with all three boys and Eleanor to tear Henry's kingdom apart. Eleanor is merely in on it to get back at Henry for loving Alais whom she had raised as a surrogate daughter and the late Rosmund an old rival of Eleanor's whom Henry replaced her with.This film has it all infidelity betrayal family dysfunction and a script that crackles with venom wit and plottwisting motivation. See it if only for O'Toole and Hepburn's firstrate performances.".

She and their three sons Richard the eldest a brave warrior on the battlefield whom Eleanor wants to succeed Henry as king Geoffrey the quietly vicious unappreciated middle son of whom neither of them love with a plot for every occurrence and John the piggish dirty thieving brat is their youngest whom Henry for some unknown reason wants on the throne are all requested to appear at their palace of Chinon for the Christmas holidays. Also invited is young King Philip II of France whose elder sister Alais is the treasured and muchloved mistress to Henry. Philip wishes to have Alais mearried off to one of Henry's sons preferably Richard in order to form an alliance between England and France made between Henry and Philip's father the late King Louis. But meanwhile Philip is also plotting with all three boys and Eleanor to tear Henry's kingdom apart. Eleanor is merely in on it to get back at Henry for loving Alais whom she had raised as a surrogate daughter and the late Rosmund an old rival of Eleanor's whom Henry replaced her with.This film has it all infidelity betrayal family dysfunction and a script that crackles with venom wit and plottwisting motivation. See it if only for O'Toole and Hepburn's firstrate performances.";

Her role is sort of an interesting counterbalance to Peter O'Toole as King Henry II. That is she's elderly and he's young. Maybe it was an allusion to the growing generation gap in the world at the time.But anyway this is what epic tales of royalty are supposed to be. It shows Henry's conflicts in wondering who will succeed him. Never dragging the movie truly gives one the feeling of being with these people and understanding their lives. One of the most interesting scenes  in my opinion at least  is when Eleanor says something about sex. I usually wouldn't expect someone of Katharine Hepburn's generation mention sex in a movie. But she does a great job here well duh. Also starring are a very young Anthony Hopkins and an even younger Timothy Dalton. All in all The Lion in Winter is a perfect movie in every way and affirmed 1968 as one of the best movie years ever with 2001 A Space Odyssey Funny Girl The Odd Couple The Planet of the Apes Romeo and Juliet Candy The Night of the Living Dead and Bullitt.".

Don't miss it. Trivia notes. Richard played here by Hopkins in his film debut became King Richard the Lionheart not the Lionhearted whom Robin Hood supposedly supported. John became King John of the same tales and in reality was the King John who signed the Magna Carta in the early thirteenth century. Nigel Terry who played John went on to play King Arthur in Excalibur some years later. Henry II was the greatgrandfather of Edward I William Wallace's nemesis in Braveheart.".

The second Welsh Plantagenet took one of the most beautiful powerful and intellectual women of all from the King of France and some say his own father It was one of the greatest love stories of all time between the two most dynamic individuals of their era. And this is what it's all about and what makes this play and this movie work. Each was really the only one the other could ever really love. Nobody else in their time even came close. And only a Hepburn could pull off Elenore of Aquitaine. I still like Stewart's Henry better because he gave me more of the Henry we know from History as a completely fearless dynamic powerful King who could do and haveanything he wanted. Even though her youthful beauty had faded Elenore as always the great love and the only woman who could ever have been his equal. So despite all the scheming infidelity and dysfunctional family betrayal those two will always be one of the great matches of history right next to Caesar and Cleopatra.

	schema:reviewBody "When such a tremendous film which evokes the intense intellectual pontification of the London and New York Theatre world makes it's debut into the Hollywood cinema it is truly amazing!! Lion in Winter is one of my favorite movies of all time!! Katherine Hepburn won for best actress in 1968 with this role!! Peter O'Toole who played Henry II and Anthony Hopkins who played Richard are two of the finest actors in the history of the silver screen!! The year was 1183 A.D. a time of the barbarians which meant it was an environment consisting of a potpourri of megalomania dictatorial entitlement and the visceral components of primary survival!! Everybody loathed everybody else!! A provision for heartfelt emotions was obviated by an enmity which focused on the ruthless gratification of the boorish hierarchy!! The passion for hatred was relentless in this movie!! In evaluating the plot keywords of this film they were summed up as the battle of the sexes and a dysfunctional marriage!! Suffice it to say these were masterpieces of understatement!! A wife was reduced to the post of insensate chattel and thus she was relegated to the hedonistic wishes of the king until it was seemingly appropriate for the king to inflict his wife with dotage by decree!! Henry II's time was one where the only philosophical reality in people's lives was death. The line of logic being that if you bore them you had the right to execute them as well... This blatant disregard for human life cultivated an abject misery for the precarious plights of everyone involved in the subjugation of the capricious royalty!! I found this film to be spectacular as a writer I can appreciate the monotonously challenging approach Lion in Winter took to articulating realism!! The dialog compounds the deplorable rancor to the prevailing circumstances during the barbarian era of HenryII!! This film is a somber depiction of ancient history and history is history for better or worse!! No!! I do not have any perception of what it was like in England in the year 1183 however the rudimentary despondence which was depicted in this movie is sufficient enough to purvey a frightful conception of a terrorizing primate and subhumanoid callousness!! I would not have wanted to live during that era of uncivilized human history!! Believe Me!! Movies like Lion in Winter take on artistically dimensional endeavors that elevate the standards in theatrical and cinematic entertainment thus they should be rewarded for it!! FABULOUS FILM!!!FIVE STARS!!! A PERFECT TEN!!!".

A wife was reduced to the post of insensate chattel and thus she was relegated to the hedonistic wishes of the king until it was seemingly appropriate for the king to inflict his wife with dotage by decree!! Henry II's time was one where the only philosophical reality in people's lives was death. The line of logic being that if you bore them you had the right to execute them as well... This blatant disregard for human life cultivated an abject misery for the precarious plights of everyone involved in the subjugation of the capricious royalty!! I found this film to be spectacular as a writer I can appreciate the monotonously challenging approach Lion in Winter took to articulating realism!! The dialog compounds the deplorable rancor to the prevailing circumstances during the barbarian era of HenryII!! This film is a somber depiction of ancient history and history is history for better or worse!! No!! I do not have any perception of what it was like in England in the year 1183 however the rudimentary despondence which was depicted in this movie is sufficient enough to purvey a frightful conception of a terrorizing primate and subhumanoid callousness!! I would not have wanted to live during that era of uncivilized human history!! Believe Me!! Movies like Lion in Winter take on artistically dimensional endeavors that elevate the standards in theatrical and cinematic entertainment thus they should be rewarded for it!! FABULOUS FILM!!!FIVE STARS!!! A PERFECT TEN!!!";

	schema:headline " Christmas With Henry And Eleanor Plantagenet";
	schema:reviewBody "It's Christmas 1183 at the Plantagenet castle in Chinon France. Henry II is still in mourning for the death of his eldest son who would have been Henry III. He's not quite sure what to do about the succession. He's inviting his three surviving sons Richard Geoffrey and John and their mother the legendary Eleanor of Aquitaine.The nice thing about The Lion in Winter is that you don't need a knowledge of English history to help you follow the plot. It certainly helps but the skill of the players and the great direction they get from Anthony Harvey makes this film understandable and universal.Peter O'Toole is not crazy about all three of his sons. He's an older and wiser man than the young monarch we saw him play in Becket. He sees the weaknesses in all of them. Richard who is a pure warrior more interested in battles and killing than ruling Geoffrey who schemes with every breath and John who's an amiable dunce of kid manipulated by everyone. None inspire any confidence.And then there's Eleanor a tough minded woman liberated centuries before Germaine Greer and played in a grand manner by Katharine Hepburn. Her dissolution of her marriage to Louis VII of France and her marriage with Henry II brought the large and rich Aquitaine province into the British auspices. She plays both the province and her sons in a never ending battle of wits with her husband as ruthlessly as any riverboat gambler.Two pieces of historical fact must be noted. The realm of Henry II consisted of England and a great deal of northern France. Rule in his realm meant of a necessity that the king divide his time in both parts of his far flung empire. That's why the gathering is in Chinon in France which was under English rule.The second fact is that the English king was also Duke of Normandy at that time and in that title owed allegiance to his sovereign the King of France who is played here by Timothy Dalton. But he's also a powerful monarch in his own right. The duality of those titles is a great deal of the reason for the conflict you see between Dalton and the entire Plantagenet family.And Dalton plays the whole lot of them off against each other. As King Philip II Augustus he is as important in French history as Henry II is in British. He's the son of the man that Henry stole Eleanor from by another queen and that fact is upper most in his mind.There's no real story in The Lion in Winter. It's like a medieval Long Day's Journey into Night a glimpse into the inner workings of a royal family. Long and deep on characterization as is the O'Neill classic. Still you'll be both entertained and informed watching it. Author James Goldman did his research well.The sons are played by John Castle as Geoffrey Nigel Terry as John and Anthony Hopkins in the first film that brought him notice as Richard later on Richard the Lion Hearted. This is a far more realistic Richard than had ever been shown before including his well known homosexuality.The Lion in Winter won Katharine Hepburn her third Best Actress Award though she shared it with Barbra Streisand for Funny Girl. Peter O'Toole got his third nomination of eight for Best Actor losing to Cliff Robertson for Charly. That's one I've never understood. It's a great ensemble cast everyone at his very best and not to be missed when broadcast.".

	schema:headline " One of the Most Overrated Movies Ever Made";
	schema:reviewBody "After watching Becket I thought I was in for another classic. But it turned out to be on of the biggest flops I have ever seen. Unlike Becket the dialogue was filled up with imaterial and seemed to repeat itself. For example throughout the movie it seems that O'toole and Hepburn are in engaged in a major argument when suddenly it turns around into a love scene. I can recall of this happening at least 5 times throughout the movie. A second aspect to the dialogue was the relationships. The brothers were all forming alliances with each other King Henry II Eleanor of Aquitaine and King Philip of France. At one point of the movie I had no idea who was supporting who. For example there is a scene were all three brothers are conversing with King Philip but each time one walks in the other starts to hide. Even King Henry the II walks in and suddnely it turns into a huge argument. Even in the ending provides no resolve to the movie when suddenly Eleanor of Aquitane and King Henry II resolve their relationship. I have no idea how this movie could win an Oscar for best screenplay.Another disappointing part of the movie was the acting. The brothers other than Richard Anthony Hopkins seemed to be out of character and did not show enough expression. King Philip Timothy Dalton seemed to be over the top. But that I could with stand. The performance that disappointed me the most was Katherine Hepburn as Eleanor of Aquitaine especially after winning an Oscar for it. She seemed to struggle with her British accent. She also was very much over the top and wasn't very convincing as a Queen. She was a serious miscast. The two acting performances that held this movie together was Peter O'toole as King Henry II who probably deserved the Oscar who probably played better than he did in Becket because he was required to and Anthony Hopkins as Richard who played vet good as the son with a true desire of becoming king. Other than these two great performances this great story was turned into a inconclusive and enigmatic spectacle.".

It's an endless sequence of ruses empty threats doublebacks and nullifications. After about half an hour you realize none of the actors are affecting royalty they're all portraying thespians and every character is totally full of crap.Even given that the passing of the crown in the Plantagnet household has not been much of a secret for seven hundred years the movie fails to make that gambit engaging and also fails to name the line of succession before the credits roll. I don't ask for much just move me an inch forward of where we started two hours ago. For every scene that would have worked in a movie half this length another horrid overbaked piece of rot cancels it out. Every halfinteresting character is offset by a runt John or a zero Alais  what the hell is her petulant whiny purpose in this movie?. The stupid dinnerprocessional exchange with Hepburn taunting O'Toole through a stupid grin as yet another Styrofoam gauntlet is thrown down exemplifies the films coy phony aggravating conceits. Goldman torpedoes the movie with scene after scene like this. When all is said and done there isn't a piece of scenery left unchewed and the film quickly reveals itself to be a zerosum game my absolute least favorite format.I'm sorry to hear that some drippy viewers think it's funny to see Richard Hopkins acting sissified. It's the only moment a viewer could possibly find one of the characters sympathetic because it's the only frame of legitimate emotion or affection in the whole movie.

Now replace Liz and Dick with Katharine Hepburn and Peter O'Toole. That's The Lion in Winter.In 1183 King Henry II is in the winter of his life. He has his heart set on leaving the throne to his youngest son but his wife Eleanor of Aquitaine wants their eldest son to inherit. For years Henry has imprisoned the queen in a faraway castle only letting her out for royal functions and holidays. During Christmas she's brought home and the two rulers play a nonstop game of cat and mouse constantly trying to outsmart and outhurt the other. With their three sons and the visiting king of France as pawns it's an incredibly lively story.Peter O'Toole reprises his role as Henry II he'd already played him four years earlier in Becket. He gives a wonderful emotional frustrated performance but in the stiff competition for Best Actor in 1969 he lost to the unworthy performance of Cliff Robertson in Charly. It's tough to pick which loss is more appalling The Lion in Winter or Becket. In either case and even though I'm sure Richard Burton would have been just as good if not better in this role Peter O'Toole is impressive. The sons are played by Anthony Hopkins John Castle and Nigel Terry. It was Anthony Hopkins's second theatrical film and Timothy Dalton's first Tim was very touched that Kate would come onto the set on her days off to act with him when he did his closeups and her presence wasn't technically needed. There's an awful lot of touching trivia relating to this film. Peter and Kate enjoyed each other's company on the set having known each other for years earlier Peter named his daughter after her. And speaking of descendants Katharine Hepburn's lineage can actually be traced back to Eleanor and Henry II! The art and production designs are fantastic in the film. The castle is expansive but the rooms are mostly empty. The thrones look worn and slightly coarse and the jewelry looks rich but primitive. Margaret Furse's costumes are in mostly dark muted colors and they look very authentic. Furs and large swaths of linen are draped over the actors' shoulders there are no ornately sewn gowns because in the 1100s lavish clothes couldn't really have been created.And finally there's Katharine Hepburn who won her third Best Actress Oscar for the film. She vacillates between angry hurt cunning desperate hopeful loving deceitful and exhausted and each emotional change takes the audience with her. At times she'll make you laugh and at times she'll make you cry. You'll be kept on your toes unsure of who to trust or root for but it'll be worth it. After all as Kate said in the film Every family has their ups and downs.".

The tour de force acting by Katharine Hepburn and Peter O'Toole is a joy to watch. Anthony Hopkins is incredible and its his first movie role. Clearly he had it. He commands the screen to the point one cannot look away. The rest of the cast is also wonderful except Jane Merrow as Alais. Sadly she is way out of her league. On the other hand watching the contrast between Merrow and the others only serves to prove their superior skills and make watching them even more delightful. When these brilliant actors deliver their zinger lines its pure delight. The Lion in Winter is in my top ten movie list.".

A pleasant adventure set in 19th century Iraq  there Kara Ben Nemsi Helmuth Schneider replacing Viktor Staal a writer  adventurer and doctor crosses the sunny desert when he meets his old friend Hadschi Halef Omar Georg Thomalla who is now married and has a baby  but he early abandons his family and accompanies him to enjoy other adventures . The adventurer doctor is asked for help from Dosorza Antonio Casas whose wife was killed and his children kidnapped by the nasty smuggler Sfir Rafael Luis Calvo . Meanwhile  Kara Ben Nemsi and Hadschi Halef Omar are pursued by Safir's hoodlums  the extreme villains Pdar Barta Barri and Aftab Jos Manuel Martn . As they are fighting an unseen Arab enemy who always struck in the dark . There also appears two lost men  a British  archaeologist Sir David Lindsay Theo Lingen and the German Professor Ignaz Pfotenhauer Fernando Sancho who bears the comic relief  a real expert on ornithology  who are taken imprisoned . But Kar Ben Memsi discovers the smuggling shelter  the Babylon ruins  he then frees two beautiful damsels in distress  Sfa Mara Cruz  Safir's daughter  and Irida Pilar Cansino and meets his abducted friends . This is a sequel to Die Sklavenkarawane or Caravana De Esclavas 1958 by Ramon Torrado with Viktor Staal  Georg Thomalla  Mara Cruz  Theo Lingen Jos Guardiola  made with similar artistic and technician team . It is an exciting adventure movie including thrills  shots  fights  duels and marvelous oriental outdoors  though filmed in Spain . Risked adventures and interesting roles along with solid action and a good sense of humor pulled off by an attractive couple  Fernando Sancho and Theo Lingen . The most spectacular scenes are the fights on the desert and the Babylon ruins . Although some fights are not convincing and the short budget is occasionally revealed  as it is filled with stockshots and mattepainting . Support cast is plenty of familiar Spanish faces  usual in coproductions of the 60s and 70s  such as  Fernando Sancho Antonio Casas  Angel Alvarez  Barta Barri  Francisco Bernal  Jos Riesgo  Xan Das Bolas  Jos Luis Martin and an ominous leader of the bandits  Rafael Luis Calvo  who played with vicious intensity . Originally it was planned to shoot this picture at its historical location in Turkey  but for organizational reasons it was decided to make it in Spain instead . The film is set in Bagdad  Basora  Iraq  though is was actually shot in Aranjuez and Madrid  Spain  being well photographed by the prestigious cameraman Ricardo Torres who photographed notorious titles as La Mies Es MuchaFray Escoba La Vida Por Delante and Comicos .It is based on Karl May novel  about a known personage  Kara Ben Memsi  this role starred several films  most of them performed by Lex Barker  such as  Kingdom of the Silver Lion 1965 by F.J Gottlieb  Wild Kurdistan 1965 by F. J Gottlieb  The Yellow One 1964 by Robert Siodmak and Die Sklavenkarawane or Caravana de esclavas 1958 by Ramn TorradoGeorg Marischka and its followup  Der Lwe Von Babylon 1959 titled Spain En Las Ruinas de Babilonia or Lion of Babylone also directed by Ramn Torrado . And other silent versions starred by Carl De Vogt as Caravan of Death 1920  Auf den Trmmern Des Paradieses 1920 and Die Teufelsanbeter 1920 . In addition  a series television titled Kara Ben Nemsi Effendi 1973 26 episodes starred by Michael Vogler as Kara Ben Nemsi .The motion picture was middlingly directed by Ramon Torrado  he made a mostly decent  colorful fun  but not without gaps  failures and flaws . Similary to previous film Caravana De Esclavas 1958  it was not huge hit  but successful enough to have this sequel  Der Lwe von Babylon following in the same year 1959 . Ramon was born in 1905  Galicia Spain. He was a director and writer known for directing some vehicles of known Folklorics stars such as Peret in Amor a Todo gas 1969  Manolo Escobar in Un Beso en Puerto 1966 and Paquito Rico in Malvaloca 1954. Torrado directed four mediocre Chorizo Westerns such as 1965 Los Cuatreros  1964 La Carga de la Polica Montada  1964 Relevo a Pistolero and 1963 Bienvenido Padre Murray . Rating . 4.510 .

This time Muti plays Nicole a girl desperate to get attention in the opening scene at the beach she pretends she's drowning so that someone will pick her up! Nicole falls in love with the much older cartoonist Romani Gazzara and even though he notices that she is telling him lies constantly for example that she'd be rich and happy or about to be married he doesn't realize to what extent she lost touch with reality actually Nicole needs treatment by a psychiatrist. She tells Romani she's flying to London but actually she enters a mental hospital. She has prepared letters her sister can send from London so while Romani reads them and thinks she's fine she is suffering terribly among lunatics. When he finds out the truth what will he do? The Girl From Trieste doesn't have the provocative punch of a Bukowski story like Tales of Ordinary Madness arguably Campanile was a more conservative director than Ferreri anyway. The locations of Trieste and Venice could have been put to better use since these cities live so much in the past visiting them is close to time travel that a more surreal uneasy feeling could have been created. I'm not saying The Girl From Trieste is a bad movie but maybe it doesn't entirely satisfy. It holds a lot of interest with its two unpredictable characters worth watching for Muti fans anytime. With more than 10 years experience in movies already she reached the height of her beauty and acting skill in the early 80s.".

	schema:headline " Muti and Festa";
	schema:reviewBody "A middleaged artist Ben Gazarra sketching on the beach witnesses a young woman Ornella Muti being rescued from drowning. He loans her a blanket. Later she returns the blanket and they have sex several times but she always leaves right afterward leaving the man to wonder who she is and where she goes. Things become more complicated as he begins to fall in love with her and after his regular girlfriend Mimsy Farmer with whom he has a curiously open relationship returns. He eventually begins to realize his mysterious new lover may be very much insane.Muti is excellent in this movie but it's unfortunate that she really has to struggle here against her own incredible beauty. You really have to suspend your disbelief that you are NOT watching someone who is quite literally one of the most beautiful women in the world in scenes where she has to fake drownings or sit in an outdoor caf in a miniskirt with her legs splayed to get attention from men. With the average attractive woman this would be believable but with someone that looks like Muti you would expect a riot a traffic pileup or a line of guys waiting to administer mouthtomouth. Her affair with an old codger like Gazarra also strains credibility the pair were also teamed even more implausibly in Marco Ferreti's biopic of poet Charles Bukowski Tales of Ordinary Madness. Still Muti turns in a truly superb performance. Gazarra is also more than adequate. Farmer is as irritating as usual but at least here she's meant to be here.This was apparently based on a novel by the talented Italian director Pasquale Campanile Festa who also directed The Libertine Hitchhike and Body of a Woman and who definitely knew his way around the bodies of some beautiful women like Catherine Spaak Corrine Clery Lili Karati and of course Muti. Unfortunately the import DVD I saw was obviously ported from a poor video source and is kind of grainy and too dark at times most regrettably during some of Mutti's nude scenes. This is a very decent movie and really deserves a better transfer. Still it's a mustsee for any Italian movie fans teaming up one of Italy's most incredible and incredibly beautiful actresses and one of Italy's most talented if underrated when compared to more famous contemporaries like Fellini Antonioni or Pasolini directors. Definitely recommended.".

Of course the performances by RhysMeyers and Balk do help. The crime story angle of it isn't terribly interesting. Whooo lotsa shooting and squealing tires. Yawn The story of a teenager idling in life and waiting for it to happen to him rings true though. Modine makes a sufficiently oily criminal trying to extend the family business. The sequence where Josh finds out what happened to their parents is unnecessarily overblown but it was bearable. Balk is as usual a hidden gem. Mary Louise Parker I didn't even recognize for a while and her character seemed to be a plot device but she did fairly well. I was floored watching RhysMeyers thinking all the while THIS is Brian Slade from 'Velvet Goldmine'??? Without the makeup and with his natural hair he looks at least five years younger and it strikes you heh he's just a kid. One that can act I've decided. His American accent is perfect tinny and hollow and more authenticsounding than those of some of the real Americans in the movie. I've rarely if ever heard a foreigner evoke so perfect an imitation of American speech. Anyway this is a worthwhile movie. A little generic sometimes but overall it's very decent. Ignore the misleading video box but watch for the humorous parts like when RhysMeyers gets pulled over by his dream girl in blue for running a stop sign.".

His brother Walter has been gone for a while and he comes back hoping to make amends for leaving the family. Josh has what seems like a brothersister relationship with Bella but he really wants Emily a cop who is several years older.Josh's parents died when he was very young and he was adopted by the Minnells. Walter who has gone back to his original name Schmeiss knows the full story which Josh has never heard and what happened to them may explain why both brothers turned out the way they did. 'The Maker' is the one who makes the rules in a given situation. Josh has that opportunity when he helps Walter and Felice in their 'transfer and storage' business. I think of the pleasant character from 'What the Deaf Man Heard' when I think of Matthew Modine. However he can play bad guys too and he made Walter likable and not really evil. As a con artist Walter had to be quite a good actor too. I thought most of the lead actors gave good performances. Still the movie was quite dark at times and somewhat violent toward the end. Jonathan RhysMeyers effectively showed a young man having to make important moral decisions as he reached a point where he could have gone down the wrong road.It was a worthwhile film if you like this sort of thing.".

Walter who has gone back to his original name Schmeiss knows the full story which Josh has never heard and what happened to them may explain why both brothers turned out the way they did. 'The Maker' is the one who makes the rules in a given situation. Josh has that opportunity when he helps Walter and Felice in their 'transfer and storage' business. I think of the pleasant character from 'What the Deaf Man Heard' when I think of Matthew Modine. However he can play bad guys too and he made Walter likable and not really evil. As a con artist Walter had to be quite a good actor too. I thought most of the lead actors gave good performances. Still the movie was quite dark at times and somewhat violent toward the end. Jonathan RhysMeyers effectively showed a young man having to make important moral decisions as he reached a point where he could have gone down the wrong road.It was a worthwhile film if you like this sort of thing.";

	schema:reviewBody "Rex Ingram is probably best remembered for directing Rudolph Valentino's breakthrough film THE FOUIR HORSEMEN OF THE APOCALYPSE 1921 but he ventured into the fledgling terror genre with this thriller starring Paul The Golem Wegener.Wegener's character Dr. Oliver Haddo is allegedly based on the real life character Alastair Crowley. When we first meet him he is in attendance as the famous Dr. Burdon Ivan Petrovich saves the life of lovely Margaret Dauncey Alice Terry the real life Mrs. Ingram with an operation on her spine. While recovering Margaret falls in love with Dr. Burdon and he returns her affections. Dr. Haddo is interested in her too but for far less healthy reasons. Dr. H you see has been searching for the way to create artificial life in the laboratory sound familiar? and a old book on alchemy has informed him that he needs the heart blood of a maiden added to certain other chemicals to make this happen.So determined is Haddo to make this happen that he hypnotises Margaret and marries her while she is under his spell. At his mountain top lab he plans to complete his diabolical experiment. Will Margaret lose her own life so Haddo can create life? Will Dr. Burdon find her in time? Ah . . . that would be telling!What many of us wonder is is Haddo a real magician or just a very good hypnotist? In one scene he allows a poisonous snake to bite him but makes the lethal wound vanish with just a wave of his hand. Just a moment later the same snake bites a young woman and she must be rushed to hospital. Now most of us know that a venomous snake expels all its venom at the first bite so the fact that it was the second bite that felled the woman should have been a tipoff that Haddo was not bitten at all. Yes but remember this is a movie and we have to build up suspense. An amusing scene has Dr. Burdon and Dr. Haddo meeting for the first time in a park. As Haddo walks away Burdon remarks to Margaret He looks like he stepped out of a melodrama!. As if on cue Haddo glares back throws his cape over his shoulder and makes a perfect stage exit! It is an innocuous but effective moment and briefly clouds the menace that will soon be facing the lovers.The sequence most people remember is where Haddo gives Margaret a look at Hell. It is a rugged looking place but rather removed from the horrors of the Italian film L'INFERNO 1909 or even DANTE'S INFERNO 1926. The place is loaded with damned souls but they all dance around carefree while Pan at least I think it's Pan plays a tune on his pipes. Another faun dancer Hubert Stowitts takes Margaret in his arms and passionately kisses her as the dream ends. So did they really go to Hell or was it all a hypnotic dream? In a key scene soon after this Haddo visits Margaret at her home and we clearly see his lips say the words your rape which sends her into the deepest despair. Whether the rape was actual or just implied quickly becomes a moot point because she goes away with him convinced she can never marry Dr. Burdon now.Elements of the final reels of THE MAGICIAN figure prominently in the Universal film FRANKENSTEIN 1931. Haddo has a monolithic castle at the top of a mountain a dwarf assistant do you think his name is Fritz? and a well equipped lab. I think that not only director James Whale but also the set designer for FRANKENSTEIN had to have sat through this film more than once.Talkies came along about a year after this film was completed and Wegener who was uncertain of his ability to speak English returned to Germany. He was not alone he was soon joined by Emil Jannings Conrad Veidt and several other actors who had their doubts about being able to effectively perform in a foreign to themlanguage.So is THE MAGICIAN worth seeing? Yes it is despite its shortcomings it is a well paced and convincingly performed thriller. Give it a try.".

In one scene he allows a poisonous snake to bite him but makes the lethal wound vanish with just a wave of his hand. Just a moment later the same snake bites a young woman and she must be rushed to hospital. Now most of us know that a venomous snake expels all its venom at the first bite so the fact that it was the second bite that felled the woman should have been a tipoff that Haddo was not bitten at all. Yes but remember this is a movie and we have to build up suspense. An amusing scene has Dr. Burdon and Dr. Haddo meeting for the first time in a park. As Haddo walks away Burdon remarks to Margaret He looks like he stepped out of a melodrama!. As if on cue Haddo glares back throws his cape over his shoulder and makes a perfect stage exit! It is an innocuous but effective moment and briefly clouds the menace that will soon be facing the lovers.The sequence most people remember is where Haddo gives Margaret a look at Hell. It is a rugged looking place but rather removed from the horrors of the Italian film L'INFERNO 1909 or even DANTE'S INFERNO 1926. The place is loaded with damned souls but they all dance around carefree while Pan at least I think it's Pan plays a tune on his pipes. Another faun dancer Hubert Stowitts takes Margaret in his arms and passionately kisses her as the dream ends. So did they really go to Hell or was it all a hypnotic dream? In a key scene soon after this Haddo visits Margaret at her home and we clearly see his lips say the words your rape which sends her into the deepest despair. Whether the rape was actual or just implied quickly becomes a moot point because she goes away with him convinced she can never marry Dr. Burdon now.Elements of the final reels of THE MAGICIAN figure prominently in the Universal film FRANKENSTEIN 1931. Haddo has a monolithic castle at the top of a mountain a dwarf assistant do you think his name is Fritz? and a well equipped lab. I think that not only director James Whale but also the set designer for FRANKENSTEIN had to have sat through this film more than once.Talkies came along about a year after this film was completed and Wegener who was uncertain of his ability to speak English returned to Germany. He was not alone he was soon joined by Emil Jannings Conrad Veidt and several other actors who had their doubts about being able to effectively perform in a foreign to themlanguage.So is THE MAGICIAN worth seeing? Yes it is despite its shortcomings it is a well paced and convincingly performed thriller. Give it a try.";

Indeed virtually the only way I had previously known this film was via one intriguing still of the Hades sequence found in the section devoted to director Rex Ingram in the periodical The Movies published in the early 80sso it's great that THE MAGICIAN has eventually seen the light of day albeit unofficially and thankfully it lives up to its considerable reputation  to my eyes at least.Ingram was one of Silent cinema's master visual stylists but is now a forgotten figure bestknown for the Rudolph Valentino version of THE FOUR HORSEMAN OF THE APOCALYSE 1921 his retirement from films once Talkies came in suggests that like D.W. Griffith he was unable to adapt to the ongoing progress in cinematic technique and indeed his films  like Griffith's  have an inherently stilted quality to them which dates his output more than those of contemporary auteurs! Anyway this was my fourth Ingram movie after the interesting THE CONQUERING POWER 1921 the fine if somewhat underwhelming THE PRISONER OF ZENDA 1922 and the rousing SCARAMOUCHE 1923 unfortunately my copy of MARE NOSTRUM 1926  recorded off TCM UK  got erased by accident before I had the opportunity to watch it. Alice Terry Ingram's wife appeared in 15 of his films and here plays the distressed virginal heroine  who's the prime ingredient for the experiment concocted by the magician of the title Paul Wegener. The latter bestknown for his three Golem pictures made at the height of the German Expressionist movement makes for an overwhelmingly menacing villain  although I found his being a medical student quite amusing Wegener was 52 at the time of filming!. By the way the character of Oliver Haddo was based by novelist W. Somerset Maugham on notorious English Occultist and writer Aleister Crowley! The film an MGM production but shot in France where Ingram lived is ostensibly a variation on the Frankenstein myth with a few Svengali overtones thrown in for good measure interestingly Paul Wegener would star in an official version of that one in Germany the following year. Ingram's assistant director was the future iconoclastic English filmmaker Michael Powell who also appears unbilled in a snakecharming sequence around the middle of the film! As expected the film is pictorially quite stylish shot by frequent Rex Ingram Preston Sturges and Billy Wilder lenser John F. Seitz especially in the fantasy sequence set in Hades  which must surely have left an indelible impression on Ingram's production manager here Harry Lachman to refer back to it when he came to direct the Spencer Tracy version of DANTE'S INFERNO 1935  and the finale set in a laboratory on a remote mountaintop which uncannily prefigures literally step by step the similar climax at the end of James Whale's BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN 1935! as a matter of fact Wegener even has a dwarfish assistant a' la Dwight Frye in Whale's FRANKENSTEIN 1931  so it's very possible that Whale had seen Ingram's film.One is all the more grateful then that a print of THE MAGICIAN has survived since it helps throw more light on the influences behind the greatest horror film ever made which also happens to be my alltime favorite film".

A frightening rotund man Mr. Wegener happens to encounter Dr. Petrovich and Terry again and again. Wegener wants to create life and has decided Terry will supply the Blood of a Maiden required in an ancient sorcerer's recipe! While still a young woman Terry seems more like a matron than a maiden  guess you just have to assume The Magician knows a virgin when he sees one. In W.

Most unclear in the film is exactly how Wegener's experiment is supposed to work. Playing Dr. Frankenstein and inspiring the 1931 classic's design Wegener sets up a lab to extract blood apparently. Highlighted by a hellish hallucination it's very nicely envisioned by Terry's skillful director husband Rex Ingram but it lacks the richness of plot abundantly available in the book.

	schema:reviewBody "The Magician 1926 is directed by Rex Ingram and stars Alice Terry as Margaret Ivan Ptrovich as Dr Arthur Burdon and Paul Wegener as Oliver Haddo the villainous practitioner of Black Magic. If one is willing to make the necessary suspension of disbelief there isn't the slightest doubt but that the film provides loads of entertainment as a horrorthriller combination. The two leads don't have very much to do in terms of acting. Burdon is the usual faithful hero and Alice Terry's character spends most of her time staring helplessly about in a trance and looking full of Angst. Paul Wegner who directed The Golum 1920 steals every scene he's in with a wonderfully spectacular overthetop melodramatic portrayal of the Magician who needs the heart blood of a maiden to create life hmm . . . I wonder who's supposed to provide that ingredient.Another star in the film is the great clifftop towercastle of Hadoo himself surrounded with bolts of lightning and filled with such items as strange potions which bubble and foam with a satisfactorily smoking violence strange manuscripts and sinister props. When Hadoo picks up his box of sharp knives one can't help noticing the nearby cupboard topped with a skull nicely festooned with cobwebs. There's the expected winding staircase to impede the heroic rescue and an open fully firedup incinerator helps us along to the climax which ends with a suitable cataclysm. There are a very few points where the film is slightly disjointedobviously owing to the fact that a few frames have been lost but one soon forgets them. Generally the print used by TCM is very sharp and beautifully tinted. It's a pleasure to watch it. Robert Israel's score is well chosen skillfully applied and very atmospheric. Note for example the reunion of hero and heroine is underlined by the love theme from Tchaikovsky's Romeo and Juliet. The story of the film is based on a novel of the same name by Somerset Maugham and it is available for free download on Project Gutenberg. I've not read it yet but I might do so if only to compare the two approaches. This is a film I would recommend for the entertaining use it makes of the typical stereotypes of the horror genre but above all for Wegener's fabulous performance.".

However director Rex Ingram obviously influenced by earlier German forays into the supernatural cast German actor Paul Wegener of DER GOLEM in this adaptation of Somerset Maugham's novel THE MAGICIAN. Wegener's menacing performance as an evil Yogi in LEBENDE BUDDHAS 1925 made him a good choice to play Oliver Haddo obsessed with creating life from an ancient formula requiring the heart's blood of a maiden played by Ingram's wife Alice Terry.John F. Seitz' cinematography is superb especially in the depiction of the heroine's hallucinatory descent into Hell where she is figuratively ravished by a lustful and athletic satyr. And although Haddo doesn't succeed in creating the grisly halfcomplete humans as in the novel the controversial subject matter was nevertheless strong enough to insure the film's failure at the boxoffice in 1926.Interesting comparisons have been made between this film and James Wale's FRANKENSTEIN but the subject of black magic also invites comparison with later films  THE BLACK CAT 1934 THE NIGHT OF THE DEMON 1957 and THE DEVIL RIDES OUT 1968  featuring characters who like Oliver Haddo were modeled on reallife occultist Aleister Crowley.".

And although Haddo doesn't succeed in creating the grisly halfcomplete humans as in the novel the controversial subject matter was nevertheless strong enough to insure the film's failure at the boxoffice in 1926.Interesting comparisons have been made between this film and James Wale's FRANKENSTEIN but the subject of black magic also invites comparison with later films  THE BLACK CAT 1934 THE NIGHT OF THE DEMON 1957 and THE DEVIL RIDES OUT 1968  featuring characters who like Oliver Haddo were modeled on reallife occultist Aleister Crowley.";

The Paul Newman here is more understated and antiheroic which provides a welcome change to film goers like me who enjoy seeing the Hollywood biggies downplaying their boxoffice charm by taking on less glamorous more substantive roles. This political melodrama takes place primarily in a EuropeanBritish Isles setting with an all European cast except for Mr. Newman. He portrays an agent who infiltrates a diamond smuggling ring to try to smash that ring's core. During the course of the film he is pretty well beat up and bandied about by his antagonists not leaving his pretty boy image much to thrive on. His contact agent Mrs. Smith Dominique Sanda becomes his love interest not as a torrid screen love affair but more of an quasiplatonic one where the job at hand takes precedence over the romantic involvement.The plot and story line is developed nicely by Mr. Huston who takes us on a European tour that starts in London then works its way to Ireland and finally to Malta. James Mason does his usual yeoman's job in his rendition of the pompous Sir George Wheeler the right wing politico big wig who may have his own share of illegal dalliances. Although Mr. Newman is in fact the main character the entire cast comes across very well as more of an ensemble effort with no one role really outdoing another. It seems that Mr. Huston lent his directorial hand very deftly when it came to letting the film itself be the focal point rather than just one or two actors hogging the spotlight. Not a well known film perhaps but one that deserves viewing nonetheless due in no small part to a most interesting conclusion.".

The locations in London and Ireland with real local people add much to the realism and fascination of the story.

	schema:reviewBody "Hitchcock appears to be the ghost that is haunting John Huston in this flick. Or should we say that it is Huston's homage to Hitchcock that we have here and which seems to either spice up or overburden the film depending on who the viewer is. The cinematography lowkey brown color palette and restrained performances  allowing the vivid action to move the plot all have shades of the later Hitchcock movies like Topaz or the one with Newman himself in it Torn Curtain. In fact Hitchcock made only one more film after the 1973 date of Mackintosh Man so we are witnessing something which could be interpreted as an effort on Huston's part to continue that legacy. Some specific parallels are for example Newman's struggle in the river to strangle the killerdog set on him during his escape echoing the struggle in the farmhouse to kill the Russian agent Torn Curtain. Or the mad car chase over rocky Irish roads by Newman and Sanda mimicking the inevitable car chases patented by Hitch in various of his early bw films such as The Man who Knew too Much w Donat or Young and Innocent. Another parallel can be seen in the casting. Besides Newman himself there is Huston's selection of the mysterious Dominique Sanda one of Europe's most sensuous stars whose appeal mirrors Hitchcock's obsession with the cool blonde beauty of Grace Kelly Eva Marie Saint or Tippi Hedren.Then too we have the eloquent James Mason in a late role commanding the opening of the film in the House of Lords by holding forth in the grand manner.

In what other country than England could upperclass spies  traitors be celebrated in literature and movies like the agents Philby or Blunt? Newman's adversaries are gentlemen but not what they seem to be. We even get an idea of what an English prison is like and the quantities of laundry that they do. Last of all who is Mrs. Smith?

Yes there are holes in the plot but overall the performances and Newman's Great Escape make up for the plot weaknesses.Of four  three and a half.

	onyx:emotionText "Hitchcock appears to be the ghost that is haunting John Huston in this flick. Or should we say that it is Huston's homage to Hitchcock that we have here and which seems to either spice up or overburden the film depending on who the viewer is. The cinematography lowkey brown color palette and restrained performances  allowing the vivid action to move the plot all have shades of the later Hitchcock movies like Topaz or the one with Newman himself in it Torn Curtain. In fact Hitchcock made only one more film after the 1973 date of Mackintosh Man so we are witnessing something which could be interpreted as an effort on Huston's part to continue that legacy. Some specific parallels are for example Newman's struggle in the river to strangle the killerdog set on him during his escape echoing the struggle in the farmhouse to kill the Russian agent Torn Curtain. Or the mad car chase over rocky Irish roads by Newman and Sanda mimicking the inevitable car chases patented by Hitch in various of his early bw films such as The Man who Knew too Much w Donat or Young and Innocent. Another parallel can be seen in the casting. Besides Newman himself there is Huston's selection of the mysterious Dominique Sanda one of Europe's most sensuous stars whose appeal mirrors Hitchcock's obsession with the cool blonde beauty of Grace Kelly Eva Marie Saint or Tippi Hedren.Then too we have the eloquent James Mason in a late role commanding the opening of the film in the House of Lords by holding forth in the grand manner.

Reardon have to expose a communist traitor and he also must catch him . The intrigue involves a Conservative Member of the British Parliament Sir George Wheeler James Mason  who is best known for his frequent political diatribes on the British government . Meanwhile  Reardon goes in action  being helped by a beautiful agent Dominique Sanda in her first Hollywood movie for French actress . A cold war spy thriller with all the edgeofseat ingredients  suspense  thrills  a complex intrigue  twists and turns . Intriguing and thrilling script  being one of the first produced screenplays of Walter Hill who later became an action thriller director . Paul Newman is first rate as a secret agent assigned a dangerous mission accompanied by a beauty Dominique Sanda . Wily and excellent  as always  James Mason as a cunning Parliament member with dark aims . This is the first of two movies that actors Paul Newman and James Mason made together  the other was Verdict . It's also the second of two movies that director John Huston and actor Paul Newman made together  he first was The judge Roy Bean  made the previous year . Supporting cast is frankly magnificent  such as Ian Bannen  Nigel Patrick  Michael Hordern  Percy Herbert  the last film of Noel Purcell and Niall MacGinnis and special mention to Harry Andrews as Mackintosh . This film and its source novel were loosely based on the identification defection and escape from Wormwood Scrubs Prison in 1966 of Russian spy George Blake who was working in British intelligence as a double agent but was not one of the Cambridge Five spies . Colorful and evocative cinematography by Oswald Morris filmed on location in London  Ireland and Malta . Enjoyable musical score by the great Maurice Jarre  including a catching leitmotif . The motion picture was well produced by John Foreman who financed various Huston films such as The Man Who Would Be King  being stunningly directed by the great John Huston at his best . Director John Huston made this spy movie not longer after he had helmed another espionage film  Kremlin's letter . The picture was made in a good time of the 70s and 80s when Huston resurged as a director of quality films with Fat City 1972  the aforementioned The man who would be king 1975 and Wise blood 1979. He ended his career on a high note with Under volcano 1984 Honor of Prizzi 1985 and Dublineses 1987.

	schema:reviewBody "For some reason Paul Newman and international intrigue never hit it off. In The Prize Mark Robson 1963 a story of skullduggery at the Nobel Prize ceremonies complete with kidnappings violence and romance Newman looks petulant and sounds whiney. The movie's style echoes Charade and To Catch a Thief but Newman is definitely no Cary Grant. In Torn Curtain Alfred Hitchcock 1966 where a killing is brutal and lengthy betrayal and capture is a real possibility but where tension is lacking Newman usually looks irritable and uncomfortable. Torn Curtain isn't much of a movie and Newman disliked his experience working with Hitchcock but Newman's performance is flat and perfunctory. With the Mackintosh Man a story of Cold War intrigue treason and dangerous escapes Newman doesn't break his pattern. He gives a performance that for me seems commonplace. It's not all his fault. The screenplay by Walter Hill undoubtedly with a lot of input from director John Huston is unnecessarily complicated and abrupt. Worse Huston's direction in my opinion is careless and sloppy. Relationships in the movie aren't made clear. There's no subtlety. Details get lost. There's a long pointless car chase. At times Newman looks like he's all by himself acting in a vacuum. Much of the movie was filmed in Ireland during Huston's long Irish squire period. One assumes this was the primary reason Huston did the film. He could get great tax writeoffs he was where he enjoyed being the Irish loved having him there...and he evidently didn't want to be bothered by working too hard. So why watch the movie? Well if you're a fan of the adventure novels of Desmond Bagley you'll know The Mackintosh Man is based on Bagley's The Freedom Trap. For some reason I get a little nostalgic even while I'm either bored or irritated by the movie knowing this. The book as nearly all of Bagley's novels are is a superior read with careful tricky plotting good writing and protagonists you can come to like. The second reason is James Mason. He plays a slippery fellow you'd better not trust too far. Mason is a movie in himself as he usually was in all of his films. It's a delight to observe just how good he was. The third reason is the large number of firstrate British character actors that populate the movie. Some have significant roles others are on and off quickly. Here are a few and they're all memorable...Harry Andrews Ian Bannen Michael Hordern Nigel Patrick Peter Vaughan Roland Culver Percy Herbert Niall MacGinnis Noel Purcell and Leo Genn. The movie may be confusingly written and carelessly directed Newman may seem out of place but you can't beat the cast. Newman plays Joe Reardon a tough crook tossed into a British high security prison for 20 years. Eventually he hooks up with a gang that runs an escape operation for longterm prisoners. They get you over the wall and to another country. They can get Reardon out if he pays their high price. Others have gone before. He agrees and out he goes with another prisoner who is a traitor. By gum we find out Reardon really is working with British counter intelligence. Highlevel traitors are being sprung from the prison and winding up in a transit pipeline to the Soviet Union by way of Malta. Could an aristocratic member of parliament Sir George Wheeler Mason be involved? Does the beautiful Mrs. Smith Dominque Sanda really care for Joe or is she playing her own game? Can Newman ever show he's tough without sounding sarcastic? Could a dramatic shootout at the climax be more selfconsciously staged and directed? Read Bagley's The Freedom Trap then see the movie. You'll like I hope the story in the book and you'll like the actors in the movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "The whole movie is pretty well executed but there are two scenes that especially impress.  The first has Newman just escaped from a country estate being chased across some sprawling chillylooking hills by some armed gangsters and a dog.  No particular acting skills are called for but the location has been neatly chosen.  The steelgray horizon is empty as far as the eye can see.  The rises are sprinkled with large lichenspotted boulders.  There are numerous small streams that must be splashed across and they look so cold as to be almost glacier fed.  Low stone walls crisscross the landscape.  Newman runs through an isolated cemetery studded with a dozen Celtic crosses the kind of place that is so atmospheric that it practically begs you to die on the spot so you can be buried there and forgotten. The second memorable scene is a car chase.  Well  a car and pickup chase. Newman and Sanda roar around the mossy back roads of the Irish countryside followed by two men in a Mercedes.  Newman says Now let's see what they can really do and he floors the battered truck.  There are skids the vehicles twirl around on the slippery dirt road they bump and crash against the stone walls bordering the paths.  With no particular set up the Mercedes does a final pirouette and flings itself backward against and through one of the walls.  Alas this particular wall was designed to prevent vehicles from accidentally driving off the cliff behind it.  The Mercedes does a neat one and a half gainer off the precipice bounces off the rocks far below and into the surf.  I never thought I'd find another car chase exciting but this one is straightforward and unembellished.  There are no slow motion shots.  No vehicles crash through a fruit peddler's cart. There are no shots of the inside of the car as it falls no screaming occupants.  The Mercedes lands on its roof way down there  and does NOT explode!  It just lies there in the swirling ocean surf mackeral dead. Thank you John Huston.The story is kind of complicated but is followable if you pay attention. James Mason Ian Bannon and Harry Andrews are old pros at this business. Paul Newman's efforts on film have been varied.  When he gets a good script and puts some effort into it you get a fine performance from him as in The Hustler.  He's often criticized for not being able to play comedy but he's more than competent in say The Prize.  There are also times when he seems hardly able to keep awake and he mumbles rather than speaks as in Torn Curtain and some of the time in this film.  It's rather a lukewarm performance.  And he's suntanned beyond any English or Irish standards though he'd fit right into Malibu.  Dominique Sanda has about one expression an intense stare and is rather like Candace Bergen so stunningly gorgeous that it hardly matters whether she can act or not.The ending is something of a disappointment.  There is a Mexican standoff involving Bannon and Mason on one side and Newman on the other.  Bannon a voice of tired reason advances the proposition that this situation is insane.  Someone is liable to be hurt.  Why not put our pistols down and walk away all of us alive and no one in danger any longer?  Sounds eminently sensible.  Newman agrees which is also sensible.  So everyone puts down his gun but while Mason and Bannon stroll off Sanda who has had Mason's gun pressed against her head picks up a pistol and shoots the two of them to pieces for personal reasons.  She tells Newman who is standing there aghast You would have let them get away.  I should have shot you too.  Then she stalks off and leaves him flat.  The problem is that viewers haven't been set up for this ending.  It's true that Mason was responsible for the death of Sanda's father but we've been given no indication of how bitter she is or how ruthlessly she can kill.  Huston has claimed that the ending was made up at the last minute but that he regretted using it as it now is because he would have shot some of the earlier scenes differently. He was right about that the old fake.".

Whereas Maclean got superlative movies fashioned from 'The Guns Of Navarone' 'Ice Station Zebra' and 'Where Eagles Dare' Bagley's stories were by and large ignored by Hollywood. A rare exception was John Huston's 1973 film of 'The Freedom Trap' retitled 'The Mackintosh Man'. Paul Newman plays 'Joseph Rearden' recruited by British Intelligence boss 'Mackintosh'  Harry Andrews  for a top secret operation to unmask a traitor at the heart of the establishment. Posing as an Australian jewel thief he allows himself to be sent to jail for twenty years  how times change. Nobody would get a sentence like that now even for murder . A fellow inmate  Nigel Patrick  informs him of the existence of 'The Scarperers'  a group who help rich prisoners escape for a large fee. Rearden goes over the wall with Communist spy 'Ronald Slade'  Ian Bannen . Some time later he wakes up in a mysterious country house with sinister German nurse 'Gerda'  Jenny Runacre  and creepy 'Mr.Brown'  Michael Hordern  for company. But his cover is blown and he is forced to make a break for it. A phone call to London informs him that Mackintosh  the one man who knows of his innocence  has died...Loosely based on the reallife case of George Blake  a Communist spy who was freed from jail in 1966 by men sympathetic to his cause  this pleasant oldschool spy thriller benefits from a twisty story location shooting in London Ireland and Malta and a firstrate cast. Newman is as solid as ever and alongside him are some great British stars such as James Mason Roland Culver Percy Herbert and Peter Vaughan with lovely Dominique Sanda as Mackintosh's daughter 'Mrs.Smith'. Stealing the show however is the stunning Jenny Runacre as 'Gerda' who gets to inflict some painfullooking wounds on the star. Wonderful Irish actors like Noel Purcell and Eddie Byrne appear fleetingly. Maurice Jarre's title theme is very much in the same vein as Anton Karras' music for 'The Third Man'.Walter Hill who wrote the script later became a major action director with '48 Hours' and 'The Driver' to his credit. He sticks to the book but the ending has been unfortunately changed. Instead of 'Sir George Wheeler's'  Mason  yacht being blown up by a limpet mine we get a more lowkey climax similar to that of 'The Ipcress File'. It ends far too quickly for my liking. Rearden deserved better than to be dumped by Smith. I'd also like to know how an old lorry could possibly outstrip a powerful Mercedes on a quiet Irish road. Flaws aside 'The Mackintosh Man' is an above average timepasser.".

	schema:reviewBody "This time we have a good old British spy film in which the real traitor is the one who is calling for all traitors and criminals to be terminated. Joseph Rearden the infiltrator who is supposed to expose the whole network then is a solitary man in an erupting nest of aspics. The only one he could trust does not survive his silly confidence. Macintosh is a vain little mule who still trusted one person in the world his own assassin. A solitary man against a very well organized spying business finds it slightly difficult but he is an Interpol agent after all. So he knows how to swim between two different currents without drowning. His escape from prison and his escape from the hiding house in Ireland are absolutely amusing. It is so easy. No one is going to believe that one. And yet everyone believes it and they end up in Malta and have a good laugh a sacrilegious laugh after killing two people in a church. Mama Mia. That film from 1973 is funny in many ways because the action is so easygoing like some kind of slow business in a back street on a bank holiday Sunday when everyone is out of town. It is in a way funny to see such a film today with an actor who is worth a lot and yet is dramatically underused and underdirected if not just plain undirected or maybe even misdirected. One thing is impossible today the drowning of the dog you would have the RSPA on your back from the shoulders to the ankles for such cruelty to animals. Slightly too long and too realistic. It is as if we were watching the sketches of Guernica instead of Guernica. Some preparatory sketches instead of a masterpiece. But well it is fun to watch some peaceful and rather restive spy film that does not explode in all directions. But well a tiny bit more action might have been a good thing.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne University Paris 8 Saint Denis University Paris 12 Crteil CEGID".

And boy does it show.....Nobody's even faintly trying to create any suspense. Everybody involved seems to be sleepwalking through the thin plot until the predictable ending. There is absolutely nothing that stands out about this film. It's not even bad enough to be interesting just dull beyond belief. Only recommended to cure insomniacs.".

The screenplay by highlyrespected writer Walter Hill features a solid premise and plenty of interesting twists and turns and the various UK locations are used to great effect bringing a character of their own to the film. The cast is also wellchosen and portray their roles with respectable conviction yet something still seems off about the picture. It's almost as if the whole enterprise lack that special oomph that is necessary to really sell a spy picture.Perhaps the problem is that after years of James Bond movies and various Cold War thrillers too many of the film's elements have simply been done before and done better and the ominous feeling of dj vu is too immense for the film to survive. Or maybe the problem is that we expect a lot more from a director with clout of John Huston who seems to take a strangely apathetic approach to the material which makes the film's recycled elements feel even more trying. For whatever reason the film never seems to grip us in the way a good thriller is supposed to. As a whole THE MACKINTOSH MAN is a fine film for a rainy evening but it stands as not only a wasted opportunity but also as possibly the least distinctive film of director Huston.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have always enjoyed The MacKintosh Man having read the original novel by Desmond Bagley and being overtly fond of John Huston's work as a filmmaker. Looked at today I think it can be viewed as a typical 1970's cold war thriller heavy with atmosphere but having watched it again yesterday I am curious about a few idiosyncrasies that I believe can be considered potholes. It takes a while before we realise that Rearden Paul Newman is a British secret service agent but is it conceivable that any agent would be prepared to spend a lengthy time in jail before eventually being sprung by the elite group known as The Scarperers  in this instance we are to believe that Rearden is content to spend a year in a half in a maximum security prison masquerading as a criminal before he is even contacted. I mean it is quite possible that he could have been there for years before any approaches were made. And only MacKintosh and his daughter know his true identity! How do the authorities know that The Scarperers will try to spring the Russian agent Slade Ian Bannenin the first place? Why do The Scarperers decide to spring the jewelthief Rearden at the same time as Slade? Surely Slade would have been top priority on his own without complicating matters by deciding to spring a lesser offender at the same time? A halfshare in Rearden's money is surely not a goodenough reason. Would a highly respected British M.P. Member of Parliament Sir George Wheeler James Mason and notice the Sir though in fact a longembedded Russian agent himself endanger his position by having a recently escaped Russian agent hidden aboard his yacht in the first place? And then casually sail with him aboard to Malta? I mean there are a few other instances that can leave the casual viewer wondering about the plot and its development but I think it best to leave them. The MacKintosh Man is a solid little thriller that would not withstand too serious a critical analysis. But then again many of the greatest films ever made are riddled with plotholes and to delve too deeply would be to destroy the illusion and our enjoyment. And really all cinema at the end of the day mediocre or not is just an illusion. So be it!".

But the police are tipped off Rearden goes on trial and is sent to prison and agrees to a shadowy organizations' offer of assistance. They regularly break people out of prison for a hefty fee.This viewer would do well not to give away too many more details about the plot because it does have some twists for you along the way. Not everything here can be taken at face value. The absorbing tale was adapted from a novel by Desmond Bagley although future director Walter Hill gets sole screenwriting credit several people actually worked on it. It gets a lot out of some wonderful location shooting in Ireland and Malta and it showcases a typically charismatic and commanding Newman. The first rate cast also features Dominique Sanda as a Frenchaccented Mrs. Smith who works with MacKintosh and a superb James Mason as a sly member of Parliament who's leading a double life. It's a pleasure to see them all at work. Ian Bannen Michael Hordern Nigel Patrick Peter Vaughan Roland Culver Percy Herbert the intoxicatingly sexy Jenny Runacre Niall MacGinnis Eddie Byrne and Shane Briant turn up as well.There are some thrilling moments but the climactic confrontation leaves a little something to be desired. It just doesn't have that much tension. However there is some shocking violence that makes a hell of an impact.This is good material overall that would have been ideal for a filmmaker such as Hitchcock. But Huston is pretty masterful himself crafting a slick feature that holds your attention without being really memorable.Seven out of 10.".

So it's not a surprise they achieved a great hit with The Major and the Minor. One has to go back to the time this film was made to realize what the creators of this comedy accomplished. This marked the first Hollywood film Mr. Wilder directed and his touch is everywhere. The movie stands the passage of time.The Major and the Minor works because of its two stars. Ginger Rogers and Ray Milland were versatile actors who showed perfect chemistry in the film. Both do excellent work guided by the masterful hand of Billy Wilder.Ginger Rogers' take on the little girl is fine. Of course we the viewers know what is going on but to the rest of the people she is nothing but the innocent and young SuSu Applegate. Ray Milland on the other hand is proper throughout the film until the end when the mystery is solved. Mr. Milland's timing is impeccable and he makes his Maj. Kirby a sort of absent minded uncle to the young SuSu.Billy Wilder showed a flair for this type of comedy. He got wonderful supporting performances from Rita Johnson and the disarming Diana Lynn as the two sisters with different viewpoints on everything. Also the opening sequence involving the incomparable Robert Benchley shows us a lecherous man who has hired the grown up Susan for a scalp treatment that in his mind will lead into something else. Mr. Benchley and Ms. Rogers are hilarious.This film established Billy Wilder as a director who went far and enjoyed a long career.".

It's a joke obviously too subtle for some because Charles Boyer is of course one of the great lovers of the screen one everyone would have known when this film was released in 1941. It's similar to when Ginger Rogers' character as a girl on the train is asked to speak Swedish for the conductors who question her veracity. She answers I want to be alone. Again this joke is something every movie viewer then would have known as an allusion to Swedish film star Greta Garbo. The Major and the Minor is a marvelous film and deserves better treatment on IMDb.".

The initial response is no which Billy Wilder and Ginger Rogers reinforce through the disconnect between Rogers' SuSu and the precocious reality of the adolescent set.

Rogers' inability to escape predatory advances  whether it be by grownups in the big city or 13 year old military school boys  is an ironic point well made by Wilder this film indeed seems an exploration of extreme fate. Take the inevitable wedding of Pamela that occurs regardless of the identity of the groom or the fact that on every date Rogers is subjected to go on with a Cadet it becomes the exact same date. More to the point the connection between Ray Milland's Major Kirby and Rogers does not change as they meet with Rogers taking on three separate incarnations.

	schema:headline " Wilder's Directing Debut  SuSu you're a knockout!";
	schema:reviewBody "Billy Wilder like his contemporary Preston Sturgis gained attention in Hollywood at Paramount Studio as a screen writer. And oddly enough both decided to become directors because of unfair feelings towards the work of director Mitchell Leisin with their scripts. Wilder did not like Leisin's work with MIDNIGHT and Sturgis did not like his work with REMEMBER THE NIGHT. It was unfair because Leisin did not have the cynical edge of Wilder and Sturgis but Leisin was into bringing a more human element into his films oddly enough in later years Wilder would too. They both got permission from Paramount to direct  Wilder a little after Sturgis did because Sturgis had demonstrated he could be quite successful as a director. THE MAJOR AND THE MINOR is Wilder's first film as director and his first comedy. He demonstrated in it that he was above average in his ability to direct getting the first good performance he got out of Ray Milland and an equally good one out of Ginger Rogers. He and his partner Charles Brackett did the screenplay here  a simple story of a woman who gets fed up with her failing life in New York City and decides to return however regretfully it may seem to her small midwestern town. But Susan Applegate has a problem  she hasn't enough money for her ticket by train. Then she discovers she does have enough for her ticket if she can convince everyone she is a very tall teenager. So she does as twelve year old Su Su Applegate. Complete with pigtales and a balloon and temporarily accompanied by Tom Dugan who agrees to be her father for a price Su Su gets her ticket only to be cheated by Dugan out of most of the remaining money she was carrying she does kick him though!.She ends up hiding from suspicious conductors in a private sleeping compartment with Major Philip Kirby Milland who is returning to his job at a military academy after a fruitless attempt to get into the war effort it is 1942. Kirby is engaged to the daughter of the commandant of the academy Pamela Hill Rita Johnson. What he doesn't know is that Pamela is determined to undermine every attempt he makes to get a war job. She has connections through her father's friends which she uses like an expert. It helps that Philip has an eye problem though not a major one.Because she is traveling alone Philip takes SuSu to the academy until they can have her picked up or driven to her home. She becomes an instant social success with all of the cadets  most of whom test out their young libidos on her by demonstrating how the Nazi blitzkrieg bypassed the Maginot Line you have to see it to believe it. Only one person is not taken in  Pamela's sister Lucy Diana Lynn. Lucy is going to be a scientist and she can tell that SuSu is just too well developed to be her age. But Lucy and SuSu soon develop a close friendship as Lucy eventually admits Susan is far more of a sister to her than Pamela ever was. So SuSu's secret is safe  and she and Lucy soon are trying to figure out how to counteract Pamela's efforts against Philip.The film has many lovely touches like SuSu taking over the switch board the cadet who is caught as a result and who has been listening to My Mother Done Told Me looks angrily at her and yells out A woman's a twoface!. There are also the appearances of Robert Benchley as the amorous Mr. Osborne who knew Susan as Susan in New York but meets SuSu at a dance at the military academy Benchley's son is a cadet there. He goes crazy trying to figure out where he met this girl before. But best is the interaction between Milland and Rogers one highlight of which shows Wilder at his wickedest and would not be repeated in 1940s comedies again. Trying to get little SuSu to be careful with the cadets Uncle Philip gives her a birds and the bees lecture. She asks him if he thinks she is attractive. He looks carefully at her and says Why SuSu you're a knockout!' She leaves and he shuts the door smiling. The smile has a touch too much teeth in it  almost a sensual smile. And Milland realizes it...and a moment later he cringes thinking that he is becoming a potential child molester.Will Philip get his wartime commission? Will Pamela get defeated and Susan eventually reveal herself to Philip as a grown woman she likes him very much? You have to see the film to see how it works out. It also has the added attraction of Ginger Roger's mother Leila playing Susan's mother. Altogether a capital film and a good directorial debut for Wilder.".

	schema:reviewBody "Susan Applegate Ginger Rogers gives up on pursuing her dreams in New York and decides to return home on the next train. Not being able to afford an adult ticket she pretends to be 11 12 next week. This plan is rough to start with and gets more difficult when she meets a handsome military man Ray Milland on the train...Billy Wilder had gotten sick of his writing being taken by directors and butchered from his original vision. This marks his directorial debut and it is a brilliant piece of film. Is it his masterpiece? Probably not. But I'd say it is better than many other of Wilder's works.Can Ginger Rogers pull off being 12? On one hand clearly not. But at the same time any actress that could would probably not be able to be the woman that is hidden underneath the child disguise. For the most part the transformation is impressive even if not completely believable.I absolutely loved this film and have not found myself more engrossed by a classic film in a long time and I do watch plenty of classics. If you love Billy Wilder or Ginger Rogers or want to get acquainted with either one I would say this is the film for you.".

	onyx:emotionText "Susan Applegate Ginger Rogers gives up on pursuing her dreams in New York and decides to return home on the next train. Not being able to afford an adult ticket she pretends to be 11 12 next week. This plan is rough to start with and gets more difficult when she meets a handsome military man Ray Milland on the train...Billy Wilder had gotten sick of his writing being taken by directors and butchered from his original vision. This marks his directorial debut and it is a brilliant piece of film. Is it his masterpiece? Probably not. But I'd say it is better than many other of Wilder's works.Can Ginger Rogers pull off being 12? On one hand clearly not. But at the same time any actress that could would probably not be able to be the woman that is hidden underneath the child disguise. For the most part the transformation is impressive even if not completely believable.I absolutely loved this film and have not found myself more engrossed by a classic film in a long time and I do watch plenty of classics. If you love Billy Wilder or Ginger Rogers or want to get acquainted with either one I would say this is the film for you.";

And even though the basic plot seemed to be mere fluff to me when I first saw it I'm now persuaded that this movie definitely runs deeper. After reading other comments here that delved into the themes I thought of a particular scene that struck me as odd when I first watched this. At the station when Ginger first gets the idea to pose as a child a mother is looking at magazines with her two children a boy and a girl. The young daughter insists on buying a movie magazine and reads aloud from the cover Why I hit women by Charles Boyer. The way the child says this and the very fact that this particular line is included just stayed in my mind as I watched this film. Others commented on how Ginger's character is always suffering predatory advances both as an adult and as an eleven year old. Now I see it differently when I think of the scene where Ray Milland is looking at her with one eye closed and telling her what a knockout he can tell she'll be in a few years. Well of course he's really looking at a 30 year old but he believes she's a child and I think this really brings up issues of how sexualized and maybe preyed upon ?women are at any age whether they are adults or children. Well that really makes this an odd and interesting movie mixing some risqu topics with highly enjoyable lighthearted fluff!".

It's an adorable story about a New York City working girl Ginger Rogers wanting to go home to Iowa but not having enough money for the train fare so she goes as a minor 12 years old.  Along the way she meets a Major from a boys military school Ray Milland and gets involved with his life unintentionly and falls in love. It is an unusual story but it works.  The chemistry between Rogers and Milland is perfection.  They made a great team.  In 1944 they made another terrific movie Lady in the Dark which was a comedy with musical numbers. This was Ginger Rogers' best movie and Ray Milland was her best leading man. They complimented each other. Ginger Rogers and Ray Milland had something in common they could do comedy and drama easily.  Not many actors can do that.   My favorite thing about this movie is the romance but the next thing I liked is the supporting actress Rita Johnson who was a superb villain in comedies. She was always fighting to get the guy.  I won't say the movie is dated but you do notice the movie represents the 1940's during the war years it shows how the people looked and acted differently than they do today.".

This is one of those classics I really enjoyed when I first watched it but dragged too much when seen recently. Sometimes the more you get used to modern movies the more some of these classic films can seem too slow. This is an example.Also and I am a classic movie fan despite these comments this film is another example of how much viewers were asked to suspend belief in these older films. Here were asked to believe that no one would suspect that a grownup Ginger Rogers couldn't pass as a 12yearold? One look at the very femalelike Rogers and it's previous obvious she's and adult especially at the dance near the end of the film.Well if you can overlook that this is still a fun movie. Sometimes the dated dialog and attitudes of the time period make it all the more fun. Rogers was a great comedienne not just Fred Astaire's most famous dance partner. She is the big star of this film.There is a bit of Lolita mentality in here as Milland begins to fall for this 12 yearold. They never really tell you here whether Milland knew how old she was all along however. The end the film a bit too abruptly as the two run off to get married!!!! As I said there are lots of holes in this story but it is entertaining enough that you don't care. Of note too is that Rogers' reallife mother plays her mom in this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Billy Wilder began his career in Hollywood as a screenwriter. However dissatisfied with how directors were treating his screenplays he yearned to have greater creative control over his films. Though he had codirected a single film in the past the ultraobscure French drama 'Mauvaise graine 1934' it wasn't until 1942 that he was given a genuine opportunity to display his directorial talent and a penchant for audacious comedy. On the surface 'The Major and the Minor 1942' might easily be mistaken for a silly fluffy screwball comedy  and it works quite effectively when viewed as such  but closer inspection reveals an abundance of mature and even slightly scandalous themes coming into play. Ginger Rogers and Ray Milland costar in Wilder's improbable but highly entertaining satire of inherent human sexuality loaded with unsubtle innuendo Why don't you get out of that wet coat and into a dry martini? and difficult romantic situations. It must have taken a bold director indeed to present a grown man falling in love with what he believes to be a twelveyearold girl a contentious subject even today.Ginger Rogers plays Susan Applegate a proud and independent woman living in the city. Wilder doesn't shy away from revealing the darker even somewhat predatory sexual nature of most men and the camera shows countless male heads turning towards Susan as she passes through a hotel lobby each pair of eyes eagerly passing over her attractive body. When a married scalpmassage client Robert Benchley mistakes their appointment for something more than a massage the early stages of Wilder's preoccupation with marital infidelity Susan decides to return to her quaint uncorrupted hometown only to find that she lacks the money for an adult train ticket. In a burst of genius she decides in order to claim a halffare ticket to masquerade as a twelveyearold her appearance drastically altered by styling her hair into pigtails wearing children's clothing and carrying a balloon. That any intelligent human being would actually be fooled by such a scheme is highly debatable but if the viewer learns to suspend ample disbelief then many laughs are due to follow.Ray Milland plays Major Philip Kirby a handsome and respectable military man who meets Susan now using the childish moniker SuSu on the train and takes to her almost immediately. After intense flooding brings their train to a halt Kirby agrees to bring Susan back to his residence at a boy's military school where she is immediately the sensation of the college. As a young girl Susan's experiences with male sexual desire change little the hordes of gawking and opportunistic men give rise to equallyrapacious hordes of gawking and opportunistic boys and even Major Kirby himself to his horror finds himself becoming attracted to SuSu as her mature charm begins to exhibit itself. In a particular sequence one that the censors no doubt would have watched warily Kirby attempts to explain to Susan the birds and the bees likening her female attraction to a light bulb surrounded by moths and one eye clamped firmly shut suddenly declares her to be a knockout! Billy Wilder's first feature film is audacious wellwritten brilliantlyacted and most importantly of all very funny it deserves to be seen alongside the director's other various classics.".

What strikes me about it now is that it's just one element of the theme of sexaspotentialexploitation that's woven throughoutfrom the ogling of Susan in New York to her unpleasant encounter with Benchley to her exhausting attempts to avoid male teenage libidos at the military academy. What makes Wilder's treatment of that theme so wonderful and perhaps why his films are not merely shallowly risqu is the way that potential is just observed rather than being the whole point of the movie. The point instead in this film as in his later ones is the capacity of mature cleareyed adults to navigate past sexual predators and through their own cynicisms to find love.

This rather interesting comedy depends a great deal not on just Wilder's writing and directing but on the considerable comedy talents of Ginger Rogers to put it over. It's not easy for an actress in the full flower of maturity to pretend to be an adolescent but Rogers was certainly up to the task.Rogers plays Susan Applegate from Stevenson Iowa who has had just about enough of New York. After trying several professions and making no headway in any of them she's ready to cash it in and go back to Stevenson maybe marry a local guy there. But cash is the problem when she comes up just short of the fare from New York to Stevenson. What to do but pretend she's a child and travel for half fare.A rather interesting set of circumstances has her stopping off as a guest of Ray Milland whom she has 'fooled' into thinking she is only an early teen. That doesn't sit well with Milland's fiance Rita Johnson a real ice princess who suspects something's up. And Johnson's sister Diana Lynn knows there is but doesn't care. Milland is an instructor at a boy's military school and the sight of his female guest sends the cadets into hormonal overdrive. Milland's feeling a bit antsy around Rogers though he can't quite figure out why.Wilder showed that even in his first film he was a master at slipping stuff by the censors. In a recent biography of Billy Wilder that was more important on this film than most because the subject matter was weaving dangerously close to pedophilia. Paramount was disposed to let Wilder have this project especially after another of their writers a couple of years earlier showed he had the directing chops. But Preston Sturges was given a tryout in the studio's B picture unit with The Great McGinty. The Major And The Minor was an A film all the way because Wilder was able to sell Ginger Rogers on the story. He also brought the film only slightly over budget which definitely insured he would have a directorial career at Paramount.Robert Benchley is also in the film as a lecherous old goat who is the one who finally sends Rogers packing to Iowa after putting the moves on her while she is trying the profession of masseuse. Wouldn't you know it he turns out to be the father of a chip off the old block in the person of Cadet Frankie Thomas. Benchley's scenes in the film are precious indeed.The Major And The Minor still holds up very well after over 60 years no doubt because of the risqu subject matter. It's a film definitely guaranteed to make you a fan of the talents of its director and its stars.".

This is patently ridiculous and if anyone could possibly pull this off Miss Rogers was NOT the one! Had the film starred a very younglooking and less developed lady such as Leslie Caron or Audrey Hepburn circa 1952 perhaps it wouldn't have seemed so ridiculous but here it just makes the commonsense part of me want to scream. I just hate films with bad premises and bad castingand I am not sure ANY actress could make this premise work. Oddly this dopey plot was repeated a decade later when Jerry Lewis took on this same roleand he was 29 at the time! While Billy Wilder is a now huge name in directing at the time he had no reputation in Hollywood so he was stuck with this utterly stupid casting decision. Had he been given this assignment later in his illustrious assume he would have likely refused such a ridiculous premise!The silly plot occurs because Ginger is trying to buy a train ticket but the rate has recently changed. However the child fare is halfprice and so she decides to pose as a kid!! On board the conductors naturally assume she's an adult but oddly Ray Milland is an apparent idiot and has no idea she's NOT a child!!!! So since he's a gullible idiot Ginger hangs out in his private room during the entire trip. However when Milland's fiance sees Ginger in his room later she naturally assumes that this 31 yearold woman is a 31 yearold woman!! But to convince his fiance and future fatherinlaw that she is only a child and nothing inappropriate occurred he brings Ginger with him to meet them at the military school. And oddly when they meet Ginger they immediately assume that she is 12!!! This is dumb AND creepyafter all it's better that she's a 31 yearold than a prepubescent female riding with a strange man!!! Now whether or not this is a watchable film just depends on how a able you will be to accept the premise. If you can somehow manage to not only believe the plot but also ignore all the creepy implications the film is a lot of fun...and even romantic especially at the end. I guess I just couldn't do this and the movie despite its pluses just didn't work for me. I couldn't get past Ginger's casting her ridiculous impersonation of a child calling it 'broad' or a 'burlesque' is way too charitable and that Milland's character might just be a pedophilea very problematic plot to say the least!".

A deception was therefore needed to try to lure away some of the German defences. Interservices XX Committee XX for doublecross members Lieutenant Commander Ewen Montagu and Squadron Leader Sir Archibald Cholmondley hatched the then unheard of plan of planting a body in the sea off Spain where prevailing currents would surely carry it inshore to the Huelva region known to be the territory of one of the Nazis' best Spanish agents. The body dressed as a major in the Royal Marines and apparently killed in a plane crash would be carrying supposedly top secret documents aimed at convincing any reader that the invasion target was not Sicily at all but Greece. Montagu himself plays a cameo role in the film as an Air Marshall.The leading role of Montagu is played by Clifton Webb utterly credible as a British naval officer while Robert Flemyng who had himself served conspicuously in WWII and who was awarded the Military Cross and Order of The British Empire takes on the role of his junior assistant a composite role based partly on Cholmondley's reallife character and partly on Montagu's reallife assistant.Together they must procure a body that will pass a medical examination to determine the cause of death and they must also create a personality and a past life and history for this man.This is a truestory that avoids battle scenes and big bangs. There are no special effects. It describes a war of stealth and cunning and the cat and mouse game of espionage. It is an atmospheric suspense thriller with Stephen Boyd very effective as the determined Axis agent Patrick O'Reilly sent in from Ireland to verify the existence and past life of this man who never was. While the soundtrack is one of Alan Rawsthorne's The Cruel Sea better scores it is nevertheless immediately recognizable as being one of his haunting compositions unfortunately sounding so much like all his others. It is ably directed by the great and sometimes underrated Ronald Neame. It is beautifully filmed as are all of formercameraman Neame's pictures. The voice of Churchill is provided by the young Peter Sellers who at that time in 1956 was establishing his versatility and making a name for himself in the BBC radio comedy The Goon Show.20th Century Fox's DVD video and sound quality are excellent as would be expected in the studio release of one of their own productions.A worthy and entertaining addition to any WWII film collection and if it gives you an appetite for a more indepth recounting of the true story Ewan Montagu's 1953 book is still available in both the hardback and paperback editions.".

He is perfect as Montague. Stephen Boyd is excellent as an Irishman working undercover for the Nazis who appears in London to verify the existence of the dead soldier who is given a fake identity. Gloria Grahame plays a woman who unexpectedly falls in love and winds up as part of the plot. She turns in a heartbreaking performance.

Ewen Montague an officer in the British military intelligence in World War II was aware that unless something was done to reduce the defenses that the German and their Italian allies set up in Sicily the Allied assault on the island which we would observe close up in the movie PATTON would be a bloody fiasco that might set back the Allied war effort in Europe. The key to it would be to convince the Germans that if an attack was being planned it was being planned for another part of the European continent. Montague was sharp enough to formulate a daring scheme  and this film shows that formulation the care and planning needed to pull it off and how it succeeded in fooling the Nazis.Montague's scheme is to deposit the corpse of an R.A.F. officer off the coast of Spain still attached to a briefcase full of invasion plan documents  except the plans are not for the area of Italy or Sicily but for France. He reasons that the Fascist Franco regime in Spain will be very willing to allow the Nazis to read the secret papers or copies of them. The trick is to find a corpse that will look like it died violently in battle and can fool the enemy and that enough details regarding the dead officer can be verified by Nazi agents in Britain to make the Germans believe the corpse is genuine and not a plant.So we watch Clifton Webb as Montague in a rare straight dramatic part  well acted by the way consult with specialists including Andre Morell as the famous British Home Office pathologist Sir Bernard Spilsbury. A good corpse is selected and the right amount of proper personal items put into his military tunic and overcoat including even a restaurant bill for the previous night before his death. When all is ready the corpse is dumped off the coast of Spain by submarine. And then Montague and British Intelligence sit back and watch what happens crossing their fingers that the scheme works.Stephen Boyd three years from his performance as Messala in BEN HUR plays an Irishman who is spying for the Nazis and who eventually discovers that the corpse is the genuine article. The result is that the Nazis weakened their defenses in Sicily sufficiently to allow the Allies to show up and despite the PattonMontgomery rivalry retake the island in the first major defeat the Germans had of European conquered territory. A fascinating story well told  and as I said true despite being so improbable.Sir Bernard's career as the leading British Criminal trial pathologist from the Crippen Case in 1910 to the De Antiquis Case in 1947 was never given a movie treatment. Occasionally he is mentioned as in UPSTAIRS DOWNSTAIRS in one episode when Edward Christopher Beeney is reading a newspaper in 1925 about the Crowsborough Murder  the trial of Norman Thorne  and feels that Sir Bernard will see it through! Actually that was one of Spilsbury's most controversial cases. He does deserve a Masterpiece Theater series about his life which ended in 1947 with his tragic suicide.".

In this movie it is decided that British forces would use a corpse with false documents attracting Nazis attention to Greece while the Allied Forces would land in Italy. Easy but fascinating plot!

Wars are not only made of guns and soldiers but also of officers who make plans and articulate attacks while they're in secret rooms using every kind of ways to confuse the enemy. In this movie it is decided that British forces would use a corpse with false documents attracting Nazis attention to Greece while the Allied Forces would land in Italy. Easy but fascinating plot! Watch it!My rate 810";

	schema:reviewBody "It was 46 years ago that I have seen this movie and I still can close my eyes and see many of its pictures. The scene where the body of a dead Londoner who died of phenomena so his corps was suit to be presented as a drowned pilot submerging from a submarine on a beach in Spain. The scene of the German spy hand on the Morsecode key who is as straggling in making the right decision. The scene in which the car suddenly stopped in the middle of London's traffic for a brain storming session where Clifton Webb who is playing Commander Ewen Montague is in his best. From the many movies about events at WWII it is one that stacked long in mind as it dealt in the quality of the gray matter of the counterintelligence and not about the brutality of the war. It is a masterpiece when the director Ronald Neame was able to inflict the emotionally pain of war in that one scene where coincidently the German spy get a real verification about the staged event. Recommended even 46 years later.".

The wealth of detail is interesting in itself and it is also used well in enhancing the realism of the story.Clifton Webb stars as the British officer who comes up with the scheme of using The Man Who Never Was to trick the Germans into weakening their defenses in Sicily before the planned Allied invasion there. Webb gets to show flashes of his wellknown screen sarcasm but in general he gives a good lowkey allbusiness performance.The story divides fairly equally into two parts first showing the careful development and implementation of the plan and then following a Nazi investigator played with believable coldness by Stephen Boyd as he tries to determine the truth about 'Major Martin'.The first part is particularly filled with interesting details and the script very nicely fits them all in without seeming slow or boring. The second part gradually builds up tension and combines it with the seemingly unrelated tensions in the life of Gloria Grahame's character bringing things together in a good sequence that sets up the finale while also bringing out some worthwhile thoughts that go beyond the story itself. It all works quite well both as a historical dramatization and as a story of deception and intrigue.".

	schema:reviewBody "I really enjoyed and appreciated this excellent film that is based on a true British disinformation plan during W W II code named Operation Mincemeat. The plan by British Intelligence was to deceive the German high command into thinking the Allied invasion of Sicily would take place elsewhere. The successful hoax was achieved by attaching  Top Secret  documents on a corpse deliberately left to wash up on a beach in Spain. This intriguing story is well played out in fine detail in  The Man Who Never Was  with the screenplay staying close to the truth along with the addition of some well placed fiction for example the Irish spy in the film is a complete fabrication. Stephen Boyd plays the part of Patrick O'Reilly the fictitious spy while the real Ewen Montagu declared that he was happy with the fictitious incidents which although they didn't happen might have happened. Clifton Webb was an outstanding choice for the role of British Navy Lieutenant Commander Ewen Montagu who is fully involved in the cunning scheme to fool the Nazis. Webb's performance brings this most absorbing historical story to life. It is also interesting to note that the real Ewen Montagu has a cameo role in the film of an airvice marshal who has doubts about the feasibility of the proposed plan. It was described as a surreal moment when the real Montagu addresses his fictional persona played by Webb. Gloria Graham gives a fine strong emotional performance in her role as Lucy Sherwood a woman who unexpectedly becomes part of the plot. All the supporting actors give very adequate performances in this well done worth watching wartime drama a film that has passed the test of time.".

It's a very very good film but depends on its ordinary flair to survive which means its flair remains a bit ordinary. Some great acting fast editing and a final third with a surprise twist that keeps you really watching. And it's based on fact which adds yet another tilt.I watched it at first because I wanted to see Gloria Grahame who can be simply astonishing in her slightly off beat roles. And she comes through to a degree hereshe doesn't have a lot of screen time and her role is partly to be saucy as usual but partly to be upset and crying which she does really well. I love the drama built into World War II in any form though combat films are less interesting than civilian ones to me and this was mostly on the home front London after the Blitz but while some overhead bombing was still apparently going on it is heard in one scene.As a look at secret service work or what might now be called a Special Ops mission it's really quite believable. I suspect being only a decade after the event happened there was an attempt to make it honest but beyond that it feels honest. The people are determined and flawed and yet very smart and a little lucky. What seems like a turning point in the invasion of Europe by the Allies really seems to hinge on the intuition of one or two people and the ad lib genius of one American girl on the spot which I assume is fiction but who knows?.If you want to relax but never be bored this is a terrific movie. Though technically an American production it's thoroughly British from the source book to the cast to the setting of course in London. The British director was originally a cinematographer which might account for the solid if unsensational visual sense of it all. It's not a breakthrough moving or memorable film surely but as high quality entertainment with a toe in important history it excels.".

The aim was to let some papers which purported to be letters between the generals of the Allied high command fall into the hands of the Germans to make them think that the Allied assault would be in Greece rather than Sicily.The film is pretty true to Ewen Montagu's book and one must presume that the story is therefore reasonably true to the facts. Montagu was the man who dreamed up and largely executed the plan and he's played pretty convincingly by Clifton Webb. Montagu himself appears in a walkon roleThe film is a bit leaden there's a certain reverence about rendering a great war success and everyone behaves as good chaps should in the service of their country great wartime spirit do their duty and so on.It would have been all a bit too ponderous if it weren't for the minor characters Michael Hordern is particularly good as the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police but the other supporting actors all add colour and character.The story is one of preparation and fine attention to detail  it's reminiscent in that sense of 'The Day of the Jackal' not a lot actually happens but we see how painstakingly the plan was executed.Worth watching.".

The aim was to let some papers which purported to be letters between the generals of the Allied high command fall into the hands of the Germans to make them think that the Allied assault would be in Greece rather than Sicily.The film is pretty true to Ewen Montagu's book and one must presume that the story is therefore reasonably true to the facts. Montagu was the man who dreamed up and largely executed the plan and he's played pretty convincingly by Clifton Webb. Montagu himself appears in a walkon roleThe film is a bit leaden there's a certain reverence about rendering a great war success and everyone behaves as good chaps should in the service of their country great wartime spirit do their duty and so on.It would have been all a bit too ponderous if it weren't for the minor characters Michael Hordern is particularly good as the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police but the other supporting actors all add colour and character.The story is one of preparation and fine attention to detail  it's reminiscent in that sense of 'The Day of the Jackal' not a lot actually happens but we see how painstakingly the plan was executed.Worth watching.";

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is based on the booka true account of a British plan to fool the Germans before the invasion of Sicily in 1943. A couple British officers have come up with an interesting ideafool the Germans into anticipating an invasion of Greece instead in order to divert the German defenses on the wrong anticipated target. In order to do so they take a man who recently died from pneumonia and dress him up in an officer's uniform complete with phony orders for the invasion of Greece. Then the body is pushed out of a sub off the coast of Spain in the hope that the proGerman Spanish government passes this false information to the Nazis.However while the Germans do assume that the body and secrets on him are genuine they need to be sure so they send an Irish agent into Britain to trace the comings and goings of the dead manto see if he is real and recognized by those who he should have some in contact with before his death. And if the spy cannot confirm that the dead man is genuine then the British ruse will be a failure.The film is very taut and wellwritten throughout. However unlike the typical war film there is no fighting or killing in this filmit's more a spy film than anything else. The acting is very good and despite Clifton Webb being an American his lovely diction and accent appear decent enough for his role an an Englishman. It's funny but when I first heard Stephen Boyd in the film I thought to myself wow...he's really bad at faking Irish accents. Then when I checked IMDb I noticed that he really was Irish. So much for my impressions of how well actors approximate accents!! A very very good war filmone not to be missed.".

Generally the acting is fairly wooden with only Boyd's performance showing signs of realism. Flemyng also shows a comedic flare in his few closeups. With this film it is the true story that holds our interests and also that most haunting poem delivered at the opening titles. Last night I dreamed a deadly dream... etc.. I will recall all of those evocative words until I die. Overall a fine film with some flaws and considerable ageing in style. Nevertheless true to the period and riveting to the end. Even the romantic interest between Gloria Grahame and William Russell doesn't distract. They both did their best. I like this film very much indeed.".

Along the way they find a group of damsels in distresses Krista Nell  Veronica Lujan  Claudia Gravy . Then  David disguised as a Canadian Mounted Police officer but things go awry . This is effortless and below average story in Paella Western subgenre style  thus the picture includes the Canadian theme similarly to Unconquered by Cecil B De Mille and The Canadians by Burt Kennedy . As the movie follows more the American models than Spaghetti Western wake . Other Spanish films about Canadian Mounted Police are Mestizo by Julio Buchs and Revolt in Canada by Amando De Ossorio and Cavalry Charge by Ramn Torrado  concerning similar events  battles between Red Skins and Red Long Coats. As it results to be a familiar film  with no much violence  though there are many deaths . The picture contains an exciting and spectacular final battle  though badly paced  including hundreds of extras  when the regiment is besieged by Indians . However  nobody seems to be wearing any clothes more than a week old and modern day police special pistols are used alongside of propish looking firearms with little or no concern about authenticity . Characters use knives that are brand new reflectively shiny and don't appear to be sharpened . Regularly played by George Hilton who overacts as a brave scout . Hilton starred a lot of SpaghettiChorizo Westerns as I Due Figli Di Ringo Un poker Di Pistole The gold professionals Sartana  Professionals for a Massacre and many others  though also performed a great number of Giallos as All the Colors of dark  perverse Mrs Ward and Scorpion tale .

That film was set in the desert this one is supposed to be Canada but sure looks like desert to me. There are some funny bits and Palacios is very good as a FrenchCanadian trapper who is Kotosch's sidekick. The women look very sixties and a few of the mounties sure look Italian or Spanish.

	schema:reviewBody "This is the eight feature film by Francois Truffaut that I have seen. He made 25 feature films over a 24 year period from 1959 to 1983.What I find most interesting about Truffaut's development is how conventional he became. With Jules and Jim 1960 he broke every rule of cinema convention. Here 17 years later he does a movie that is a model of Hollywood conventionally. It is so conventional that Hollywood soon copies it into an American version starring Burt Reynolds a film which also has its merits. In conventional cinema the audience is meant to identify with a character subjectively. The ability to cut shots so the viewer becomes part of the action seeing what a character sees and feeling what a character feels is the essence of conventional Hollywood cinema. Here we are meant to identify solely with the skirtchasing hero. Yet the hero seems to be only a standin for Truffaut himself or at least a vision of Truffaut that he would like the audience to have of him. Because Trauffaut is a master of cinema as his hero Hitchcock was a master of cinema we the audience do identify with the hero.It is only at the moments when we are looking at the course rough facial features of Charles Denner when we see him as being 6 years older than Truffaut and not nearly as handsome that we find it hard to accept him as a man with the power to sweep women off their feet. If Truffaut is the lover Bertrand Morane Danner is not. However it is only at moments when we cast ourselves into the roles of the quite beautiful women in the film that this becomes a problem. It is curious that JeanPierre Laud did not play the lead in this film as he personified Truffaut in so many other films.In any case even if Danner is not so handsome we feel the pleasure of the successful seducer. It is a pleasure that even death cannot wipe out. However because of the conventionality of the film we do not feel the joy of the new wave.One day someone will make a movie about two brothers one named Francois and the other Jean Luc. The first brother created conventional works of art that were masterpieces of subjective narrative the other brother took a Brechtian delight in exploding those conventions and making sure that we never identified with a character but only studied them. I am think amazingly although their paths diverged considerably they may have arrived at the same peak of cinematic art.".

	schema:reviewBody "From it's title to it's ending The Man Who loved women is a great movie. Francois Truffaut displays all his mastery of the cinematographic language. The editing performances and dialogues all contribute to the film's subtle but engaging rhythm.

	schema:headline " Truffaut's masterful homage to true love its joys and its pains";
	schema:reviewBody "Truffaut made so many superb films and some minor and more forgettable too but this one succeeds at so many levels that I felt compelled to give it a perfect score. Which I did and here's why. Possible spoilers may below! First Charles Denner although not your average Casanova as far as looks are considered displays such a calm intensity such an obvious sincerity and such a determination in finding that something he is so desperately missing and which we ultimately get to understand when he meets Vra Leslie Caron true love. We do not fall in love  that is total love love with total and innocent abandon  more than once or twice during our lifetime. It's too painful to survive to a rupture from the loved one which is why it's such a unique experience and why we don't want to ever go to another cycle of loverupture of that magnitude. Too risky for one's very survival. And yet because it's really a single oneofakind experience that takes the lovers to heaven because its pleasures are so plentiful and so ecstatic we think we can find a substitute in another person. As Truffaut's narration goes in fact since we already found exactly what fulfilled completely our own heart that poorly understood and complex neural center that we still thus call when we met the object of our true love. There's nothing rational of course in such matters and nobody else can possibly reunite that purely idiosyncratic combination of body and mind that we met somewhat randomly and that happened to be there when we were ready for ... falling in love. Truffaut had an exquisite understanding of matters of the heart as abundantly demonstrated by his filmography from the Antoine Doinel pentalogy to L'histoire d'Adle H without forgetting Jules et Jim and Les deux Anglaises et le Continent. But Charles Denner's character is obviously a much closer alter ego than JeanPierre Laud's alias Doinel the latter being rather a charming caricature of Truffaut's own shortcomings. It is now common knowledge that L'homme qui aimait les femmes is the most autobiographical film from Truffaut. It was probably quite an intense but transcendental experience for him to write a story so close to his own life story and such an intimate portrayal may explain why this movie resonates so strongly and so poignantly for the viewer. Well it did for me at least. Not that I recognized myself in this tombeur or cavaleur  those are the words that he sometimes uses to describe himself  who is neither a Casanova nor a Don Juan. But mostly because just like Bertrand MoraneDennerTruffaut I realize that I tried very hard to find another xxxxx after my affair with her ended but could never really succeed as well as with xxxxx although I did have many excellent encounters and affairs that enriched my life. Not that the women who followed did not have their unique qualities and attributes it's just that.... the quest for a replacement for true love is so well depicted in that masterpiece that words will always to convey what is ultimately extremely personal and unique.The movie would already be successful and superb if it was merely a richly illustrated somewhat archetypal portrait of a man who has an urge to meet women he meets aimlessly for reasons he cannot specifically formulate but that can be as trivial as the particular effect that the fringe of a dress will have on the silhouette of a woman's legs. But it turns out to be more much more than simply that. As we gradually find out Bertrand decides to write about his life experience with women an exercise that he thinks more or less consciously as we realize ultimately might help him to understand his urge of his and perhaps exorcize himself At some point he says as an off voice something like  Is it pathological? Am I a poor fellow with a base obsession who just wants to pin down as many women as he can like so many bugs he captures with his intricate stratagems?. An encounter that did not turn out well is the trigger and makes him realize that in fact he does not understand why he acts in such a way with so many women. As the movie unfolds the book progresses but Bertrand meets a few disappointments and even consider abandoning the book when he finally finds an editor who is willing to publish the book. The favorable decision results from the efforts of a woman on the reading committee luminous Brigitte Fossey for this publishing house who enthusiastically advocates his manuscript. When the movie concludes Truffaut leaves us on this note There's a way that all our pleasures and sufferings in the name of love or else will not have been in vain And we call this..... a book. Although Truffaut did not write fiction in the form of novels his written oeuvre consists in a few successful essays and a very substantial correspondence he was an avid reader and a great admirer of literature. How often have we seen films praising what has been ultimately the major source of inspiration of the greatest movies in history i.e. the written book? L'Homme qui aimait les femmes is an homage to women to the unique nature of true love and its quest and to writing as a meaningful vehicle for transcending what would absurdly die with ourselves as another tool in human quest for eternity of the individual. A masterpiece and to me the most completely satisfactory movie in Truffaut's filmography.".

	schema:reviewBody "The first half of The Man Who Loved Women is absolutely wonderful it is picture perfect. The second half especially a large chunk about Bertrand's Charles Denner love affair with a somewhat unstable married women drags a little bit. This dose not mean that it is a boring film on the contrary it is a joy to sit through. Bertrand loves women as the title hints at he loves women so much he cant stop himself from going too great lengths to talk too a beautiful women. He will do anything necessary he dose not care about the way he is perceived or if he will be rejected he goes completely on instinct without thinking about any outcome or what might happen he just must talk to any women that peaks his interest. Bertrand is not Don Juan he just has a natural and somewhat unstoppable way of falling in love with every woman he sees or in the case of his wake up telephone service hear. Women are intrigued or attracted to his nonthreatening natural nature. In fact at one point one women says that she could never refuse him of anything because of the way he asks for it. Truffaut creates a complete dream world were every women it beautiful every women has a perfect figure every women walk and moves like a ballet dancer. Truffaut obviously loves women he loves everything about them everything! He creates this world that all men would love to be a part of. Truffaut and his writing partners do a wonderful job of creating a character that we can love while at the same time be fascinated by his whimsical attitude to life. He has no friends he dose not associate with any men outside of a work environment. He has one interest one hobby one passion that being women. Charles Denner plays this role perfectly he has the sort of absent minded professor quality Bertrand has one thing on his mind only and its written all over his face. Though there are uneven moments and some situations feel contrived this is a beautiful funny touching and at times though provoking film. Enthusiastically Recommended !!".

Has its flaws but the overall result is nice and successful.Every man who loves women should watch this and enjoy it. I love women myself. You don't have to be like the lead character Bertrand Morane to love women. No matter the way you love women this is a movie for all the men who worship women both for men who are lucky with women and for men who are unsuccessful with women.The great actor Charles Denner portrays a very interesting character Bertrand Morane the one whom the movie's title is all about. He appears to be between 4550 years old works in a laboratory testing the aerodynamics of aircraft owns an Alfa Romeo Giulia saloon and... loves women. He never resists a lovely pair of legs and yet he seems more interested in watching attractive women than actually having something serious with them. He even goes to extraordinary lengths to locate and lure women he'd seen even if for nothing...His peculiar kind of attraction for women turns out to be fatal for him at the end. He goes after two women with nice legs at the wrong place at the wrong time and gets hit by a car. Once in the hospital he accidentally severs his drip falls out of his bed and dies  and all because he feels attracted by the nurses's legs.His burial is the most original ever you see nothing but women and they all show their attractive legs. After all it's a special funeral. The funeral of a special man.The final credits are also among the most original and best ever thanks to all those shots of lovely legs that drive us women lovers crazy.Considering the fact that this is a movie about a man who loves women not all the women are attractive but there are a few who are. Brigitte Fossey is undoubtedly one of the most attractive women in this movie. She was a really adorable child and grew up to be quite an attractive young woman.Title in Portugal 'O homem que gostava das mulheres'.".

	schema:reviewBody "Another good film by Truffaut as with DW Griffith Leni Riefenstahl in the sense of a good watch but why does it seem so gloomy and weighted downat times even like a horror film. Is it because Bertrand Morane is a solitary? Or because he draws us into a world through his low key partly sympathetic rendering that is somehow upsetting andor even detestable? Is it because the view here is hothouse psychological? A kind of Freudian mind drama in which a motherson dyad subsumes everything outside itself to its own ends? see Alfie for a social view of a similar womanizer Is it because of the extent to which this fantasy is carried outthat it finally seems deranged and sick as if the product of a puerile mind in an adult? Or is it all the concealment techniques used to paint Bertrand as so exceptional a male that he might even find acceptance on an allfemale island?I think all of the above count but for my part the real source of gloom is the absence of women in The Man Who Loved Women. No matter the angle the multiplicity of women one arguable exception are singularly available to Bertrand Morane. They are inspected their entry into his world and our screens pursued consumed and disposed ofall to their immense delight. This is their invisibility Oh yeah they have their fleeting stories but these are invariably subsumed by Bertrand's script which is all about pleasure appetite and some trumped up memory of a delinquent promiscuous mother. But the big lie in all this and what Bertrand is most convinced of is that women want and need sexand specifically from him. This availability is so patently confirmed as to be pornographic. Each step of his lovers' butterflylike life span with him is not only accepted but savored and yearned for. It's as if his sexualizing puppylove has incapacitated them cutting them off from both their own minds and their own worlds. No way they're drawn to him for social reasons this is not Alfiebut an irressistable urge which speaks for the social power cleverly hidden by Truffaut behind his very personal power trip. And accounts for Bertrand's capacity to transform live often tall worldaware women into fun sex toys.The real convincer in this schema of availability though is Genevieve the editor publisher. You expect her to be the point woman for exposure given her position and her inside view of Bertrand's story but noshe is the ultimate patsy. She not only loves his refreshingly honest take on his use of womenwhich she convinces herself is so modern and contains a tendency toward equality but converts five resistant male copublishers to her view. Which makes it just a matter of timeshe's lucky to be leggy before she expresses wimpish longings for the said Bertrand Morane and jumps into bed with him. And her love like that of all his others will soon become eternal and confer a kind of sainthood on the late Bertrand. If this seems astonishing than her role in the burial scene confirms it to be nakedly true. Surrounded by dozens of Saint Bertrand's lovers she supplies the voice over as each woman approaches to toss dirt on his coffin. She touts each as an example of Bertrand's diverse taste for women... like shy myopic gentle passionate orphanish funny and so forth ad nauseam as if even greater holiness might be bestowed on a male who has slept with Asians Blacks Latinas Russians and Native Islanders. Anyway a fitting end indeed to a man who classified all women as either kittens or fillies.".

And accounts for Bertrand's capacity to transform live often tall worldaware women into fun sex toys.The real convincer in this schema of availability though is Genevieve the editor publisher. You expect her to be the point woman for exposure given her position and her inside view of Bertrand's story but noshe is the ultimate patsy. She not only loves his refreshingly honest take on his use of womenwhich she convinces herself is so modern and contains a tendency toward equality but converts five resistant male copublishers to her view. Which makes it just a matter of timeshe's lucky to be leggy before she expresses wimpish longings for the said Bertrand Morane and jumps into bed with him. And her love like that of all his others will soon become eternal and confer a kind of sainthood on the late Bertrand. If this seems astonishing than her role in the burial scene confirms it to be nakedly true. Surrounded by dozens of Saint Bertrand's lovers she supplies the voice over as each woman approaches to toss dirt on his coffin. She touts each as an example of Bertrand's diverse taste for women... like shy myopic gentle passionate orphanish funny and so forth ad nauseam as if even greater holiness might be bestowed on a male who has slept with Asians Blacks Latinas Russians and Native Islanders. Anyway a fitting end indeed to a man who classified all women as either kittens or fillies.";

	schema:reviewBody "Each film by Franois Truffaut is like an antithesis for its predecessor Shoot the Piano Player for The 400 Blows Jules et Jim for Shoot the Piano Player etc. but The Man Who Loved Women 1977 isn't really the opposite of Small Change 1976 but more like The Story of Adele H. 1975 turned upside down. First of all the protagonist of The Story of Adele H. is a woman and the protagonist of The Man Who Loved Women is a man. However despite the tragical intensity of The Story of Adele H. and the light comedy of The Man Who Loved Women both films deal with sexual obsessions. In the former film the woman is madly in love with a man from whom she can't get response. In turn the latter is all about a man who doesn't believe in true love and therefore goes from one brief relationship to another.The Man Who Loved Women 1977 might just be Truffaut's funniest comedy but what is more it also presents an insightful picture of an obsessive womanizer Bertrand brilliantly played by Charles Denner. Just like The Story of Adele H. it is also a story about an independent character who is a victim of his own obsession. In addition in the background of both stories there is an abandonment made by a mother or a lover both protagonists try to imitate their parents in one way or another and are inevitably going to face destruction both stories are also recorded to personal memoirs and both of them have separate prologue and epilogue sequences.Already in the very beginning of The Man Who Loved Women we are told that the protagonist has died and at the cemetery we enter a long flashback which equals most of the film. However before we enter this flashback we see women walking to the cemetery but also Truffaut himself passing by which is a clear statement that the film knows that it is fiction. As if he was sealing the deal. It is consciously exaggerated romanticism so to speak. This idea is also highlighted by the fact that the protagonist starts to change his memories when he decides to write an autobiographical novel. His whole life is fiction.Usually Truffaut portraits fatal women who lead their lovers to death and destruction Jules and Jim The Bride Wore Black but in this case the man is the dangerous character who lures women. However in reality he is much more destructive for himself than for the women he loves. His obsession seems to be some sort of a defense mechanism against the vulnerability which hunts many of Truffaut's characters who are often abandoned by a cold mother The 400 Blows.As said Bertrand is a victim of his own obsession and just like the dogmatism of Catherine from Jules et Jim so is the obsession of Bertrand an absolute prelude for death. He is constantly tied to his own madness. He loves to watch women and even points out that women's legs are like compass points circling the globe. Although this rather plain concept gets an intriguing twist because Bertrand actually sees the seductive legs of women everywhere  even where there aren't any like in the outrageous scene at the airport  and they also seal his destiny.Besides youth and innocence love was a repeating theme throughout Truffaut's career and that is why he is often called the romantic of the French New Wave. In his world love was a dominant force which restricted the lives of people. But it also appears to us as kind and patient. The Man Who Loved Women was Truffaut's tribute not only to women but to love. In the director's personal love life he had several lovers but no life partners. Although Truffaut wasn't a womanizer by any means he said that he never stopped loving his former lovers. As if relationships were transient but love was eternal.".

	schema:headline " The Mah who loved Women";
	schema:reviewBody "The Man Who Loved Women by Francois Truffaut is the critically acclaimed film released in Europe in 1977 that is a comedyadult drama that teaches quite an interesting lesson about men and women. Specifically the obsession of sex and carnal pleasure without the input of love respect and commitment.Bertrand Morane Charles Denner is a man who loves every woman he meets literally. You can basically call him a leech and sex addict because he has never loved any women he has slept with. However in some cases the man tries to develop a relationship with these woman and it's the women and not him that are problem. One woman comes to mind. Delphineis a paranoid sex slut who likes to have sex in dangerous places for the thrills of it. She reminds of the type of woman I briefly have met and or even the schizophrenic kitty bondage like women who have rated my reviews You know who you are. Later on we learn that she does it to spite her husband. Morane at first thinks Delphine likes him but being a grown man and being smart enough to realize when he is being played for the fool he soon realizes she is just using him. She is just a piece of trash that he had the pleasure and displeasure to be with. In a way this incident describes the problems for Morane sometimes he meets really nice women who are afraid of commitment but like the sex does feeding Morane's appetite for more sex without love and other times he meets these nasty gutter trash unfeeling abusive and self paranoid women wholl screw him in the end. Quite a sad story and it gets sadder and at times funnier throughout. The flight attendant encounter he has is a pretty memorable fling one those flings where Morane and his mate have fun and both come away happy with their short term encounter.However the party is over when Morane through his doctor Doctor Bicard Jean Daste tells him he has Gonorhea. In a funny scene the Doctor tells him to tell his sexual partner that she has it but Morane cannot do that because he has been with a dozen women over the last few years and taking names was something Morane didn't do. LOL It's this sort of negligence and irresponsiblity that show the side of Morane that every womanizer is. A man in pursuit in his own selfish interest that when the time comes out to help another the man whether a womanizer or a capitalistic doesn't care. In this case Morane's Gonorrhea infection is both ironic and fitting.Morane through this predicament then tells the Dr. about the book that he is writing and the Dr. encourages him to write since it would help him perhaps deal with his women issues and perhaps find the sexual partner with whom he infected gonorreah with.Despite the somewhat offensive premise The Man Who Loved Women or better known by it's original title Homme qui aimait les femmes L' is a very entertaining French adult comedydrama almost reminiscent of newer comedies like Amelie.The film by Francois Truffaut is regarded as one of his best from a very respectable director. He has done quite a good job here including themes that teaches the audiences many lessons. Ask for the DVD released by MGM it was a dissappointment no commentary no trailer no nothing basically the film itself. However the fact that the movie is available in U.S. is good news since many of these rare films from the 1970's are practically unavaible in the video store.".

After the adventure of french new wave of the 60's Truffaut matured and to me he started producing his more focused work. He basically produced some films which were essays on cinema as well as autobiographical depictions of his thoughts.So we have a film about storytelling. A womanizer who writes the story of his life. Every woman in his life is herself a story. So the pleasure of being involved with a woman maps the will Truffaut has to tell a story. The fact that Morane writes all the stories and makes one single big form a book with them enhances this.The woman editor has an important role. She is the key character that Truffaut places above Morane and she annotates and comments on the whole structure. Her remarks on Morane's book and personality may as well be taken as commentaries on the very film and of its director. She is selfreference she is Truffaut commenting on himself thus adding reflexivity to the film. That's why she observes that Morane the writer doesn't reject the details others wouldn't notice and she literally says that he is basically a storyteller. Also she is the one who remarks the fact that Morane's funeral is the perfect ending to the story. I saw all this as reflexive annotations on the very structure of the film and more generally on the nature of Truffaut's cinema. He was through all his life a storyteller and above any pleasure he took in making a film there was the pleasure of narrating. Also he took a special interest in filming details something i think he took from Hitchcock. The hand dialing phone numbers or turning the pages in the address book that sort of thing.Morane's funeral which opens and closes the film gathers all the women around him. It is like the editor the second narrator told a praising of Morane's life the recognizing of his qualities the celebration of his life cinema.This and La nuit amricaine are so far the best built films by Truffaut that i saw. Many times i think that Truffaut and Godard! has spent to much time around things which were not that important like school kids discussing football teams. But in certain points he made important contributions to the evolving of cinematic narrative. This is one of them.My opinion 45 httpwww.7eyes.wordpress.com".

Being on the losing end of these transactions didn't feel good and it's hard to muster sympathy for the protagonist who perishes much as the road kill one sees every spring when mating season causes hormones to trump common sense.";

Is that possible? Apparently yes. Once in a blue moon of course. Apparently there was a blue moon in 1977. It's about a guy who has affairs with countless women is literally obsessed by them eventually deciding to write a book about his sexual exploits. At first glance it's hard to accept the little hooknosed Morane as being some sort of Casanova. However you get used to that quickly partly because a lot of the women he gets aren't that greatlooking either. Although I'm sure this was neither Truffaut's point nor intention. The movie is quite pleasant to watch the dialog and the narration are interesting. The only drawback and it's not a major one is that occasional situations and supporting actors aren't too convincing but this is to be expected from a European movie UK films not included.".

I venture to say that the dozens of girls he is shown seducing are pure movie fantasy. Brigitte Fossey is wasted in too small a part and her character of a sharp literary agent quickly seduced by her client no really? is another fictional trope. In truth all the women in the plot are wasted. And on the whole for all the chasing that propels this plot the story goes nowhere turns in a circle because its viewing angle is 100 masculine all along. The women in the plot have no consistency they don't have a chance to or it was not in the filmmaker's intention or talent to show texture to their characters. These women are all legs and desires no thoughts of their own. As a 2018 viewer I find neither lightness nor poetry let alone instruction on human nature in that point of view I see a chosen perspective that is both offensive and dated. At some point we are even presented with the trope of the crazy nympho qualified without irony as the most interesting of all his conquestsaccording to our Casanova. Paging the 70s baby!

Alongside physical satisfaction he also seeks intimacy passion and romance but at the same time that isn't enough and he finds himself craving for something more. Truffaut hints child abuse through Bertrand's dysfunctional relationship with his mother who was a prostitute. Bertrand decides to write down his various encounters in a book and that seems to provide some answers as he searches for perspective. The movie opens with a funeral sequence attended by numerous women and we learn very soon who's funeral it is.It's a charming film. The pace slackens a little in the middle but the amusing lines keep the viewer entertained throughout. The subtle dark humour works superbly. Denner acts quite well even though I felt that he was physically miscast. The rest of the cast that mostly includes beautiful women are just as good and certainly pleasing to look at.Truffaut's storytelling is compelling. He gives 'L'Homme Qui Aimait Les Femmes' a poetic touch. There is a certain whimsical quality to it that combines successfully with the subtle elements. The first rate cinematography and score contribute to the viewing pleasure. This is quite a good example of charming French cinema minus the typically French clichs.".

You are perplexed through missing something but this is even more annoying when you don't quite know what that something is.This is precisely the criticism leveled at The Man Who Fell To Earth which carries the hallmark of a controversial directorial style. Nicolas Roeg directs this science fictiondramalove story with one eye on the main event and another on the various sub plots that weave their way in and out of the principal tale. By creating passages of snipped time that do not knit together as logical flashbacks there is a somewhat disjointed narrative which is seen as a personal indulgence. Many were puzzled enough to claim that the whole project was flawed and that chronologically it simply didnt work. That is a harsh judgment the film is highly stylized but this does not detract from it's undoubted quality. You have to 'want' to understand it and invest a bit of patience. See it twice I had to and it will sink in or read the IMDB reviews to get a taste before you digest it wholeheartedly.Thomas Jerome Newton David Bowie lands as surely all self respecting aliens would choose to do in New Mexico. How come he is wearing 'normal' clothes? Where did he get the precious metal rings that he wastes no time in trading so eagerly? Why is he carrying an Englishman's passport? These are the kind of questions that confront you at the outset causing many to bark in dismay. To get the maximum benefit from the film you simply have to take these unexplained occurrences  and also the rapid and disjointed passing of time  on board because the whole is more significant and understandable than its component parts.Newton arrives on Earth to suck on the capitalist system recruiting a top patent's lawyer Buck Henry  superb as Oliver Farnsworth along the way to help quickly mould his business idea World Enterprises into an immense scientific and commercial colossus. He proceeds to convert the Earthman's physical cash into an enormous scientific solution in the hope that it will reverse the desperate decline of his own remote world  and save his family  light years away. A disillusioned college professor Rip Torn magnificent as Nathan Brice stale with the stench of academia and tired of bedding his female students joins Newton as a chief scientist. He is actually the closest to understanding the man but he ultimately fails him. The mocked time lapses in this film are in my view one of it's strengths. It enables us to see Mary Lou Candy Clark pass from young humble hotel maid to alcoholic old wretch via livein lover and 'Tommy' worshipper. Clark  Bowie share a key scene where Newton decides to reveal his true self Newton discards his humaneye contact lenses strips away the false body hair and fingernails. Mary Lou goes hysterical with fear as the real Newton appears in all his extraterrestrial glory and this is made all the more grotesque when he starts to exude a complete bodily slime during the ensuing love ritual.A special mention should be made of Anthony Richmond's photography particularly in the spectacular terrain of New Mexico. Indeed the whole film is a technical masterpiece and the acting is also of the highest level.Of course the Man Who Fell To Earth is himself beaten at the outset. The Intelligence Services jealous as opposed to curious of his corporate success want this weirdo brought to order. They achieve this by hounding Farnsworth and infiltrating the company finally spoiling everything.Imaginative vibrant different ambitious and memorable class comes in original packaging. So open it up....and immerse yourself in an adventure".

I have not seen it since 1980 so if my memory fails me please excuse.

The other reviewers noted the somewhat disturbing sex scene towards the end of the movie but for me at least that was not needed. I didn't need slime or removed eyeballs although that is a great scene to tell me the man is a freak who is human enough to lament his own inability to connect with these creatures from Earth. For the most part the movie was understated unfolding in its own detached time.".

Perhaps what makes The Man Who Fell To Earth brilliant is the thing that causes people to despise it it has no plot. That's right. It's alot like a David Lynch movie there are bizzare characters bizzare dialogue and bizzare situations but barely any trace of a followable plot. The film manages to carry a thin story with almost no plot whatsoever and be consistently interesting and entertaining throughout. On top of that it's all stunningly photographed. There is quite a bit of sex in this movie but the sex is done so stylistically we hardly notice how pornographic it is. For instance in one scene near the end of the film Bowie wields a pistol loaded with blanks like a phallus. The scene than erupts into a bizzare sex scene filled with flashing strobe lights full frontal shots of Bowie and the gun firing randomly off. The Man Who Fell To Earth is essential viewingunless of course movies that are hard to follow or a naked David Bowie aren't your thing.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have just watched The Man Who Fell to Earth from beginning to end after seeing several scenes here and there from years of flipping past the scifi channel or whatever other channel this film might've been shown on. I must say that I think it is one of the most interesting films I've ever seen. Now before you start thinking this is going to be a review of blind worship stop for a moment and remember that just because something is interesting doesn't mean it's likeable. Art is not meant to be appealing. It's meant to cause a reaction it's meant to make you think it's meant to make you uncomfortable. Art forces feelings upon you that you might rather not experience so whether you like it or not this film is a work of art. But some art...in fact a lot of art...is trash. Is this movie trash? Some say yes some say not. Some think it's brilliant others think it a waste of time. Some think the narrative's dependence on visual stimulus as opposed to linear storytelling is a touch of cinematic beauty while others dismiss it as experimental tripe.Somebody wrote a scathing review saying that if you like junk like Lost Highway you might enjoy this movie. Well no offense meant but I'd like to say that this person has made clear that he can't see past what's appealing. Why watch something that's unappealing you might ask? Because that's what art's supposed to do...it challenges you and your values. Sometimes it reinforces them and sometimes it will blatantly attack them. You have to draw your own conclusions and interpretations. The Man Who Fell to Earth is no different. Yes the film seems to jump from time to time one scene juxtaposed with a scene that takes place 20 years later a flashback that may or may not be a flashback it is confusing. I know I was confused. It's not a linear narrative...it's telling a story through pictures with occasional words just to make sure you have a little more than an inkling as to what you're supposed to be seeing. Personally I would be interested to see the movie without dialogue...like Aeon Flux a story can be told philosophically and artistically without words.What is the story? Well...quite simply David Bowie in his first and probably one of his best onscreen performances is an alien on Earth trying to find a way to get water back to his world. Is it as simple as it sounds? Not by any means. But you have to believe it to see it. You will be confused you might even be offended there's a lot of sexually explicit scenes that border on pornography but one way or the other this film is meant to be visually stimulating. What you see will make you think...if you're repulsed by it and feel the urge to turn it off then it's simply not your kind of movie.On the whole I like this movie though I must be in a certain mood to watch it. It is not easy to watch there are long stretches without dialogue and when there is dialogue it's often confusing. But no matter what I like what I was seeing on the screen. I do feel like watching it again because I know there is more to absorb and take in there's more to think about that I missed before. But that's the kind of person I am...I want to think and I want that discomfort this movie gives me because I am alleviated by the need to solve it not dismiss it. Bowie is in fine form probably used to alienation being a Brit in America and having played his own Ziggy Stardust character in the past. The rest of the cast performs rather competently although nobody's performance shines as much as Bowie's although Candy Clarke is pretty good in some scenes and Rip Torn's deadpan performance is a bit of dry humor.Dispute me if you must I give this movie 12 out of .".

I guess what I was expecting in The Man Who Fell To Earth was something on the order of Ziggy Stardust but if that was the only thing missing I wouldn't have been nearly as disappointed. It's not that I mind nonlinear storytelling but at least there should be a coherent story to tell. Nominally the story's protagonist is on a mission to Earth to figure out how to bring water to his home planet where he's left his family. That never actually happens and you have to wait out the entire story in all it's excruciating boredom to find that out.Unlike virtually all scifi stories involving aliens from another planet this one doesn't go into a lot of pseudoscientific rationale about how Thomas Jerome Newton Bowie arrives on Earth in human clothes with perfect command of the English language. Even though he reveals his true appearance later in the picture I found it odd that he bleeds red blood gets the heaves and has the same reproductive organs as the male of the human species thanks to an overly gratuitous sex scene with his female companion Mary Lou Candy Clark. Can someone explain this to me  how is it Bowie's character can whiz across the vast reaches of space to arrive on Earth and then have trouble adjusting to a taxi cab speed of forty five miles per hour or the erratic motion of an elevator? That just doesn't make sense.I think the concept for the film was sound it reminded me a bit of the genre classic The Day The Earth Stood Still particularly relating to the mathematical concepts that Oliver Farnsworth Buck Henry parlayed into a handful of patents that made Newton a rich man. That's about as far as it went though as Bowie's character descended into the depravity and decadence that thwarted his original mission. The occasional flashbacks to the alien's home planet only added to my bewilderment as it was made to seem that the only inhabitants that resided there were his own family trekking around through the desert in that makeshift tent. All very maddening but boring at the same time and just about enough to make a lad insane.".

	schema:headline " The Director Who Fell In Love With His Camera";
	schema:reviewBody "and forgot what his movie was about.    Possible SpoilersThe Man Who Fell To Earth is based on a very interesting premise an alien on a desperate mission to save his planet from a worldwide drought has come to earth for water in the process he gets captured exploited by corporate goons and finally addicted by our culture and his mission becomes slowly derailed.  Unfortunately in a literal case of life imitating art so does the movie.The problem comes from the director and the script he spends far too much time on strange vignettes that have nothing to do with the movie in particular an extended silent scene where a naked middleaged black man is swimming in his pool gets out penis flopping the works and hugs his white girlfriendwife in slowmotion no less while he looks at the camera with a soulful apprehensive look.  Then it's back to the movie.  I still remember this scene because it's completely out of context with the rest of the film we don't know who these characters are and never see them again and the audience is left looking at each other and saying ...huh?  If Nicolas Roeg wanted to make an interracial plea for tolerance couldn't he have just made a movie about it?  Here it plays as if he had the concept and decided he could stick it into his movie at any point and it would work.  It doesn't nor do other scenes like it.  There are some strangely staged pointless sex scenes where Bowie has become involved with a human girl that are almost goofy.  After some softporn scenes showing small segments of their bodies we are shown a fully nude Bowie and girl from overhead for less than 1 second literally. Later in a disconnected scene a man goes to visit his wife at the office and they rip their clothes off and have sex in a small room whereupon the wife discovers that Bowie has taken pictures of everything with his new technology he wants to patent to make money to help him in his mission and needs the man's help he happens to know this would happen happened to be there at the time and does this to prove how nifty his invention is to the man.  If this sounds strange it's even more so in the movie.  Roeg seems to be wanting to develop his soft porn skills in arbitrary parts of the movie and it doesn't help the story.The movie does manage to make some points about the utter ruthlessness of corporate greed how humans manage to corrupt anything we get our hands on and how our vision no matter how urgent is constantly derailed by the excesses around us.  However Roeg seems fuzzy about that concept in regards to his own directing and the movie loses all focus towards the end when a waiter asks David Bowie who is drunk and defeated had enough?  Yes I have he says and lowers his head.  The end.  Can you say...easy copout?  By the end of the movie it doesn't matter.  We have had enough too mostly of the director's excesses and want to leave.  By the way the whole planet Bowie comes from dies...not that it seems to matter...The movie is frustrating in that it seems to go somewhere in the beginning we have glimpses of his faraway planet and his slowly dying people and little or no development of his attempt to work towards completing his goal other than a brief glimpse of a nevertobe completed spaceship.

David Bowie does an excellent job in the role and frankly I believe that he could do a convincing job of almost any role he chooses after seeing this. But I can't recommend anyone spending two hours of their life watching this. I am sure the book was enjoyable and would be a much better use of your time.  Three out of ten stars".

	onyx:emotionText "and forgot what his movie was about.    Possible SpoilersThe Man Who Fell To Earth is based on a very interesting premise an alien on a desperate mission to save his planet from a worldwide drought has come to earth for water in the process he gets captured exploited by corporate goons and finally addicted by our culture and his mission becomes slowly derailed.  Unfortunately in a literal case of life imitating art so does the movie.The problem comes from the director and the script he spends far too much time on strange vignettes that have nothing to do with the movie in particular an extended silent scene where a naked middleaged black man is swimming in his pool gets out penis flopping the works and hugs his white girlfriendwife in slowmotion no less while he looks at the camera with a soulful apprehensive look.  Then it's back to the movie.  I still remember this scene because it's completely out of context with the rest of the film we don't know who these characters are and never see them again and the audience is left looking at each other and saying ...huh?  If Nicolas Roeg wanted to make an interracial plea for tolerance couldn't he have just made a movie about it?  Here it plays as if he had the concept and decided he could stick it into his movie at any point and it would work.  It doesn't nor do other scenes like it.  There are some strangely staged pointless sex scenes where Bowie has become involved with a human girl that are almost goofy.  After some softporn scenes showing small segments of their bodies we are shown a fully nude Bowie and girl from overhead for less than 1 second literally. Later in a disconnected scene a man goes to visit his wife at the office and they rip their clothes off and have sex in a small room whereupon the wife discovers that Bowie has taken pictures of everything with his new technology he wants to patent to make money to help him in his mission and needs the man's help he happens to know this would happen happened to be there at the time and does this to prove how nifty his invention is to the man.  If this sounds strange it's even more so in the movie.  Roeg seems to be wanting to develop his soft porn skills in arbitrary parts of the movie and it doesn't help the story.The movie does manage to make some points about the utter ruthlessness of corporate greed how humans manage to corrupt anything we get our hands on and how our vision no matter how urgent is constantly derailed by the excesses around us.  However Roeg seems fuzzy about that concept in regards to his own directing and the movie loses all focus towards the end when a waiter asks David Bowie who is drunk and defeated had enough?  Yes I have he says and lowers his head.  The end.  Can you say...easy copout?  By the end of the movie it doesn't matter.  We have had enough too mostly of the director's excesses and want to leave.  By the way the whole planet Bowie comes from dies...not that it seems to matter...The movie is frustrating in that it seems to go somewhere in the beginning we have glimpses of his faraway planet and his slowly dying people and little or no development of his attempt to work towards completing his goal other than a brief glimpse of a nevertobe completed spaceship.  Exactly how many gallons of water is he expecting to transport in this tiny thing? Or is he the first in an invasion?  It's never explained or developed for that matter.  David Bowie does an excellent job in the role and frankly I believe that he could do a convincing job of almost any role he chooses after seeing this.

Sure the plot is a little hard to follow but it is so brilliantly rendered and the cinematography is perfect. A very strong atmosphere and mood is created and the whole thing all together is just mindblowing. Very original. Very artistic. Go see it if you haven't already.I would also like to add that this cult science fiction film is however not for everyone. The way it was created and the way the scenes are shot resembles an experimental film. The style is also out of the ordinary and the plot may seem to be a little strange and confusing to some.

Evil Rip Torn the evil capitalist ruins Bowie's life.At the end Bowie gives up and is a drunk in a restaurant.Yeah that's a great movie alright. I want to give that one 9 stars as it was such great entertainment...not.I don't need Hollywood endings but why do people rate such downbeat boring movies as excellent? Films like this are not entertaining exciting involving moving or anything beyond boring and depressing.Just in case you are wondering this is NOT a science fiction film. All the scifi parts if put together would take up about 10 minutes if that. This is a character story about a guy having the evil corporations running him and ruining him. If that is your cup of tea go for it but don't expect an interesting scifi picture.".

	schema:reviewBody "I love good science fiction and I don't mind slow paced films like Kubrick's 2001 A Space Odyssey as long as you are given new ideas to think about as you watch but TMWFTE is both tedious and annoying. The theme of the film about how an alien of superior intellect gets destroyed by the culture of greed capitalism and corruption comes to light very early. What follows adds very little to embellish that idea and we are stuck watching characters we don't really learn that much about get consumed by the said theme and wallow in the misery of excess. Roeg who was a far better director of cinematography than he was a film director made some interesting films Insignificance and Bad Timing among them but TMWFTE isn't one of them. There are those who praise the film and compare it to 2001 but it doesn't have the clear focus of Kubrick's film nor a character half as interesting as Hal 9000. David Bowie is visually interesting but in essence he's just playing a variation of his rock stage persona. Candy Clark's character was like being immersed in a backwoods opera with redneck hicks and the actress gives it her all but the role is so illdefined with great leaps of unexplained personality changes that no actress could have pulled it off. Roeg's style is so convoluted it just becomes a chore to figure out what's going on. And making the main character an alien who comes to earth to get caught up in the whirlpool of contemporary society doesn't hold up to scrutiny. Why an alien? It could have been someone from a completely different culture or someone with an unusual upbringing like Peter Sellars in Being There and been just as effective if not more so. The scifi element works with Bowie's physicality but not much else. Other than the alien makeup I found little else visually interesting. The whole production just seemed low budget with corners cut in all the wrong places. Locations and character motivations for being in these odd locations just come across as arbitrary as do the plot turns themselves. I first saw this film on its initial release a cut version which like other Roeg films namely Performance was butchered by the producers before release. I thought this full length restored Criterion edition would have made the film easier to follow but all it did was make it drag even more. As others maintain some respond well to this film suggesting it has much to say about how people get swallowed up by our capitalistic notions and the film's prescience of future inventions such as the digital camera and an mp3 type music device being ahead of their time and those things are there. Yet as a dramatic story that pulls the viewer in and gets them caught up in unusual characters lives I found it to be a failure. To me it was an unfortunately shallow tedious take on an interesting and worthwhile theme.".

	schema:reviewBody "Nicholas Roeg is a little tricky at times when it comes to narrative. Sometimes he experiments with it excellently Bad Timing and other times he slightly dulls the senses in an experimental kind of way Dont Look Now. The Man Who Fell to Earth seems to be told mostly in a linear fashion and there seems to be something of a story going on but... I never felt it completely click. Maybe that is part of Roeg's point with the material to create a kind of alienation that the alien no pun intended feels whilst gathering up the billions he needs to get supplies back to his home planet. But something just doesn't feel like it goes the way it should even when things are fascinating in a scene maybe even brilliant and the actors do end up trying their best along with Roeg's knack at capturing a mood in a specific strange but bewildering way.It isn't totally clear where the plot could be headed aside from the usual oblivion of the protagonist to the wretched TV excess of alcohol and some drugs to boot. Which is fine as a route of a plot. But it's perhaps that there doesn't seem to be a sharper satirical stabbing motion being made in the context of the story of what Bowie's man is doing on Earth except in bits and pieces. Perhaps he's a reflection of how some of us act right here on our planet or that there's even a sorrow to the state of affairs with Thomas Newton who is sensitive sometimes weak and at least a little unnerving in his detachment via the almighty dollar. Maybe there are some valid points made in connection with the suffering of a human being in what it does to his soul the longer they're on some strange planet by way of a horrible and dehumanizing marketplace. But the way it's presented to once again pop up a word that gets tossed like a beach ball at a concert in a pretentious manner.Or to amend that with another tired clich the parts are better than the sum or the whole. I did enjoy very much just looking at the Man Who Fell to Earth with some scenes some shots some transitions some jabs at real cinema displaying Roeg's natural gifts as an auteur at the peak of his powers. Just seeing that New York skyline for instance is a minor thrill or in the cutbacks Newton has to his old world. Hell even the sex scenes much lauded in some of the more negative reviews have a certain messy charm to them. And who doesn't love seeing Rip Torn as some smart but dangerous scientist who moves on from a penchant for young students in the sack to Newton's possible rocketship? Seeing scenes with Bowie and Rip Torn are indeed exciting in their indescribable link Bowie of course so fits into Newton it's hard to figure anyone else in the part. I even loved the quirky old rock and rolljazz type of music Roeg used when the first assumption would be Bowie would glamrock the whole place up.If there's anything that keeps the Man Who Fell to Earth from being a truly spectacular cult item though if only for this reviewer it's a certain mood overall to the piece an uncertainty as to what to do with everything in the book and how to make it so unusual a piece of science fiction that its own alienation could potentially affect the viewer in unexpected ways. It's got guts to go where it does to be sure but it's a tough journey along the way with romance wonderment of the unknown mental deconstruction and corporate fables all entwined. Whatever you have to say about it there's nothing else like it.".

And who doesn't love seeing Rip Torn as some smart but dangerous scientist who moves on from a penchant for young students in the sack to Newton's possible rocketship? Seeing scenes with Bowie and Rip Torn are indeed exciting in their indescribable link Bowie of course so fits into Newton it's hard to figure anyone else in the part. I even loved the quirky old rock and rolljazz type of music Roeg used when the first assumption would be Bowie would glamrock the whole place up.If there's anything that keeps the Man Who Fell to Earth from being a truly spectacular cult item though if only for this reviewer it's a certain mood overall to the piece an uncertainty as to what to do with everything in the book and how to make it so unusual a piece of science fiction that its own alienation could potentially affect the viewer in unexpected ways. It's got guts to go where it does to be sure but it's a tough journey along the way with romance wonderment of the unknown mental deconstruction and corporate fables all entwined. Whatever you have to say about it there's nothing else like it.";

The cinematography is amazing the story is intriguing and the acting is surprising. I mean I wasn't sure if David Bowie was going to be able to carry a movie like this but he was great. His performance of a detached icy humanoid alien was one of the most fascinating aspects of this film. I feel that the reason why most people don't view this film in such a high light nowadays is due to how bleak and slow the tone and pacing are. For me this was not a problem but I can see where some are coming from since modern audiences want less vague and bleak movies in cinemas. In conclusion if you are into complex challenging scifi movies then I highly recommend The Man Who Fell to Earth.".

In the book it's all beautifully described as the blue transformation of the alien into a human and his loss of motivation to rescue his planet from a severe draught. In the movie you just see an alien doing things without much reason or thought about them. This lack of understanding of the main character makes the movie kinda dull and void. However having read the book you'll understand what and why is he doing. That's not much help because the majority of the viewers will be lost...That said it's a nice movie maybe a bit on the surrealist side it has an oniric touch or maybe the daze of a hangover after too much booze which goes well with the atmosphere of the book and story. David Bowie the obvious star does very well on the skin of an alien clearly helped by his quite particular lookings. The supporting actors do well too but in the end it's just an aboveaverage movie. Not bad but thousand lightyears of the quality and depth of story which the book has.In short could have been great if the script was at least decent. Worth a watch still.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was going to give The Man Who Fell to Earth 1 star. 3 really is a bit generous. The movie really has no plot and is just a series of enigmatic scenes that don't really mesh well. For the first hour I was genuinely interested in the characters. Then I realized that the movie wasn't going anywhere. I say it's not a boring movie because quite a few of its scenes were actually compelling for some reason. These interesting scenes are distributed throughout the movie well so just when I felt like turning the T.V. off I'd get a bit interested again. The movie was at least in my opinion more entertaining just slightly more than 2001 A Space Odyssey I'm not saying it's better than 2001 by the way because it's definitely not just that I personally found it more entertaining. Still for me to like a movie it needs to have a good plot or at least interesting characters.Speaking of 2001 A Space Odyssey there is something else I must say. It's that The Man Who Fell to Earth is rather pretentious. Now the word pretentious is used quite a bit to describe movies without the user of the word elaborating on what he means by it so let me elaborate. I think 2001 is a very boring movie. Nothing will ever make me think that it is entertaining. This doesn't mean however that I don't have a great amount of respect for it. If we're speaking objectively it is probably the greatest sciencefiction movie ever made greater than Blade Runner my favorite movie of alltime the Star Wars movies Alien Jurassic Park etc. 2001 deserves all the praise it gets even if it will never be one of my favorite movies. 2001 is not a pretentious movie because it is as great as it is trying to be.Now The Man Who Fell to Earth on the other hand is a pretentious movie. It really did seem to be trying to be greater than it ever could be. Maybe it was because the budget was too low. 2001 may be boring but there are certain scenes that you'll remember forever or at least for a very long time the scene where the ape figures out how to use the bone as a weapon the scene where David Bowman tries to get back into the Discovery 1 the creation of the Star Child etc. I'll be completely honest  out of all of the interesting scenes in The Man Who Fell to Earth the one that I remember the best is the one where David Bowie shows Candy Clark his real eyes and she wets herself. The Man Who Fell to Earth tries to use obfuscation to cover up for it's lack of substance and plot.The special effects aren't very good. And why is it that they use footage from one of the Apollo rockets I think it's Apollo 11 but I'm not sure blasting off into space when David Bowie is supposed to be The Man Who Fell to Earth? And there was a lot of sex and nudity in this movie. I'm not complaining that it's morally wrong or anything. What I do think is that sex and nudity in a movie should serve a good purpose. Then again I love Death Race 2000 which has quite a bit of gratuitous nudity but that movie takes itself far less seriously than this one. Here it's mostly used to distract the audience from the lack of plot and character development. I was curious about what the IMDb's Parents Guide for this movie had to say about the sex and nudity in the movie. The first piece of information in the Sex  Nudity category is Arguably all of the sex and nudity is shown in an artful tasteful way the scenes are strongly focused on characterization as opposed to titillation. I must disagree. There was much more sex and nudity than there had to be to make certain points. We get it already Rip Torn is a womanizer.I don't feel like I wasted my time watching this movie. Maybe I'll watch it again. And I'm also interested in reading the book on which it was based. But if you want a really good science fiction movie take it from me just some guy on the Internet watch Blade Runner. Or Logan's Run which also came out in 1976 and has far better special effects for the most part just ignore some of the bad miniatures. Or even Death Race 2000.".

	schema:reviewBody "I like Nicolas Roeg's films although I don't claim to always get or enjoy every minute of them. They're always fantastically shot in a crisp realistic style he often pushes back the boundaries particularly with the censors and they frequently have scenes which stick long in the memory. However they often seem to have just as many longueurs with offbeat characters and nonlinear narratives. Maybe I'm the problem...Anyway David Bowie here plays a part which seemed to haunt him for years to come in the aftermath of the film alone he used images from the movie for two of his album covers a 12inch single sleeve while it also seems to inspire tracks on his Station To Station Low and Scary Monsters albums not to mention the famous Ashes To Ashes video. Bowie was at an artistic peak musically although off stage he was hopelessly hooked on cocaine in fact just watch the contemporary BBC Arena documentary on him Cracked Actor and he looks here as if he's just walked onset from there. So can he act then...?Well if there was one part he was born to play it was this one the alien misfit who conquers the world but to be honest while he certainly has a presence you wouldn't say he was extended much. Looks great though.The film stopstarts its way on his space invader odyssey as he leaves his family life on Mars or wherever it is to start inventing items which quickly become society's new fashion musthaves. He picks up or rather she does him an adoring if simplistic hotel chambermaid and garners a backup team to make him a vast fortune his target being to amass enough funds to build a spaceship to take him back home. But something happens on his way to heaven as unsurprisingly he's abducted by government officials where he's subjected to excruciating tests which wouldn't be out of place in an animal cruelty lab. Resistance however is futile and the mysterious Mr Newton by the end is a washedup drunk still resigning himself to his earth bound fate. In one of the film's most telling lines he forgives his captortorturer as he admits his own race would gave treated a visiting earthling in the exact same way.There's solid backup to Bowie's central role with a variety of convincingly portrayed stock characters. Roeg pushes the permissive button pretty far here with more than a smattering of nudity in the sex scenes not ignoring the fact that males frequently get naked too when being intimate. I would still say there were too many scenes which for me played like Bowie's own cutup method for lyrics at around this time by which I mean I found them puzzling strange and unconnected. And why no Bowie soundtrack?Still an interesting if confounding movie as strangely addictive in its way as television is to Newton.".

The use of fisheye lenses although sometimes excessive helps lend a surreal quality to the proceedings which is apt.Here we have John Randolph a nonentity with a face that has all the appeal of a hardboiled egg. He's converted into Rock Hudson which is a considerable improvement in appearance anyway. But both the organization and Hudson have botched it. Under hypnosis Rock has revealed that maybe his true desire is to be a painter an artist.He winds up at a very nice beach house in Malibu with an understanding servant a studio with all the amenities and Salome Jens as a woman he picks up on the beach. Not bad eh? And all this for a mere 30000. The house alone would run 30 or 40 times that much now.Well to tell the truth Rock seems a little unhappy in his new life. He dabs perfunctorily at his canvas. He doesn't smile much. He doesn't seem to be having a good time.So far so good but then we enter the befouled middle act. Salome Jens hustles him off to a Saturnalian bacchanal in the forest. Everybody gets drunk strips plays musical instruments and dances around in a vat full of grapes. Rock is at first repelled but is dragged into the vat anyway and gets drunk and ecstatically happy.Fine right? But then later Rock is urged to give a party for his neighbors all of whom turn out to be retreads like himself. Rock begins to drink cocktails and gets loaded. But what is the reaction of his guests? This time it's disgust. Jens cautions him to take it easy on the booze but why? It's the only time we see him happy and what's so worrisome about being drunk at a party where everyone else is drinking too? Disgust turns to a deeper concern when Rock begins making allusions to his previous life. He's a Harvard graduate and you can't keep them down. Finally he realizes that he's not really made out for this kind of life for reasons never made entirely clear. Well not made clear at all. Not even explored in the dialogue. Was his dream of being a painter just a childhood fantasy like wanting to be an astronaut? What is the source of his dissatisfaction? There is a good scene in which he visits his wife who now believes her husband to have died in a fire. He asks about some watercolors he'd done in his previous life and discovers that they were thrown out. No question about his original identity having been dismal.So he complains to the organization that he wants yet ANOTHER identity. The very sensible and reassuring Will Geer handles him and tells him that everything is fine and they'll redo him. Geer in a perfect performance doesn't tell him that a second renovation involves his death. Rock will provide a cadaver as a substitute for a new guy entering the program. Nothing is more scary than the doctors having strapped Rock down lowering a bone drill onto his skull behind the ear. How does Rock perform? Pretty well. It's certainly his best dramatic role.And the supporting cast is flawless. The logic behind the middle of the story is its greatest weakness. The rest is well worth watching.".

Rock Hudson isn't an actor with much credibility to most film fans but he is brilliant in this film in easily his most powerful and believable performance ever. The rest of the supporting cast are excellent especially the underrated character actors John Randolph 'Serpico' Will Geer TV's 'The Waltons' and Jeff Corey 'Mickey One'.

The innovative and the postexpressionist cinematography of James Wong Howe the use of the 9.7 mm fisheye lens extreme chiaroscuro tilted low angle shots handheld camera shots combined with the stylish graphic work of Saul Bass and a cold taut and harsh music of Jerry Goldsmith makes it like a Faustian tragedy with a Kafkaesque approach. The whole film is about distortion. The twisted vision of the main character trapped in his own nightmarish world full of reborns and employees. But the real nightmare is the dreary routine of his existence. For instance the scene of the train when Arthur Hamilton is reading his newspaper and feels suddenly sick with his life. We see very short shots of the train window and his sad face. The more oppressive scenes are silent just extreme closeups of faces. Perhaps the best film directed by John Frankenheimer and the best paranoiac film ever created. Classic is a weak word to define this masterpiece of modern terror.

There are not too many films which offer the viewer a choice to finish watching or not.

It starts easy enough when a middleage man John Randolph Arthur Hamilton decides to accept an offer to 'exchange' his given life and trade it for a more youthful one. The transition is casual enough but director John Frankenheimer adroitly uses the Black and White images to lure not only the audience but the subject into a false sense of security and tranquility. During the fantastic transformation from old John Randolph to youthful handsome and attractive Antiochus 'Tony' Wilson Rock Hudson he and the audience is gently beaconed and eased into the new but alien life by a calm and compassionate guide called the Old Man. Will Geer It's his job to ally the fears and reassure suspicions that 'everything is going to be alright.' The fact is the film is so tranquil one hardly suspects the new life unless the subject and the audience want to go home. JohnTony choose this option. The way back however is impossible but only the audience is privy to it. The subject is removed from his 'second' life and given a quiet room to collect his thoughts. It's here the subject and the audience are once again joined by the Old Man who will ease us not to the comfort of a New Life but to make us aware that escape and the exit doors are twenty feet away. It's time to choose again but you'd better hurry. The end is terrifying in it's finality. ".

	schema:reviewBody "The psychological thriller has been twisted contorted and mangled as of late. The main attraction seems to have changed from the thrill aspect to the grossout and disturb factor. How these movies have strayed is a testament to a new generation of filmmakers and audiences. The thirst for blood as it appears on the screen isn't what thrillers used to be. Blood was reserved for the horror movies. It used to consist of all mind games.John Frankenheimer's premise behind his classic thriller Seconds is just that a mind game. Seconds is the journey one man takes into a new life. Arthur Hamilton is a depressed boring and trapped individual. His life revolves around work. He has become virtually asleep at home not saying much or doing much. His wife seems bothered by his silence at home and in the bedroom.While taking the train home from work Arthur is given an address. What he will find there he doesn't know. That night he receives a strange phone call from his old tennis buddy who was presumed dead. He tells him to go to the address and everything would be alright. Upon arriving at the address he is told to go to another location. From the new local he is taken by meat truck to a different location. This is where his life would change forever.Arthur is given the chance millions would kill for the chance to start a new life a rebirth free of all previous ties and problems. Confused and frightened at first Arthur is reassured that the procedure is reliable and affective. The recovery process is long and difficult. The operation itself is a full body makeover using a cadaver for physical transplants a new voice and even a new signature. Arthur Hamilton is transformed into Anthony Wilson. Now it is up to Wilson to change his ways and become his new self. This all leads to one of the most dramatic endings in cinema history.The film's opening sequence of credits is a thrill to watch itself. Using different almost uncomfortable camera angles on one man's face. Throughout the film there are awkward closeups and shots but this is intended. It is almost like a normal person's point of view fixed on one thing at a time not just a scene. The lighting too is intended to have an impact on the story throwing shadows in all directions. The shining quality of the film hands down is the cinematography. James Wong Howe whose previous work include Hud Sweet Smell of Success and Yankee Doodle Dandy goes above and beyond making the film exciting to watch and hard to look away from. Howe uses a host of camera angles and techniques to get the emotion of the characters across. Rock Hudson as Arthur Hamilton postoperation as Wilson gives his best as the confused and altered patient. His character obviously wants to change but he is held back just out of his sheer nature. He hasn't been capable of living life freely no strings attached in a very long time. His performance couldn't have been better for the role. Also giving note worthy performances are John Randolph as Arthur preoperation and Will Greer as the man at the company who convinced Arthur to proceed with the procedure once he was informed of what his intent was.Nominated for an Academy Award for Best Cinematography Seconds breaks boundaries in filmmaking and storytelling. Seconds is a trailblazer setting the mark for thrillers and what they are capable of. It is rare to find a film so moving and at the same time make you think long after the film ends.".

The most vicious guys of the story talks like an affectionate father. The dizziest scene of all seems to go on forever. The protagonist is a pure Greek Tragedy hero. How could they do it in 1966?

It's one of Rock Hudson's most highly rated performances and deservedly so.Production wise Seconds does resemble a rather long episode of the Twilight Zone but that's not a derogatory comment. The Company provides some people to help newbies transition. Two of the best performances are Wesley Addy as a rather creepy factotum assigned to Hudson and Salome Jens as a woman who evinces interest in the new man that is Hudson.Seconds is not a feel good movie but it's a great horror story told without any of the usual monsters blood and gore associated with the genre. If you see Seconds it will raise some disturbing questions.".

The camera angles especially the ones where it was 'pinned' on the actor's shoulders were genius.  I'm amazed that movies back then even in black and white look better than most movies in color today....the cinematography was excellent.  There's something very appealing about black and white films when they're done right.  As far as the story I was very suprised at how the film ended.  Its a suitably depressing end to a very depressing and disturbing film.  I'm curious as to why the lead character thought he failed at his 'second chance'.  But like Mr. Wilson said maybe he never had a dream to be fulfilled which is why he ultimately failed.  This is a film that I wish could be exposed to more people.  This is very effective and daring filmmaking something we need more of today.  Although this film is only for people who like to think.

Also a surprisingly mature performance from David Hemmings matched the mood of powerlessness and fatalism that pervades Seconds.A little further off it recalled the Incredible Shrinking Man.

A slasher film marathon with inyourface gore would be easier to sit through than this because they don't affect you on a personal level like this film does. You can laugh off the blood and fake violence in a slasher flick but there is nothing to laugh at in this film. It brings up disturbing feelings hopelessness claustrophobia the feeling that no matter what you do even if given a second chance at life you are still trapped by the decisions you made in your first one or will make the exact same choices you did in your first life bringing you to the same point again. I hope the message of this film isn't you're doomed to make the same mistakes and decisions over and over again no matter what you do so don't even try. If there is a message in this film or a statement it makes it's don't pretend your past didn't happen and walk away from it thinking you can start over with a new life and new lessons. Instead embrace what happened to you good and bad and that you learned a lot from it good and bad. Then go on with the rest of your life with those lessons that your life including your mistakes taught you. It's one thing to move to a new place and to a new career and even a new family it's another to abandon everything you learned up to that point which is your identity. That's the cautionary moral this movie seems to make.At least I hope it does. The movie is so bleak and so stark in its presentation it leaves it entirely up to the audience whether there's a statement there at all.I think this is just the kind of movie that Roger Ebert liked and would have recommended.

'Seconds' is based on a quite plausible premise that somewhere out there is an underground organisation known as 'The Company' which specialises in giving people new identities fresh starts in life.Arthur Hamilton a middleaged businessman is approached by a Company employee whilst commuting and gets offered the chance to begin his life again. Trapped in a loveless marriage and with nothing to look forward to save retirement he opts to be reborn.After extensive plastic surgery he emerges butterflylike as 'Antiochus  Tony  Wilson' professional artist. Wilson is given a lovely home near the sea a livein manservant and strikes up an affair with a beautiful neighbour Nora Marcus.But he realises too late that his new life is just as empty as meaningless as the one he threw away. Returning to The Company he asks to be given yet another identity. Unable or unwilling to nominate another candidate for rebirth he unwittingly signs his own death warrant...'Seconds' was directed by the late John Frankenheimer then at the peak of his powers as a filmmaker with classics such as 'Birdman Of Alcatraz' 'The Manchurian Candidate' and 'Seven Days In May' to his credit. He brings a Hitchcockian feeling of suspense to the early scenes while the postrebirth section could not have been bettered by Kubrick. James Wong Howe's cinematography is breathtaking the 'Company' scenes are chillingly stark while the infamous wine festival is soft focus. Speaking of which the scene is carefully edited so that even though people are running around naked you never see anything explicit  you do in the European version though! . Imagine what it might have been like had the film been made five years later.For Rock Hudson the film was a welcome change of direction after those romantic comedies with Doris Day. He gives a moody powerful performance which surely must rank as his best. According to Danny Peary's book 'Cult Movies 3' the party scene where Wilson breaks down and pleads for the right to his identity hit the actor so hard he could not stop crying. Hudson's homosexuality was at that time one of Hollywood's bestkept secrets.The excellent supporting cast includes Salome Jens giving a hypnotic performance as the freespirited Nora Will Geer as the president of 'The Company' and Murray Hamilton as 'Charlie' who by nominating his old friend Arthur Hamilton as a candidate for rebirth inadvertently sets in motion the wheels of his destruction. The most impressive performance comes from the late John Randolph as 'Arthur'. He is simply brilliant particularly when he realises he has nothing to live for and one wonders why he did not bag an Oscar for best supporting actor.Lewis John Carlino's script is a little talky but its ideas  derived from David Ely's novel  are solid. Who is to say that a story like this could not happen in real life? How do we know there isn't a 'Company' out there right now? The late Jerry Goldsmith surpasses himself with a magnificent score as bleak and foreboding as the film itself.'Seconds' also has the most horrifying ending of any film I have ever seen. A guaranteed nightmare inducer.Not a picture for those who like their science fiction drenched in C.G.I. 'Seconds' ought to be compulsive viewing for young people who think plastic surgery is the key to a better life.".

With Seconds I'm somewhere in between.The beginning is unbearably slow. The audience is expected to deal with this massive concept but we're saddled with a character who doesn't ask even the most obvious questions. Arthur Hamilton is given the opportunity to fake his own death undergo plastic surgery and start a new life. While some attempt is made to convey why he would agree to this it still feels too easy as if they just want to get it over with and bring on Rock Hudson as Hamilton's new self. Characters tell Arthur what he's going to do but we don't dig much deeper into why he's being offered this opportunity.Things do improve some when Hudson arrives but it's not really until he begins to question what his life has become that things take off. Hudson does a great job in this film and the critical and commercial panning he took was unwarranted. There are flaws in this film but Hudson's performance isn't one of them.By the end we see Hudson coming to the realization that too much of his life has been spent chasing material things a conclusion that just seems trite in view of the larger issues here. In fact the whole concept seems underthought. Yes these people get youngerlooking bodies but aren't they still the same age they were before? Perhaps my view's tainted because for years I had thought this was a movie about group that made people younger sort of a fountain of youth treatment an idea I found interesting. After finally watching it tonight the reality felt like sort of a letdown.Still the film does have some genuinely disturbing moments and the ending is chilling. It's something of an ancestor to films like The Game' and shows like The XFiles' with its conspiracies and shadowy concepts. It's definitely worth checking out but I can't help but feel that there's a better film buried in here somewhere.".

	schema:reviewBody "In Scarsdale the bored banker Arthur Hamilton John Randolph is contacted by his former friend Charlie Evans that supposedly died several years ago giving information about a secret organization that offers for US 30000.00 a second chance in life to wealthy people. He visits the company and they explain that they use a cadaver with the same characteristics to stage the death of the client and give a new identity after plastic surgeries with new documents. The reborn Arthur is the painter Antiochus 'Tony' Wilson Rock Hudson that lives in California with his butler John Wesley Addy that helps him in the transition. Tony meets the lonely Nora Marcus Salome Jens on the beach and they have a love affair. But sooner Tony realizes that his fake world does not give satisfaction to him and he returns to the company requesting another life. But the rules are not so easy to be changed.Seconds is a weird film by John Frankenheimer with potential of cult movie. The creepy and disturbing story is quite absurd but the screenplay never uses clichs and it is impossible to guess what will happen with the lead character. The conclusion is totally unexpected. My vote is seven.Title Brazil O Segundo Rosto The Second Face".

	onyx:emotionText "In Scarsdale the bored banker Arthur Hamilton John Randolph is contacted by his former friend Charlie Evans that supposedly died several years ago giving information about a secret organization that offers for US 30000.00 a second chance in life to wealthy people. He visits the company and they explain that they use a cadaver with the same characteristics to stage the death of the client and give a new identity after plastic surgeries with new documents. The reborn Arthur is the painter Antiochus 'Tony' Wilson Rock Hudson that lives in California with his butler John Wesley Addy that helps him in the transition. Tony meets the lonely Nora Marcus Salome Jens on the beach and they have a love affair. But sooner Tony realizes that his fake world does not give satisfaction to him and he returns to the company requesting another life. But the rules are not so easy to be changed.Seconds is a weird film by John Frankenheimer with potential of cult movie. The creepy and disturbing story is quite absurd but the screenplay never uses clichs and it is impossible to guess what will happen with the lead character. The conclusion is totally unexpected. My vote is seven.Title Brazil O Segundo Rosto The Second Face";

	schema:reviewBody "I don't think the movie's definition of 'reborn' is exactly what the popular meaning has in mind. Nevertheless it's a heckuva scifi movie from beginning to end. Frankenheimer pulls out all the stops in his camera work. The angles and effects are weird even for the closeups while that hectic bacchanal still has me panting for breath. We're kept off balance the whole time by those angles which is as it should be. The style fits the material perfectly.Poor Arthur Randolph. He's a dutiful husband and breadwinner but he's also terminally bored with his life and wife. It seems he's grown old even at middleage. So now he's ready for the big change the Company provides for a price. Still he should have known when he signed up that he was in for the wrong kind of rebirth. After all he first has to go through an infernal steam cloud at the pants presser then through carcassstrewn meat lockers in a slaughterhouse. It's all this just to get to the Company offices. That should have told him that the price of a new identity would be more hellish than the 30000 in dollars.But then what guy wouldn't trade a 45year old tired mug for Rock Hudson's handsome features and a new chance at life especially the swinging kind. Okay so maybe there's something sinister behind the smiling bureaucrats of The Company especially when Mr. Ruby Corey scarfs down the fleshy edibles. But not to worry they'll fake his death with some poor soul's cadaver and his unexciting former life will be left behind for good. So after a lot of bloody plastic surgery Arthur gets his new chance with a handsome new face reborn now as Tony Wilson Hudson. Plus he gets to move from his boring old house in the suburbs to where else but swinging Malibu CA. The Company it seems fixes up everything. Then there's that adoring young playmate to help Jens him settle in. She's sure a long way from the drab wife he's left behind. Okay maybe there's something odd about John Addy the hovering house servant of his beach cottage. Nonetheless he waits on Tony's every need and now Tony can live life as a king.And get a load of those merry making hippies snaking up the canyon to their winesoaked retreat that Nora's roped him into. Trouble is you can change a person outwardly but it's not so easy inwardly. Besides as Arthur Tony has a whole lifetime of habits and hangups to overcome. So now he just sort of stands there uptight amid all the naked winestomping bodies. A real partypooper until playmate Nora strongarms him into drunken abandon. Now he's got what he thinks he wants a new swinging life to replace the glum old businessman. At last life is good but is it. I'm not surprised the film has a big cult following. On the whole it's that good. The cast is superb even Hudson who I suspect gives a career performance. That's along with the Walton's Will Geer as the kindly old head of The Company his perpetual smile a mask for what turns out to be a Faustian bargain. To me the movie's final third lacks the kind of clarity that's gone before. But maybe that's as it should be. That way the sinister undercurrents remain clouded in their exact depths.It appears the plot pivots at this point on the question of personal choice certainly a defining feature of personal fulfillment. But without giving away too much it seems The Company has engineered everything right down to guaranteed unhappiness. So the Company program perhaps amounts to a recycling of clients through preplanned stages that Tony too must go through. The movie doesn't spell out what The Company is really up to instead we have to piece things together. I guess my only gripe is with the ending. Frankly the kicking and screaming may raise the viewer's dreadlevel but I think the ending should come as a sudden surprise with kindly old Will Geer looking on.Nonetheless the movie appears to be an original reworking of the Faustian legend of selling one's soul. But whether taken as a Faustian parable on middle class discontent or not it's still a riveting 100minutes.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the late fifties Rock Hudson was seen through the eyes of middleaged women and teenage girls as the allAmerican Alpha male the hero a luminary of the melodrama genre. While Hudson's performances were exceptional in nearly all of his films his performance in Frankenheimer's frenetic psychological thriller Seconds is nothing short of amazing. Another notable albeit overlooked performance was that of Francis Reed as Emily Tony's original wife. Reed's final scenes of the film were beautifully and eloquently articulated and her emotions while restrained were catching you could feel her sense of loss and confusion. The film's commencing images of Authur's distortedwarping face accompanied by Goldsmith's dark piercing score gives the viewer a sense of confusion of not knowing exactly just what is happening and a lingering air of dread and disgust. The film in an elemental analysis is rather uneven some scenes are overdrawn lengthy. Take for example the duration of the wine stomping festival. While this sequence is significantly important to the understanding of the main characters their thoughts their ideas and their behavior a spiritual and personal releasing of the central character's concealed emotions and inner tensions it's simply far too long and at times confusing due to the jerky camera movements handheld? making the scene almost laughable. Another example of a needlessly linty scene is the party episode at Wilson's new Oceanfront domicile. Once again the camera movements are highly unstable and the scene overall far too long. The scene comes across as an over lit neurotic parody rather than a significant watershed in the narrative. Other than these few weaker elements of Seconds the film as a whole is surprisingly powerful. Once again Hudson's performance was very authentic and while his character was not the most reasonable man Hudson's heartfelt performance makes him very sympathetic. Overall Frankenheimer's unconventional foray into the Paranoid Thriller Genre is very memorable and one of the more honest deeply compelling films of it's time. The final 20 minutes are harrowing and the ambient orchestrations by Goldsmith access at perfectly calculated moments. Unconventional in it's approach moving in it's deeply felt themes and haunting for it's difficult questions toward's a perhaps superficial covetous modern society.".

	schema:headline " Video surprise of the year realistic engrossing ranks with best American crime films of the 70's";
	schema:reviewBody "Wow! I wasn't expecting this  a sober detailed semidocumentary study of police investigation and tactics from of all people Bo Widerberg?!I am astonished to say that this is a remarkably realistic and believable film and as another viewer suggested should be viewed by current filmakers as a prime reference for how films in this genre can be successfully approached. This truly ranks with the best American crimepolice films of the 70's and soars above all their pale French imitations though it may lack the visceral impact of DIRTY HARRY or a character as indelible as Popeye Doyle. But character development is not really the film's focus it is getting the details right  which it does  of the methodical police investigation of a murder and then their forced tactical response to a sniper. In doing this Widerberg and co. avoid a number of cliches and dramatic pitfalls that have plagued other films and television dramas working this turf over the last 40 years. These include cowboy heroics by rogue cops an overreliance on police jargon that supposedly lets us know we are inside the world of police work allowing interpersonal melodramas between characters to blur the focus of the story i.e. catching the criminal and of course the now ritual abuse of explosions car chases and machinegun editing to supposedly heighten our excitement. There are also no cartoonish twistedgenius serial killers masterminding absurd plot twists. Here the killer is as unspectacular and as understandable although we never meet him as the men pursuing him. It is also remarkable how characters casually enter into the film as they enter the investigation  no one emerges as THE hero  everyone just does his job. And Widerberg is so effective at focusing us on the quiet routine details of how the case develops that when violence erupts in the later part of the film it is truly startling. The scenes of panicking crowds have an unsettling documentary feel. The police response to this threat is again restrained unspectacular all right the helicopter attack may be pushing it a bit and intensely dramatic for just that reason no bells or whistles required. When the criminal is finally stopped it is almost anticlimatic no drawnout battles to the death no swelling music and this is as it should be for the world remains the same evil still exists and the job goes on. Can't wait to see MAN FROM MALLORCA. 9 out of 10.".

I wasn't expecting this  a sober detailed semidocumentary study of police investigation and tactics from of all people Bo Widerberg?!I am astonished to say that this is a remarkably realistic and believable film and as another viewer suggested should be viewed by current filmakers as a prime reference for how films in this genre can be successfully approached. This truly ranks with the best American crimepolice films of the 70's and soars above all their pale French imitations though it may lack the visceral impact of DIRTY HARRY or a character as indelible as Popeye Doyle. But character development is not really the film's focus it is getting the details right  which it does  of the methodical police investigation of a murder and then their forced tactical response to a sniper. In doing this Widerberg and co. avoid a number of cliches and dramatic pitfalls that have plagued other films and television dramas working this turf over the last 40 years. These include cowboy heroics by rogue cops an overreliance on police jargon that supposedly lets us know we are inside the world of police work allowing interpersonal melodramas between characters to blur the focus of the story i.e. catching the criminal and of course the now ritual abuse of explosions car chases and machinegun editing to supposedly heighten our excitement. There are also no cartoonish twistedgenius serial killers masterminding absurd plot twists. Here the killer is as unspectacular and as understandable although we never meet him as the men pursuing him. It is also remarkable how characters casually enter into the film as they enter the investigation  no one emerges as THE hero  everyone just does his job. And Widerberg is so effective at focusing us on the quiet routine details of how the case develops that when violence erupts in the later part of the film it is truly startling. The scenes of panicking crowds have an unsettling documentary feel. The police response to this threat is again restrained unspectacular all right the helicopter attack may be pushing it a bit and intensely dramatic for just that reason no bells or whistles required. When the criminal is finally stopped it is almost anticlimatic no drawnout battles to the death no swelling music and this is as it should be for the world remains the same evil still exists and the job goes on. Can't wait to see MAN FROM MALLORCA. 9 out of 10.";

After that the film continues on a very slow pacealthough it never gets boring until the last half hour which consists of very welldone but not standard policeaction. The film oozes of realism from everything to small talk between father and daughter to attempts to stop a crazy gun man. The best swedish thriller ever and damn good even by international standards.".

Thre are wonderful shots of steam trains especially at night which will delight gricers of the world but there's also a portrait of an oldfashioned community and industry in the early days of communism. One of the interesting things about Munk's films is his essential fairness and it's especially noticeable in this film all of the characters have both good features and bad and the tragedy comes partly because they cannot accept or trust one another.

Thre are wonderful shots of steam trains especially at night which will delight gricers of the world but there's also a portrait of an oldfashioned community and industry in the early days of communism. One of the interesting things about Munk's films is his essential fairness and it's especially noticeable in this film all of the characters have both good features and bad and the tragedy comes partly because they cannot accept or trust one another.

	schema:headline " Story of a decent but controversial man";
	schema:reviewBody "Action takes place in 1950. Machinists driving a steam train locomotive notice a man standing on the rail track next to an open semaphore but cannot stop the train before crushing him. They discover he is their former old chief in the locomotive driving team and also that one light of the semaphore is out which means run through normally while there should be two which means slow down and drive carefully. Railroad investigators mostly suspicion sabotage because the man was actually recently forcibly retired but do not understand why he found himself on the track. They question people having worked with him or involved in the fatal situation. All seem to hate him and for some good reasons as the man was harsh for young coworkers not very obedient to new management and some witnesses might share responsibility for the accident. The investigation is mostly an examination of the old man's life and personality because technical details which allow to finally know what happened are revealed near the end only.During the examination motives for the old man's behavior are progressively revealed. The harshness is probably related to his dislike of too ambitious colleagues who want fast promotion to full driver positions. His servantlike treatment of aides might come from his back problems that he tries to hide to keep the job. His lack of obedience is also a refusal for the new and presumably unreasonable cornercutting policies motivated by the notsowell working Stalinist model. The movie has therefore a political dimension. The old engineer opposed not only new young ambitions and new policies in the railways but also by extension in the entire country. The investigators behave somewhat like an inquisition. It is by consequence important for political correctness that the final flashback which reconstructs the most plausible story is told by a party mogul in a positive way.The long flashbacks which compose the movie and tell the actual story from different and partially contradicting points of view will remind you of Rashomon the action date even matches its release year. The concept of examining a mystery surrounding the death of a controversial hero was present in Citizen Kane. The beginning scenes in the train strangely reminisce me of The Lady Vanishes. The ending is worth a Capra movie.The intrigue is rooted in workplace reality which makes the movie somewhat more viewerstressing than Rashomon and good candidate for illustrating a conflict solving managerial training. The location shooting makes it realistic and thus a good testimony of the past. There is a bit of action and a few moving train stunts. The scenes in the locomotive's cabin seem shot while the train was really in movement and without special effects. Some shots are from a camera attached to the train laterally. Various funny railroad devices are prominently featured like machines for rotating locomotives or cranes for water refills.The movie received the Best Director award in 1957 Karlove Vary film festival Czechoslovakia and the Warsaw Siren Polish Film Critics' Award in 1957. It is available on VHS.Rating 10".

It is precisely keeping this thing in mind that Polish director Andrzej Munk set out to direct Czlowiek Na Torze a film about the lives of Polish railway workers. His film questions the role of a dead railway worker who went much too far in the course of his job before after having been being fired by the authorities. This film was made possible with the help of Polish Railway employees who are shown to wisely tackle differences at work place. The film begins with a nicely shot sequence of a train driven by a steam engine. It is worth mentioning that the camera has been placed so meticulously that one could see the actual train chugging marvelously on the tracks. The film is replete with nicely shot scenes of this kind which capture each moment of what it is being in a situation related to trains.".

Richard Crenna pulled off the role nicely though I don't think of him in the Western genre. I'm a fan of Louis L'Amour but don't think I read this book  will have to now!

	schema:headline " Riding Rough With Richard Crenna!!!";
	schema:reviewBody "Innocent Bystanders director Peter Collinson emphasizes action shrouded in mystery in scenarist Scot Finch's cinematic adaptation of Louis L'Amour's novel The Man Called Noon with Richard Crenna plagued by amnesia while a passel of triggerhappy pistoleros do their best to pack him full of lead. Conan the Barbarian lenser John Cabrera photographed this invigorating oater on various scenic Spanish locations where earlier westerns such as Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West and John Guillermin's El Condor had been shot and Collinson and he frame each shot so that this dusty windswept horse opera is easy on the eyes. James Bond movie aficionados should savor the fact that stunt man Bob Simmons the guy in the gun barrel sequences of Dr. No and From Russia With Love arranged the stunts. The scenes of horsemen toppling from their saddles and horses plunging into the camera are genuinely exciting. Crenna faces the same trouble that Matt Damon would confront forty or so year later with his loss of memory. Mind you it takes one spectacular fall from a hotel balcony and later another down the side of a mountain for our stalwart hero to recover his wits while his adversaries blast away at him. Oscar winning actor Stephen Boyd and former MGM contract player Farley Granger cannot seem to figure out what side they are on and whether they are going to riddle our hero. Similarly two womenItalian beauty Rosanna Schiaffino of The Long Ships and Patty Shepard of The Stranger and the Gunfighterstand on either side of our protagonist but they have already decided what they are going to do about him. The lastminute showdown between these two dames is something to see especially with Shepard decked out in black with a flatcrowned hat. Collinson and Finch don't lollygag around in this sagebrusher. Just as Jonas Mandarin Richard Crenna of Catlow has finished dressing in his hotel room in Kiowa Flats villainous sharpshooter Ben Janish ngel del Pozo of Hell in the Aegean creases Jonas' scalp with a bullet and Jonas crashes through his window and falls into the street. Scrambling to escape from a search party of armed desperadoes our resilient hero climbs aboard a train pulling out of town. Janish's henchmen assemble to find but they lose him. Meantime Jonas dashes across the rooftops of box cars this is splendidly staged by Collinson as the train chugs away into the distance. He winds up in a box car with a scruffy sixgun toting owlhoot Rimes Stephen Boyd of BenHur and they behave like partners for a while. Eventually they end up at a ranch presided over by the lovely Fan Davidge Rosanna Schiaffino who suffers under the tyranny of Janish. After Fan cleans up Jonas' scalp wound our hero joins a group of ruffians in a nearby bunkhouse and proves his wits with his fists. He slugs it out with a couple and then settles down for a long overdue nap. The following day Jonas saddles himself a horse with Fan's permission. Rimes and he gallop off into the wilderness. Rimes warns Jonas that the area is rift with 50 box canyons with no way out of them. Nevertheless our wily protagonist finds a fortress of a stone house off in the mountain. This innocuous looking place looks comfortable within and Jonas leads Rimes to an elevator to a cave and an outlet where they catch a ride aboard another train. Collinson and Finch release information in piecemeal fashion to keep us in the dark as long as possible and things slowly come together when Jonas learns about a lawyer named Cullane who has been recently killed. Stealthily Jonas inventories Cullane's office and he runs into Cullane's homicidal sister and later a character named Judge Niland Farley Granger of Strangers on a Train who initially appears to be a good guy. Later we learn that the noble judge isn't so noble and he wants to kill Jonas. Our hero Rimes and Fan are trapped in the stonehouse during the last quarter hour and have to shoot it out with hordes of henchmen while they contend with dynamite being hurled at them and smoke from burning sagebrush. As you can see Collinson refuses to let the action loiter and The Man Called Noon doesn't let up throughout its 98bulletblasting minutes. Richard Crenna is appropriately tightlipped and he displays his prowess with a pistol as he keeps knocking down targets on rooftops and behind doors in the fortress sequence. The Man Called Noon qualifies a hardriding western that doesn't wear out its welcome.".

Oddball cast. Richard Crenna not exactly the most physical of actors is hilariously unbelievable as a tough man of action. Your guess is as good as mine as to how he wins all those fist fights. And he's either bionic or a cousin of Bruce Willis' character in Unbreakable because he survives a couple nasty falls and countless flurries of gunfire with nary a scratch. In fact the villains in this movie have to be the worst shots in the history of film. The more I think about it I'm not sure who or what they were aiming at but it couldn't have been Crenna. There's Stephen Boyd about a decade past his prime drawling and mumbling his way through a turn as some sort of a slippery opportunist the Han Solo role. Actually not a bad performance. And also Farley Granger 20 years or so removed from his fling with matinee idol stardom. He's a more interesting looking actor at this point with graying hair and richer voice but he comes off as all kinds of ridiculous in the big dumb senseless finale. Hard to tell if his acting is much improved with such a poor script.It's also got an inappropriately exuberant music score bad stunt doubling a confusing plot with too many names you never can attach to faces and some gratuitous violence that might have been offensive if it hadn't been so nonsensical.

This film features none other than Richard Crenna as the heroic lead a mysterious gunslinger come to clean up the town suffering from the usual amnesia that makes him slightly vulnerable a trope that was overutilised in this particular genre of filmmaking. I do love Crenna but first and foremost he was a character actor so it's a little unusual to see him as the hero here it's impossible to ignore the fact that he seems miscast. The likes of Stephen Boyd Farley Granger and Patty Shepard play in support. This film is directed by Peter Collinson the director of such movies as THE ITALIAN JOB and STRAIGHT ON TILL MORNING and it's an interesting oddity rather than anything particularly enjoyable. The plot seems longwinded and the outcome obvious but at the same time at least it retains the interest.".

Now I will say that the director manages to pump in a lot of atmosphere into just about every scene and occasionally there is some decent action. However the movie is all the same a tough slog. It is remarkably slow for a European western with the movie remaining at a near standstill for long periods. The screenplay also suffers with the amnesia subplot  not much is done with it and what there is has a strong degree of extreme familiarity. No freshness there. Also there are some strange changes in tone  one scene the movie is trying to be a gritty western and then it suddenly changes into a western with a more epic tone.

My family moved across the Ohio River into Indiana from Kentucky near where this movie was filmed during this same time period of the 1820's and I have family correspondence showing the life of this areas people of the 1820's.I love this movie but then I might be prejudice. It was made in 1954 just before my 12 birthday and my family and I were in it. My brother and I played school kids my dad was a farmer and my mother was one of the ladies on the river boat. I loved being on the set in the Lincoln Village in Rockport Indiana and watching Burt striding around in his period costume. He always acted as if he knew exactly what he was doing. Everybody give Walter lots of room while he got lessons from Lash LaRue an expert bullwhipper from old Hollywood westerns on how to use the bullwhip. He learned some but it was Lash who did the big scenes. Miss Lynn was kind and sweet to all of us kids when we did the schoolroom scenes. John Caradine was always golly and cheerful and seemed to love everybody and what he was doing.I could go on and on. I have tons of behind the scene pictures my dad took a lovely picture of my lovely mother in a beautiful period costume on the boat and a copy of Gabriel's Horn the book from which the movie was taken as well as a copy of the movie.As an adult 53 years later I look at this movie and see a decent true period movie with lessons to be learned that anyone of the 1950's would have enjoyed. Some of the parts could have been cast better but do not judge it by today's standards. Lancaster et al worked hard and stayed true to the times they were portraying and credit is due.".

	schema:headline " Burt Lancaster's Eastern Frontier flick";
	schema:reviewBody "Released in 1955 The Kentuckian is one of only a couple films directed by Burt Lancaster.THE STORY takes place during the presidency of James Monroe circa 1820. Lancaster plays Eli Wakefield a Kentuckian who desires more room to breath in Texas. Still in Kentucky they blow their Texas money on freeing a beautiful indentured servant Hannah Dianne Foster. They don't get past the next frontier town where Eli takes up with his brother in the tobacco business and Hannah gets a job as a bar matron. Eli's dreams of Texas are sidetracked when he meets up with a schoolmarm Diana Lynn who encourages him to settle down and make a family with her. The problem is that Eli's son prefers Hannah and doesn't want to give up their Texas dream. Meanwhile feuders are hot on Eli's trail not to mention malevolent local businessman with a whip Walter Matthau.Some highlights include Lush Eastern locations. The film was shot in Levi Jackson State Park Kentucky near London as well as Owensboro Kentucky which is on the Ohio River and Rockport which is just across the river in Indiana. The river depicted in the film is supposed to be the Tennessee River I think but it was shot on the Ohio. In any event although The Kentuckian is classified as a Western it's actually an Eastern.The film offers a good glimpse of what the Eastern USA was like back when it was still a frontier  the cabinstyled houses sleeping in the woods etc. No internet cable video games DVDs or microwaves. People actually sat down with other people and communed.The story is realistic albeit with some lame dialogue. Regardlessyou don't have to worry about any goofiness or unbelievable bits that plague some 50's Westerns except for the toowoodenthey'refunny feudalists.Back then a huge riverboat coming to town was an exciting attraction. Americans today by contrast get all excited over the shenanigans of some celebrity.Dianne Foster Hannah is a beautiful redhead. One wonders how a woman like this would stay single very long on the frontier.The whip fight with Matthau is great. Lancaster is almost whipped to shreds !.Loyalty is a subtheme here. Eli's son is loyal to Hannah and never warms up to the schoolmarm although there's it's clear that there's nothing wrong with the latter. And Hannah is loyal to the man who delivered her from bondage Eli despite his infatuation with the marm.I liked the bit on Eli being a laughing stock because of a worthless freshwater pearl but he gets the last laugh with a letter from the President or is it? and additional help.Lastly Lancaster is a likable protagonist with his charismatic joyofliving persona he's humble and respectful the antithesis of Eastwood's amoral and lifeless 'man with no name' a decade later.The film runs an hour and 44 minutes.BOTTOM LINE The Kentuckian is breath of fresh air and I enjoyed it from beginning to end for all the above reasons it's sort of like The Last of the Mohicans 1992 of its era albeit no where as good. It's innocuous and easygoing but sometimes surprisingly brutal the dog fight and whip fight. If you can acclimate to the style of filmmaking of the mid50s it's worth checking out.GRADE B".

	schema:headline " When A Wakefield Meets A Fromes";
	schema:reviewBody "In the first of two films Burt Lancaster directs as well as stars he plays the title role of Eli Wakefield who is The Kentuckian. The part of the frontiersman in the James Monroe presidency fits Lancaster's robust personality perfectly. He's very much a combination of both the William Holden and Robert Mitchum characters in Rachel and the Stranger taking the best aspects of both for his portrayal. Like Mitchum he's got 'woodsy' ways and like Holden he aims to see his son grows out of those ways.Just where and how little David McDonald does grow up does concern Lancaster and he does during the course of The Kentuckian reexamine just what it is he wants for himself and his son. He's also got a real problem in the shape of a pair of inbred mountain people called Fromes whose family has feuded with the Wakefields for a couple of generations.Burt's moving west with his boy to get away from the mountain feud so his kid has a chance to grow up and their destination is Texas which the Mexicans had opened up for Yankee settlers eventually to their regret. But he helps a lady in distress in the person of bond servant Dianne Foster and spends his 'Texas' money buying out her contract from Will Wright. So a planned visit with brother John McIntire and sisterinlaw Una Merkel is going to be longer than he thought especially with McIntire wanting to remake Lancaster into a merchant like himself. McIntire also has a wife picked out for him in the person of school teacher Diana Lynn.The film was shot in Owensboro Kentucky and presumably in 1955 there was still enough 'woodsy' territory that it still looked like 1820 frontier America. Director Lancaster got good performances out of his cast which included Walter Matthau making his motion picture debut. Matthau plays a tavern owner and town bully a mean man with a bullwhip who goes after an unarmed Lancaster with one. That scene is really the climax of the film.However the two to watch for here are the Fromes brothers Paul Wexler and Douglas Spencer. They are a pair of evil looking dudes no doubt ancestors of those guys from Deliverance.In a recent biography of Burt Lancaster because of some disparaging comments Lancaster made about directors the Director's Guild first refused to let him direct his own film. Eventually the production company HechtHillLancaster got a waiver from the Guild. I think they wanted to Burt to sweat a little. For him though directing turned out not to be something he wanted to do he got through the film with some difficulty and it was no accident that while he was on the production end Lancaster only directed one other film in his career Midnight Man.The Kentuckian is a good film perfectly suited to Burt Lancaster's athleticism and charisma a must for his fans.".

It's hard to have exciting gunplay though Lancaster makes the best of it.The movie shows early America with all it's provincial warts. The townspeople seem rather cruel to the outsider Lancaster and his son because he's a rube although they're not much better educated themselves. You can easily see these people rushing out to California to look for gold in a few years trampling everything in their path. The backwoodsmen who seek to kill Lancaster are taciturn and singleminded. Exactly the type to carry on a feud for generations.There's no law enforcement in this town so the town bully Mathau does what he likes.An underlying theme is the importance of education and planning ahead. Lancaster turns the tables on the townspeople and gains their respect by using his education and smarts rather than by physical force.Lancaster does manage several fine action scenes and as an actor is quite convincing as an ignorant rube at first and as a pretend rube on the riverboat.I thought the movie paid close attention to period details and speech patterns. It really captured the young USA during it's early expansion period.I liked the inclusion of a musical singalong by the piano especially the lovely tune My Darling.Spoiler If there's a flaw in this movie is the failure of Lancaster to have more of a romance with Diane Foster. It's implied that they'll be together by the end of the movie but they never even kiss.".

Burt Lancaster is great as the boy grown up who wants his son to be free in a free country to take life in big bites as he has done. That events conspire against him is inevitable and the story pulls you along convincingly. The one to watch for is Walter Matthau in a very early role who is a real SOB with a wicked bullwhip. While the dialogue may sound preposterous and stilted this is the way people spoke back in 18th century America and the movie wins on many points. While it is definitely a product of the 50's and feels like it it still rings authentic and heart felt in a way that many other similar movies from the same period simply do not. A cut above and definitely worth the time to seek out and watch.".

Because of this I love films that talk about American history that are unusualnot Westerns or war filmsjust something different. This film is about life 'out west' in the Tennessee area circa 1820a period WAAAY underrepresented in American films...heck it's hardly ever even mentioned! So from the onset I was pretty happy about the setting of this film.Burt Lancaster plays an outdoorsmansort of a Davy Crockett or Daniel Boone sort of fellow. The main difference is that he also has a young son AND doesn't want to abandon him Crockett and Boone should have taken note NOT to do this. The problem however is money. He and his son love the carefree outdoor lifebut it takes money to get to this promised land. In the meantime the two are forced to hang around civilization at least what approximated it out on the frontier. Here in town Lancaster's brother played by John McIntyrea guy who looked nothing like Burt and seemed too old for the part pushed for him to go into business with himand get rid of his buckskin clothes and settle down. In addition two women wanted himthe school teacher who represented domesticity and the indentured servant who believed in his dream. What will happen? Will Burt and son become domesticated and civilized or will they eventually make it to the wide open lands of Texas? Overall this is not one of Burt Lancaster's best acting performances. He's goodbut also pretty unremarkable. But the film is different and reasonably well madeand it's hard to dismiss it. A nice film at least from a history teacher's perspective and well worth seeing.".

	schema:reviewBody "Although The Kentuckian is sometimes described as a Western it is set several decades earlier and a long way further east than most films in the genre. It may seem obvious that first the East and then the Midwest had to be won before Americans could make a start on winning the West but in fact there are relatively few films about frontier life in the early nineteenth century compared with the thousands set in the West during the second half of that century. The explanation I have heard is that the Hollywood studios had on their doorstep the California deserts which could easily represent Texas or Nevada or any one of several other Western states without too many people noticing but nowhere that could convincingly stand in for the deciduous forests of the eastern USA in the same way.The action can be dated by references to the Presidency of James Monroe to the period 181725 and takes place in Kentucky. This does not necessarily follow from the title. The Virginian after all did not take place in Virginia. The main character is Elias Big Eli Wakefield a widowed frontiersman who is considering leaving the state and moving to Texas. His reason for leaving apparently is that Kentucky is becoming too crowded even though in 1820 the state only had about half a million people spread over its 40000 square miles. One thing that is never mentioned in the film is that at this period Texas would have been ruled by either Spain or Mexico perhaps it would have been considered unpatriotic to have stated explicitly that Wakefield is considering emigrating from the USA to a foreign land.Urging Big Eli to leave is his son Little Eli who is looking forward to a life of adventure in Texas. Urging him to stay is his elder brother Zack who hopes that Eli will settle down in Kentucky and join him in his business. A further complication is that two women take a liking to Big Eli indentured servant Hannah who wants to go to Texas to escape from her villainous master Stan Bodine and schoolteacher Susie who wants to stay in Kentucky.Burt Lancaster who also directed also stars as Big Eli but this is not one of his better performances. Indeed most of the acting is not very good. Dianne Foster as Hannah and Diana Lynn as Susie are both dull and Donald MacDonald as Little Eli with his whiny voice and perpetually sulky expression must rank as one of the least appealing screen youngsters ever. Probably the best is Walter Matthau in his first feature film as Bodine played as an American version complete with moustache and bullwhip of the villainous Squire Jasper from a Victorian melodrama.This film was Burt Lancaster's first experience of directing indeed it was the only film on which he acted as sole director. He was also credited as joint director of The Midnight Man made nearly twenty years later. I have often wondered what attracted him to this story. In his later career he was often drawn to complex socially significant movies often ones with a message in line with his own leftwing convictions. There is nothing however complex or significant about The Kentuckian a film with a turgid plot taken from an obscure novel. The gist of the story is Big Eli's indecision about whether he should move house or stay put and even the most experienced and gifted of directors would have struggled to make that particular plot line interesting. There is very little apart from its setting to distinguish this film from dozens of standard Western Bmovies. The one good about the film is that the experience clearly persuaded Lancaster that his future in the film industry lay in the field of acting rather than directing and as a result we were not deprived of all the wonderful performances he was to give over the next three decades. 410".

	schema:reviewBody "A mix of 50's sensibilities and period art the way they could only do it in the 1950s. Lancaster is stiff at times but shines in the riverboat scene and of course handles the on screen fights pretty well. A.B. Guthrie Jr. knows what to put in a frontier story and Matthau McIntire and Carradine act rings around the rest of a fairly lackluster cast. The part of the boy isn't welldirected and only manages to be a fairly sympathetic character. Both Foster and Lynn seemed miscast... Foster was too elegant for the indentured servant role and the Lynn character weak for a frontier schoolmistress. But the story holds together and is worth the watch for fans of Matthau Lancaster or the genre of offbeat 50's westerns. Watch for almost a dozen 'stock' cowboy figures from that era popping in and out of scenes like James Griffith as a perfectly evil riverboat gambler.".

At this site you walk beyond the bridge to a trail take a right to trail two another right and twenty five yards or so you are under sky bridge. From the first short trail to the second there is a drop of about 45 feet. At that point the second trail isn't all that wide and you have to be somewhat careful. Beyond the edge of the trail you see tops of trees. Tall trees. While helping my girlfriend down I saw this guy approaching wearing sweat pants and sweater dark sunglasses and a smile. He had a mop of unruly hair. We continued on toward the bridge and I looked back. He didn't pause at the trail junction he just jumped. Like a cat. As he approached after that athletic move and with a big grin and square jaw I knew I just knew. I told my girlfriend who that was following us and as he passed she asked him...are you Burt Lancaster? He said yes I am and ambled on by. She swooned. He and two other Hollywood types did some thumbs together form a square panning looking at the sky at times. An interesting day out.".

He gets some essential help from bondswoman Hannah in back of the Fromes who takes aim with the rifle of her freshlykilled master Bodine. With only one Frome to deal with now he takes his chance dashing across the very shallow river before his nemesis can reload.Lancaster has dealings with 2 women in particular. Hannah who begins her association with Burt and his halfgrown son as a bondswoman who takes pity on them when the towns people turn hostile toward them. In return Burt uses his money for steamboat passage to Texas to buy out her bondswoman contract. Hannah decides to leave this town with the Wakefields when they break out of jail. They head for another village where lives brother Zack who's making a living as a tobacco grower and trader. Zack welcomes the 3 giving Burt odd jobs toward regaining his funds for the Texas trip. Early on Burt thinks he may have found his fortune in a sizable pearl found in a mussel. The locals encourage him to inquire whether President Monroe might be interested in such knowing it's worthless commercially. Eventually Hannah sells herself as a bondswoman to tavernkeeper Bodine to provide money for the Wakefield's journey onward. Meanwhile Burt has taken a fancy to the village schoolteacher Susie and she to him. Brother Zack encourages him to forget his Texas dream and settle down in that village with Susie who has no desire to go to Texas. Burt swallows this bait for a while but the captain of the Texas steamer tries to convince him that he's a natural frontiersman not psychologically suited to planting his feet in a settled village. Besides he's not yet out of the range of the two murderous Fromes who eventually show up as I previously detailed. This coupled with Hannah's heroics against the Fromes and the death of her master causes Burt to rethink his life plans.This littleknown western certainly rates a look with many details I didn't mention.

James Monroe is president and Burt Lancaster is a freedomloving woodsman who takes his son MacDonald and heads for the river town where they will say hello to Lancaster's big brother McIntire and his wife Una Merkel. Along the way they pick up a young lady Foster and meet a friendly school teacher Lynn.Well while they's awaiting' for the river steamer ol' Burt soon has two wimmen amoonin' after him  one a indentured servant gal and the other a purty school ma'rm alooking for a husband to go with her house. I shore hope I spelled indentured wright. Don't know what it means though. Maybe it means she got all her teeth. Sounds good for ol' Burt but it ain't so hot. I oncet had FIVE gals amoonin' after ME and they was all purty too. Well we done heard the chimes at midnight more'n oncet and one night when we was pieeyed there was all SIX of us abaying at the moon like Burt's huntin' dog Pharaoh. The voices tell me to do things like this.The problem is that Burt has spent all their Texas money to free Foster from bondage. Now he has to go to work for his brother McIntire and his boy has to go to school and learn something. I'll turn him into a businessman says wellmeaning McIntire and I'll wear that buckskin right off him and OUT of him. This is not Burt's idea of a good time. He likes to lie out in the woods with his boy on a prime night and chase a fox or two with Pharaoh. The unspeakable in pursuit of the inedible. The two of them yearn for the open skies of Texas where the air tastes like it's never been breathed before. Aside from not having any money there's another problem or two that need facing. Kentucky is a country of feuding clans and one scabrous clan is on Burt's tail. Another is the local mean guy who runs a saloon and wields a great big whip  Walter Matthau if you can believe it. On top of that McIntire's wife begins to scold them for their backwood ways. She kicks the dog off the couch and nags Burt and his boy which is beginning to sound painfully like my marriage.Two outstanding scenes for a warm and ordinary family movie Burt and son playing rich hicks for riverboat gamblers and then turning the roulette wheel on them a really NASTY fight between the sadistic and dirtyfighting Matthau and the proud and indefatigable Burt. Burt is whipped to tatters but guess who is knocked out.Very nice photography by Ernest Lazslo and a subtle score without a whistleable tune in it from Bernard Herrmann. Burt's direction is functional without being distinctive. It's not a bad movie. It's a warm family drama with a little romance and violence to spice it up.".

I oncet had FIVE gals amoonin' after ME and they was all purty too. Well we done heard the chimes at midnight more'n oncet and one night when we was pieeyed there was all SIX of us abaying at the moon like Burt's huntin' dog Pharaoh. The voices tell me to do things like this.The problem is that Burt has spent all their Texas money to free Foster from bondage. Now he has to go to work for his brother McIntire and his boy has to go to school and learn something. I'll turn him into a businessman says wellmeaning McIntire and I'll wear that buckskin right off him and OUT of him. This is not Burt's idea of a good time. He likes to lie out in the woods with his boy on a prime night and chase a fox or two with Pharaoh. The unspeakable in pursuit of the inedible. The two of them yearn for the open skies of Texas where the air tastes like it's never been breathed before. Aside from not having any money there's another problem or two that need facing. Kentucky is a country of feuding clans and one scabrous clan is on Burt's tail. Another is the local mean guy who runs a saloon and wields a great big whip  Walter Matthau if you can believe it. On top of that McIntire's wife begins to scold them for their backwood ways. She kicks the dog off the couch and nags Burt and his boy which is beginning to sound painfully like my marriage.Two outstanding scenes for a warm and ordinary family movie Burt and son playing rich hicks for riverboat gamblers and then turning the roulette wheel on them a really NASTY fight between the sadistic and dirtyfighting Matthau and the proud and indefatigable Burt. Burt is whipped to tatters but guess who is knocked out.Very nice photography by Ernest Lazslo and a subtle score without a whistleable tune in it from Bernard Herrmann. Burt's direction is functional without being distinctive. It's not a bad movie. It's a warm family drama with a little romance and violence to spice it up.";

Quite apart from being a good thriller director Bo Widerberg brings twists and slants to what would otherwise be the sort of film that we've seen a hundred times. Although a buddybuddy movie J  J's relationship is constructed backtofront. Instead of going from 'chalk  cheese' to reconciled dreamteam they begin as good friends with implicit trust between them as colleagues but the events of the film put this under strain. As a corollary there is no neat ending. There are some good moments of humour as American and Swedish culture brush up against each other but the greatest departure from the standard is the insight into Johansson's personal life. Occupying no more than a few minutes screen time we see the result of his marriage breakup. The scene where he attempts to recapture his relationship with his son is almost painful and his furtive eye contact with another metro traveler is nicely captured. In fact these brief interludes convey more about the loneliness of a failed relationship than many an entire film. Overall they add a rare depth to this genre. Add to this a great carchase and the technique of putting a rear facing roadpointing camera on the front of a car which brilliantly conveys menace.There is also a welldeveloped sense of place with all the action set in a wintry Stockholm and it's environs. While we see the city's underbelly downandouts winos criminals alienated youth it is still an affectionate portrait. Twenty years on there are some nonP.C. moments as when a suspect is recognised partly as he is seems to be the only foreignlooking person in Stockholm. The ending can also be criticised for leaving a feeling that the ball is still in the air but this is largely because we cinemagoers are so used to complete resolution.This is the sort of film that should be made more often.

This is one of them although you might have had to have experienced Sweden in the 1980s to get the full impacct  and not to find some of the subplots or plot points improbable. The reality behind the movie as eloquently elaborated on in Call Girl 2012 starring Pernilla August was actually even uglier and the author of the book  criminology professor and police expert Leif GW Persson  this movie is based on had a pivotal role himself in the reallife scandal. This paves the way for a great deal of authenticity and the director Bo Widerberg pours all of his considerable talent into establishing that even further  yes life really was that bleak and the score actually sounds like the way it all looked and felt.

This is one of them although you might have had to have experienced Sweden in the 1980s to get the full impacct  and not to find some of the subplots or plot points improbable. The reality behind the movie as eloquently elaborated on in Call Girl 2012 starring Pernilla August was actually even uglier and the author of the book  criminology professor and police expert Leif GW Persson  this movie is based on had a pivotal role himself in the reallife scandal. This paves the way for a great deal of authenticity and the director Bo Widerberg pours all of his considerable talent into establishing that even further  yes life really was that bleak and the score actually sounds like the way it all looked and felt.

In my opinion the result is absolutely great and I am sure Bend of the RiverThe Naked Spur and The Far Country would have benefited from it. Nowadays with the LCD Plasma and Widescreen TVs we can definitely agree that time proved that the widescreen was there to stay.

Stewart is the man that comes looking for the person responsible for the killing of his brother. His quest is going to bother many people and he is in for a lot of violence very similar to The Violent Men made in the same year and also in Cinemascope. Mann wanted to make a western about King Lear which he never did but it was not this one although you can feel he was toying with the idea.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Man from Laramie 1955You have a right to expect a movie starring James Stewart directed by Anthony Mann and photographed by Charles Lang to be spectacular. And it is. This is one of the first full wide screen Technicolor movies and it's one drawback might be that it is trying to apply a new format to an old and slightly tired genre. The fact it rises above its familiarity is to Stewart's credit and Mann's. Lang who photographed an extraordinary number of great black and white films trades stately perfect color and design for pure drama and intensity which are very different things but it gives a full backdrop to the high drama here.This is a beautiful movie for sure in its restrained way. The fact that it's restrained when the whole world is gaping for surging new big color movies is a small miracle in itself. Mann did a number of westerns for which he's most known and a few other genre pics but first made his name as a film minor film noir director. He seems to carry over enough of the edginess and cruelty of those noirs to make his Westerns exciting rather than epic which is a good thing. He and Stewart worked together on five westerns and they have taken on a life of their own and a feeling of their own that's impressive once you click into it. One of the best noir elements to the story which was not written by Mann is the feeling of the lone man against the world a great theme.The key woman lead is a clich the widow hanging on against the odds in town. In this case she is a charming but slightly miscast Cathy O'Donnell a favorite of mine who takes demur and innocent to the heights. You see from the outset that this widow and Stewart's good hard working character are destined for some kind of meeting of destinies.

It's all great stuff in the Western mold. One fight is right in the middle of a mooing herd of cattle and it's pretty fun. You do wonder sometime at the possibility of a super nice guy sticking it out against all these obstacles and I mean obstacles. The domineering and sometimes evil family led by Donald Crisp with the always impressive Arthur Kennedy as the chief hand seems like more than a man could handle.

	onyx:emotionText "The Man from Laramie 1955You have a right to expect a movie starring James Stewart directed by Anthony Mann and photographed by Charles Lang to be spectacular. And it is. This is one of the first full wide screen Technicolor movies and it's one drawback might be that it is trying to apply a new format to an old and slightly tired genre. The fact it rises above its familiarity is to Stewart's credit and Mann's. Lang who photographed an extraordinary number of great black and white films trades stately perfect color and design for pure drama and intensity which are very different things but it gives a full backdrop to the high drama here.This is a beautiful movie for sure in its restrained way. The fact that it's restrained when the whole world is gaping for surging new big color movies is a small miracle in itself. Mann did a number of westerns for which he's most known and a few other genre pics but first made his name as a film minor film noir director. He seems to carry over enough of the edginess and cruelty of those noirs to make his Westerns exciting rather than epic which is a good thing. He and Stewart worked together on five westerns and they have taken on a life of their own and a feeling of their own that's impressive once you click into it. One of the best noir elements to the story which was not written by Mann is the feeling of the lone man against the world a great theme.The key woman lead is a clich the widow hanging on against the odds in town. In this case she is a charming but slightly miscast Cathy O'Donnell a favorite of mine who takes demur and innocent to the heights. You see from the outset that this widow and Stewart's good hard working character are destined for some kind of meeting of destinies. And there are inevitable clichs too that you might get used tothe stoic Indians the older woman as tough as nails and a gem of a role a patriarch with a thoughtful wise look that shows counteracting wisdom and fistfights in the dust. It's all great stuff in the Western mold. One fight is right in the middle of a mooing herd of cattle and it's pretty fun.

	schema:headline " Good movie but too many plot inconsistencies";
	schema:reviewBody "This is an very good Western. It may be a little underrated because it is generally known as the worst of the three MannStewart Westerns. I thought it was at least as good as Winchester '73 and Naked Spur.Here are a list of positivesThe acting is very good. Stewart is his usual fabulous presence. Arthur Kennedy is solid. There are also some other fine supporting performances. The only exception is Alex Nicol playing the heavy. This was overdone both the character and the acting.The basic plot is pretty compelling at least through the first half of the movie.It looks like it was filmed almost entirely on location.There was a very short but excellent scene where a Mexican friar explains that the Pueblo Indians in the town of Coronado are traditionally peaceful cliff dwellers and fundamentally different in nature from the nomadic Apaches. Rare historically accurate and sophisticated insight from a Western of this era.Now here are the negativesThe movies suffers from numerous fundamental plotfeasibility issues.1 Lockhart is a U.S. Army calvary captain who has gone undercover posing as the leader of a supply wagon train it's unsaid  but that's how they got through Apache country. They had an Army escort. However he hardly acts like a spy pretty much spilling his guts about his mission whenever given a chance. If he was smart enough to come up with the ruse of pretending to be a civilian surely he could have been a little more clever in rooting out the bad guys. Like maybe pretend he wanted to buy some repeating rifles? Just sayin'. 2 More on Lockhart's preposterous ineptitude as a spy. When the town drunk Jack Elam offers to sell him any information he wants Lockhart shoos him off. Real smart.3 Why was he loading up his wagons with salt? Didn't he come to stay?4 Some other user reviews felt that it was not explained in the movie why the drunk later tries to kill Lockhart. I thought it was made clear that the Indian paid the drunk to kill him then the Indian killed the drunk in order to shut him up. The Indian was put up to this by either Vic and Dave or the Indian gun buyers themselves. Remember Lockhart coughed up the reason for his secret mission to the Indian the minute he rode into town.5 After being hired by Kate Canady Lockhart immediately rides onto the property of the Waggoman ranch in order to cut out stray Half Moon Ranch stock. This doesn't sound like such a critical task that Lockhart should be taking that kind of risk considering that Dave Waggoman wants to kill him. Good idea to go alone too huh? Why not leave your gun behind and paint a bullseye on your back while you're at it?6 It's difficult to understand the motivations of Vic and Dave in selling guns to the Indians. It's clearly not necessary they already control most of the territory. We have to assume that this was crazy Dave's idea  an irrational attempt to emulate the former ruthlessness of his father. It's completely out of character for Vic to be complicit with Dave in this activity.7 Once the guns are revealed Vic'c character is handled irrationally for the rest of the movie. The logic of the script says that his actions are tragic and sympathetic i.e. he clearly does not intend to kill Dave and hurts the old man by accident. To this point in the story Vic is a Job figure a decent guy whose life has been destroyed by accidental external forces. Yet for the rest of the movie he is cast as a legitimate villain justifiably killed by the Indians thereby indirectly avenging the death of Lockhart's brother and remembered by the old man forever as the dirty snake who killed his faultless son. This inexplicable about face in the script is grossly unfair to Vic.8 And while we're on the subject how can Lockhart be so darkly obsessed with avenging his brother's death and hold absolutely no malice toward the Apaches who actually killed him. It's ENTIRELY the fault of Vic who was no doubt forced or coerced into selling the guns anyway by crazy Dave.9 There was no way that wagon load of guns falling off the cliff damaged the majority of the rifles. The Indians surely could have collected them at the bottom of the hill.10 The finale scene where Vic Lockhart and the Indians all show up at the rifle scene at exactly the same time is a preposterous coincidence11 And one last thing just how did Lockhart get down from that cliff at the end of the movie without the Indians noticing?In summary Man From Laramie has good acting good locations and a solid interesting plot set up but the conclusion is contrived. Plot elements and scenes are just slapped together to produce the climatic scenes Mann is looking for. The story has no integrity.

	onyx:emotionText "This is an very good Western. It may be a little underrated because it is generally known as the worst of the three MannStewart Westerns. I thought it was at least as good as Winchester '73 and Naked Spur.Here are a list of positivesThe acting is very good. Stewart is his usual fabulous presence. Arthur Kennedy is solid. There are also some other fine supporting performances. The only exception is Alex Nicol playing the heavy. This was overdone both the character and the acting.The basic plot is pretty compelling at least through the first half of the movie.It looks like it was filmed almost entirely on location.There was a very short but excellent scene where a Mexican friar explains that the Pueblo Indians in the town of Coronado are traditionally peaceful cliff dwellers and fundamentally different in nature from the nomadic Apaches. Rare historically accurate and sophisticated insight from a Western of this era.Now here are the negativesThe movies suffers from numerous fundamental plotfeasibility issues.1 Lockhart is a U.S. Army calvary captain who has gone undercover posing as the leader of a supply wagon train it's unsaid  but that's how they got through Apache country. They had an Army escort. However he hardly acts like a spy pretty much spilling his guts about his mission whenever given a chance. If he was smart enough to come up with the ruse of pretending to be a civilian surely he could have been a little more clever in rooting out the bad guys. Like maybe pretend he wanted to buy some repeating rifles? Just sayin'. 2 More on Lockhart's preposterous ineptitude as a spy. When the town drunk Jack Elam offers to sell him any information he wants Lockhart shoos him off. Real smart.3 Why was he loading up his wagons with salt? Didn't he come to stay?4 Some other user reviews felt that it was not explained in the movie why the drunk later tries to kill Lockhart. I thought it was made clear that the Indian paid the drunk to kill him then the Indian killed the drunk in order to shut him up. The Indian was put up to this by either Vic and Dave or the Indian gun buyers themselves. Remember Lockhart coughed up the reason for his secret mission to the Indian the minute he rode into town.5 After being hired by Kate Canady Lockhart immediately rides onto the property of the Waggoman ranch in order to cut out stray Half Moon Ranch stock. This doesn't sound like such a critical task that Lockhart should be taking that kind of risk considering that Dave Waggoman wants to kill him. Good idea to go alone too huh? Why not leave your gun behind and paint a bullseye on your back while you're at it?6 It's difficult to understand the motivations of Vic and Dave in selling guns to the Indians. It's clearly not necessary they already control most of the territory. We have to assume that this was crazy Dave's idea  an irrational attempt to emulate the former ruthlessness of his father. It's completely out of character for Vic to be complicit with Dave in this activity.7 Once the guns are revealed Vic'c character is handled irrationally for the rest of the movie. The logic of the script says that his actions are tragic and sympathetic i.e. he clearly does not intend to kill Dave and hurts the old man by accident. To this point in the story Vic is a Job figure a decent guy whose life has been destroyed by accidental external forces. Yet for the rest of the movie he is cast as a legitimate villain justifiably killed by the Indians thereby indirectly avenging the death of Lockhart's brother and remembered by the old man forever as the dirty snake who killed his faultless son. This inexplicable about face in the script is grossly unfair to Vic.8 And while we're on the subject how can Lockhart be so darkly obsessed with avenging his brother's death and hold absolutely no malice toward the Apaches who actually killed him. It's ENTIRELY the fault of Vic who was no doubt forced or coerced into selling the guns anyway by crazy Dave.9 There was no way that wagon load of guns falling off the cliff damaged the majority of the rifles. The Indians surely could have collected them at the bottom of the hill.10 The finale scene where Vic Lockhart and the Indians all show up at the rifle scene at exactly the same time is a preposterous coincidence11 And one last thing just how did Lockhart get down from that cliff at the end of the movie without the Indians noticing?In summary Man From Laramie has good acting good locations and a solid interesting plot set up but the conclusion is contrived. Plot elements and scenes are just slapped together to produce the climatic scenes Mann is looking for. The story has no integrity. The other parts of the movie aren't strong enough to compensate for the numerous glaring flaws.";

It captures the bigness of the western landscape which is a plus in this film based on ranching. Other westerns Eastwood's miningbased film Pale Rider for example really don't need vast sweeping landscapes.The acting direction production values are all very good. The musical score is dated and not great but at least it has a western theme.There is one oddity you might notice about the female characters. The contrast between how the Aline McMahon and the Cathy O'Donnell parts are developed is extreme. McMahon is fortunate to have a great role but O'Donnell's role is underdeveloped and kind of empty.

And it is also the end of a great team that made eight classic western. I'm speaking about the director Anthony Mann and the beautiful actor James Stewart. In this movie Stewart plays the role of Lockhart a former captain of the USA army searching for the men who sold guns to the Indians that slaughtered a cavalry column in which Lockhart's brother was in. It's interesting to see that Lockhart doesn't blame the Indians in the first place but the white men that sold the guns to them. This is a typical view of modern western the pure Indians against the crooked white men. In that search Lockhart goes to a town named Coronado where he rapidly begins a fight with the Waggoman the landlords of the city and rich ranchers. The characters of Alec Waggoman his son Dave and Vic Hansbro a kind of adoptive son of Alec are so much interesting each one with his own motivations some density and in the end it's Vic who we would think is more just and flexible who reveals the worst. Nevertheless all these characters behave in a manner that is determined by their interactions and not gratuitously as in many movies. The weakest point of the film in my opinion is the irrelevance of the feminine characters which are completely superfluous for the plot and the movie itself. Another negative point but this time it's not the movie's fault I saw the movie on TV and could not benefit of the fantastic CinemaScope. This is one of the first western filmed in CinemaScope and uses the widescreen technology to put to evidence the magnificence of the landscape and the power of this emotive drama becoming an example of western seen as an epic art form of America. Finally I would like to detach the work of James Stewart Arthur Kennedy e Donald Crisp.".

MannStewart westerns usually don't include the rich landowner type of storyline and usually don't take place in town or not for long. The big ranch western and the town western are hardly ever as interesting to me as the ones that take you on an adventure across open country. Maybe because the former type tend to be dramas rather than actionadventures.I think this is the only MannStewart western where you'll see characters drinking their coffee out of china cups and saucers or was I imagining that?. And though there's the usual shocking violence it somehow seems tacked on for effect rather than organic.The cast and direction are really great  I guess I'm not as crazy about the situations or the setting.".

	onyx:emotionText "This final MannStewart western seemed to be a kind of pastiche of elements from their previous ones  including just off the top of my head the grizzled old sidekick Wallace Ford instead of Walter Brennan or Millard Mitchell the violent psycho Alex Nicol instead of Dan Duryea Stewart being physically abused and Arthur Kennedy costarring again Bend Of the River.On the other hand it's very different. MannStewart westerns usually don't include the rich landowner type of storyline and usually don't take place in town or not for long. The big ranch western and the town western are hardly ever as interesting to me as the ones that take you on an adventure across open country. Maybe because the former type tend to be dramas rather than actionadventures.I think this is the only MannStewart western where you'll see characters drinking their coffee out of china cups and saucers or was I imagining that?. And though there's the usual shocking violence it somehow seems tacked on for effect rather than organic.The cast and direction are really great  I guess I'm not as crazy about the situations or the setting.";

	schema:reviewBody "I'm a big fan of the Anthony Manndirected James Stewartstarring Westerns from the early 1950's and have said before that this series of films represented a more than worthy successor to John Ford's legacy from the 30's and 40's. Indeed for me in many ways Mann's films take the genre to an even higher level not least his stunning use of colour cinematography and his use of the superb Stewart a far more interesting and complex never mind less wooden performer than Ford's amanuensis John Wayne. Both these attributes are much to the fore in this particular movie but this time I felt slightly let down by some underpar support acting and a not wholly consistent narrative plot. Taking these points in turn I wasn't engaged sufficiently for example by Alex Nicol in a key role as the head rancher's spoilt and sadistic son  for me this part should have been played with much more edge and brio I could visualise the sometimes maligned Victor Mature making much more of the part for example and also wasn't greatly moved by Cathy O'Donnell either as Stewart's slightly plainlooking belated love interest. She lacks depth and fails to create a believable chemistry with him throughout. Perhaps that's why he rides away at the end without her in tow which only serves to make the depiction of her awakening feelings seem all the more contrived. Which leads me to the weaknesses in the plotting and characterisation. The way the story develops it seems altogether inconsistent that Arthur Kennedy as Vic the adopted son and right hand man of old man Waggoman what kind of name is that? who we see repeatedly in the first half acting as reasoning peacemaker between father and son and son and Stewart should later be shown to be too cowardly to admit to killing Nicol  Dave in selfdefence especially after the former has callously wounded a defenceless Stewart. By the end of the movie he Vic seems to be taking the blame too for supplying the Apache guns which were used to kill Stewart's cavalryofficer brother and hence the latter's reason for coming to town in the first place as well as coldheartedly running out on O'Donnell at the same time. There's also a not fully or satisfactorily explained murder of a local blackmailer Jack Elam and the periodic insertion of a taciturn Red Indian assistant at O'Donnell's store who seems to serve no material purpose at all. The Leartype plot old Waggoman even goes blind at the conclusion is noble in intent but for me just too convoluted in execution to cover the various plotholes. That said Stewart is excellent in his part as the crusading idealistic but still ornery Lockhart and he as usual is worth watching on his own. I also liked Arthur Kennedy's expressive acting in a confusedlywritten part. Mann's direction has some real highspots a forwardtracking shot of Stewart advancing forward to confront young Waggoman in town and some great nighttime shots of Vic in pursuit of same ghost riders in the sky indeed but all told while wonderful to behold tighter scripting would have better served the final outcome here.".

Although the journalists in Kane said otherwise they were never seeing who he was rather what he was like ie. his behaviour how others perceived him etc. Here we have something broader examining a man confronting society confronting his friends and confronting himself all at the same time. Newspaper journalism tells us what something is like. Good documentary strives to really define what or who something was.This is a highly intelligent structure moreso than his previous works and moreso even than Kane. As a meditation on filmmaking it moves gracefully from the shots captured by Agniezcka's cinematographer and the shots of Wajda himself forcing us to draw parallels.It's a shame Wajda remains largely unknown.

She is trying to find Birkut a popular figure that vanished without any explanation and she'll try to discover what happened with this mythic figure.

But wait! The ending of this journey appears in Man of Iron 1981 also directed by the great Andrzej Wajda. Man of Marble term that refers to the propagandistic marble statues made in Birkut's image is a powerful and brilliant story about the importance of past in the lives of everyone it's the thing that makes us look for the future with better eyes and in the film we are constantly dragged down to it in order to get some answers about Birkut's future Is he alive? Is he dead? Why he disappeared? Not just that it is a great accomplish in showing how documentaries are made both the protagonist work but the ones made up by the government where Birkut and his friends were trained to appear important in front of camera. And of course a political and historical background that reveals many things about Poland and how strict the society were back in the 1950's and even in the 1970's with an absolute control on everything filmed said and all. Unique in many senses Man of Marble present us the sad reality of Communism with masked realities where everything presented as good but in the surface it wasn't all good and Birkut realizes that after a painful incident and after the suspicion that his friend was a spy something that he never agreed and that made him fight with the ones who put him on a good position among people the government.It is a well made film with terrific performances by the cast and a magnificent screenplay that knows how to evoke many times many periods of Poland without being confusing something that was problematic in its sequel everything works fine.

	schema:reviewBody "When I saw this film I was very shocked at how subversive the content was. While it was filmed in Poland during the Sovietdominated era the film focused on a fictional character's rise and fall in local government. Mateusz Birkut is an ordinary Polish bricklayer working on a massive government project. A film maker decides to stage a propaganda stunt to see if a new record for speed bricklaying could be set. Birkut agrees to give it a try along with his crew. Not only did they meet their goal but they exceeded itand it was all captured on film to be shown to the masses. Overnight Birkut becomes a minor celebrity and he is given a nice job working for local government. And for some reason over the years his name is just about completely forgotten.Now over 20 years later a young film maker has stumbled upon Birkut's name and some of the newsreel footage but she is really curious how he went from hero to nobody so quickly. She spends most of the film reviewing old film clips and tracking down those who knew Birkut to find out WHY. However repeatedly she is told to mind her own business and lots of roadblocks are thrown in her path. Finally after exhaustive work and putting herself out on a limb politically she finds out how the repressive government worked during the Stalin yearstaking a hero and eventually jailing him as a political prisoner and then erasing memories of his existence. Repeatedly she is warned to let the matter drop as even in the postStalin era it wasn't exactly a free country. How this very critical film ever got made it beyond me but it's wonderfully made and captivating.".

	schema:reviewBody "I came to this film after having watched Wajda's Ashes and Diamonds which I consider to be one of the finest films I have seen. However Man of Marble was just too quirky for me leaving me a bit perplexed. The story concerns a young film student known here only as Agnieszka who decides to produce a documentary on one Mateusz Birkut as her graduation project. Birkut was an idealistic bricklayer who rose to the status of postWWII hero by way of displaying superior efficiency and strength. His innovation of how to use a small team to accomplish improved production came to be so well recognized that he would tour the country setting up such teams. The film timeslices from the 1970s when Agnieszka is making her film to previous times all the way back to mock documentary footage of Birkut in the 1950s. The presentation is anything but flattering to the Communist Party and it is astounding the Wajda was able to get this made in a time when the Communists were still in power in Poland. The story must be autobiographical to some extent since we see Agnieszka encountering political opposition to her digging too deeply into the past trying to reconstruct Birkut's life and figure out why he essentially dropped from the scene after having been so highly visible there is also a famous film director in the movie whom we get to know well.There are many scenes that had the quality of a dream but yet seemed like they were supposed to be taken for real. For example one scene has Burkit's friend Witek going into a small office of a party boss and when Burkit enters the office some time later there is no sign of Witek. If this were to be taken as some sort of Kafkaesque event then Burkit would have made no remark on the mysterious disappearance but he express the surprise that any normal person would have. I did not know what to make of such scenes. Agnieszka's facial expressions and body movements are often quite odd bordering on the bizarre and they accentuated the feeling of unreality I had that became increasingly more pronounced as the movie progressed.The collage of Agnieszka's interviews mock documentary footage scenes from Burkit's life scenes from Agnieszka's own life and an inappropriate musical score did not coalesce for me.".

However if on the one level wecan see her rejecting the father figure on the second level we can witness desire as the film maker is practically possessing the hero statue which she finds in a basement of a museum.Well basically the catch of the movie is the intertwine of the story with the girl on the way of her desire and the political level which makes this trip also a trip of a historical clearing up. And in the strange development of we find that the fake hero is in fact an authentic one and that we did know the secret of the narrative  the herothe father the phallus of the propaganda is the true hero as he had to face real tough moral problems and he lived the life in truth .

	schema:reviewBody "In my recent reviews of the Defa films about the life of Karl Liebknecht I pointed out that the textbook Bolshevist character is revolutionary and selfsacrificing willing to exploit itself for the benefit of society. It chanced that I have just seen the Polish film Man of Marble which elaborates on just this subject. Hence I enjoyed the film even though the message in the narrative is rather vague. The story plays in the late seventies. The leading thread is a film project that is meant to finish the studies of Agnieszka one of the main characters. She decides to make a commentary on the former lead worker Mateusz Birkut who rose to extreme popularity in the fifties. Then in the aftermath of Stalinism he was discredited and put in prison apparently simply because he became a bit of a nuisance  like so many others. Agnieszkas project is not welcomed by the authorities because it reopens old wounds. However they do provide her with the means to start the project a camera crew of three people. As the story unfolds Agnieszka turns out to be a typical newshawk intrusive chasing great material without much respect for other peoples feelings. In a chain of interviews the old companions tell about their part in Birkuts career. I don't know if it is intended but my sympathy went mainly to those characters people who were less fortunate than Birkut and nonetheless managed to do something useful with their lives. Birkut starts as a brick layer. He participates in a propaganda project that aims to boost productivity in building. It uses the division of labor and the mechanic motion that in the west is called Taylorism. Birkut is launched as a celebrity a working class hero and enjoys all the privileges. Many former colleagues get a dislike for him since he pushes up their norms. At the same time the authorities get tired of Birkuts mediation for fellow workersand try to put him on the sidelines. Birkut ignores the warning signals and is eventually convicted and imprisoned for four years. In the postStalin era he is rehabilitated but due to his embitterment he remains an outcast. After all these years Agnieszka is unable to track him down but she finds his son Maciej Tomczyk Birkut never really married and later abandoned his girlfriend. Maciej tells that Birkut has passed away. In the sequel Man of Iron we learn that he was actually shot during a workers' upsurge. As said above the film message is mixed. Birkut is not a man of high morals but a victim of the system. The increase of labor productivity is a common goal in all economies no matter what their ideologies may be. In capitalism the driving force is extra pay or in times of large unemployment the competition between the workers. In the Bolshevist states the workers were supposed to voluntarily exploit themselves. Solshenitsyn once told a story that just after the revolution the propaganda drove some simple minds to actually work themselves to death. Later productivity was stimulated by giving social rewards for excellent achievements the famous surpassing of the planned task in the form of marks of honor often to a collective or enterprise. Workers ethics in Japan have also been mentally unhealthy. You need trade unions to provide for a counterbalance and this is in fact the subject of the sequel film Man of Iron. In my opinion the film is not antiBolshevist  and it was financed by the state. It just calls for better balances in the social power distribution within the system. Probably there are lots of hidden meanings in the film. For instance Birkut burns his fingers after subversive elements have heated one of his bricks which is quite funny. From then on Birkut wears gloves. And a fellow worker of Birkut enters the office of a party bureaucrat and never returns even though there is no other exit. The legs of Agnieszka move in all directions you will not see this behavior with for instance Julia Roberts. This category of social films is just my cup of tea so if you like the type I suggest that you read my other reviews.".

	schema:reviewBody "In 1976 a young woman in Krakow is making her diploma film looking behind the scenes at the life of a 1950s bricklayer Birkut who was briefly a proletariat hero at how that heroism was created and what became of him. She gets hold of outtakes and censored footage and interviews the man's friends exwife and the filmmaker who made him a hero.What is to be said about this film? Some say it is anticommunist but is that really fair? At most it could be said to be antiStalinist which isn't really the same thing when you get down to it. And because one idealist has faded to obscurity does that put a shadow over the whole movement? The idea is interesting and of course has some historical parallels but I can't say it ever fully got my attention and would not be one of my favorite Polish films. I would much more have enjoyed an exposition of a real person rather than some fictional creation.".

	onyx:emotionText "In 1976 a young woman in Krakow is making her diploma film looking behind the scenes at the life of a 1950s bricklayer Birkut who was briefly a proletariat hero at how that heroism was created and what became of him. She gets hold of outtakes and censored footage and interviews the man's friends exwife and the filmmaker who made him a hero.What is to be said about this film? Some say it is anticommunist but is that really fair? At most it could be said to be antiStalinist which isn't really the same thing when you get down to it. And because one idealist has faded to obscurity does that put a shadow over the whole movement? The idea is interesting and of course has some historical parallels but I can't say it ever fully got my attention and would not be one of my favorite Polish films. I would much more have enjoyed an exposition of a real person rather than some fictional creation.";

Basically young filmmaker Agnieszka Krystyna Janda is making her diploma film she decides to focus it on the 1950s the Stakhanovite movement and the man who became a symbol of an overachieving worker in Nowa Huta heroic Polish bricklayer Mateusz Birkut Jerzy Radziwiowicz. From stock footage including outtakes and censored footage in the archives interviews with some people who knew the propagandist including his exwife his friends the filmmaker who helped him become a hero to the people and the marble statue of the man found beneath ground she chronicles Birkut's life. We see the life of Birkut in flashbacks including his early beginnings his fall from grace and his rise to become a hero during the workers' revolution to the people with his multiple brick laying in building housing but noone knows what has happened to him. But Agnieszka's harddriving style and content for her film are causing concern for the authorities and unnerving her supervisor they think the student is digging in too deep to recent history the supervisor kills the project claiming it is over budget her footage and equipment are confiscated. Agnieszka's father suggests there is a single specific reason the authorities do not want the film to be completed and released so following her seeing more footage found and the advice she takes some equipment and goes to find Birkut for herself and ask him questions even if she is not involved in the making of the film in the end she does find Birkut's son Maciej Tomczyk also Radziwilowicz in the Gdask Shipyard he tells her that his father died years ago. Also starring Tadeusz Lomnicki as Jerzy Burski Jacek Lomnicki as Young Burski and Michal Tarkowski as Wincenty Witek. I am not sure I know fully why this film was withheld for four years but it works as both a pseudodocumentary and a thriller of sorts with a filmmaker going into places she shouldn't go and seeing the origins of the man she is trying to find out about I admit there were some slow spots but all together it is an interesting drama. Very good!".

I wonder how this was ever released in Poland at the time and the scenes in the film where I felt Wajda really did succeed as a director is where he contrasts Soviet propaganda with the actual events very powerful. Wajda fails more than he succeeds with this particular film though it's a disjointed narrative and it takes tremendous skill to keep the audience interested in both stories. Sure one may argue that Man of Marble isn't intended as entertainment but even in the context of arthouse cinema this film is only engaging in parts with Agnieszka's attempt to make this film ending up far more interesting than the film she's making.I can see where Wajda is going with the way he shot this film but it just doesn't work very well and the score for this film has to be one of the worst matches I've ever come across.

ROBO MAN as it is known on the video box is a pretty strange affair. It is actually more psychological cat and mouse game than anything else with the poor metalheaded guy caught in the middle. The movie intercuts scenes of Gould trying to pick the metal man's brain to find out if he is who he says he iswas with scenes of Trevor Howard appearing to brainwash the same guy at an earlier date. The intriguing notion is that Gould has such respect for the ability of his perceived enemy Howard that NOTHING the metal man says will prove who he is to Gould. I left the movie uncertain whether Gould's stubbornness helped or harmed humanity.Also it may have been intentional but Gould acts more robotlike than Mr. Metalhead. The performance of Metaldude is actually quite affecting. Kudos to Joe Bova.".

	schema:headline " Very unusual paranoia thriller probably TOO lowkey for its own good though the plot is undoubtedly thoughtprovoking.";
	schema:reviewBody "Who? is an intriguing lowkey totally unusual Cold War thriller that has faded undeservedly into obscurity. While not a lost classic by any stretch of the imagination it remains a commendable little film which explores issues of identity and political paranoia in an affecting way. Based on an Algis Budrys novel and adapted for the screen by John Gould it is a film of much talk and little action.... therefore viewers will need to give it a certain level of attention in order to follow the plot and understand the characters. Those who prefer special effects explosions and other such brain candy will probably not enjoy it.American scientist Lucas Martino Joseph Bova is badly injured in a car accident whilst in the Eastern Bloc. He is rushed to hospital and saved by Communist doctors but his face and much of his body is so grotesquely disfigured that they have to use metallic plating to rebuild him. By the time Martino is repaired he looks more like a robot than a man. A while later Martino is returned to the U.S but his startling new look arouses immediate suspicion. The American government wonder whether the real Martino has been sent back to them or if they have in fact been handed a Soviet spy disguised as this strange robotic man. Agent Sean Rogers Elliot Gould is given the task of interrogating the robotic man to find out if he is who he claims to be or an impostor. Martino insists that he is still the same man and that only his appearance has altered but Rogers suspects that there is more to the case than meets the eye. Could the whole thing really be an audacious Russian spy plot? Or perhaps the Americans DO have Martino but he has been brainwashed by the Russians into carrying out espionage activities for them? Or maybe even the bewildered metal man is genuinely telling the truth struggling to come to terms with his incredible new appearance in a paranoid world where all around him refuse to trust him?Gould is good as the hero a man whose sense of accountability towards national security motivates and occasionally clouds his quest for the truth. Also good is Trevor Howard as the Russian Colonel Azarin who is seen in flashback trying to brainwash the injured Martino not until the end of the movie do we learn if his brainwashing efforts were successful. But best of all is Joseph Bova as the robotic victim evoking a mix of sympathy and suspicion with his voice and mannerisms despite the fact that his face is concealed behind an inexpressive metal mask. Indeed Who? is a wellacted offering throughout. The film's faults lie elsewhere. Jack Gold's direction is too pedestrian and lowkey for the movie's own good. Many of the scenes are so dully staged and detached and grey that the film has a somewhat cold feel to it. An air of cynicism hangs over the proceedings  one might almost call it antientertainment or anticinema. This actually damages the film in some ways and undoes the effect of the good performances and thoughtprovoking storyline. I'd still recommend Who? if just for its relatively strange ideas but it is undoubtedly a picture that could have amounted to much much more.".

The acting is dull but you can't blame main actor Joseph Bova as is is constantly acting with a mask on his face. The ColdWarConflict is just a background for a silly love story and the worst is Bova's makeup as the robot outfit looks rather like the iron man of the Wizard of Oz or a funny figure from an old Disney movie instead of being a symbol for a human tragedy.

	schema:reviewBody "Some of the negative reviews here seem to be because of not paying proper attention to the story particularly understanding the clever flashback structure andor getting hung up over the makeuptin head effects. Its a huge shame that these might dissuade people from seeing this brilliant film. The appearance of Lucas Martino the tin man is irrelevant. What matters is that all the FBI has to go on to identify him is his responses. Another reviewer no doubt distracted by facebook rather than actually watching mentioned 'why don't they just compare his fingerprints?' but its explained in the film that whilst the arm may belong to Martino it doesn't guarantee that the headmind does. At its heart the film explores a fascinating theme about identity what makes a person who they are in a way that couldn't be imitated and taught to someone else. Between the lines is a chessgame style thoughtbattle between two sides figuring out what to do with this guy and trying to solve the puzzle of how to prove that someone is who they say they are. There's a desperate tragic and lonely feeling underlying the conversations when trying to distill the very essence of a person's humanity. What really makes the idea work is the meticulous structure of the film  we see the present day situation of the FBI trying to figure out who he is intercut with flashbacks of the Russians questioning him and figuring out whether to send back a spy instead. So the audience has to think and consider all the angles along with both the Russian spy commander and the FBI agent trying to second guess events but never really knowing for sure who the man is or more importantly  HOW to know until the very end. I've seen this film at least six times and still enjoy its ideas and main philosophical puzzle each time despite knowing the outcome. Its such a great shame that people are so blindsided by the lack of action the dodgy makeup effects the woeful mismarketing and obvious low budget of the film to recognise what is actually a great story and a very intelligently structured film. There are two particularly ropy moments  a carchaseshootout at an airport and a completely pointlessunnecessary moment where an agent chases our mystery man across a road runs into the side of a car then leaps over its hood and ends up dead. Next scene mystery man says Sorry about Finchley. FBI agents ignores it moves into next line of questioning. Its pretty absurd. If these stupid shoe horned attempts at 'action' were cut out completely it would be a better film. I would love to see a polished remake of this story by someone like Chris Nolan or Denis Villeneuve  taking the flashback structure and running with it to really explore the themes and push the emotional side into new territories. It would surely be a classic of philosophical scifi. Genuinely this is one of my favourite movies of all time.".

He comes back to America with his head in a metal casing and American agents don't know if it's really the same guy or a spy.Very low budget. Elliot Gould stars in this vehicle as the US agent who doesn't think the guy is the real deal.I suspect this movie was the beginning of Gould's demise as an actor. It come after all his great movies and he hasn't done much of substance since.He walks through this role reading lines in a stiff fashion. Interestingly this movie was made nearly 15 years before the original RoboCop. Wonder if they got the idea from it. It's basically the same concept without the law enforcement angle.The giant fatal flaw in this film is if they really wonder if this is the real scientist why don't they just take his fingerprints and compare them?Plus flashbacks make it apparent it IS the guy. So all the suspense is lifted n the first 10 minutes. There's no drama no tension. Just a guy with a silver head wandering around.Super disappointment.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm currently taking a Clint Eastwood course at UT Austin and we recently watched this movie.And its a bit confusing. I'm not sure what to make of this fun wacky and somewhat random movie. Eastwood himself seems to strive and always aims for ambiguity in his work. And it shows here.There were a lot of dumb ass critics in the 60's and 70's that liked to bash Eastwood and used the popular buzzword of fascist and labeled him as such. So in response Eastwood was very particular about what he did afterward and would do things that contradict in the eyes of critics his previous work or characters. This of course confused critics and ultimately forced them to look at his work again and see that they were being dumb ass idiots and were just going along with the popular liberal clap trap at the time.So we have this movie in which Eastwood is this hillbilly mechanic and competent street fighter and his adventures with his orangutan not a monkey Afsheen they have 12 ribs like us. And its this almost really weird PG comedy. It has these sort of random plots and events that are kind of incorporated into the story and well not really sure how I can best put it into words but its just fun. It shows that Eastwood can do this wacky road comedy.But it has some surprisingly dramatic moments as well. The audience is well aware of the Sandra Locke's characters true intentions before Eastwood's Philo. And when he does figure it out its pretty brutal. And I really bought into that emotional confrontation and Philo's reaction. And then Eastwood throws a fight and in some ways its bleak. But in other ways it isn't. Philo I think found a little bit about himself and learned who his true friends are people like Clyde and Orville and Orville's girl Echoa young Beverly D'Angelo.The character of Tank Murdoch I believe is meant as an allegory to Clint Eastwood and his celebrity status his celebrity and his star persona. Philo wants to challenge Murdoch and beat him. Murdoch is a guy who everyone knows and has this huge reputation. And then Philo sees Murdoch who's really pretty sad. His friends turn on him and aren't real friends and he realizes he doesn't want to be Tank Murdoch. And he doesn't want other people gunning for him. So at the end of the movie it almost feels like it was Eastwood REJECTING his own star persona and choosing to stay in obscurity with his friends. Makes me wonder how Eastwood truly feels about his celebrity status.Jeffrey The Vile One Harris".

He had to call on all his skills to keep the film from being stolen by an ape.This and its sequel Every Which Way You Can will never be at the top of Clint's cinema achievements but it's a nice rollicking comedy about a bare knuckle fighter. If it were set in today's times instead of the Seventies Eastwood's Philo Beddoe would be on the extreme fighting channel.Seeing Clint's living quarters reminded me of John Wayne's similar arrangements in True Grit with Chin Lee and General Sterling Price the cat. Clyde's quite a bit more the handful than a cat. He lives with Geoffrey Lewis who is his second and corner man in the bare knuckle fighting business and handles all the wagers and Lewis's mother a 'helpless' little old lady with a shotgun deliciously played by Ruth Gordon.Making his living as a bare knuckle fighter Clint just seems to run into people determined to take him down. That includes an involvement with aspiring country singer Sondra Locke whom he spends a good deal of money on and who then takes a powder on him. She's heading east so Clint Lewis and Clyde are as well. Along the way they pick up sharp shooting Beverly D'Angelo who saves them on one occasion.The legendary bare knuckle champion is Denver Tank Murdoch and as that 20th century philosopher Ric Flair opined to be the best you have to beat the best. So Clint is heading to Denver to find both Locke and Walter Barnes who plays Tank Murdoch with his three amigos.He also manages to arouse the anger of John McQuade and his Black Widow Biker gang. These people are the sorriest biker gang ever depicted on the big screen. Everyone and I mean EVERYONE manages to best this crowd of losers. But they never give up.Best in the film are Ruth Gordon and Clyde not necessarily in that order. I've often thought that the Academy Awards should have a best animal performance in a given year. That year the Oscar gold would have been taken by the orangutan. I wish the film had elaborated a little more on when Eastwood and Lewis break into a zoo to get Clyde's male needs satisfied.For a lighter and brighter side of Clint Eastwood don't miss Every Which Way But Loose.".

Watch this film to see a different approach to Clint Eastwood's work as he lives a relaxed and happy life with his ape 'Clyde'.The sequel to this film is just as good as the first one with new characters and well supported music that suits the period as well as the film. They have finally released both films on DVD in England and is worth the investment for a classic collection.".

Providing a uniquely bizarre buddy presence Clyde steals the show. Though totally replaceable as a plot element he becomes irreplaceable as a star in his own right.Every Which Way But Loose finds Clint at a perfect fit 48  not too old to appear frail and not too young to appear green  spending much of his time in Shirtless Kirk mode in illegal street fights that pad his trucker income. Falling hard for Lynn HalseyTaylor skeletal Sondra Locke playing a country singer even though she can't sing worth a damn  yes unfortunately that's her voice on the soundtrack Philo traverses the American heartland with his pal Orville Geoffrey Lewis to woo her whilst moronic cops and imbecilic bikers tail him tailing her both groups on a vendetta against Philo for their chins repeatedly impacting his fist.Populated with Eastwood regulars John Quade Dan Vadis Bill McKinney William O'Connell  Thems black widdas!  and a very young very sexy Beverly D'Angelo Every Which Way is that type of homespun movie where a character can step up to a bar and order a beer  and get one! where a barroom brawl breaks out and everyone starts fighting  for no reason and with the person they were sitting next to this motley concoction of characters and contrivance could have slipped out of control very easily instead exhibiting an easy grace that its star has become renowned for and standing defiantly on its inspired silliness.There is a throwaway scene where Ma rocketfueled Ruth Gordon chastises Philo for Clyde's misbehavior whereupon Philo approaches Clyde and points an imaginary gun at him. Clyde puts his hands up Philo exclaims Bang! and Clyde suddenly falls back flat on the tires. Funny and cute on the surface only Clint aficionados will see the satire as Clint assumes the relaxed lean of one of his avenger characters and  in a film where he never wields a gun  uses a pretendgun to fire the punchline. Every Which Way followed three movies where Clint's gunhand got a heavy workout  as Dirty Harry in The Enforcer 1976 The Outlaw Josey Wales 1976 and a film where more than a million rounds were expended trying to mow down his Ben Shockley in The Gauntlet 1977. Eternally unassuming about his living legend status Clint is more inclined to crack a bemused embarrassed smile over the effusiveness afforded him at awards ceremonies rather than transform into Hollywood Ass. Willing to parody his own legendary characters during a confrontation with the bike gang  the imperiously impotent Black Widows  we hear a snatch of the Good the Bad and the Ugly theme.The country music soundtrack is surprisingly fitting and uncharacteristically enjoyable especially the nostalgic poignant title track sung by Eddie Rabbitt. To make nominal sense of the grammatically incorrect title simply preface three words of the song lyrics You turn me every which way but loose Though the movie is played for laughs aplenty it is a Queen song disguised as a Hansen song ending on a very dark note  while the crooked cops and incompetent bike gang draw our attention as villains it becomes apparent in the final scenes that the vilest villain is the woman who turned Philo every which way  Lynn HalseyTaylor. There is no formulaic reconciliation with Philo as Lynn maintains her stance as an unrepentant philanderer and turns her back on him. Philo then loses the film's final fight for mercenary reasons. We don't often see these types on screen like the incestuous family in Chinatown these characters are sociallyshunned types that slap us awake to the possibility of conclusions besides Hollywood pap.I just hope that when I'm 48 I'll look as good as the shirtless Clint.".

	schema:reviewBody "When this film was made it was reviled and I mean REVILED by the critics of the day. How dare Clint Eastwood make a comedy! Yet it was Clint's biggest box office success up to that time and still might be. I saw it when it was out at the theater and years later not only does it hold up but it's light years better more realistic honestly and intelligent than most modern comedies combined.This film was originally meant for Burt Reyonlds but Clint liked it a lot and decided to do it despite having his manager and just about everyone he was friends with tell him not to do it. Eastwood said he was drawn to the movie because it didn't have a conventionally happy ending. He doesn't get the girl and ends up broke with the ape. I saw this when I was really young and having watched too many sitcoms like most Americans I was sad when the film had an ending like this. I didn't expect it. There was a line in which Clint's character Philo says to Sondra Locke who plays a hustling country singer I was hoping to go beyond your bedroom. If this film were made today it would have a Jerry Springer like condescension towards the working classes with an incest subplot a grandma with no teeth and the obligatory Deliverance references. This film is still funny and entertaining even though the ape Clyde really doesn't fit in all the time. If they lost the ape the film would still be good. The film is also consistently funny. There are no real story lulls in it. And it was made in a time when people weren't so uptight and politiclaly correct. One of the early scenes has Clint in a bar and he talks to a girl who gives a ton of lip and smug condescension. He asks her what are you mad at? with all sincerity. Clint was hitting on a PC chick years before political correctness came about. We have become much too uptight and rigidly humourless. Even the comedies nowadays aren't particularly funny. They're usually gross smug and childish without any real trace of wit. A shame but then we have this film we can go back to.".

A hefty abundance of CW music meant that the culture was into a growing popularity by the late 70s which brought in more country cornpone to the theater screens. It appeared that we wanted to see Clint do a comedy but he sure wasn't the right man for the job. So what happened to the script? Our man Clint is in love with the Palomino country singer Sondra Locke he was with her in several more of his Malpaso productions. That's the whole story and it all goes every which way but loose until there's a big knot where the entire movie itself becomes nothing more but senseless junk. The orangutan made the perfect pairing for the guy who carries a .44 Magnum.....what an embarrassment! And then there was a sequel! Clint how can we ever forgive you?".

	schema:reviewBody "Every Which Way But Loose seems like it had some history behind it. Eastwood jumped at the script despite the fact that they originally wanted his pal Burt Reynolds to do it everyone tried to talk him out of it because at the time it was a far stretch from Eastwood's violent dark gloomy screen image and further more when all was said and done previewers said the film would tank but it didn't because it's fun. It was made to be fun just a romp a good time and heartfelt and all in all it's not that far of a stretch from Eastwood's image because he still kicks some major butt and shows a softer side for sure.Clint Eastwood plays Philo Beddoe a fun loving crazy guy who happens to have a knack and love for street brawling. Along with his best friendmanager Orville Boggs they take in a good amount on bets including Beddoe's win of a rather large sarcastic trouble making Oranguatang named Clyde. Despite popular assumption the film really isn't about Clyde and Beddoe but more just about Beddoe and his cross country trip to find the woman of his dreams while being chased down by some folks he made rather angry...two off duty policeman and a squad of Motorcycle gang members. Eastwood is good in his role because not only is he his typical tough guy big screen icon but he has a softness to him he's having a good time and it just makes it fun. Although you're kind of waiting for him to lose it and pull out a magnum on everyone. Veteran character actor Geoffrey Lewis plays Orville Boggs. He's certainly not as tough as Eastwood and yet they make a great team. Hilariously funny stealing the show is foul mouth Ma Boggs played by Ruth Gordon. She only has a few scenes but it's downright hilarious. And then of course there is Clyde played by Manis. Manis does what you would expect a decent ape to do to make everyone smile. He certainly has some of the laugh out loud moments but he never steals the show the way you might expect. He's just another part of the whole crew. Sondra Locke plays Eastwood's love interest who he travels cross country to find. She's self centered and seemingly determined to outrun Eastwood and I think he could have done better but he was hooked on her. Beverly D'Angelo plays a small role as Echo Orville's girl who he picks up from a vegetable stand. They make a cute couple and she has some great scenes.The fight scenes are plenty the country music is overwhelming and at the time probably a great soundtrack. It's a country film and the quint essential fist fight street brawl movie. Eastwood is unstoppable and most of the comedy comes from watching him make fools of his rather foolish enemies along with his buddies. It's an adventure comedy that is worth seeing. It's not depthy or important or a real slam bang comedy...it's just fun...and that's why everyone loved it and why it's an Eastwood classic. 710".

Philo's best friend and companion is Clyde an ape of epic proportions that loves to drink beer. His other pal is Orville a loyal friend that follows him everywhere and acts as his fight manager. Orville's mother Zenobia is a foul mouthed woman who fails all the driving tests she goes to.Philo takes an interest in a CW vocalist Lynn HalseyTaylor a not too talented singer traveling from place to place trying to make it in the business. Lynn alas is a calculating woman who does not plan to spend the rest of her life with Philo. Lynn is quick in accepting Philo's generosity but she wants no romance with Philo who goes after her fighting himself with whoever wants to and making some money in the process.James Fargo the director had been around as assistant to many projects that Clint Eastwood got involved in so it did not come as a surprise his friend would tap him for this film as he was starting in the industry as a director. Written by Jeremy Joe Kronsberg whose first screenplay this was the film was not exactly what one would have expected by a star of Mr. Eastwood's magnitude. While the movie is not horrible it is forgettable. Clint Eastwood a man of impeccable taste in music has always favored jazz music in most of his movies. Here he plays tribute perhaps to all the places out West that feature music from the heartland. Mel Tillis one of CW's big stars sings a couple of songs.It did not help that Sondra Locke was cast as Lynn. The actress and Mr. Eastwood had no chemistry whatsoever in spite of being romantically involved. Based on the popularity of this film the stars went to do a sequel Any Which Way you Can. Geoffrey Lewis plays Orville Philo's true friend. Beverly D'Angelo appears as Echo and the great Ruth Gordon is seen as Ma. Boggs.".

	schema:headline " Forgotten gem";
	schema:reviewBody "Here we have the movie that Jean Renior considered his favorite of all his American efforts. It's truly a forgotten gem from this great director.It involves the Tucker family a hardworking but poor clan who toil in the cotton fields as day workers. The family is led by Sam played by Zachary Scott accompanied by his lovely wife Nona played by Betty Field. They are accompanied by Beulah Bondi's ornery Granny Tucker two small children and a frisky little dog. They represent the best of America's hardworking poor with Sam and Nona truly being dedicated to each other and their family.We are introduced to them as they pluck cotton beneath the burning sun hauling huge sacks stuffed with the crop. Suddenly an elder member of the family falters and he is quickly aided by his nephew and his wife Sam and Nona. Sam takes his uncle's load of cotton telling him that he'll finish his row. Nona Tucker stays with the old man as he languishes in the fields flies buzzing around him as he sweats and wheezes. Sam soon rushes back after delivering his cotton and Nona informs him that his uncle isn't doin' too good. They give the old guy water and urge him to hold on but with his dying breath he tells his young relatives ...grow your own crop. This advice Sam truly takes to heart and soon asks his sympathetic boss to let him farm a piece of land on a kind of renttoown deal. Sam and Nona's experiences making a life on this fallow piece of land are the focus of the movie.Truth be told I've always found talented Betty Field to be one of Hollywood's most unsung and underappreciated actresses. She seems to generate some vague aura of tragedy with subtle underpinnings of a quiet sexuality. Her voice has a low register which also can have a beautiful clear resonance that is unique and memorable. Betty Field was the main reason I was so excited to finally be able to view The Southerner. And I certainly was not disappointed! Her Nona and Scott's Sam are extremely believable as soul mates and married lovers and there is a certain erotic electricity in there quiet scenes together.Zachary Scott'character is earnest sensitive and ultimately heroic and his presence lends a quiet softspoken American spirit to the proceedings and he voices a soft Southern accent to perfection. His Sam Tucker is intelligent brave and determined and the movie really gives him the opportunity to demonstrate his strength and prowess. Scott is wiry and strong and his performance is athletic and inspiring. One can easily believe him to be the kind of man who would inspire the love and dedication of his wife and family. His obvious intelligence goodness and his determination help make his long and difficult journey extremely involving. After a major catastrophe when Sam experiences dark feelings of hopelessness Zachary Scott truly conveys the reality of a common guy who questions all his decisions and abilities.Jean Renoir's ability to capture the distinctly American essence of these characters is remarkable for a director from Europe. He certainly has a fascination and love for the land and uses the landscape to reinforce the emotional high points of the film. In one remarkable scene when the couple's young son battles an illness Nona runs from the family's house into the freshly plowed field crying as her husband follows her. She throws herself down onto the dirt and hugs the soil as she weeps and confesses her innermost feelings. Renoir seems to almost turn the dirt and mud of this field into a third character in the scene.But yes there are a few elements in The Southerner that must disqualify it from masterpiece status. One disconcerting thing was the Hollywood makeup on Betty Field who was never without mascara and lip gloss even when picking cotton or burning brush off a field. She certainly looked lovely but also inappropriate for the movie. And the expert character actress Beulah Bondi has some moments where Renoir allowed her to perhaps play it a little too broadly. She's much of the comic relief in the film and serves this purpose well but her crotchetiness does begin to grate somewhat. And unfortunately the superb Blanche Yurka is underused as Sam's mother and she appears so suddenly that it seems some of her scenes must have been cut. Percy Kilbride plays a thankless role as Yurka's suitor and his screen time could have been used more efficiently.But other supporting player deliver wonderful little turns in the film. There's Charles Kemper as Sam's rotund best friend and city slicker Tim. He's likable and warm and the narration that opens the film is his. He is perhaps the polar opposite of Sam in appearance and philosophy and lends a voice to the advantages of city living. Then we have J. Carroll Naish as a terse and bitter neighbor who supplies much dramatic impact in his scenes with good guy Sam. The deliberate and thoughtful interplay between these two characters is packed with tension and foreboding. Norman Lloyd as Naish's nasty lowlife farmhand gives a unique performance and seems to bring an almost animalistic quality to his character. Also Dorothy Granger is both frightening and sad as a drunken barroom floozy who doesn't run from a fight.The Southerner could probably be considered The Grapes of Wrath Lite. But to view it that way certainly underestimates its own power and its relevance even today. Stripped to its essence the movie could be the tale of any closeknit family who struggles to survive and to flourish in an uncaring world. Renior's talent with the help of a great cast makes The Southerner an impressive portrait of the struggles and rewards of American farm life. It has the ability to resonate in the memory because of both its Hollywood artistry and its gritty Southern strength.".

I suppose these were necessary nods to Hollywood conventions of the time. Kudos must go to Zachary Scott for the courage of his performance in the lead. An underrated actor Scott was nearly always cast playing lounge lizards and other assorted slimeballs. Here he appears without his mustache and is almost unrecognizable. Given that Scott aspired to a career as a Gabletype leading man this role was not a good career move. But it is definitely the performance of his career and along with the equally outstanding performance of Betty Field makes the film. Incidentally I could have done without the over the top performance of Beulah Bondi as Granny throughout the film I kept hoping Scott would strangle her.".

	schema:headline " Worth a Closer Look";
	schema:reviewBody "The opening shot amounts to a wonderfully compelling hymnal to the land and those who toil there while the rest of the movie attempts to follow through with that noble theme. There's no doubt that this is one of the most laudable movie projects to come out of the decade. But for all the earnest concern there's still too much of the theatrical for my liking. I know the film is generally hailed by critics and there's much to be said for its consistent downanddirty look at the plight of the southern sharecropper. But there's also a staginess to many of the characters and scenes that blemishes director Renoir's naturalistic approach. Consider Beulah Bondi's overthetop turn as Granny. She's supposed to offer amusingly caustic comments on events as relief from the rigors of the plot. The trouble is that both she and the camera rub our nose in the role. They just as well have hung a sign around her neck saying crusty old woman. The bad makeup job doesn't help either and serves as a constant reminder that the Tuckers are after all only a makebelieve family. Since she's a central character the flaws in her wild eyerolling performance are hard to ignore. The other acting is fine especially from Scott in the lead role as Sam. However both he and wife Nona Field are more stereotypes than multidimensional people. He's the noble tireless worker and so is she. Together they are unwavering in their support of each other and the farm. And when Sam does waver after the flood it's Nona providing the strength to persevere. Thus it's the whole family and not just Sam plowing the field that will make the farm a success. That's a good point for the script to make. The trouble is that Sam and Nona are simply too good to be believable in the face of all the adversity. At least one breakdown scene where the emotional toll of the wrenching burdens is expressed would have added a more human dimension. Writer Renoir is simply too insistent on the nobility of the two characters turning them more into symbols than complex real people.On the other hand the hostile neighbor Devers Naish is the most interesting of the characters. His dark resentful nature would appear to come from uncredited cowriter William Faulkner who specialized in such Gothic personalities. The real agonizing story of what it means to start up a farm is told by the embittered old man in what I take to be the movie's central scene. He's made a success but that success has made him hard and mean and now he lives in fear of anyone rising above him. I wish the screenplay had not betrayed that dark impact for the price of a big fish in what strikes me as a very implausible turn around scene on the riverbank. The film's virtues are pretty obvious. There's a real effort at showing rural poverty and its effects on people never a Hollywood biggie. When little Daisy lovingly puts on the crude blanketcoat I was reminded of a world so easily passed over in a nation of commercialized malls. Ditto the welldone possum feast where the simple act of eating means so much more. And especially when the family and we gather around the little hearth fire to peer into the glow through eyes much more ancient than our own. These are indelible scenes that transcend the movie screen and alone are worth the price of the movie.Maybe it took a European auteur outside the usual studio framework to want to deal as honestly as possible with such a noncommercial theme. But the location shooting and insistence on the unglamorous even down to the very unHollywood barfly add up to what looks like an effort at honest depiction. Of course Renoir's wellknown humanism and rollicking humor show up in the party scene in what amounts to a folk celebration of life and community. Then too there's that telling scene between Sam and Tim Kemper where each comes to appreciate the contributions of the other in supplying the community's needs. Whatever the film's regrettable flaws the message remains a powerful one that needs constant retelling especially in our own cynical times. Too bad Renoir didn't stay on this side of the Atlantic. His influence on our own moviemakers would have pushed them in a much needed direction.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Southerner is a very good film starring Zachary Scott Betty Field Beulah Bondi Norman Lloyd J. Carrol Naish and Blanche Yurka. It's the story of a man Sam Tucker working as a cotton picker along with his wife and parents. As his father lays dying in the field he tells his son to own his own land. Sam quits his job and makes arrangements to work the land of his former boss with the goal of ownership. He's not welcome by his closest neighbor Naish and the house on the land is nothing but a shack. The family nearly starves during the winter the daughter can't go to school because she doesn't have a coat his son falls ill with spring sickness probably rickets. Nevertheless Sam and Nona Field keep working Sam knowing that working the land and feeling the sun is the only way he can live.This is a very absorbing film. You not only see but feel the struggles of the family and how hard they work no matter the odds with strength and determination.Betty Field was a good choice as Nona  she's plain and tiredlooking with a bright smile. The devotion she has to Sam and he to her is very touching. As a couple she and Scott are very effective. Beulah Bondi is very good as the irascible annoying wizened grandmother either complaining or predicting doom and gloom. Naish gives an excellent performance as a jealous and unhelpful neighbor and Norman Lloyd is appropriately slimy as his worker. It's always hard to relate the skinny Lloyd who usually played villains with the older revered Dr. Auschlander in St. Elsewhere  he's had quite a career. As of this writing he's 93 and still working.Zachary Scott is okay as Sam but it's not a comfortable fit. The part required more warmth more depth and more internal grit it's a Henry Fonda role. Still for not being Scott's normal type of sophisticated or villainous part he handles it well.A good film beautifully directed by Jean Renoir who was nominated for an Oscar. There are some stunning cinematic moments as well. Worth watching for sure.".

	schema:reviewBody "Based on all the historical evidence Renoir was granted independence in the making of The Southerner and it shows in his direction and control of stylistics. The pastoral setting is explored with great depth of field while characters are staged in depth through windows like in many of Renoir's French films M. Lange La Chienne. The story is the epitome of apropos  if you're working for a big outfit maybe you don't get rich but you still get your pay even if the crops is bad. But the little guy who is growing his own if his crops is ruined he's got nothing left. This warning given to Sam Tucker sets up the drama of the story while also commenting on the methods of producing the film itself. The mobile framing and long take pans accompanied by voiceover dialogue would be quite unconventional for a Hollywood audience and are much more in tune with the kind of documented eye of social cinema which Vigo promoted. As much as the stylistics are European and Renoirian in origin the story is a corny slice of Americana  to live on the land you own catching trophy catfish grandma watching over things from her rocking chair. It speaks to America... even ironically lies to America. Land needs rest like a man. That's why the Lord invented Sunday is of course ridiculous given that Sunday was invented by the citizens of the French Republic. Renoir makes the most of the realism that can be achieved through exterior shooting on location and not on the studio sets. The house that is used literally sits on a crooked foundation creating impact on the viewer where skewed perspectives juxtapose with prospects of hopes and dreams. There is no class conflict in this film... the conflict plays out within the working class. Renoir falls back on some decoupage classique but frames a great fight sequence through it. The most unRenoir element of the film is the portrayal of the wife who supports 100 her husband and at no point creates even the slightest amount of stress of strife for him... she is in effect a cardboard cutout woman folk. For all the massacring of Renoir's films in the cutting rooms The Southerner could do with the removal of anachronistic misogynist traditional values in some of his Hollywood films. Renoir always believed in egalitarianism for women especially so one can see that as much as The Southerner is considered independent Renoir was still bound by the puritanical values of the society to which his film would be distributed.".

	schema:reviewBody "During his American exile period Jean Renoir turned out some really interesting films. The best of these is The Southerner which earned an Oscar nomination for Best Director. This film is clearly the ancestor of that Sally Field classic from the Eighties Places In The Heart.The Southerner is the story of a poor white family in the rural south named Tucker. Zachary Scott who wants very much to farm on his own land takes an option from Paul Harvey and plants cotton on it. He was advised by friend Charles Kemper that it's a whole lot easier to be working in a factory or working as a farmhand on someone else's land as you're guaranteed a paycheck and you won't starve.But that goes against that great frontier tradition of 40 acres and a mule and the people who homesteaded and developed their own land. It's an ingrained American dream not like the Europe where Jean Renoir was taking a hiatus from due to World War II. In fact The Southerner is a great tribute to Renoir's ability to soak up American culture and values. He really depicts the rural American South quite well. What's not shown here are black people but in point of fact they would not be sharecropping near any poor white people at that time. Still the lack of them is a major flaw in the film.Both Zachary Scott and Betty Field do a great job at playing these very simple but indestructibly sturdy Tuckers. Their two children live with them as well Scott's ancient grandmother Beulah Bondi made up to way beyond her years even then. J. Carrol Naish has a nice part as a bitter neighbor who resents the fact that Scott might just make a go of it on land that cost him a couple of family members. Former silent star Estelle Taylor plays Naish's daughter and old time vaudevillian Jack Norworth has a small role as the local physician.Norworth's part is involved with Scott and Field's son coming down with pellagra common among the poor people of the south who did not get a decent diet. Fresh milk every day went a long way and that's the reason that schools started giving out milk to the children way back in the day and still do.Besides a nomination for Renoir The Southerner also received Academy Award nominations for Best Music Scoring and Best Sound. Sad to say for Renoir his film did not get to take any Oscars back to France when he returned.The Southerner ought to be seen back to back with Places In The Heart which has black people very prominent in the cast and does not shy from racial issues. Still even with that major flaw The Southerner is a deserved film classic.".

The movie is a chronicle of the hardships that face farmers and a tribute to a certain kind of modest heroism that is willing to put up with all manner of strife to plow doggedly ahead. Neither the film nor Scott's performance make a martyr of the farmer or even necessarily ask us to agree with him. Some people are cut out to be farmers and some aren't the movie suggests but it doesn't attach a value statement to that. Rather it presents farmers as people who have to make a living just like anybody and would rather do so by working the land than anything else.Some dramatic conflict is brought into the picture through a character played by J.

It's a modest movie with modest ambitions that makes a big impact.Also featuring Beulah Bondi as an irascible grandmother whose broad shtick wears thin fast and feels at odds with the rest of the movie.The Southerner brought Renoir his only Academy Award nomination for Best Director and it was also nominated in the categories of Best Dramatic or Comedy Score and Best Sound Recording not especially meaningful recognition since the Scoring category had 21 nominees that year and the Sound Recording category 12.Grade A".

Grapes was an object lesson in Marxism's transition from false consciousness to class consciousness except for Ma's sellout speech about the people that live at the end. I'm not objecting to the Marxism just pointing it out.The Southerner doesn't pit the poor and exploited against the rich. Scott's family is really dirt poor and their neighbors are a nasty family but the antagonist here is not Management but force majeur. Scott has a corny speech in the midst of his struggling cotton patch in which he talks to the Man Upstairs and asks what's up. It's a reasonable question in context.Happily Scott's family is not straight out of Walt Disneyland. Grandma is a whining selfish pain in the neck who imparts dumb hick medical advice. Betty Field is more in the mold of the supportive wife while the two kids are there mainly to provide a focus for worry.This poverty looks real. The people that work in the fields really look dirty. Everybody looks dirty. One kid get pellagra the result of a lack of niacine from vegetables and fruits. The reason he gets it is that during their first winter the family simply has nothing to eat but flour dried corn and whatever varmits Scott and his dog can manage to bring home. It's horrifying to see how happy they are when Scott brings home a possum. You have to be pretty badly off to eat a marsupial.The plot follows a familiar trajectory hope followed by disappointment impending triumph blighted by disaster. But the acting is pretty good. None of the leads had a distinguished career but they're convincing enough here. The script gives us some neat character studies too including J. Carrol Naish as the embittered and jealous neighbor with the nasty son and the generous daughter. The last scene involves the rescue of the family cow they finally got one from a flooded river and is well executed. And the director Jean Renoir stages one fist fight and two comic episodes of violence in unexpected ways. Not brutal just unexpected.The ending as you might expect has everyone bravely putting their shoulders back against the wheel their faces bright with hope  even Grandma's.".

	schema:reviewBody "The famed French director Jean Renoir spent a few years in Hollywood during WWII making films before ultimately returning home to continue his career following the defeat of the Nazis. The Southerner is one of these Hollywoodproduced films made by Renoir.The film begins on a cotton field and one of the pickers has a heart attack. As he lies there dying he urges his nephew Zachary Scott to get his own land and give up the hard life of a picker. So in the next scene Scott gets his boss to agree to let him farm some old land that's been sitting vacant for many years. The idea sounds good but when Scott sees the land he wonders if he has a prayer of making it work as the farmhouse is almost completely in ruins and the place looks like a disaster area. Naturally times are very very difficult for the family and it's an interesting portrayal of a tough bygone way of life that few today in the USA can remember. Overall it's unrelentingly depressingand the family's life is made more so by an evil neighbor J. Carroll Naish who seems to delight in making them more miserable! But how can they possibly make it with so many things stacked against them? Tune in and see for yourself.While the film is not always pleasant it does make for compelling viewingyou just can't stop watching the family fighting to eke out a meager existence. In this sense it's very reminiscent of the film The Good Earthbut set in rural Southern America. And historically speaking it's an important filmmostly because aside from this Hollywood tended to ignore this lifestyle. I was thinking about giving the film an 8 it's very very good but I deducted a point for Beulah Bondi's over the top performance.By the way despite Beulah Bondi looking and sounding like a more ancient more annoying and insane version of Granny from The Beverly Hillbillies in this film she isn't actually that old when she made the film she was in her 50s. It seems Bondi played so many old women parts people just assumed she was an old womaneven when making films in her 30s and 40s.".

I was thinking about giving the film an 8 it's very very good but I deducted a point for Beulah Bondi's over the top performance.By the way despite Beulah Bondi looking and sounding like a more ancient more annoying and insane version of Granny from The Beverly Hillbillies in this film she isn't actually that old when she made the film she was in her 50s. It seems Bondi played so many old women parts people just assumed she was an old womaneven when making films in her 30s and 40s.";

As the farmer Scott gives a very natural and nuanced performance it is unfortunate that he was not able to parlay this role into a better career. Field is terrific as the devoted wife who tirelessly works the field alongside her husband while Bondi is amusing as the eccentric granny.

	schema:reviewBody "One of only a few films I am aware of from the classic Hollywood era that is devoted to dramatizing the plight of poor white farmers in the southern US during the early 20th century. Others I can think of include Tobacco Road The Grapes of Wrathboth directed by John FordSergeant Yorkin part and The Yearling none of which feature cotton growing in the humid South as does this film and all of which have a higher profile in recent times than this film despite its several Oscar nominations. This is an engaging story with conflicts over whether to try to make it as an independent farmer or to look for an easier and more predictable factory job. clearly Pa Tucker prefers the country environment.We have mostly 3 generations of Tuckers living under the same leaky roof including cantankerous Granny who is often a pain but can give some insights on the problems she experienced in her younger days as a farm wife as these relate to their present situation. As she related near starvation and sickness have taken a heavy toll of her extended family over the years. One of the serious problems she is familiar with is 'spring sickness' which is hinted to be pellagra a common vitamin niacin deficiency in the South of those times caused by too much reliance on corn products mostly corn meal mush in their diet. Native Americans had long ago discovered how to prevent this problem by treating the corn with wood ashes but European settlers never figured out that this treatment was important when their diet was too limited to corn products. The doctor rightly recommended that they include more vegetables and in the short run milk in their diet. Presumably the latter supplied needed calcium and additional protein as one of the important symptoms of severe pellagra is skeletal demineralization. In the film only the boy develops pellagra symptoms but actually it was much more common among women and girls as they tended to receive less varied nutrition than men. Back to the story The Tuckers have rented unusually fertile bottom land to grow their cotton and kitchen garden crops. Unlike Cooper in Sergeant York they don't have to deal with frequent rocks and steep hills. Unlike the Joads in The Grapes of Wrath they don't have to deal with persistent drought dust storms and being displaced by mechanized corporate agriculture.Unlike the Baxters in The Yearling their crops aren't eaten by wildlife although domestic stock do make a mess of their veggie garden at one point. But they do learn that farming on rich bottom land encompases the life and careerthreatening risk of occasional devastating floods and hurricanes. Meanwhile some physical altercations while in town provide some comic relief. J. Carrol Naish played Devers the Tucker's hard bitten not often sympathetic older neighbor.Naish was an excellent sometimes charismatic character actor often playing Native Americans Italians or Latinos including Mexican Santa Anna in The Last Command and Sitting Bull in Anne Get Your Gun and later in Sitting Bull. He played ethnics in several Fox and MGM musicals where he served primarily for comic relief. I most remember him as the charmingly irreverent Italian Bayou fisherman in the musical drama The Toast of New OrleansBetty Field looks too apple pie fresh as a supposedly dirt poor ignorant southern farm wife. Besides she was primarily raised in New England. Otherwise she is fine as the leading lady. Zachary Scott a native Texan comes across as more believable in his role. Beulah Bondi as granny came across as the most authentic of the Tuckers. She apparently played a rather similar role in the film The Trail of the Lonesome Pine. Unfortunately she lost out in her most coveted role as Ma Joad in The Grapes of Wrath. Thus her role in the present film somewhat makes up for that lost opportunity. With all their problems the Tuckers come across as spunky and optimistic in their precarious situation quite different from the decadent downtrodden Lesters in Tobacco Road also in a vary precarious financial situation.".

Most of the cast of this is not as well known as the Henry Fonda Joad family epic but that is different in a significant way. The Joads are in the process of trying to escape the dust bowl. This family relocates to the run down farm at the beginning of the film and then the story goes through their day to day living torments.French Director Renoir does a fine job assembling a story that makes a lot of sense and shows farm life struggles in a different way. The most famous cast member to me is Percy Kilbride who would go on to be Pa Kettle. In this movie he is a store clerk he eventually gets married and has a big wedding party nearing the end of the film. Since his bride is not Ma Kettle that makes him a bigamist though there is no relation between the films. Even though this is not the most famous cast around the performances here are very well acted and the cast makes the story more believable. The ending after a major climate changing event is a real life ending. For the folks who survive life goes on regardless. It is a lesson that needs to be taught more to a generation right now who has the idea that Climate Change is the end of everything as we know it. Climate change is not an ending it is a disaster that leads to a new beginning by those who survive. There is way too much gloom and doom and too many people getting rich peddling such nonsense.".

Their first year doesn't go as planned as the family must struggle with no food illness natural disasters and a mean spirited neighbor J. Carrol Naish. This film has quite a few faults including being oversentimental and featuring a poorly written part of grandmother but I still loved nearly every minute of this film due in large part to the three stars. I'm not overly familiar with Scott or Field but they really impressed me with their performances here. Their parts aren't anything we haven't seen already in previous films but they still manage to make their characters seem real and fresh. Naish gives the best performance I've seen from him as the feisty neighbor who doesn't give the poor family a chance. Renoir's direction is right on the mark and for a foreigner he captures the southern spirit quite well.".

All in all though for me it's an engrossing film and an honest one.A great point of interest is Zachary Scott in his second screen role. Minus his characteristic mustache and playing a simple tiller of the soil he seemed strangely cast. We're so used to his ultraslick amoral roles that seeing him in this film is rather startling. Not to say he wasn't good at it. There's just something about his angular face and sharp thin nose that suggests he ought to be more in a tailored tux than wrinkly overalls.Reading Scott's bio was informative not a particularly happy life and career despite his impressive seventy total credits. I got the feeling that Warner Bros. simply didn't know what to do with him following Mildred Pierce and Flamingo Road. Maybe they felt he was so convincing in these sinister roles that the public wouldn't buy him as other types. Whatever the case his private life seemed rather glum and lacking vitality. Could also be his first name may have been a downer in the long run. The supporting cast of The Southerner is fine and the film remains a strong depiction of early rural life in America.".

Although they are still recognizably Hollywood types Zachary Scott and Betty Field are convincing enough as the bedeviled farmers. However they do tend to leave the running to the support players particularly J. Carrol Naish who has one of his best roles ever as an embittered mean spirited neighbor Norman Lloyd as a bizarrely vicious halfwit Noreen Nash as a kindly if vamping sympathizer silent star Estelle Taylor making her first movie appearance since 1932 as an opportunistic barfly Nestor Paiva as a thiefthug of a barman and of course Percy Kilbride in his element as the local storekeeper.I thought that Beulah Bondi despite her faultless makeup tended to overdo the selfishly evercomplaining nanny and that the kids were just a little too squeakily clean if otherwise perfectly natural.It can been seen that this is no dull quasidocumentary but a richly characterized tapestry of Southern living. Packed with incident too. Perhaps a little too overweighted with thrills for complete realism but I'm not complaining. The producers seem to have taken astute advantage of a natural disaster to film the flood scenes good to see that no stock or newsreel footage at all has been used which are fascinating yet terrifying to behold. Manmade incidents are not wanting either as Scott and Kemper systematically wreck Paiva's bar and as Scott fights with the mercilessly bullying Naish. Superlatively yet unobtrusively crafted in all departments The Southerner is an unusual yet highly compelling drama about ordinary folks with characters and settings well away from the usual Hollywood clichs.Indeed so realistic is the background it comes as something of a surprise to learn from Renoir's autobiography that the movie was actually photographed in a cotton field not far from the small town of Madera California on the bank of the San Joaquin River. The situation was ideal. All that was needed was for Lourie to build a tumbledown shack and for the shooting to take place while the cotton was in flower.".

I've enjoyed his work in other movies in the past since not only does he know his craft well he has screen presence and even has some acting ability.But perhaps because Dacascos is unfortunately still not that well known in North America the producers also picked someone with more name value to pair up with him. While I can sort of understand this they really made a bad choice with choosing Coolio! I guess I can't really blame Coolio because in the past he has shown some screen ability. However the screenplay and the direction make him EXTREMELY annoying with his nonstop slang talking and insulting. What's even worse is that Coolio's character is given much more focus than Dacascos' character right down to the climatic action sequence. To say that Dacascos is greatly wasted is putting it mildly.The climatic action sequence IS entertaining and so are the previous ones in the movie... what little there are. The remaining running time is talk talk talk blah blah etc. Most of the focus is in fact on a plot so weak and so cliched that it gives dumb action movies a bad name. I suspect this is the main reason why the movie has yet to receive an official release in North America 3 years after it was made! Stanley Tong really needs to return to his roots to realize what made his past movies work.".

The Japanese release of the movie makes a big deal of Fujiwara's presence as a second string character and underwear model perhaps deservedly so. With the camera's help  she fights better than Jade Leung did in the first Black Cat movie and she's  certainly got the goods as far as the stripping and stretching scenes go. Still you sort of  have to wonder if some distributor wasn't going a bit far in releasing it here under the  name SPYN... it is after all primarily a movie about other characters. When it isn't making you wince over the English pronunciation or chuckle at the really  obvious subbing of stunt doubles though this is a halfway decent attempt at creating a  Bgrade action flick with international appeal. The plot is disjointed but piles on  enough stunt pieces that you aren't endlessly looking at your watch during the eventual  plot exposition scenes and the rest of the movie is silly enough see the motorcycle that rides up the back of a bus or the hopefully intentional comedy resulting from Coolio's  character being named Coolio... Coolio killed my partner! etc. that you don't feel  completely bad for renting it and turning your brain off for an hour and a half.

This kind of calculated marketing driven filmmaking process is just not what Hong Kong filmmakers do well leave that to Hollywood boys and the result is a grand disaster of a film that I can't imagine appealing to anybody whatever their nationality.The primary culpit is the script which fleshes out a paper thin and utterly generic plot with terribly inane dialogue delivered in poor English by a cast for who the language is mostly not a natural choice and I include Coolio in that p.  As a result it's hard for the acting not to be utterly dreadful even if the cast were made of people who actually could act in their native language.  I'm not sure how the spurious racism sprinkled through the script was meant to increase international appeal either.The film's one saving grace is the action scenes which Stanley Tong does know how to direct.  There's a few moments of greatness to be found in these scenes especially the finale set atop a pane of glass precariously suspended hundreds of floors above the ground for whatever reason.

Brainless easytofollow entertainment not bad after a couple of beers I would imagine but being as I was ENTIRELY too sober at the time I would say that the only reason I didn't run out of the cafe was because I was having too much fun laughing at their understanding or lack thereof of physics. Motorcycles slamming into walls with heroes flying into the air are just a tad too much for me to take and the entire cafe reverberated with laughter for five minutes after and given this cafe was populated by geeks explaining just WHY it was impossible. No duh. Nevertheless it's an action flick so check your brains at the door and enjoy this movie for all it's testosteroney goodness.

His demise was also a let down I felt there wasn't a big enough showdown between him and Aron Kwok. Mark was excellent in this as usual with his fighting he did not look out of place infact his form and acrobats beat the others hands down and he did some impressive stunt work whereas say Van Damme would have been consistently doubled. The film has a good pace Coolio is funny in an over the top way and there are some exceptional stunts. The fight scenes are first class although as far as Hong Kong goes I have seen better and some unrealistic stunts and wire work also look dodgy but overall I was entertained. Dacascos stole the show for me and his only weak moment was where he was smoking a cigar it is obvious he's not really a smoker with his strict training he undertakes and the fact he looked like he was going to throw up aswell as a sore sounding throat. Overall this is a good way to pass 90 or so minutes although the DVD I own has a bad picture and mediocre sound. 710".

China Strike Force is also totally preposterous much of the time and requires a huge amount of suspension of disbelief but it is precisely this bonkers 'screw logic' approach that makes matters so entertaining.The opening scene gives a pretty good indication of what we're in for cop buddies Alex Leehom Wang and Darren Aaron Kwok are on a mission to save a hostage and use their martial arts skills to pummel the enemy into submission. After much hardhitting violence it is revealed that the whole thing is actually a police training exerciseone in which the pretend enemy are willing to take an awful lot of damage for the sake of realism and in which Alex and Darren seem more than happy to risk blindness the other cops content to shoot the good guys in the head with paintballs!.After this daft intro we get into the story proper Coolio plays a drug dealer also named Cooliowhat are the chances? trying to break into the Chinese market. Mark Dacascos is Tony Lau Coolio's Shanghai contact who goes against his uncle Ma's wishes by importing narcotics. Wang and Kwok are the policemen out to stop the drug smugglers helped by beautiful Japanese Interpol agent Norika played by the dropdead gorgeous Norika Fujiwara. And that's really all you need to know about the plot 'cos all the fun is in the fast furious and farfetched actionMarvel as one of the cops rides a motorbike onto the roof of a car and then defies physics by leaping onto the top level of an open top bus. Watch in amazement as a racing car is driven underneath a moving lorry at high speed. Drool in excitement as Noriko does stretching exercises in a prison cell. Thrill to the sight of Kwok and Dacascos fighting on top of a pimped up purple and yellow Rolls Royce suspended from the bottom of a helicopter. And stare in disbelief as Coolio Noriko and Kwok battle it out on a plate glass window teetering like a seesaw hundreds of feet above ground level.Thanks to its deathdefying stuntwork check out the end credits to see some of the not so successful attempts and director Stanley Tong's excellent handling of the action China Strike Force manages to be a hugely enjoyable nobrainereven with Coolio in it!".

Coolio Coolio no that's not a mistake in what has to be the most perfect casting of all time Coolio just happens to play a guy named Coolio is a gangsta from South Central L.A. who is trying to make inroads into the Hong Kong criminal underworld. So naturally Tony and Coolio gravitate toward each other so they can achieve their own personal aims. Meanwhile cops Darren Tong Kwok and Alex Cheung Wang are part of an elite squad who are determined to stop the gangsters and the drugs they import. These guys will stop at nothing and they're constantly doing crazy stunts to stop the baddies. When they're transferred to Lung Cheng their contact is Sheriff Lin Chun who resembles a Chinese Joe Mantegna. But the real question is who is the mysterious and beautiful Norika Fujiwara? Where do her allegiances lie? So sets the stage for the ultimate showdown between cops and criminals. What will happen? Perhaps the question foremost in the minds of viewers of China Strike Force is why...WHY is Coolio of all people involved in a Hong Kong action film? And why is his name in the film Coolio? It would have made so much more sense for his character to have a different name because there is dialogue such as and I'm paraphrasing here Coolio killed my partner two years ago! Do they mean Coolio or...Coolio? And lets also keep in mind he has a fedorastyle hat with no top so his bizarre plantlike hair can sprout out the top of the hat. Words can't describe how silly this looks. But in all seriousness he and Mark Dacascos have good chemistry together and for American audiences like us they are the two names in the cast so we already have a sort of recognition factor with them. While Coolio's stereotypical chattering can get irritating it makes you wonder why this didn't become a threepart series like Rush Hour.Seeing as China Strike Force is light in the character and plot development departments it makes up for it with stunt work and Martial Arts fights. The stunts stand out as being particularly impressive especially the car chases. But it's not really enough to keep a 90 minute film afloat so there is definitely some filler. But it should be noted that American movies have either a Black Yelling Chief BYC or a White Yelling Chief WYC at the precinct but here in a wild twist is a CYC or Chinese Yelling Chief. But the movie as a whole has a huge American influence as best indicated by its numerous Arnold Schwarzenegger references. And of course the presence of the one and only Coolio who  though you have to wait quite a while for it  gets to do some CoolioFu on his opponents. And in an unintentionally? Meta sequence we find out Coolio is played by Coolio while Coolio music plays on the soundtrack. We believe the official mathematical term for that is Coolio Cubed.In the end China Strike Force isn't really the most consequential movie out there but it makes for a decently entertaining onetime watch thanks to the obvious care that went into the stunt work.".

	schema:reviewBody "I sought the movie for my Mark Dacascos collection and because of him I watched it all the way through. The scenes he's in are solid and of course his fists and footwork are the icing on this otherwise dry cake. The movie begins very slowly and seems disjointed. You have to piece together plot elements which is unfortunate because a little bit more effort to include the viewer would have improved the flow. The places where you get a break from that feel opportunistic and thin. There is a feeling that the characters are just trying to get to the next action sequence and those aren't welltimed or particularly powerful. Everyone in the film is visually interesting but the backdrops seem opportunistic and static and the stunts often look like the evening news shot too wide and far away never sharp or startling enough to rouse. Kwok looks like he's really trying to find a character in there somewhere he's likable and the bits of banter that occur between Darren Kwok and his partner Alex make you want to see their efforts succeed but it's just too little spread too thin and nobody else is acting like there's room for humor in the scene. Mark Dacascos is topnotch with what he's given. If you like how he moves his presence through a scene using his skin eyes those long elegant hands you'll appreciate his sense of proportion here. He brings the film a sense of solidity when he's in the frame and offers the only intimacy in the venture using his eyes to evoke it even though his character is aloof. Coolio wields a brutally candid hood mentality charm pulling no punches with his brazenly observant racism. I found it refreshing and palatable  it's aimed at everybody even his old friend Tony Lau Dacascos. His abrasive drama plays well off Dacascos' polished and saturnine hauteur but the two of them aren't enough to carry a film about two other guys and some other stuff... and that's exactly what this feels like. The action scenes are slow and shot from less than optimal angles. There are ways to shoot people who look this interesting  Andrezej Bartkowiak and Christophe Gans both know how to put a camera on Mark Dacascos and with the abundance of attractive personages it's too bad that didn't happen here. I was hoping for another Cradle 2 The Grave something that surprised my mode of thought and shook up the mix that had punch pride and balance. I was sorely let down. Even so I give it four stars out of ten all of it due to Mark and Coolio. If you want to watch a movie that goes where this one doesn't  see Cradle 2 the Grave for some goodlooking people broken stereotypes nice dialogue fine music and superb acting by DMX. If you want mystery lyrical execution passion and art with your kung fu  see Crying Freeman for its beautiful dialogue and provocative tone set by Gans' shooting and Julie Condra's amazing voice flowing throughout. Mark Dacascos is in them both for all the right reasons.".

	onyx:emotionText "I sought the movie for my Mark Dacascos collection and because of him I watched it all the way through. The scenes he's in are solid and of course his fists and footwork are the icing on this otherwise dry cake. The movie begins very slowly and seems disjointed. You have to piece together plot elements which is unfortunate because a little bit more effort to include the viewer would have improved the flow. The places where you get a break from that feel opportunistic and thin. There is a feeling that the characters are just trying to get to the next action sequence and those aren't welltimed or particularly powerful. Everyone in the film is visually interesting but the backdrops seem opportunistic and static and the stunts often look like the evening news shot too wide and far away never sharp or startling enough to rouse.

The worst performance is unquestionably that ofCoolio as a badass black gangster from South Central. GrantedCoolio probably doesn't aspire to play Shakespeare although I'dbe quite interested to see him try because he can act and has acertain presence but as he hams his way through this cruderacial caricature it's impossible not to imagine that he had hiseyes firmly fixed on his paycheck throughout and that it wasapparently large enough to overcome any scruples he might havehad about the role. It would be nice to think that one day the blackman as swaggering pimp archetype will follow Uncle Tom ontohistory's cutting room floor but China Strike Force unfortunatelyconfirms that that day isn't here yet.Marc Dacascos radiates his usual gravitas but after a while of thisyou start asking yourself why he is lending his air of dignity tosuch a shallow and uninteresting film.

There are occasionalattempts at humor but no one seems to care whether the gagscome off of not so they mostly languish and die. The funniest partof the movie is probably an outtake involving some fizzy Vitamin Ctablets which suggests that the budget could have been reducedand the movie improved by firing Coolio and replacing him with afew bottles of soluble aspirin.Martial arts fans may enjoy the fight sequences for their settings ifnot for their virtuosity but there's a definite sense that everything'sbeen done before and better elsewhere.

He might have found a niche that he excels in but there aren't enough movie of this type made in Hong Kong. The action in this movie stretches believability a bit. Like in the motor cycle chase scene the bike literally climbs up vertically on the back of the van then launches off its roof on an angle to land on top of a double decker bus. Not likely to happen !The rap music used in this movie sounds very dated and using them were a fad the year this movie was made.

	schema:headline " You outlived your life you outlived your kind";
	schema:reviewBody "Man of the West was the last Western directed by Anthony Mann it also  stands as one of his best works in the genre. The film belongs to a  transition category of Westerns it was released in a period when the  Western practically ceased to be a pure and innocent adventure of  cowboys and Indians a conquering of the West by hopeful pioneers and  instead was substituted by a more pessimistic somewhat more mature  adult and even philosophical approach. The Man of the West is a clear  representation of that change being one of the pioneers in the  category along with John Ford's The Searchers which was made about the  same time the change that was finalized in what is considered as a  symbolic death of the Western classical genre  John Ford's The Man Who  Shoot Liberty Valance.  With all its pessimism and extreme almost sadistic violence Man of  the West is also an undoubted predecessor to the Westerns made later in  the '60s by Sam Pekinpah beginning with 1962 Ride the High Country and  culminating in what considered his best 1969 The Wild Bunch.  In Man of the West the transition the change in the genre incarnates  itself in a figure of Link Jones wonderfully played by Gary Cooper.  Right from the opening scene of the film we are introduced to him as he  appears on the horizon of the classical Western's landscape a figure  that looks like it had been moulded out of as much marked by the time  as the hero himself surrounding scenery. And when he enters the town in  a classical Western manner of a stranger sure of his strength the  voyage to the past really begins a past which starts to hunt the main  character in almost an exact proportion as it revealed to us. A past  that finds its threatening personification in a most evil character of  Dock Tobin superbly played by Lee J. Cobb. An old outlaw who once was  Link's buddy and who somehow managed to survive all those years still  remaining in action outliving his kind outliving his life  representing no more nor less than a shadow of the classical Western  bad guy figure and opposing Link his once best friend and now enemy of  equally phantomous nature. The confrontation reaches its peak and draws  to its conclusion in the phantomtown of Lassoo left by its  inhabitants a long time ago and populated only by ghosts and aged  Mexican couple before our heroes' arrival. This is where the final duel  between the two parties takes place a duel where again the deviation  from the classical Western style is so obvious where actually the  classical duel scheme finds its end when the opponents breaking all the  codes and leaving all the moral preoccupations aside shoot each other  in pure struggle for survival motivated by the overwhelming hate and  the desire to erase the past. The final result is one of the most  tragic and pessimistic Westerns in the cinema's history. 910".

	schema:reviewBody "Stranded in the middle of nowhere after their train is robbed a former outlaw a schoolteacher and a gambler take refuge with the gang that the former outlaw once belonged to in this dark western drama. Taking refuge does not come easy to the onceoutlaw played by Gary Cooper as he has to pretend to still be a tough lawbreaker despite reforming his ways and there is a lot of tension in the air as the gang members are equally as uneasy about his return. The plot actually has a lot in common with David Cronenberg's 'A History of Violence' with Cooper having to face the violent past that he thought he left behind. Cooper never quite seems right in the role though aside from being two decades older than his character it is hard to ever imagine Cooper once being a hardened outlaw. As a character he is not as well developed as Viggo Mortensen in 'A History of Violence' either with the train robbery happening before we even have a chance to know him. The film is also set back by a melodramatic music score from Leigh Harline that comes off as overbearing half the time. The film does have its moments though. The long distance shots of Cooper entering the supposedly abandoned cabin are great capturing the eerie isolation of the place. The scene in which Julie London is told to strip at knife point is nailbitingly intense too and while he looks too young to really be Cooper's uncle Lee J. Cobb is delightful in the role radiating both danger and a sense of longing wanting so much to reconnect with the outlaw nephew he thought he lost forever.".

	schema:headline " Gritty Violent Anthony Mann Western";
	schema:reviewBody "Man of the West being an Anthony Mann directed western contains a good deal of violence. Usually starring James Stewart this one stars Gary Cooper in one of the best roles of his career. The story centers on Cooper as a reformed outlaw who boards a train with Julie London as a saloon girl and Arthur O'Connell as a fast talking gambler. Along the way the train is held up and the three are left behind. They stumble upon a shack that turns out to be the hide out of the men who had held up the train. Led by a slightly mad Lee J. Cobb the gang includes Jack Lord as Cobb's sadistic henchman and veteran western performers John Dehner Robert J. Wilke and Royal Dano as the other gang members. Turns out that Cooper had once been a member of Cobb's gang. There is a violent fight between Cooper and Lord that is the highlight of the film. There is also an graphic for the time shootout in a deserted town and the ultimate showdown between Cooper and Cobb at the end. Cooper was a little long in the tooth at the time to be believable as Cobb's protege Cobb was actually 10 years younger but that can be overlooked due to the excellent performances by both actors. London has little to do but O'Connell is excellent as the gambler who finds his courage. Man of the West is arguably one of Cooper's best.".

Along the way the train is held up and the three are left behind. They stumble upon a shack that turns out to be the hide out of the men who had held up the train. Led by a slightly mad Lee J. Cobb the gang includes Jack Lord as Cobb's sadistic henchman and veteran western performers John Dehner Robert J. Wilke and Royal Dano as the other gang members. Turns out that Cooper had once been a member of Cobb's gang. There is a violent fight between Cooper and Lord that is the highlight of the film. There is also an graphic for the time shootout in a deserted town and the ultimate showdown between Cooper and Cobb at the end. Cooper was a little long in the tooth at the time to be believable as Cobb's protege Cobb was actually 10 years younger but that can be overlooked due to the excellent performances by both actors. London has little to do but O'Connell is excellent as the gambler who finds his courage. Man of the West is arguably one of Cooper's best.";

A gang robs the train where Link is traveling including his luggage with the money the train successfully escapes from them but the singer Billie Ellis Julie London Sam Beasley Arthur OConnell and him are accidentally left behind in an isolated place many miles far from any city. The next train will pass by the region only a week later and they look for a shelter for the cold night. They find an abandoned ranch where Link used to live.

A tense dramatic and violent relationship develops between Link and the group with tragic consequences.  This western is very different from the others without action but having dramatic psychological drama instead including a claustrophobic situation in the house. Gary Cooper plays a protective good man who wants to forget his past Julie London's role is a lonely woman who does not love any man or anything but who falls in love with Link and the performances of the bad guys' are fantastic. This movie is really a classic western. My vote is eight.Title Brazil O Homem do Oeste' The Man of the West".

	schema:reviewBody "GARY COOPER plays a man haunted by his shady past when he's stranded by the side of the railroad tracks after a train robbery along with JULIE London and ARTHUR O'CONNELL. He finds shelter for them in a shack inhabited by several former gang members he'd been associated with including his derelict uncle LEE J. COBB the boisterous head of the gang. JACK LORD is the prize villain of the piece almost unrecognizable as the man who later starred in Hawaii Five0 of TV fame.But the story is a nasty one none of the desperadoes worth caring about and Cooper is unable to do much with his role of reformed outlaw trying to turn his life around and save schoolteachersinger London from the clutches of an evil gang.He manages to do exactly that in the course of the film's running time but by that time there's been such extravagant overthetop acting by LEE J. COBB he chews every piece of scenery to bits as opposed to Cooper's man of a few words antihero played with such lethargy by Cooper that you have to suspect he was already feeling the signs of illness that would take his life a few years later. He looks aged and worn remaining stoic throughout in what has to be one of the stiffest performances he ever gave in a western.There's a violent physical battle between Cooper and Lord where it's obvious that a stuntman is filling in for Gary in the long shots. The role should have been played by a much younger man. JACK LORD gives one of the film's best performances as the most ornery of Cobb's sons. POSSIBLE SPOILER  The final showdown after a gun battle in which Cooper emerges the hero has him confronting LEE J. COBB and telling him he's taking him in so society can punish him. Cobb resists and starts shooting and then Cooper has no choice but to shoot him. Cobb's fall down the side of a steep rocky hillside is the last word in dramatic death falls as he flails around and stumbles to his resting place. It seemed a fittingly overdramatic end to Cobb's larger than life performance here.Summing up Downbeat western has little new to offer and Cooper's tired look doesn't serve the character well.".

	schema:reviewBody "Tense  violent epic Western in which Gary Cooper  Lee J Cobb and Julie London stand out . Brilliant and taut Western with wonderful use of locations and topoftherange cast . Gary Cooper is the Man of the West  a reformed outlaw called Link Jones Gary Cooper  he bravely did his own horseriding scenes despite physical pain from a car accident years earlier though becomes stranded after an aborted train robbery with two other passengers Julie London  Arthur O'Connell . Cooper is forced to rejoin his excolleague Lee J Cobb and exboss to save himself and other innocent people from the band's Jack Lord  Robert J Wilke Royal Dano mistreatment .Magnificent Western plenty of thrills  shootouts  violence  gorgeous landscapes and results to be pretty entertaining . This excellent Western deserves another look at 1958  nowadays is better considered then the 50s when was dismissed . In spite of its violence that influenced in Spaghetti Western  Man of the West turns out to be an essential and indispensable Western for hardcore aficionados . JeanLuc Godard a film critic before he became a director raved about the film saying it was the best film of that year  because of his recommendation the film has been reevaluated and is now considered a classic western . Gary Cooper is frankly well in the role that fits him like a gun fits a holster .Gary Cooper was at 56 a decade older than Lee J. Cobb who played his Uncle Dock Tobin  in the film Cooper and John Dehner talk about being children together  Dehner was actually fourteen years younger than Cooper . However  Stewart Granger was originally announced for the lead role and James Stewart eagerly sought the role played by Gary Cooper but since Stewart had fallen out with director Anthony Mann he did not get the part . Very good support cast formed by notorious secondaries such as Jack Lord  Royal Dano  Robert J Wilke  Arthur O'Connell  Frank Ferguson and special mention to Lee J Cobb . Colorful cinematography in CinemaScope by Ernest Haller . Powerful and thrilling musical score by Leigh Harline . This topdrawer Western was stunningly realized by the master Anthony Mann  infusing the traditional Western with psychological confusion  including his characteristic use of landscape with marvelous use of outdoors which is visually memorable . Mann established his forte with magnificent Western almost always with James Stewart . In his beginnings he made ambitious but shortlived quality lowbudget surroundings of EagleLion production as Tmen  They walked by night  Raw deal  Railroaded and Desperate . Later on  he made various Western  remarkably good  masterpieces such as The furies  and Devil's doorway and several with his habitual star  James Stewart as Winchester 73  Bend the river and The far country . They are characterized by roles whose determination to stick to their guns would take them to the limits of their endurance . Others in this throughly enjoyable series include Tin star  and Man of the West is probably one of the best Western in the fifties and sixties . After the mid50  Mann's successes came less frequently  though directed another good Western with Victor Mature titled The last frontier. And of course Man of the West  that turns out to be stylish  fast paced  solid  meticulous  with enjoyable look  and most powerful and wellconsidered . This well acted movie is gripping every step of the way . It results to be a splendid western and remains consistently agreeable . Rating  Above average  the result is a topofrange Western . Well worth watching and it will appeal to Gary Cooper fans .".

It is far superior to the vastly overrated The Searchers which came out during the same time period. Anthony Mann who directed noir films of the 40's did even better with the western genre. Man of the West is just as timely today as when it first appeared and has aged well like good wine. Psychological insight is provided on gang mentality and morality. This insight works as well with the outlaw gangs of the old west as it would if applied to the street gangs of today. What makes the Crips and the Bloods families of violence and disorder with their own brand of morality also tied the members of the western gangs together. In Man of the West the gang is actually made up of genetic family members. The acting is superior by all concerned. I would like to mention one actor that usually does not get his just desserts. Royal Dano does what was probably his best acting in this film as the mute Trout who doesn't utter a sound until he runs dying down the streets of the ghost town. Then he utters a bloodcurdling cry somewhere between a yelp and a scream. What I have written only skims the surface of a multileveled study of human behavior and interacting during the waning days of the old west. This is one of those movies that can be seen again and again with many new and fresh interpretations and ideas.".

	schema:reviewBody "Link Jones is on his way to Fort Worth to hire a schoolteacher having left his wife and children behind Link appears to be the epitome of the simple honest man. However the train he is on is robbed by outlaws thus meaning that Link's past and his dubious family ties are all careering towards a day of reckoning.This was Anthony Mann's second to last foray into the Western genre and perhaps his most clinical as regards a structured tale of men as complicated as they are conflicted? I always find with Mann's Westerns that a sense of doom hangs heavy there are very few directors in Western cinema history who have this knack of filling the viewer with such a pervading feeling of unease. Here we have Gary Cooper as Link on the surface an amiable man but the sequence of events see him thrust back into a life he thought had long since gone the term that a leopard never changes its spots sits rather well but here we find Mann fleshing out his lead character with an acknowledgement that a former life has passed with Cooper perfectly transcending this well scripted arc.What strikes me mainly about this piece is that Mann's characters are not the quintessential good vs bad characters these are just men with their own individual hang ups they all are fallible human beings and that is something that surely we all can identity with? The acting across the board here is top notch Cooper is excellent replacing Mann's stock Western muse James Stewart he cements his earthy and identifiable worth wholesale. Lee J. Cobb actually is the glue that holds the film together his portrayal of Dock Tobin perfectly plays alongside Cooper's emotive showing of Link Jones's confliction. Sadly a negative to me is that we are asked to believe that Gary Cooper is Lee J. Cobb's nephew a difference of ten years has to be a casting error one feels. Still the film comes highly recommended because the intelligence and dark atmosphere of the piece makes it well worth emotional investment whilst Cooper's two main fights both different are seriously great cinema. 8.510".

Ford still owns second place with My Darling Clementine which is pound for pound better than this one and Red River still beats Clementine but my God when all of these are stacked up together its no wonder that there is nobody around to even want to beat them. And I am leaving out Raoul Walsh in the bargain. And even in such a glittering mist Man of the West owns a pretty fine piece of territory.The opening is perhaps a bit weak and the plot from then on worse than thin very convenient that this band of outlaws are still living at the same house where Cooper killed with them and about five or six other ludicrosities but what the hell give yourself over to just watching yourself plopped into a writhing snake den and you will be just fine. It's the last third of the film that is near perfection only a few films rivaling it in intensity the last 30 of Touch of Evil Citizen Kane Clementine Red River and very few others. The weakness of the first and middle perhaps is what led the critics of the day to overlook the brilliance of the last of it. But from the moment of Cooper taunting Lord to sneak up behind him to start their fight it just never lets up. The fight is astonishing not as good as one has noted herekicking and hitting brawl in Treasure of Sierra Madre and Fritz Lang has a great tooth and claw one in Cloak and Dagger but this one is pretty damned amazing and then the buildup to Lassoo killing of Trout and THEN the shootout between Cooper and Dehner is just as good as the great if longer one in Clementine. By then Mann had learned to simplify and strip his camera let it roam some nobody with a functioning set of eyes will not wind up hypnotized with this shootout. Absolutely fabulous. Then the King Lear like nod comes with Cooper returning to the raped Julie London and mad white haired Lee j. Cobb and Mann once again shoots a finale in echoing rocks also quite nice and somehow even the hokey words of London as they ride off into the hills almost works.

	schema:reviewBody "Man of the West the film that JeanLuc Godard called the best one of 1958 when he was at Cashiers du cinema is both brutal and sad in how it places its characters into states of being no one can really get out of. One may call it fate or just bad luck when Link Jones finds himself off the train taking him back to his home and finds the one place he'd rather not go to is the only one close by and happens to have his Uncle Dock Tobin and his cousins but much of it comes back to the domination of MEN in this world the 'Man' of the title is meant to be Gary Cooper and yet it could be any of the men in here. What does it mean to be a man here? For those people wanting someone with honor and integrity one might look to Cooper's character.What's fascinating is how much of an inner struggle he is having as he comes back to his former home where his uncle taught him to be a man along with his cousins and it was in the ways of being a robber and a killer. He tried to leave that life behind but somehow some way he's pulled back in to it not that his face possibly tipping off an oldtime marshall won't get the old wanted posters out again. So when he happens along to his former criminal gunslinging bankrobbing kin when off of this train with a good woman Julie London as Billie and Arthur O'Connell as a man who seems like a possible annoyance at first and who isn't so much once the drama really unfolds it creates an instant conflict.This is Mann's territory of the dysfunctional families out in the west see also Winchester 73 with the brothers who have gone down very different roads of killing or The Furies with its fatherdaughter power struggles and he mines it for some rich dramatic terrain. it's amazing so much of this movie works even when knowing what isn't quite right about it  the age disparity is hard not to see with Cooper trying to play younger and to be fair not doing a terrible job and Lee J. Cobb as his uncle with a gray wig and some makeup that isn't wholly convincing certainly on first glance not to mention his character was a kid with one actor half his age  because the acting sells every tensionpacked moment. And few moments are more tense and sad and almost tough to watch as when the men demand that Billie take off her clothes in front of them it takes a knife to Cooper's throat to convince her to start doing it.That by the way has the feel of a rape scene because it is later offscreen there is another and Mann shows us enough of the aftermath and London is heartbreaking in every moment that Billie is put through the wringer and yet the only thing that stops that violation of her agency to go further is that Uncle Dock says it's time for bed. Man of the West is the kind of film that gains in uneasiness and violence including a fight scene midway through the movie that does not look fun like many more possible hacky directors or just more commercial minded might have done. At one point it's Cooper vs one of this gang and it goes on and on feeling not unlike something out of the fight scene from They Live only without the sense of over the top spectacle. This is rough and ragged and there's a point where the movie ness of it goes away and it's just watching two bedraggled men duking it out  including ultimately a humiliation that Link does that seems to set off this guy more than a simple shot to the head might do.What on the surface may seem like a straightforward thriller turns into a moral tale about the implicit terror that masculinity brings to people in the old west  not unlike Winchester 73 a subtle commentary on the form while getting to be it in the 1950's of course  and Cobb makes this uncle an imposing presence over everyone how could he not after all he's Lee J friggin Cobb! Cooper brings a sad dignity to the man someone who no longer wants to kill and at the same time can spring into action if he's pushed into a corner which you know is what this movie could also be called Cornered in the West or something like that. Mann and his writers have here less a story that's meant to arouse excitement as much as contemplating what it fully means when someone gets shot what that violence entails or what happens when a woman is stripped away down to what she's made for when she Billie says to Link that he's the first man she can remember in a long time if ever to not look at her as something to be had or defiled we believe it. And yet London as an actress gives her a ton of screen presence and little moments that don't make her one dimensional.It may fall short of being a best of 1958 like Mr. Godard said but I can see his love for the movie it's more concerned with ideas and notions of the old west than having it be just empty action and gunfights and exploring the psychology to be pretentious about it of the west itself of what an outlaw family entails and then what it means to be a good person in a world where it's so easy to get a gun and go out and shoot for cash and gold. 8.510".

But I will say I found Man of the West an extremely entertaining film to watch if you are a staunch fan of adult western genre as I am and this film was not made for Roy Rogers and the Sons of the Pioneers type I will also add that Man of the West was a triumphal exit from western films for director Anthony Mann. Dramatic and powerful gritty acts of violence played by ruthless characters along with the balance of Gary Cooper's reformed outlaw character trying to keep himself and Julie London alive brings forth some tense suspenseful moments. Man of the West achieves all that is expected from an above average western with some surprisingly risqu scenes for a 1958 film involving Julie London's character forced to strip for the brutish outlaw gang while Cooper looks on helplessly with a knife being held at his throat as the clothes come off the blood begins to trickle down Cooper's neck. I give all the actors credit for their fine performances and the highest quality cinematography enhances this well paced story. Man of the West is a must see film for Gary Cooper and Julie London fans alike. Many will be surprised by the ruthless character Jack Lord plays with extremely realistic acting. This 1958 film still reaps plenty of exciting adult western entertainment.".

	schema:reviewBody "A nice guy Gary Cooper's career had run out of steam by the 1950s and he made a string of mostly undistinguished Westerns. Man of the West is one of the better ones directed by Mad Anthony Mann. Mann was the fellow responsible for reviving Jimmy Stewart's postwar career as a dramatic actor in some brutal Westerns.Cooper isn't that good a replacement for Stewart. As an actor he's not as good at projecting anguish or rage. And he's older. When he's knocked down in a fist fight or falls to the floor after being wounded there's a painful quality about the scene because no one enjoys seeing the limbs of a tall and elderly man flailing about.Yet this is pretty rugged stuff  due to the direction and performances not the screenplay. The plot has Cooper and two other innocents left behind by a train in the middle of nowhere. They're a hundred miles from the nearest town so Cooper leads them to a sprawling shack whose location he recalls from his young more reckless days. Alas the shack is still occupied by Cooper's onetime companion Dock Tobin Lee J. Cobb and his gang of four including some sterling character actors like the mute Royal Dano the retarded Robert Wilkes the wolfish Jack Lord and the thoughtful John Dehner.Cooper had wised up and ridden away from the gang years ago but Dock welcomes him back believing he means to stay. He also welcomes one of Cooper's companions the Hollywoodglamorized Julie London for somewhat different reasons. The third companion Arthur O'Connell generates no interest in the gang. O'Connell's character's name is Sam Beasley which tells you just about all you need to know. For what it's worth O'Connell and Jack Lord give the two most notable performances. Lord fights Cooper in a jagged scene and Cooper humiliates and tears Lord's clothes off in public. A memorable fist fight.Anyway Cooper claims that Julie London is his woman and goes along with Dock's assumption that Cooper is here to stay. He isn't of course and when the bullets fly at the end in the ghost town Cooper and London are left standing.Cobb's Dock Tobin is a slob but a sentimental one. He puts a stop to Jack Lord's rape of Julie London and otherwise keeps order among his wild gang. One doesn't REALLY want to see him killed. He's not pure evil like Jack Lord. So in order to justify Cooper's shooting of Dock the writers have him rape Julie London in Cooper's absence. It's out of character but provides the viewer with some sense of satisfied revenge as we watch the plugged Dock roll endlessly down a long steep hill bouncing flapping but always downward as if that rolling will never stop looking remarkably like the stock market the day after I get giddy enough to dip a toe in it.One of the major irritations I had with this movie common to the genre are the names of the characters. My own extensive research of real cowboy names reveals that Link never occurs nor Matt Luke or Clint. The three most common names in fact are Alistair Governeur and Montmorency. Will these clichs never end?As a Western above average for the 1950s but not by much.".

He puts a stop to Jack Lord's rape of Julie London and otherwise keeps order among his wild gang. One doesn't REALLY want to see him killed. He's not pure evil like Jack Lord. So in order to justify Cooper's shooting of Dock the writers have him rape Julie London in Cooper's absence. It's out of character but provides the viewer with some sense of satisfied revenge as we watch the plugged Dock roll endlessly down a long steep hill bouncing flapping but always downward as if that rolling will never stop looking remarkably like the stock market the day after I get giddy enough to dip a toe in it.One of the major irritations I had with this movie common to the genre are the names of the characters. My own extensive research of real cowboy names reveals that Link never occurs nor Matt Luke or Clint. The three most common names in fact are Alistair Governeur and Montmorency. Will these clichs never end?As a Western above average for the 1950s but not by much.";

	schema:reviewBody "I tend to love anything that Anthony Mann touches and this movie no exception. Mann's Noir films seem as much the work of DP John Alton as Mann but with this western Mann proves himself a brilliant collaborator with big name DPs by teaming with vibrant color specialist Ernest Haller of Gone With the Wind fame. The film's primary color is green unspoiled like the grass of the landscapes of nineteenthcentury north Texas but also bringing to mind all that is least reassuring about nature its capacity to engulf and disorient. This is a very unconventional western. But unlike many films that adopt a western milieu but do not want to succumb to the genre's tired traditions Man of the West does not selfconsciously invert or critique those conventions. It silently yet almost defiantly ignores them. Throughout his career Mann was brilliant at the subtle evocation of cruelty. But this film is his most potent portrayal of depravity. The scenes in the villains' layer reminded me of nothing less than those in Lynch's Blue Velvet that focus on Frank and his crew. The primary difference is that Frank is a kind of antiGod his awfulness seems like a conduit of a cosmic menace. Mann's monsters are fully of this world. Indeed they are depraved in the fullest sense of the word violent and deranged yet also degraded and debased. Nor is the nameless or is it multinamed? protagonist played by Gary Cooper whose acting doesn't drag this work down like it does in many of his movies a true western hero. He is presented as a good man or at least a vastly better person than are his opponents yet the violence he uses to dispatch his enemies is not transcendental heroic violence. He's just a more clever and sneaky talented murderer than are his foes. This is not good triumphing over evil. It is the strong exterminating the weak and this deflates any sense of the film's happy ending giving credence to any mythology of the west. This is not myth this is a nasty little tale of people killing people and it feels so much more profound for it. Some of my favorite moments in art arise from what I might call accidental philosophizing when a work almost in spite of itself describes something in a new way that forces one to abandon if only for a second preconceived notions of what that work and maybe our world can be. There is an exchange of dialogue in this film that is a prime example I used to live here. Were you a boy then? I don't know what I was.".

	schema:reviewBody "As the movie was drawing to a close the question of whether one could really jump over an oncoming car was nagging me. Some brief research highlighted an increase of the average car height throughout recent decades to about 1.5 meters but one could certainly go for an aggressive sports car which only measures about 1.2 meters. The world record for high jump stands at 2.5 meters but that's a running jump so can you do it standing still as the movie suggests? Putting my metaphorical glasses back on I'll admit my interest was piqued when the realization came about that this movie is inspired by Werner Herzog's hike from Munich to Paris in 1974 in support of his mentor Lotte Eisner. Here our lead Julian is a young man institutionalized for harboring said belief of car jumping which ends up causing a tragic accident wherein his best friend is killed. The story kicks off with Julian's escape from the facility he was being held in as he aims to walk over 600 km to the house where his friend's father lives recovering after a heart attack. The point of walking is to focus all his energy towards the father's betterment in the spirit of a 'holy' pilgrimage. Along the way Julian meets up with Ju and Ruth both in need of a long walk to cleanse their unhappiness. All the while Jan is on their heels trying to find and return Julian to the asylum.This constitutes the main theme of the movie a paradoxical one at that taking on a selfishselfless journey an escape from how the world sees you how you see the world and how you see yourself. The great thing is that it works really well as the characters come off stoic and for the most part relatable. Julian's quest for redemption Ju's attempt to emote again and Ruth's struggle to feel selfworthy alongside Jan 'the jailer' who finds himself in a purgatory of his own making make for a soulful exploration. The gorgeous backdrop of the German countryside turns what could have otherwise been an average experience into a tactful bout of escapism. Embellished with moments of both sensitive and caricaturistic humour the story is packaged tightly until the last fifteen minutes.This brings me to the two limitations impairing my enjoyment. Firstly it is guilty of romanticizing away the complexity of the story as it needlessly and unsubtly provides outlines for both characters and themes. Secondly the ending is drawn out and too sweet for comfort as the mystery is shattered and the stars realign. The reason why I would rather not dwell on these things is because the cinematic journey managed to inspire me. Upon its conclusion I had become all silly and was thinking about biking for days or heading out to an isolated cabin in the middle of the mountains. Director Baker Monteys proves to be a good paysagist of the soul if not quite the storyteller. There everyone can be a little pretentious!".

	schema:reviewBody "Der Mann der ber Autos sprang or The Man Who Jumped Over Cars is a German 105minute movie from 2010. And even if it is already more than 5 years old it is still the most recent filmmaking effort by writer and director Nick BakerMonteys and also his only theatrical release full feature film. The name of the filmmaker does not sound German to me but this film is and this should also become obvious pretty quickly if you look at the cast list. The two protagonists are played by Robert Stadlober and Jessica Schwarz. Stadlober I am not a fan of at all and I don't think he is good enough for lead roles or has ever been. Jessica Schwarz I like more but she also did not impress me that much here. She had zero chemistry with Stadlober I must say and this really hurts the film. What also hurts it is that it becomes once again painfully obvious how limited Stadlober is.The title is certainly a bit pretentious but the film also does not manager to deliver in terms of the story. Here and there we have a few good moments but all in all this was never a convincing artistic achievement. The story feels really unrealistic for the most part and I am fairly certain in real life the main female character would not have had any real interested in the male protagonist. The happy ending felt forced too and I usually hate that if they pick such a path instead of realism. And was up with the audience finding out towards the end that Stadlober's character is actually some kind of lunatic. And we are still supposed to like him? I did not for the entire film. He just seemed stupid and awkward to be but not in a good way and this applies to the whole movie. I don't recommend the watch.".

	schema:reviewBody "I think that Demi Moore was bold to go with the little known Ocracoke NC accent because most people will probably wrongly think that she was doing a very bad job at a North CarolinianSouthern USA accent.Ocracoke is a small fisherman's island at the bottom of the North Carolina Outer Banks island chain and is only accessible by ferry. This isolation has kept the accent there mostly unaltered since the 17th century days when it was inhabited by British seamen. The Ocracoke accent sounds like a mixture of Brit and Yank so what you hear Demi Moore doing in this movie is really quite accurate.I also enjoyed the cozy portrayal of the Manhattan NYC side street neighborhood life. The NYC avenues tend to be wide impersonal and busy but the narrower townhouse and small shop filled side streets can be quite friendly. It gives me some nice childhood nostalgic memories to see the happier daytoday aspect of NYC life shown in this film.I watch this romantic comedy whenever it is on TV and I have no complaints about it at all. I find it to be a sweet feelgood film with occasional hints at magic realism but without plunging too far into that iffy genre.I feel that all the players did good jobs and that the locations and settings felt very true. Nice production values too.If you like Moonstruck then you will probably like The Butcher's Wife too.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is the best performance Demi Moore has ever given in my opinion. She shows that despite her long time film career she is not the cookie cutter actress most people seem to want her to be. The accent she uses for this character is wonderfully eccentric and brings a realness to her that really makes her shine in this role. I loved her in the long blonde hair and flowy summer dresses much more then her typical costumes designed to show off her body. She was perfect as an out of whack psychic who can divine others fortunes accurately but not her own. This is a typical problem with true psychics by the way. The emotions they feel and the needs they have make it near impossible to accurately see their own future hint this is why you never see a psychic win the lottery. Demi is sweet and totally alluring in this film and anyone who says otherwise just has a grudge against her.This is a wonderfully whimsical romantic comedy with great acting on all parts. Mary Steenburgen plays a perfect shut in turned night club singer and sings beautifully in my opinion. Jeff Daniels is perfect as the semi neurotic psychiatrist whose life is being turned inside out by this lovely psychic. George Dzundza is a great comic butcher and shows that he really has the chops to be a great actor. I think the problem with this film is just that some people tend to take it to seriously and want too much from it. I have watched it over 30 times now and I love it more every single time I watch it. I wish Demi Moore would play more roles like this instead of crap like GI Jane and Charlie's Angels. As for the lesbianism add in I don't agree with homosexuality but I'm not going to force my sensibilities on other people. There are people that are homosexual there is no getting around it and as long as there are there will be some of that life style written into films. If you can't deal with it then just change the channel. Don't complain that Hollywood is trying to convert everyone because it simply isn't true. There is no homosexual conspiracy. Deal with it.".

If you can't deal with it then just change the channel. Don't complain that Hollywood is trying to convert everyone because it simply isn't true. There is no homosexual conspiracy. Deal with it.";

She plays a clairvoyant with an overactively romantic spirit who uses her gift for telling the future to act as a matchmaker to assorted residents of a small town one that resembles a small borough of New York. She tries out her whim by marrying the first man that touches her clairvoyant heart George Dzundza and goes to live and work with him in his butcher shop hence the title of the film. Jeff Daniels plays a shrink in the town whose advising is countered by Moore and her fortune telling leaving him to question her abilities and his own heart he falls for her too if you hadn't already guessed. There are some real wasted talents in this film including Mary Steenburgen who is a complete ditz with no real substance except to sing her heart out. Future Oscarwinner Frances McDormand also appears to no effect as a town lesbian. There is some beautiful set design for this film along with a few socalled magical portions but these sections precious few that they are have no connection with the rest of the heavily disjointed script.

It's this kind of thinking in Hollywoodthat a younger slimmer man would be a better catch for Demi Moore than a balding chubby guy like George Dzundzathat sinks most romantic comedies and nearly does this one in as well. Daniels is exasperating while trying to shrink Moore's head while Dzundza's fire is lighted by local spinster Mary Steenburgen a closet chanteuse. The film is not the merry romantic mixup it wants to be and Demi is too callow to be passed off as this blonde sweetheart she fails to connect with anyone onscreen not to mention the audience.

It's this kind of thinking in Hollywoodthat a younger slimmer man would be a better catch for Demi Moore than a balding chubby guy like George Dzundzathat sinks most romantic comedies and nearly does this one in as well. Daniels is exasperating while trying to shrink Moore's head while Dzundza's fire is lighted by local spinster Mary Steenburgen a closet chanteuse. The film is not the merry romantic mixup it wants to be and Demi is too callow to be passed off as this blonde sweetheart she fails to connect with anyone onscreen not to mention the audience. Perhaps happilyeverafter stylist Hughes was just the wrong pick as director he turns a promising scenario into a flatfooted sitcom.  from ";

I'll always remember the music the title song as well as the classical pieces used throughout the vestibule of Mimi Roger's apartment palace the scene of Tom Berenger having breakfast with his family Lorraine Bracco's fiery performance as his wife and the haunting opening aerial shots of NYC lit up at night.  I watched it again for the first time in probably nine or ten years and it was like visiting with an old friend or curling up with a good book you had read before.  You knew the story but it was all fascinatingly interesting.  The plot here is pretty basic working class cop has to babysit upper class babe who witnesses heinous murder.  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out how it all ends but director Ridley Scott somehow manages to keep it compelling thanks to some great direction and wonderful performances from the cast.  Somewhere I saw this billed as an erotic thriller which is way off base.  Scott keeps everything here extremely classy.  It's more of a romantic thriller and throwback to the noir films of the 1940's.  This may not be the best film you'll ever see but it's one of the better thrillers of the 1980's and a worthy testament to Ridley Scott's versatility as a director.  It's also nice to see Jerry Orbach in a supporting role that probably paved the way for his part in the never ending Law and Order TV series.".

This is a film with multiple agendas and Ridley Scott best known at the time for 1979's ALIEN and 1982's BLADE RUNNER is frankly an odd choice to direct such a picture. However Scott proves himself to be up to the challenge and film plays like a slightly abstract dream that isn't afraid to crash down into gritty realism on occasion. With his film noir skills perfected with BLADE RUNNER Scott turns the focus from the future to an equally idealized version of the present well 1987 to be exact but he maintains the same sense of visual menace and harsh industrialism.Tom Berenger has received a considerable amount of criticism for the irritating fake Brooklyn accent he delivers his lines in but I overall I found him to be quite acceptable in the role. Even better is Mimi Rogers who convincingly portrays the detached loneliness of the high society lifestyle without the benefit of screen dialogue that permits her to openly address such an issue. Jerry Orbach and John Rubinstein are also memorable supporting parts but it is Lorraine Bracco who steals the picture as Berenger's feisty wife. Long before she was best known as Tony Soprano's psychiatrist Bracco brought to the screen the ultimate portrayal of the modern wife and mother  loving but fierce tough but compassionate and not afraid to slap some sense into the man who has done her wrong.And I love Sting's opening rendition of the title Gershwin classic.".

Mike is assigned to protect her in the night shift in her apartment in Manhattan. When Venza threatens Claire the contact of Mike with Claire gets closer and conflicts him dividing between the love for his family and the heat passion for Claire and the fascination for her world. Today I have just watched Someone to Watch Over Me maybe for the sixth or seventh time and every time I see this movie I conclude that it is an underrated stylish masterpiece. Everything works perfectly in this film. The story may be not original the conclusion is quite moralist but there is an important and unusual approach regarding the difference of classes and consequently of worlds which is the basis for the conflictive romance between Claire and Mike. The direction of Ridley Scott is tight and perfect as usual using different angles camera and magnificent photography and shadows in the night to express the differences between the two worlds. There is one specific scene that I love when Mike is sat with his face half illuminated in the hall of Claire's apartment totally confused and with his feelings divided. The cast is very inspired and in my opinion this is the best role of Mimi Rogers amazingly perfect as an elegant wealthy and needy of love woman and wearing a beautiful hair style. Tom Berenger is outstanding as Mike and Lorraine Bracco is also fantastic in the role of a simple woman and wounded wife. The music score is awesome highlighting the three versions of the song of George and Ira Gershwin which gives the title of the film specially the last one with the interpretation of Roberta Flack. My vote is ten.Title Brazil Perigo na Noite Danger in the Night".

Berenger is solid in the lead and Bracco fantastic as the fiery wife while Rogers is sultry in a very classy way as the other woman. Andreas Katsulas is menacing and scary as Venza which was perfect for this part. The classical music scores add a perfect touch and the ending is actually quite thrilling.

	schema:headline " Well Made but Very Flat";
	schema:reviewBody "There is no doubt that Someone to Watch Over Me is a smoothly paced and extremely well made film. It is directed by Ridley Scott after all. There is also no doubt that the cast is fully capable and gets into their roles with a much needed grit and determination. Sadly there is also no doubt as to just how unmemorable the film is. Here you have Scott genre hopping once again with a story that has potential if told right and a talented cast that lend an air of believability to the cop genre when it is usually so overblown. Therefore it is so striking to me that so little of the film stays with you. It's almost as if those involved where intrigued by the premise but simply grew weary and bored the longer they were involved.Said premise is effectively that family man cop Mike is assigned to protect wealthy socialite Claire after she witness a murder and the mobster who did it vows to come after her. The problem here is that you know exactly where this story is going and if you think there's going to be any twists or changes to the formula then you are sadly mistaken. Mike's wife seems trusting at first and Claire seems to appreciate how much he cares for his family. Yet after some encounters bring them closer they become more attracted to each other and Mike's wife begins to become suspicious. It's a shame that so little comes of this. Mike's wife and Claire have almost no contact so we don't get any feisty scenes or morality questioning ones.Then you have the romance and it just doesn't work. Most of that comes from the fact that the actors have zero chemistry together. Though it's not that their performances are bad. Tom Berenger is one of the few serious actors of the time who could convincingly play a tough cop and Mimi Rogers does her best at giving Claire a gentle attractive personality. The romance itself is just on autopilot throughout. They have a few close calls he gets more protective and their suddenly head over heels. To the film's credit it is done with subtlety and isn't completely rushed but for it to work you really must believe that these two characters are genuinely in love with each other and I never got a sense of that.Lorraine Bracco performance as Mike's wife Ellie is one of the films best features. She brings a much needed liveliness and aggression to the film as well as providing the dialogue with the punch it calls for. The character is believable as a wife who has stuck by her husband through thick and thin whilst her more grounded beauty is a nice contrast to high glamour of Claire. I also think the scenes Berenger and Bracco share are always engaging and wellacted.There is a distinct lack of danger and intensity throughout the film that is really noticeable. There is a sort of shootout at Claire's apartment that lacks any sense of threat and the wouldbe assassin looks very similar to Berenger almost to the point where you can't tell who is who. The villain of the piece is so onenote uninteresting and underdeveloped that he's barely worth a mention. While the climax certainly gets across that the stakes are high it's a boring situation and one that is entirely predictable.Scott's visual flair is evident throughout the film. Its warm atmosphere and subdued lighting scheme fit the image of New York it creates. The opening credits sequence featuring Sting's title track floats over New York at night and it is a beautiful way to open the film. In a way the film restricts Scott somewhat and it's a shame that the films grittiness limits his eye here even if he does make the best of what he has. Michael Kamen's score is appropriately subdued and ambient suitably lurking in the background instead of jumping out at you. Questions have to be asked over the sets however with Claire's apartment appearing to be never ending.In reflecting on the film Someone to Watch Over Me becomes something curious. A film that is clearly well made and directed but one that is mostly unengaging and leaves very little impact when it's finished. It sticks rigidly to a wellworn formula when it should attempt something fresh. It tries to convey a convincing romance without any chemistry. It comes to the conclusion you knew it would from the moment the story was set in motion. There is no questions over Ridley Scott's ability I just wish that he'd have attempted to go against the grain with a story like this. In a way it is a testament to Scott's expertise that he was able to make the film as watchable as it is.".

He loves his wife and son  yet he gets tangled in a unwanted romance. Mimi Rogers is also great as the independent and feisty wife of Berenger. Lorraine Bracco makes her character really delicate and likable. The whole trio has a great chemistry together and they are the heart of the movie. Without their great performances the whole movie would fell apart.It's one of those small movies that isn't really amazing or great  but you might like it for what it is.

Some of which were comical in a senseI could have done better. Yes it's a movie and to kill off the lady in the first few minutes wouldn't make much of a movie. It is pretty predictable up to the end which was way over the top. Most things in the movie seemed over done say the stereotypical NY Queens wife and NY cop. Or scenes that just didn't seem to fit in. The scene with the wife fixing the carburetor just seemed misplaced. It does drag you in and you want to know where it is going but it just wasn't a very enjoyable ride.".

The plot is a little bit predictable but Ridley Scott does such a great job and adds so much style to the film that we can forget the fails in the story and the cliches. It's about a cop from Brooklin Berenger who has to protect the life of a beautiful socialite witness of a murder. They end up falling in love. The visual aspects of Someone to Watch Over Me  visual is a trademark of all Scott's films  are powerful and impressive for the first time Scott showed the world of the rich and famous in a way never seen before. Ridley Scott told that he wanted to make Someone to Watch Over Me in the tradition of John Garfield's old noir films and with the help of director of photography John Poster his cameras deliver to us a bright beautiful sometimes menacing New York. The opening scene of the film Sting singing Someone to Watch Over Me and the camera showing to all of us the lights of New York is one of the key moments of the movie. Someone to Watch Over Me stands to this day as a nice entertainment and it certainly is one of the most compelling cop thrillers of the eighties alongside Sharky's Machine starred by Burt Reynolds.".

Murder adultery and class distinction are at the heart of the story and interestingly no gloss is applied to the depiction of any of these subjects. Instead the focus is on the powerful impact they all have on the various people involved.Newly promoted police detective Mike Keegan Tom Berenger is given responsibility for protecting a wealthy Manhattan socialite Claire Gregory Mimi Rogers whose life is in danger because she was the only person who witnessed the brutal murder of one of her close friends. The job involves Mike spending time in Claire's luxurious apartment and accompanying her to a variety of social events. He soon becomes attracted to Claire and her glamorous lifestyle she appreciates the level of security his presence provides and soon the unlikely couple fall in love.Mike's wife Ellie Lorraine Bracco becomes suspicious about the nature of his relationship with Claire and his tacit admission about their affair leads to the break up of his family. Mobster Joey Venza Andreas Katsulas who had attempted to kill Claire immediately after she witnessed him killing her friend then takes Ellie and her son hostage and what follows leads to the threat on Claire's life being removed permanently.Claire's comfortable existence changed radically after she witnessed the murder as she became more fearful and had her life threatened by the psychotic killer. The level of freedom she'd previously enjoyed also became considerably more restricted and her affair with Mike led to her stuffy fianc being dumped and Mike's wife being emotionally devastated by what had happened.Mike's first assignment as a detective led to his life being put in extreme danger and also to him experiencing a great deal of emotional turmoil over his relationship with Claire. The effect this had on his marriage which had always previously been a happy one was also painful and his conduct and handling of the case drew severe criticism from his superiors. Ultimately the intensity of Mike's anguish and Claire's desolation are both incredibly profound.Someone To Watch Over Me is a romantic thriller which is beautifully directed by Ridley Scott and features consistently good performances by its talented cast. Lorraine Bracco provides the stand out performance as Mike's feisty downtoearth wife whose instincts are totally reliable and Andreas Katsulas' physiognomy and bearing make him the perfect choice for the story's villain.".

	schema:reviewBody "The concept in a story about two people from two different walks of life getting involved in a love affair that will consume them is not exactly new in mainstream movies. If one adds to the concept two attractive players to impersonate those lovers on the screen the result will play heavily in the way an audience responds. If then a murder is thrown in it adds another layer to the film.Ridley Scott is a director with a keen sense of style. He has produced a string of movies that have resonated with the movie going public and Someone to Watch Over Me his 1987 film proves to be one of those favorites if one is to go by the comments submitted to this forum. The screen play is by Howard Franklin. The excellent cinematography by Steven Poster pays tribute to New York City with the breathtaking aerial night shots. Michael Kamen added to the texture of the film with his music score that also blends music by Antonio Vivaldi and Leo Delibes' Lakme into the sound track.Although the mere idea of a rich socialite getting involved with a Queens detective is preposterous at best one goes along with the possibility. We realize from the start they have no future together because the detective is pure polyester and the rich girl will not ever set her foot in the outer boroughs for all the money in the world. We realize from the beginning these lovers are doomed.The best thing in the film are the two leads Mimi Rogers is an exciting presence in whatever she decides to appear in as it's the case here. Tom Berenger with his rough good looks is perfect for the awkward detective that can't resist a woman out of his league. Lorraine Bracco who in this film bears an uncanny resemblance with Debra Winger plays the wife of the detective and is also a cop. Andreas Katsulas is at his best creepy self as the man who doesn't want to be identified and will do anything to get his accuser out of the picture.Ridley Scott delivers with his usual elegance and eye for the luxury most of us mere mortals can't afford.".

Tom Berenger Mimi Rogers and Lorraine Bracco represent the bluecollar cop the highsociety lady and bluecollar wife to perfection. Equally responsible for the film's appeal is Andreas Katsukas' portrayal of a screen villain superior to any in The Godfather or any of the film noir genre from the 1930's onward.There is really no mystery from the outset as to where the story is headed. Society girl witnesses killing bluecollar cop is assigned to guard her in her plush digs they consummate a romantic relationship bluecollar wife gets hurt and very angry! and the killer menaces all.Jerry Orbach and John Rubenstein roundout the primary cast. Neither of these has an oversupply of charisma and Rubenstein is singularly unappealing and uninteresting in the role of Rogers' bigshot boyfriend.Mimi Rogers is very attractive if not the dropdeadgorgeousraving beauty female star. But I would regard her as an actress and particularly in this role as being as sexy and sensual as say Sharon Stone even in Basic Instinct. Berenger does the aw shucks everyman type of character as well as anyone.The film's title song one of Gershwin's best has several versions during the film  and the one at the beginning by Sting is memorable. I first saw this film not long after its release and particularly enjoyed his rendition. Because not long before that I had been in New York City on business  and one Saturday evening with a colleague and his wife had dinner at the Four Seasons where Sting and his party were at a nearby table.The next night when I had flown home he sang this song a longer complete version on a television tribute to Gershwin.While this song has been used in other films e.g. Beyond Therapy it adds a great deal to the film in a subtle way.".

A detective Tom Berenger with a loving wife Lorraine Bracco and kid is assigned to watch over her.  They understandably become attracted and fall in love. His marriage begins to crumble and the killer is still on the loose...Very good forgotten thriller from Ridley Scott.  It opens with a beautiful view of Manhattan from above at night with a title song a really great one being sung.  As with most Scott films this one is visually stunning...it seems like a homage to the film noirs of the 1940s.  Most of the movie takes place at night...even the indoor scenes in Rogers' gorgeous huge apartment are mostly in dark or shadow.  And there's TONS of fog in the outside scenes Manhattan looks like London with all of that fog  Along with a great jazz score the movie has a very moody sensual quality that I loved.  Also it has more depth into feelings than is usually found in his films.Great acting helps.  Berenger drop dead handsome muscular sweet and Rogers also drop dead gorgeous and kind give two of their best performances Rogers especially.  They're both VERY physically attractive and play off each other very well.  Bracco plays down the role of Berenger's wife.  I personally didn't like herI found her loud obnoxious and sarcastic...but we're supposed to identify with her.DEFINITE SPOILER AHEAD Here's where the movie makes a BIG mistake.  At the end Berenger has to pick between Bracco and Rogers.  He picks Bracco.  Wrong.  Rogers comes across MUCH better and kinder than Bracco does BUT this is a Hollywood film and the hero can't leave his wife and kid.  The look on Rogers' face at the end was heartbreaking.  A bad misstep. END OF SPOILERI really liked this film.  It has a very interesting quality to it.  It was panned by most critics back in 1987 and didn't do too well at the box office.  Still it's worth seeing.  This should have made careers for all three of its leadsbut didn't.Also fun to see Jerry Orbach playing a policeman before he started doing the longrunning TV series Law and Order.".

There is a tiny redeeming feature in some of the photography mostly the outdoor night scenes that can make the viewer think right that's the Blade Runner touch. If not for those I would have rated it a 1 rather than a 2.The luxurious apartment of the poor beautiful rich girl is btw an exercise in kitsch  bad taste at its peak.If you haven't seen this movie and want to watch it DO IT WITH THE MUTE ON. Don't listen to the dialog under any circumstances. You will understand the plot such as it is perfectly well without it.It is interesting to see a much younger Lorraine Bracco after getting to know her character on the Sopranos about 13 years later.".

	schema:reviewBody "A 14 year old girl develops her first serious crush on the 17 year old boy that lives near by while simultaneously trying to overcome her feelings of inadequacy in comparison to her older sister. That is the simple premise of this beautiful poetic coming of age film from Director Robert Mulligan. Mulligan is famous for previously directing Summer of '42 in 1971 and To Kill A Mockingbird in 1962 two giants of the coming of age genre. Here he directs newcomers in the principal roles Reese Witherspoon in her film debut as the 14 year old girl Emily Warfield as the older sister Jason London as Court the 17 year old boy. Reese Witherspoon is astonishingly good in her film debut displaying every emotion that a 14 year old girl feels in experiencing young love and hurt never striking a false note. Warfield and London are both equally good as well. The film accurately depicts each adolescent's thoughts or feelings in regard to love with heartfelt sensitivity never crossing over into maudlin excess even once. Kudos to the autobiographical screenplay from Jenny Wingfield this is one of the very few films about young love that is honest and consistent in tone without being emotionally dishonest or sensationalist. The music is wonderfully simple accentuating the tone and mood from scene to scene but never becoming intrusive. The beautiful cinematography is by famed horror director Freddie Francis who was in his 70's when this was shot. Tess Harper and Sam Waterston play the girls' parents with dead aim accuracy for 1957 caring strict and emotionally simple. Gail Strickland is good also as the boy's mother. There are feelings to sort out lessons to learn and truths to face in this sweetnatured film that packs an emotional wallop. To date this is Robert Mulligan's last film. This is one of the very best films of 1991.  of 4 stars.".

	schema:headline " beautiful love triangle story";
	schema:reviewBody "Here's the kind of love story that I do enjoy watching. And mostly it's for two reasons. One it concentrates of young people VERY young people. People who are still in their teens and are experiencing love for the first time or at least think they are. All of us have been there in our lives and The Man in the Moon is a magnificent reflection upon our memories maybe adding on a few more details and enhancing it further than any of us have experienced. The second reason is that is a love triangle. And I do believe that as teens it's the most dramatic. And the story is so well developed that you believe the characters could really be in love or are just so new to love that they just strongly believe they are and after a tragedy or so occurs will believe it for the rest of their lives.The cast of The Man in the Moon is full of great talented names. It stars Sam Waterston who is truly a versatile actor well capable of playing tough district attorneys as well as strict yet caring and wise fathers as in this film. Also there is Tess Harper Jason London and a young young Reese Witherspoon. You look at the young talented actress as she is at age fourteen and you think that about ten years down the road she's going to win the Academy Award. All members of the cast pull off great performances and with the dialogue of the compelling screenplay they are enhanced into looking like real people in real situations. As if it all really happened. This the kind of movie that I would like to see come out more often. Love story or not. I would love to see films that make everything look real and is not phony or disbelievable in any way.".

	onyx:emotionText "Here's the kind of love story that I do enjoy watching. And mostly it's for two reasons. One it concentrates of young people VERY young people. People who are still in their teens and are experiencing love for the first time or at least think they are. All of us have been there in our lives and The Man in the Moon is a magnificent reflection upon our memories maybe adding on a few more details and enhancing it further than any of us have experienced. The second reason is that is a love triangle. And I do believe that as teens it's the most dramatic. And the story is so well developed that you believe the characters could really be in love or are just so new to love that they just strongly believe they are and after a tragedy or so occurs will believe it for the rest of their lives.The cast of The Man in the Moon is full of great talented names. It stars Sam Waterston who is truly a versatile actor well capable of playing tough district attorneys as well as strict yet caring and wise fathers as in this film. Also there is Tess Harper Jason London and a young young Reese Witherspoon.

	schema:reviewBody "That magical moment in life that point between the beautiful innocence of childhood and the confusing whirlwind that marks adulthood . . . this is what this movie is all about. Danni wonderfully played by Reese Witherspoon is right at that moment in life when the movie starts. She swoons over Elvis playing his records and wishfully thinking about love. Maureen her sister will soon be off to college has no trouble with attracting boys is beautiful and seems to have it all figured out although she doesn't. She dates a local loser whos father is also after her and just wishes she could find a decent boy and be swept off her feet. Danni like most young teenagers wishes she could be anyone else but herself because most teenagers think that who they are just isn't good enough. She wants to be Maureen but doesn't see that she is beautiful herself.The moment adulthood begins to intrude itself upon her life is when she meets Court Foster for the first time. Court whos father has recently died has moved to their old farm to work it with his mother and two younger brothers. He has been thrust responsibility when he should be having fun. On one particular hot day he goes to the pond and jumps in only to find Danni skinny dipping. They yell and argue and Danni leaves. But they see each other a day later when Courts mother is invited to Danni's to visit old friendsDanni's Parents. Danni becomes attracted to Court and Court to Danni. She is a tomboy and is spunky has attitude and says whats on her mind. Court is 17 and Danni 14 and he knows it but they continue to grow closer with their days at the pond between Court working the farm. By the time Court kisses her one day Danni is smitten. Danni's father tells her to invite Court to the house and he does. but things are uncomfortable for Court on his sort of date. The silence though is broken by his meeting with Maureen who has yet to see Court. One look between the two and its all over. The looks of pain and defeat on Danni's face are both beautiful in their trueness to life and painful at the same time. The rest of the movie I will not tell but the movie has more to it than a relationship between a boy and two sisters.The greatness of the movie is in its depiction of lifes moments both beautiful and painful and the relationship between two sisters whose love is tested by both a boy that they love and the pain they must endure both together and individually. Danni eventually marks her entrance into the world when she sees that the world is unfair painful and maybe even a little less hopeful than when the movie started. Few movies can truly capture the wonder of childhood and the pain of adulthood so perfectly. This movie has since the first time I watched it stuck in my mind. Its in the my Top 100 movie list and deservedly so. I only wish more movies like this were made because if so . . . my faith in Hollywood would be a lot better.".

You can guess that it was Court's confusion over being interested in someone so young as Dani despite his resistance was the reason for his odd and annoying behavior towards Dani after he'd met her sister but that is never explained. Not even in a way where you can know something for sure without it being spoken. It was frustrating and obnoxious. I also feel like his death was a complete cop out. The minute Dani finds out that Court was with her sister he is killed my a tractor which is oddly hilarious and makes for good poetic justice in my opinion and the two are never able to confront the relationship between them and how it had been tarnished. So much felt unfinished with this movie and not in a well that's life sort of way it was more of a wait huh what just happened??? kind of way. I also hated the how Maureen's grief over the boy she had known and loved for two days was made out to be more important and significant that Dani's. It literally made no sense to me. This movie had great potential in the beginning but the way it ended just sucked to me. Overall I didn't feel like it was a complete waste of time but it did disappoint me greatly. 610.".

	schema:headline " Explosion of emotions in reserved persons... Great movie!";
	schema:reviewBody "There must be something romantic in American farms and it is probably forever lost so American directors return to that ambiance whenever they want to make real human touching romantic dramas that won't be HanksRyan romanced comedies big tragedies like 'Autumn in New York' or dark urban exploring of human soul like 'Eyes Wide Shut'. In Europe we can't understand it because most parts of Europe don't have so wide plains which leave small communities so far from the world that whatever happens people stay leaning on each other. Austrians place their losttime romantic dramas on Habsburg castles and no one but aristocrats can feel them Swedish directors find romance far north and these dramas are hard as the life there is Italians like to return in their childhood villages where everyone is shouting or talking endlessly and no one listens Czechs have their communist history as fetish that makes them cry deep inside even when things look so amusing. But American farm dramas are so full of emotions that can so easily be misunderstood by modern audience as soapy maudlin false sentimental. The emotions are never too open people are almost as reserved as Swedish but not because strict rules forbid them to show what they feel as among monarchs. They just follow the rules inherited from their grandparents and they are too isolated to change quickly. A tractor or one Elvis record is most they can afford either because of culture lack of money or tradition.These movies can seem hopelessly romantic and as some call it chickmovies but female directors don't touch the subject. It is the world where man a father of the family still rules and wives can only support him and sometimes but hiding from him support their children when fathers becomes too strict. And what seems to be most odious for feminist directors these women don't seem to be unhappy.Remember 'River' 'Amber Waves' 'Days Of Heaven 'Places In Heart' maybe even 'Shadrach' or 'Tender Mercies'... Most of these movies don't have villains or even unkind characters except in small roles. Sometimes they exist only to make things a little harder but the life is hard enough itself. You have floods or droughts diseases or accidents and you don't need a single murderer dealer or even an attorney to make your life bitter and a story dynamic. In 'Man In The Moon' you can hardly remember a character that's not as good as you'd like your parents sisters friends or even yourself to be. They may make mistakes you may sometimes think they could've done better but be honest wouldn't you do the same or even worse?.All these movies go rather slow like those wide American plain rivers each small event each birth wedding illness is a quake for whole community. If you don't know the plot of 'Man In The Moon' you won't be able to predict much. The first half of the movie is almost a light comingtoage comedy if not placed in such environment and interfamily relations more similar to a French movie. The tragic event isn't announced even by music as it usually is. If you don't always have a spare bag full of tears it's thank God and authors not a film to make you cry all the time but if you have any emotions in yourself be prepared to have them touched.I wrote more than a few lines against modern US movies. This movie shows me that even in 90's something so human can be done. I'll pray for writers and directors like these to live and work as long as possible because I don't see younger ones who would keep following their paths.".

	onyx:emotionText "There must be something romantic in American farms and it is probably forever lost so American directors return to that ambiance whenever they want to make real human touching romantic dramas that won't be HanksRyan romanced comedies big tragedies like 'Autumn in New York' or dark urban exploring of human soul like 'Eyes Wide Shut'. In Europe we can't understand it because most parts of Europe don't have so wide plains which leave small communities so far from the world that whatever happens people stay leaning on each other. Austrians place their losttime romantic dramas on Habsburg castles and no one but aristocrats can feel them Swedish directors find romance far north and these dramas are hard as the life there is Italians like to return in their childhood villages where everyone is shouting or talking endlessly and no one listens Czechs have their communist history as fetish that makes them cry deep inside even when things look so amusing. But American farm dramas are so full of emotions that can so easily be misunderstood by modern audience as soapy maudlin false sentimental. The emotions are never too open people are almost as reserved as Swedish but not because strict rules forbid them to show what they feel as among monarchs. They just follow the rules inherited from their grandparents and they are too isolated to change quickly. A tractor or one Elvis record is most they can afford either because of culture lack of money or tradition.These movies can seem hopelessly romantic and as some call it chickmovies but female directors don't touch the subject. It is the world where man a father of the family still rules and wives can only support him and sometimes but hiding from him support their children when fathers becomes too strict. And what seems to be most odious for feminist directors these women don't seem to be unhappy.Remember 'River' 'Amber Waves' 'Days Of Heaven 'Places In Heart' maybe even 'Shadrach' or 'Tender Mercies'... Most of these movies don't have villains or even unkind characters except in small roles. Sometimes they exist only to make things a little harder but the life is hard enough itself. You have floods or droughts diseases or accidents and you don't need a single murderer dealer or even an attorney to make your life bitter and a story dynamic. In 'Man In The Moon' you can hardly remember a character that's not as good as you'd like your parents sisters friends or even yourself to be.

Reese Witherspoon is as promised surprisingly good surprisingly confident at a young age really all the small cast are quite solid in their simple 50s American setting. The reason I didn't rate this film higher is mainly that towards the end the grief shown by the older sister didn't seem so real and this pulled me out of the film a bit. Perhaps we are expected to fill in the plot or perhaps the film needed to be a bit longer. Maureen's character is quite underdeveloped I think. It is understandable that Dani Reese W. the younger would be traumatised and angry but why is her sister shown to be more upset? Because she's a few years older?  Hasn't the end rather undermined the rest of the film? The pacing of the movie makes it seem that Maureen and Court have only just met when he gets tractored warning this scene is surprisingly brutal in retrospect it seems like it might have been trying to shock a bit. well it works!. It depends what you want  if you want the girls' happy story of young love that it seems like you're going to get you're in for a surprise. Man in the Moon is both quaint and dreamy and a harsh coming of age film  a rather awkward combination? I liked the character of Court though I can see what girls watching this might be watching. And I loved that they had the courage to both let him hurt the younger sister most men would most films wouldn't and get killed.710 on my pretty harsh ratings scale. For some reason I found Jason London on a tractor funny.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this movie as a teenager and immediately identified with Reese Witherspoon's portrayal of Dani Trant a 14yearold tomboy in rural Louisiana circa 1957. She feels that she will never be as beautiful as her older sister Maureen a now rarely seen Emily Warfield and feeling out of place in terms of her conservative Baptist upbringing. Then seventeen year old Court Foster Jason London the son of her mother's close friend Gail Strickland moves in next door Dani experiences her first crush while Court enjoys her company and willful spirit. Dani succeeds in getting her first kiss from him but as soon as he sees Maureen he falls head over heels for her leaving Dani behind. The sisters' close bond is fractured severely by the rivalry that erupts which only deepens when Court dies in a tragic accident. The girls then are made to realize how much they need each other.Sam Waterson and Tess Harper are just perfect as the loving parents trying to balance their daughters' individuality at the same time trying to keep the family together. The beautiful cinematography and the wonderful soundtrack featuring Elvis Presley The Platters and many more contribute wonderfully to the film's atmosphere of a simpler time.A touching comingofage film with a timeless message.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you can suspend disbelief andor ignore reality this is a reasonably decent film. While the acting is uneven there is some really good work here especially from Reese Witherspoon who shows that she had it from a young age. She simply steals every scene she's in. But that's also a downside  she by far outshines everyone else in the movie including putting all those fauxSouthern accents to shame with her authentic Tennessee drawl.While the story does a credible job of engaging the viewer it runs roughshod over any semblance of reality. The viewer is expected to believe that in the 1950s American South a respectable family would have been perfectly sanguine about their 14yearold daughter regularly heading off unsupervised to the swimming hole with the 17yearold boy next door. There is a token scene where Mr. Trant seeing Dani upset demands to know if Court tried anything with her. Finding out that he didn't dear ol' Dad seems content to let his daughter continue going to the swimming hole till that noaccount boy makes his move. Later Mr. Trant even leaves the lovebirds at the house alone albeit for what he thought would be a short time.Sorry but it's simply impossible to believe that any of this would have happened... at least not in the sort of family depicted here. And no way would the kids have been so relaxed about getting caught in a compromising position such as when Court strips down and goes skinnydipping with Dani. Neither do the kids seem shy about sex as when Maureen's first boyfriend tries to get it on with her under a tree right by the roadside. By the time Maureen and Court finally go for a roll in the hay they do it on the edge of the field Court has been plowing where anyone could walk up on them Court's mother shows up to deliver his lunch only minutes later. It's hard to imagine such conduct being realistic in many places even today much less fifty years ago in the conservative South.While the story is supposedly based on someone's actual memoirs one can not help believing that truth was tossed to the curb somewhere along the way. Such lazy storytelling is inexcusable and almost completely ruins the emotional impact of the film. I gave it five stars for watchability and for the redeeming aspects of the story but this could have been a much better movie in the hands of more competent writers and filmmakers.".

The storyline here is very engaging and the characters are superb.  I totally lose myself in this movie when I watch it and I laugh out loud every time.  It is fun to follow the timeline of the movie... if you analyze it the entire thing takes place over about 5 months.  It begins in June with Flip and Stacey's graduation and ends around Halloween hence the brief appearnces of the Halloween masks.  The supporting cast is terrific too some great old faces that everyone will recognize.  If you love the classic comedies of Doris Day I heartily recommend this one.".

There were many familiar faces darting in and out.  People like Jaime Farr Vic Taback Jackie Joseph and George Carlin.Brian Keith was a comfortable but gruff leading man for Doris. They had many nice scenes together although he did not measure up to the usual caliber star with whom Miss Day was usually paired.As usual Doris Day worked well with children.  She was one of the few major stars that could. Many female stars avoided kids like the plague but not Doris.

She was probably in her mid40s here and in her last movie to date but she's fresh and funny throughout. I loved it when she spies Brian Keith in a gogo club with a young chick his daughter and says to sister Pat Carroll Why take a bus when you can fly? There are big laughs and some thoughtful scenes and I enjoyed themuntil the final 15 minutes when the picture goes to hell in a handbasket. Into this semirealistic brew of changing houses and coming to an understanding we get hippies bikers a chickentruck driver and Brian Keith in his boxer shorts. It's a ridiculous turn of events triggered by a tooserious marital quarrel and almost mitigates the sweet nature of the main characters. Nothing can derail Doris though she's so grounded in reality that you buy every emotion every doubletake every line of dialogue. She's one of Hollywood's most underrated actresses.

	schema:reviewBody "Doris Day's last feature film is a pleasant success although it somehow isn't recalled as a such. Backtracking for a moment Ms. Day's 1960s sex comedies were very big at the box office. The best of these films were critically acclaimed at the time and are fondly remembered today. But by 1967 Day began receiving scripts that lacked the wit and hit potential of earlier films. Day knew this but found herself committed to a few unworthy movies by managerhusband Martin Melcher. They weren't the first bad movies Day did but they did come at a time when she was a superstar. Day was able to make these bad movies better through her presence as usual she put a good effort into each assignment.By 1966 Day was firmly entrenched in the Quigley Top 10 poll of box office stars and had become a very dependable consistent attraction. The films she didn't care for were responsible for Day falling out of the Ten Best list in 1967. She saw With Six You Get Eggroll as an improvement. And it was. Day's last films heralded a return to form and she appeared at a very respectable 14 in her final 1968 Quigley Poll appearance. It was a CBSTV series deal that prevented Day from continuing her film career. She was in demand and would have had to continue in films she needed the money. But Day was committed to work on the television series against her wishes by the now deceased Mr. Melcher.Seeing the success of the earlier released Lucille Ball comedy Yours Mine and Ours 1968 the studio promoted With Six You Get Eggroll as similar fare. Actually this film is a little better overall both are good movies. Herein lumber yard owner Abby McClure Day is resigned to being single after being left with her deceased husband's business and three sons. But she is lonely a euphemism as director Howard Morris clearly highlights with the overhead shots of Day on her bed. Day reluctantly accepts selfprofessed sexminded sister Pat Carroll's arrangement of a date with widow Brian Keith as Jake Iverson. Their courtship is marvelously depicted thanks to fine scripting and performances.Some have debated whether or not the characters played by Day and Keith have premarital sex. Everything about in the characters' behavior suggests that they do. If fact the biggest reason for the marriage is that they find it increasingly frustrating to sneak around and be alone more euphemisms. The rest of the film deals with the inevitable problems the marriage causes in their living arrangements. Now considering Day's business which she's good at you've got to wonder they didn't just build another bedroom for one of the children. Unfortunately the business sense of Day's character is left standing at the alter. The plot question becomes Will the children learn to get along or break up the newlyweds? Representing the opposing fronts are her son John Findlater as Flip and his daughter Barbara Hershey as Stacy. Youngsters Jimmy Bracken and Richard Steele handle their roles and surprising bathtub scene very well. Sounding like a cross between Under My Thumb and The Zombies The Grass Roots do an original exceptional and very sixtiessounding song called Feelings listen to them as Day visits a youth nightclub. Standup George Carlin turns up as fastfood patron. Two future MASH regulars lead a mob of tripping hippies. And you can have a lot of fun picking out sitcom favorites. By the third act the film has become more unfocused and ordinary but it never really obliterates its appeal.

Brian Keith plays Jake a divorced parent with a daughter Barbara Hershy in her first movie role who has also just graduated. There is immediate resentment by the two oldest kids and it gets pretty funny. George Carlin appears as the waiter at the drive in. When they mentioned drive in back then it meant a place to eat not see movies. You can see from Carlin's portrayal that he has already developed his edgy voice and mannerisms. There is chaos when the two families are joined in wedlock. Neither house is big enough for the new family. They decide to sell both homes and buy a bigger place. Every thing comes out well it usually did in a Doris Day film When they all end up at a police station and end up defending each other as family. I liked it and while some of the stuff especially the ending may seem contrived relax it is a typical Hollywood romcom for the time period. Overall an entertaining and funny movie.".

	schema:headline " Light comedy romance is Doris Day's last film";
	schema:reviewBody "With Six You Get Eggroll is a light comedyromance with a very familiar theme by its date. Widow and widower with kids still at home meet fall in love and decide to tie the knot again only to be challenged by their respective offspring. But Doris Day and Brian Keith carry it off fine with the help of her three sons and his daughter. Doris plays Abby McClure and Brian plays Jake Iverson. The cast are all good and there are some very funny scenes especially in the beginning when Abby and Jake meet up for the first time at a party she throws. This was Doris Day's last movie. She made only 42 films in her entire career and retired from the screen and TV early. Except for her last few films arranged by hubby Martin Melcher to bail out the estate he had poorly managed for years Doris Day's star shone bright for movie and TV audiences alike for 25 years. Many many fans and movie buffs would have loved to see Day in more films. After Melcher died in 1968 Doris hit it big with her own TV series The Doris Day Show. It ran for five seasons and after her last episode on March 12 1973 she ended her performing career for good. She was just 50 years old. Probably no other actress with such a bleak background and problem filled personal life has done more to lift peoples' spirits by her talents. Doris Day was indeed a bright spot in the entertainment world. She was equally adept at dramatic and mystery roles but her endearing talents shone best in her musicals and comedyromances. She was one of a rare breed of screen stage and TV stars who could act sing and dance and who excelled at comedy. She never won an Oscar but was nominated nine years for Golden Globes as the favorite female film star in the world  winning three times in 1958 1960 and 1963.Brian Keith's background is very different. Except for a few uncredited parts in movies since childhood his acting career didn't get started until the early 1950s when he appeared in several TV series. His first male lead came in a 1956 movie Storm Center with Bette Davis. After that he had many roles in films TV movies and TV shows and continued acting until his death in 1997 at age 75. He was in more than 160 films and TV shows. With Six You Get Eggroll is a simple light comedyromance that most should enjoy. It's a good family film that may be a little slow for kids of the 21st century.".

Widow and widower with kids still at home meet fall in love and decide to tie the knot again only to be challenged by their respective offspring. But Doris Day and Brian Keith carry it off fine with the help of her three sons and his daughter. Doris plays Abby McClure and Brian plays Jake Iverson. The cast are all good and there are some very funny scenes especially in the beginning when Abby and Jake meet up for the first time at a party she throws. This was Doris Day's last movie. She made only 42 films in her entire career and retired from the screen and TV early. Except for her last few films arranged by hubby Martin Melcher to bail out the estate he had poorly managed for years Doris Day's star shone bright for movie and TV audiences alike for 25 years. Many many fans and movie buffs would have loved to see Day in more films. After Melcher died in 1968 Doris hit it big with her own TV series The Doris Day Show. It ran for five seasons and after her last episode on March 12 1973 she ended her performing career for good. She was just 50 years old. Probably no other actress with such a bleak background and problem filled personal life has done more to lift peoples' spirits by her talents. Doris Day was indeed a bright spot in the entertainment world. She was equally adept at dramatic and mystery roles but her endearing talents shone best in her musicals and comedyromances. She was one of a rare breed of screen stage and TV stars who could act sing and dance and who excelled at comedy. She never won an Oscar but was nominated nine years for Golden Globes as the favorite female film star in the world  winning three times in 1958 1960 and 1963.Brian Keith's background is very different. Except for a few uncredited parts in movies since childhood his acting career didn't get started until the early 1950s when he appeared in several TV series. His first male lead came in a 1956 movie Storm Center with Bette Davis. After that he had many roles in films TV movies and TV shows and continued acting until his death in 1997 at age 75. He was in more than 160 films and TV shows. With Six You Get Eggroll is a simple light comedyromance that most should enjoy. It's a good family film that may be a little slow for kids of the 21st century.";

Not exactly the greatest film to go out on.Anticipating The Brady Bunch by a year With Six You Get Eggroll is a pleasant enough family comedy about another lovely lady only she's the one with three boys of her own. Doris is a widow with sons Jimmy Bracken Richard Steele and John Findlater who's getting a lot of static from her sister Pat Carroll about her social life or lack thereof. Going through the Rolodex Brian Keith's name comes up. He's an old friend of Day's late husband who wouldn't you know it is now a widower with a teenage daughter Barbara Hershey. The inevitable romance blooms and they get married.Getting the respective families adjusted to step relations is a whole other matter. If you've seen episodes of The Brady Bunch Step By Step and Life With Derek I think you'll get the idea where the rest of this film is going. Keith and Day look so comfortable together you do kind of wonder what their respective late spouses were like. Look for George Carlin to make his big screen debut as an obnoxious fast food stand owner and Vic Tayback as the poultry truck driver whose repeated runins with both sides of the family brings them finally together. And in that rather anarchistic climax note the presence of Jamie Farr and William Christopher as a pair of hippies who help the course of true love.With Six You Get Eggroll is an average screen comedy but with all the blended family TV shows that have come and gone since it's nothing no one hasn't seen before.".

The courting and romance of father Brian Keith and Doris is rather sweet but the complications arise after their marriage as to who moves into whose house and who sleeps where which causes Brian and Doris to have a fight and of course it leads inevitably to an outlandish and zany ending.

This seems to have a juvenile sense of humor but I've never laughed so hard in my life. I give this a '6' only because while funny it seems to come with a price of feeling rather uncouth and maybe an embarrassment to the career of all concerned including a young Barbara Hershey as Brian Keith's daughter. This came out a year before The Brady Bunch so one wonders if this movie inspired it. Directed by The Andy Griffith Show 's star Howard Morris who played Ernest T.

	schema:reviewBody "WITH SIX YOU GET EGGROLE had the timing misfortune of coming out in the movies at the same time as YOUR MINE AND HOURS the Henry Fonda and Lucille Ball comedy about two people who get married and try to bring their individual broods of three kids each together. Here it was Doris Day and Brian Keith trying to bring her three sons John Findlater Richard Steele and Jimmy Bracken and his daughter a young Barbara Hershey together and finding it nearly impossible. Both Day and Keith are widowed and they knew each other earlier but their lives drifted apart. She became successful as an lumber yard owner and he is a successful professional as well. Her sister Pat Carroll is trying to get her to remarry one wonders why  Day's comment that she has a house full of sons and is not lonely happens to be perfectly sensible...it's not like nobody is in the house since her husband died. Carroll forces the issue by calling Keith up and strong arming Day into inviting him to a dinner party mostly for her Day's clients. And of course things click perfectly between the two until they elope to Las Vegas and marry without warning their kids. But that is just it the kids' reactions to the marriage can make or break it.The kids are he normal bunch with Findlater selfcentered enough about his dates that he ignores his chores keeping his eyes on his brothers and Hershey having become chief housekeeper for Keith. Naturally the two oldest ones clash all the time as they are unused to having someone of their own age being suddenly in the way. Hershey keeps slighting Day seeing her as a rival to her...until a fed up Day when she hears Hershey complain about how she was a better house keeper assigns Hershey all the chores for the day a Friday while Day goes out shopping. Ghostley who was off that day is a housekeeper who is constantly commenting on being overworked but also quick to remind her boss Day that certain days she's off  or that Day is butting into Ghostley's personal time. Day is also aware of the gorgeous next door neighbor of Keith's Elaine Devry who has had her eye on Keith for some time too. Day is not thrilled to hear that Devry was Hershey's baby sitter in the past.The plot is identical to that of the Fonda  Ball film although the twisted resolution is not quite the same except in results. Watching it now is like seeing a major film that had many people in it who had substantial careers...but not necessarily on the big screen. Carroll was in several sitcoms in the the 1950s  1980s. So was Herb Voland who played her husband here. Alice Ghostly is recalled for BEWITCHED and DESIGNING WOMEN although she did appear in other films like THE FLIMFLAM MAN. A young George Carlin plays the manager of a drive in restaurant here  hardly showing his great standup wit. He was better in later film parts like OUTRAGEOUS FORTUNE. Two flower children in the film would later reappear together and gain television immortality in M.A.S.H. as Cpl. Klinger and Father Mulcahy Jamie Farr and William Christopher. A belligerent chicken farmer whose truck is crashed into twice by Day and Findlater is Vic Tayback Mel on ALICE. And in his only major film credit Alvin Melvin appeared as a put upon police officer listening to everyone yelling in his station at the end. Not quite as good as his roles in YOU'LL NEVER GET RICH GOMER PYLE or ARCHIE BUNKER'S PLACE. It is easy to recall that with all their fine movie work both Day and Keith had decent successes in television too in THE DORIS DAY SHOW and FAMILY AFFAIR. Actually the only star of the film with a substantial movie career after it was made was Hershey as Day did retire from the screen...although Keith would still be available for movies up until the end when his poor health led him to a tragic suicide.".

With Six You Get Eggroll what an awful title! is the last though not necessarily the least of the dreary bunch. This was Barbara Hershey's first film and Doris' last and that's about the most interesting thing about this poky sitcom posing as a theatrical film. Similar to The Brady Bunch Yours Mine and Ours68 and Day's own TV series With Six YOu Get Eggroll was released the same year as 2001A Space Odyssey Rosemary's Baby Faces Planet of the Apes Wild in the Streets Pretty Poison and The Night of the Living Dead and it's a dull and witless comedy that was a relic even in 1968. And the gratuitous appearance of the Grass Roots and the hippies in the background are a hopeless attempt to seem up to date.

She reportedly turned down The Graduate and did Caprice67 Jumbo62 Send Me No Flowers64 Where Were You When the Lights Went Out?68 Do Not Disturb65 The Glass Bottom Boat66 The Ballad of Josie67 and Move Over Darling63 instead. With Six You Get Eggroll what an awful title! is the last though not necessarily the least of the dreary bunch. This was Barbara Hershey's first film and Doris' last and that's about the most interesting thing about this poky sitcom posing as a theatrical film. Similar to The Brady Bunch Yours Mine and Ours68 and Day's own TV series With Six YOu Get Eggroll was released the same year as 2001A Space Odyssey Rosemary's Baby Faces Planet of the Apes Wild in the Streets Pretty Poison and The Night of the Living Dead and it's a dull and witless comedy that was a relic even in 1968. And the gratuitous appearance of the Grass Roots and the hippies in the background are a hopeless attempt to seem up to date. Talented Brian Keith takes a back seat to a bunch of cute kids George Carlin and a dog. Starting with an animated title sequence the whole thing looks cheap and ugly and the supporting cast made up of familiar faces from TV is unappealing and forgettable.";

I think It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World changed the landscape of comedy and in the later stages of this film it pays its stylistic homage. But this film is really a hybrid of the DayHudson pillow talkies any Irma Bombeck story and LaughIn. Doris Day and her three boys have to share a home with Brian Keith and his daughter. This is a sure recipe for classic comedy right? Well maybe not. The jokes are forced and the action is predictable.Although this is not a very good film it is a decent guilty pleasure.

A young Barbara Hershey is a delight here as Keith's daughter. George Carlin is a rare find acting in a film character and he is here. The minor roles have faces like Jamie Farr Klinger on TV Mash Vic Tayback Mel on Alice William Christopher  Father Mulcahey on MASH Pat Carroll Disney Alice Ghostly Bewitched Allan Melvin Sgt Hacker on Gomer Pyle and more. If that is not enough music fans are treated to a song by The Grassroots the groups only appearance outside of shows like American Bandstand. They play Feelings a really good song.A whole is is more than the sum of it's parts but this is so much better than the big studios Yours Mine  Ours of the same year it is too bad the little studio film did not get more box office.

I got a copy of Dark Man off ebay finally.It is a short 'B' film however it is well done for its style punchy and effective. Unfortunately i think the shortened US version is the one doing the rounds not the longer UK version.I'd be interested in seeing the original longer release. A very young Natasha Parry is the leading lady and does the job very nicely though the age difference between her and Edward Underdown is a bit too great for easy belief. Maxwell Reed is the title's otherwise unnamed 'Dark Man' and he fits the role well both in his looks and behaviour. He brings an edgy presence to the film the dark side of Underdown's whiter than white policeman. The 2 men have a passing physical resemblance as well. There is interesting location filming down on the coast and a very unusual finale on the shooting range. The way Maxwell Reed stalks Natasha Parry building her fear is effective and realistic a simple beach scene has dark undertones. The director also writer Jeffrey Dell didn't helm many projects a pity based on this effort.".

	schema:headline " Southern Gothic tragedy with Brando Magnani and Woodward";
	schema:reviewBody "Released in 1960 and directed by Sidney Lumet from Tennessee Williams' screenplay The Fugitive Kind is a BW southern Gothic drama starring Marlon Brando as loner minstrel Val Snakeskin from New Orleans in pursuit of a new life and the people with whom to live it. He stumbles upon a Mississippi town and gets a job at a mercantile store which is run by a lonely passedherprime woman Lady Anna Magnani. While Snakeskin works the store downstairs Lady's terminally ill husband is bedridden upstairs Victor Jory. Joanne Woodward plays a histrionic beatnik while Maureen Stapleton is on hand as a housewife enamored by Snakeskin. R.G. Armstrong appears as the redneck sheriff.The first time I watched this movie in 2008 I didn't much like it probably because I wasn't familiar with Williams' stagey melodramatic style of writing. However after just viewing Williams' The Night of the Iguana 1964 and really appreciating it I had a taste for more and so gave The Fugitive Kind a second chance. I'm glad I did because this time I was able to discern its highlights and got a lot more out of it.Marlon was in the midst of my favorite period of his career while filming this movie. Arguably his greatest films The Young Lions 1958 OneEyed Jacks 1961 and Mutiny on the Bounty 1962 were all shot during this time. While The Fugitive Kind is easily the least of these it's worth checking out for a number of reasons as long as you're in the mood for a talky adult melodrama. Like The Night of the Iguana this is a brooding rumination on the nature of existence. As such there are numerous treasures to glean from the seemingly interminable dialogues. The movie's overlong and could've been tightened up but the interspersed riches hidden within make it worth staying with but you have to be a seasoned adult to appreciate it or at least mature for your years.Woodward's beatnik character is interesting as she's basically a hippie before hippies existed. Although her character is histrionic and somewhat annoying some of her reflections are poignant like in the interesting cemetery scene with Snakeskin. Emory Richardson is almost fascinating as Carol's silent black friend in a racist community. Some of their platonic imagery together is unexpected and intriguing for a film shot in 1959.Brando was 35 during filming and became the first actor to make 1 million for a single film although Elizabeth Taylor earlier signed a 1 million contract for Cleopatra that movie wasn't released until 1963. Magnani was 51 and hot to sleep with the star but Marlon didn't find her attractive which needless to say negatively affected the shoot. This is surprising because some of their scenes together are quite good. I incidentally had an Italian neighbor who passed away six weeks ago who was strikingly reminiscent of Magnani's character both lookswise and temperamentwise. So I know firsthand that people like her exist.The film runs 119 minutes and was shot in Milton New York.GRADE B".

	schema:reviewBody "The Fugitive Kind is a hot story of desire and loss and craving and heartbreak between a man and two women set in the deep south. Sounds like quintessential Tenessee Williams and it is in spurts. Sometimes Williams leans towards being a little preachy however true little moments like when Brando and Stapleton have a quiet back and forth about racism via her painting kind of nails it on the head much but it's his skills at doing melodrama that strike up the coolest beats. In fact this is one of those supercool movies of the late 50s that could have only starred someone like Brando who looks at times disinterested in the scene but at the same time completely engaged curious smooth harsh and knowing of what life can bring with his trusty Ledbellysigned guitar. It's not necessarily a towering work for the ages ala Williams collaboration 1 Streetcar Named Desire. But that doesn't mean it should be much underlooked either.As an early effort for Lumet it's also a scorcher dramatically he's so good with the actors that whatever little missteps the script might take in pouring on the poetic prose in how some of the characters talk there's a scene between Brando and Anna Magnani's characters by some ruin of a spot where she says people used to make love that is actually quite boring can be usually forgiven. Magnani especially is interesting because she should be a case of miscasting which apparently in later years Lumet admitted to. She seems lowkey at first but her strengths bloom out tenfold when it comes time to act like the hardknocklife kind of woman she is who's in a crap marriage and had a horrible affair with a man who didn't do anything after the summer they spent together. Now she's put into a situation where she does and doesn't want this drifter and vice versa and she's sometimes just as cool though also quite tough and demanding in that big Italian mama way as her counterpart.Meanwhile there's also Joanne Woodard who has the kind of part many actresses love to chew on feisty outspoken loud but also emotionally moody to the point that she admirably tries and doesn't quite get to the heights of Vivien Leigh with her classic Blanche Dubois. Overall Lumet gets a good feel for the period and shot in New York state no less while working with good material and an even better cast. It won't ever be as revered as his other work and at the same time it's much better than some would give it credit for where the tragedy acts like another sweaty Southern caricature bemoaning existence and fitting on a bad pair of shoes.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Fugitive Kind 1960This is one of those great movies that slips its way into that big gap between the great Hollywood Golden Age to the great New Hollywood of the late 1960s. An awful lot of films from the period between 195565 are weak or even downright bad big budgets and all. The Hollywood gems in that time are usually a little gut wrenching and many are based on plays or push political issues I'm thinking of The Apartment and The Manchurian Candidate. The famous directors coming to their own during time include Elia Kazan and Robert Wise and of course Sidney Lumet who directed this one.This is all working class plainspeaking emotive material. Right from the getgo with leading man Marlon Brando doing a long take as he stands before a judge we are filled with heartwrenching stuff people who want to be something and don't know how or people with big hearts that are broken or dirty. The cast beyond Brando is terrific Joanne Woodward as a young floozy with a sharp sense of independence Maureen Stapleton as a simple and faith filled wife of the sheriff and Anna Magnani intense and troubled but superior in her own out of place way.There are powerful displays of white narrowmindedness call it bigotry but it is largely aimed at just anyone they don't like that don't quite fall into clichs there is love that shouldn't be and that never is there is old world morality and inbred local gossipy immorality. Things are bound for collision even by twenty minutes in and there are innuendoes and hidden histories waiting to blossom. Lumet has a knack for the serious with his 1957 breakthrough film 12 Angry Men a template for his career. As lively and even crazy as this movie is it's also probing deeply into human woe and maladjustment often deliberate. The core of the writing belongs to Tennessee Williams who of course is all about inner troubles and outward misunderstood or mistaken actions. There is nothing superficial here not in the acting the filming or the scenes set in the South but filmed near Saratoga Springs New York. And if the wet dark nights scenes and interiors with people quarreling and fighting aren't enough to suck you in the story about wanting to live nothing more is beautiful and important. All four of the main characters are deeply good people and all flawed in small but debilitating ways. Which should sound familiar. As over the top as it sometimes seems you'll identify with the position some of the people end up in. Brando is temperamental but patient and with a profound sense of justice. Woodward is a free spirit misunderstood and punished by the uptight and hypocritical society around her. The themes are frank for 1960 including an implication of a male so manly and irresistible the women want him and get him even when it's completely wrong. And when it's right. The sexuality partly pumped up by the writing of the openly gay playwright Williams is all over Brando's face and in his scenes. And this is his movie.High high drama but from within. And explosive. Don't miss it.".

	onyx:emotionText "The Fugitive Kind 1960This is one of those great movies that slips its way into that big gap between the great Hollywood Golden Age to the great New Hollywood of the late 1960s. An awful lot of films from the period between 195565 are weak or even downright bad big budgets and all. The Hollywood gems in that time are usually a little gut wrenching and many are based on plays or push political issues I'm thinking of The Apartment and The Manchurian Candidate. The famous directors coming to their own during time include Elia Kazan and Robert Wise and of course Sidney Lumet who directed this one.This is all working class plainspeaking emotive material.

	schema:reviewBody "I suspect that Tennessee Williams probably agreed to change the title of his classically sounding play Orpheus Descending to The Fugitive Kind in order to insure box office. Possibly some of Marlon Brando's fans garnered from The Wild One might pay their admissions thinking they were seeing something like that. I can think of worst ways to be exposed to one of America's most respected playwrights.This was Brando's second time doing Williams for the screen the first time being A Streetcar Named Desire. Curiously enough this was Anna Magnani's second time doing Tennessee Williams for the screen as well she won an Oscar in 1955 for The Rose Tattoo. So the combination of Brando and Magnani seemed a natural for the screen. I don't think The Fugitive Kind is as good as Streetcar or The Rose Tattoo but the parts are meaty enough roles for both these honored players.Characters seem to drift in to The Fugitive Kind from other Williams work. Brando's Val Xavier is quite like Chance Wayne in Sweet Bird of Youth in fact in the review's title is the illusion Brando himself makes of his character. He's an early 30 something drifter with a talent for sex and music the former probably more than the latter.Unlike Chance Xavier doesn't have a female keeper but he'd like to find one. He passes up liaison with the town trollop played by a third Oscar winner in the cast Joanne Woodward for the older and married Anna Magnani.Magnani is trapped in a loveless marriage to a dying Victor Jory a petty tyrant who runs the town general store. Like Big Daddy in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof Jory is dying of cancer at a much more advanced stage of the disease than Burl Ives had. Picture Big Mama from that play hot to trot for Chance Wayne and you've got the essence of The Fugitive Kind.Joanne Woodward has an interesting part. Part of her loose behavior is in rebellion against the time honored tradition of institutional racism that is the south that Tennessee Williams grew up in. I'm not an expert on Tennessee Williams but of the works I've seen that are revived frequently this is the only one where Williams directly brings up racism. Orpheus Descending on Broadway only ran 68 performances in 1957. Two members from the Broadway cast made it to the screen R.G. Armstrong as the sheriff repeating his role and Maureen Stapleton who had Joanne Woodward's part on stage essays the part of the sheriff's wife who also is married to another middle aged tyrant. Considered a lesser work of Williams at first Orpheus Descending is now revived frequently by stock theater companies everywhere. A critically acclaimed revival on Broadway in 1989 with Vanessa Redgrave and Tammy Grimes and Kevin Anderson helped bring Orpheus Descending into its proper place in the sun.Maybe if a remake is ever done it will even be done under its proper original title. Till then we can be well satisfied with this version.".

Even today Jabe Hades the king of the Underworld where he keeps his PersephoneEurydice Lady prisoner sounds an awful lot like what George W.

I think the film works because it makes no concession to realism and frankly asserts the story's mythological elements. Lumet Magnani Brando Jory Stapleton Armstrong and Woodward make it work and deliver a film and performances that are bigger than life and worthy of the best European art films of the period.

It is the acting of these two that make me want to watch this film time and time again. I didn't necessarily like Joanne Woodward in her role it just didn't seem to fit her. It seemed like she was trying too hard or something so I just tuned her out. But I was always tuned into Brandoits just something about him that just pulls you inwondering what he'll do next in the scene. Anyway The cinematography is great and adds to the moodiness of the film. Overall the movie isn't necessarily Brando's greatest film but it's by no means one of his worst. Unfortunately there wasn't much to work with as far as the script so the acting had to carry the film.".

It is the acting of these two that make me want to watch this film time and time again. I didn't necessarily like Joanne Woodward in her role it just didn't seem to fit her. It seemed like she was trying too hard or something so I just tuned her out. But I was always tuned into Brandoits just something about him that just pulls you inwondering what he'll do next in the scene. Anyway The cinematography is great and adds to the moodiness of the film. Overall the movie isn't necessarily Brando's greatest film but it's by no means one of his worst. Unfortunately there wasn't much to work with as far as the script so the acting had to carry the film.";

After seeing the Hall film I went to Williams' text then revisited 'The Fugitive Kind' which I remembered as having brilliant moments but as finally somewhat confused.Lumet's film differs significantly from the play incidents mentioned in a line or less of dialogue get acted out with too much variety of settings in the film apart from the inevitable cuts lines are transposed in different sequence in the film script and the play's pinpoint progression of human relations is blurred in the film.The film credits are impressive Williams helped prepare the screen adaptation. The two films that came after this one in Sidney Lumet's filmography were also adaptations of stage plays and both have terrific impact 'Long Day's Journey into Night' and 'A View From the Bridge'. Brando and Magnini were great screen presences. I don't know what went on in behind the scenes but to my mind more turns out to be less in this celluloid adaptation. Williams felt this play to be 'special' among his works. Some critics thought his perfecting it over very many years was an obsession that got him nowhere. The 1990 Peter Hall film can help us reappraise William's work. The two main characters have a vulnerability not in the BrandoMagnani version which opens our receptiveness to the play. The bit of ballad Brando sings to no one is banal for example while Kevin AndersonValentine's songs send a haunting beauty to us the viewers and to characters in the drama he is Orpheus descendingto the Hell of our world!".

He very smartly displays the sexual tension and torment between the characters the actors deserve credit for this too and brilliantly brings out Val and Lady Torrence's denied vulnerable side. The scenes are brought out by some fine and provocative for it's time dialogue.Marlon Brando as a wandering guitar player fits his part like a glove. He gives a very restrained natural performance. I cannot picture anyone else who would have better suited the part. Magnani's Lady Torrence is quite the opposite of Brando's Val Xavier but it is their loneliness that attracts them towards each other and the actress does an excellent job in delivering an intense multidimensional performance. She expresses the conflicting emotions with complete grace. The scenes with Val and Lady Torrence are clearly the highlight of the movie. The supporting cast especially Maureen Stapleton are also good.There are a few loud melodramatic moments which could have been toned down. The story moves on a slow but smooth pace until its explosive ending.

There was nothing quite like the mixture of poetic symbolism the fevered acting styles from the cast and the evocation of a dusty little Southern town.The critics at the time didn't know what to make of this film probably looking for the happy predictability of the usual 1950's timepasser and it went largely ignored certainly by the public and pretty much by everyone else. As time has passed the intensity of contributions from everyone on the set is palpable especially the wonderful lighting effects that make this oddball Tennessee Williams play on stage it was Orpheus Descending especially cinematic. It is a distinctive and fascinating portrait of the oddball strain in a changing nation and rich with some memorable encounters. How can you not want to go jukin with Joanne Woodward looking as she does like Blanche Dubois after she escaped the asylum? I think the film only gets better with time but would caution those who want realism or expect sweet resolutions to stay away from the film. It is vintage Tennessee Williams with life's fragile losers the focus the tale heavy with symbolism the climax certainly not a cheererupper.".

	schema:reviewBody "Der Mann mit dem Glasauge or Terror on Half Moon Street or The Man with the Glass Eye is a German movie from the late 1960s. The film's director is Alfred Vohrer once again just like in so many others of the Edgar Wallace series. Lead actor is Horst Tappert Derrick and this is also not the only appearance for him in terms of Edgar Wallace. And also the runtime is at under 90 minutes exactly what they usually are. But something unusual is that I did enjoy this one. Most of the other German Wallace films I saw were really nothing special at all but this one is kinda memorable. The reason is not Tappert's lead performance as I found him fairly bland or the antagonist in the film's title who almost becomes forgotten the longer the film goes. The heart and should of the movie are the supporting characters be it the main character's boss his assistant or the several crew members from a local circus performers group. All colorful characters and they were interesting enough for me to watch. The final scenes involving an evil old aristocrat lady her son's love interest who may be just as evil or just the very final scene in which a group of girls gets saved from being forced to go into prostitution it was all interesting to watch and unlike many other films the comedic parts work fine in here as well. I recommend Der Mann mit dem Glasauge. This was actually a convincing watch. Thumbs up.".

Heroin and the white slave trade to be precise. But I don't imagine the early 'krimi' relied so much on humour but this one gets just a little too silly. Not helped by an English dub devoted more to trying to out camp each other rather than convince us of any hint of believability. The colour deserves a mention because even if the film could not live up to the opening credits the bright even lurid colour does and the blood is the very brightest red I've seen in a film. There are hints at the giallo and we see the classic hat cloaked coat and black rubber gloves but really this cannot surely be a good guide to the best of this mini genre I have heard so much about but seen so little of.".

	schema:reviewBody "To this writer the film is Roger Corman's best entry into scifi. Many of his 50s efforts hold a certain campy charm with their lowbudget effects  and this film is similar in that regard. It does not dwell on the effects in fact some of them are rather poor. What it does have in its favor is a tight screenplay that gets into the story quickly as will the viewer  and it's engrossing enough and the characters interesting enough that one stays involved through the episodic story.What it has most in its favor is an excellent performance from Ray Milland then in his last days being topbilled and he milks it for all that it's worth. In some scenes Corman goes for a direct closeup and Milland's facial reactions indicate that he took the the role in a smallbudgettight schedule film with all the enthusiasm that he did in one of his roles for Alfred Hitchcock Dial M For Murder or Fritz Lang Ministry of Fear. Smooth refined but a man of immediate action if necessary Milland's Dr. Xavier is not your usual mad scientist. As with Claude Rains in The Invisible Man or Al Hedison in The Fly he's the scientist who made the mistake of being his own subject.Occasionally Corman goes for the cheap gag the party sequence where Xavier examines the guests sans attire  but inoffensive in a typical 60s approach but the carnival scenes and the basement healer scenes show a maturity to Corman's direction and these scenes are greatly helped by the performance of Don Rickles. He's as sleazy as one can get and admits that if he had the power he would use it to see all the undressed women my poor eyes can stand and you believe it. A scene where Milland confronts other carnival workers who are speculating on his power shows the doctor to be both introspective and world weary at the same time. At this point even he does not know what to do with his ability but Rickles' suggestion of setting up a site to heal others leads to the film's most revealing and almost poetic sequence. Xavier's original intention was to help the ill but his implication in an accidental murder led him to seek refuge in the carnival Richard Kimblestyle.Diana Van Der Vlis does well with her underwritten role in which at one point she's rather quickly dropped and then resurfaces rather conveniently later in the story  to no great effect. This was only her second feature film though she had done a number of TV guest shots. Although half Milland's age she seems more mature than her 28 years and they make a believable pair. A bonus is the appearance of a number of veterans in brief roles  John Hoyt Harold J. Stone John Dierkes and Morris Ankrum as well as Corman stalwart Dick Miller. Miller shares his scenes with Jonathan Haze whom it appears was getting the cheapest rate Corman could pay as he has no lines at all. He was rather bitter about this as he revealed in an interview years later.Floyd Crosby's cinematography belies the small budget  only 300000 and a shooting schedule of about three weeks. According to Corman they did rehearse a bit more than usual  and in the finished product it shows. He claims he even went as high as four takes which may not exactly put him in William Wyler or Stanley Kubrick territory but it's a far cry from what he'd do in the 50s. Les Baxter contributes what may be my favorite of his scores fully complimentary to the action on screen without overwhelming it.There's a bit of controversy over the ending  some attribute an extra line of dialog that never appeared in any print that I've seen but it is still one of the most surprising endings of any scifi film since The Incredible Shrinking Man. That it won the top prize at the Trieste Science Fiction Film Festival would be enough for one to be curious enough to see it even this many years later  that it has held up so well over 40 years points to that award's validity.".

I am not sure that much or even any scientific creedence can be given to the idea behind the experiments of Dr. Xavier James and his search to see beyond what normal vision allows.  Ray Milland gives a fine performance as the obsessed man out to continue his experiments even if they involve using himself as the human guinea pig.

Dr. Xavier discovers something that he can use to see through solid objects but its effect is cumulative and by the end of the movie he's seeing all the way to the core of reality.Of course he has to go on the run and must abandon his medical career. We see him in a carnival reading peoples' thoughts and later teaming up with his x girlfriend and going to Vegas and seeing through the cards and winning big and finally escaping from the police and as he drives through the Nevada desert we see that he can't see a thing. Abandoning his Lincoln Continental he stumbles into a tent revival meeting. The preacher played by Royal Dano?is telling his followers to throw Satan out. Filmed by Floyd Crosby with beautiful special effects this is a real piece of 60's filmmaking by one of the masters.".

	schema:reviewBody "Science fiction which questions the very nature of existence itself is probably the most fascinating basis for a story idea addressed.  Prior to X THE MAN WITH THE XRAY EYES the only other film to explore this theme was Jack Arnold's profound THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING MAN 1957 and both of these groundbreaking films paved the way for later endeavours like Stanley Kubrick's experimental 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY 1968.X THE MAN WITH THE XRAY EYES was released theatrically on September 1963. On network television at this time were two important scififantasy series namely Rod Serling's THE TWILIGHT ZONE and Joseph Stefano's THE OUTER LIMITS.  This Roger Corman work is very much the same school of science fiction as both of these series which places greater emphasis on strong writing provocative drama outstanding performances and ensemble casting as the main foundation for storytelling and focus for viewer interest.Ray Milland as Dr. James Xavier sets the film's premise by noting that the human eye is only sensitive to onetenth the spectrum of light and what would be seen if human vision developed enough to perceive the full spectrum.  Unfortunately as his range of vision increases more and more his sensibilities prove inadequate to cope with the indefinable apparitions which he beholds and his radically changing perception of the physical world around him.  The most significant and telling moment occurs when Dr. Xavier hiding out from the law in a tenement basement apartment for the accidental murder of a colleague peers upward with his supervision penetrating through the ceiling of his room and sees beyond the night sky past the starry heavens and beholds the very center of existence itself causing the awestruck researcher to cry out in anguished torment.Later with the authorities in hot pursuit Dr. Xavier enters the tent of a roadshow religious bible meeting and movingly tells the incredulous throng gathered within about what he has witnessed evocatively describing the vision as a great eye at the core of the universe which sees and watches us all.The nihilistic ending of the film involves Dr. Xavier pluckingout his eyeballs now no longer recognizable as eyes at the impassioned urgence of a fanatical evangelist and his congregation with the image of Xavier's countenance freezeframing to disclose his empty bloodred eye sockets then abruptly fading out to black followed by the closing credits. This would seem to reaffirm the timeworn homily that there are some things man was not meant to know or tamper with and many critics and theatre goers understandably found this conclusion somewhat discordant and incongruous with the ideas and events which had preceded it.  However this restructured ending was mandated at the insistence of the studio heads and is not the finale that was initially filmed.  The original conclusion as intended had Dr. Xavier plucking out his eyeballs and looking around in confusion he cries out I can still see! which sheds a different light for not only had his expansive vision enabled Xavier to observe the infinite but his heightened perception has now evolved beyond the need of mere eyes for sight.X THE MAN WITH THE XRAY EYES was the third of three interesting works produced by American International Pictures over a two year period which starred Ray Milland.  The other two films were Roger Corman's THE PREMATURE BURIAL 1962 and PANIC IN YEAR ZERO 1962 which Mr. Milland both directed and starred in.  Not surprisingly Mr. Milland gives an exceptional performance as the illfated Dr. Xavier and his distinguished name and considerable Thespian expertise certainly gives this film much prestige and impact.  Ray Milland is ably supported by a fine supporting cast of talented professionals including Diana Van Der Vliss Harold J. Stone John Hoyt Don Rickles in a marvelous straight character role John Dierkes and a brief appearance by scifi film veteran Morris Ankrum as a hospital board member.Mention must also be made of Les Baxter's hauntingly atmospheric and unusual music score particularly memorable is this compelling composition's wailing sirenlike quality which ranks among his best.  Mr. Baxter is primarily known for his musical contributions to the early editions of Roger Corman's Poe series of horror films AIP's Beach Party movies and other AIP hits such as William Witney's MASTER OF THE WORLD 1961 and Jacques Tourneur's THE COMEDY OF TERRORS 1964.X THE MAN WITH THE XRAY EYES is certainly one of the most important films in the catalogue of both Roger Corman and American International Pictures and marked Corman's welcome return to the scifi genre which he had abandoned since the late 1950's.  At this point in time Roger Corman was riding the crest of considerable artistic and commerical triumph thanks mainly to his renowned Edgar Allan Poe film series and X THE MAN WITH THE XRAY EYES came in a lush period of inspiration and creativity where this auteur director seemly could do no wrong.".

For someone who had admired Milland's work for many years it just seems odd for me to see him in a smallbudget film. Maybe things got tough for him near the end of his career and he would take most any role. I don't know and I'm not judging.....just curious why he took this role. I do know having him in the movie elevates it and the dialog isn't as cheesy as one would expect in a 1950ish scifi horror story made in the '60s. Comedian Don Rickles playing a greedy criminal guy was another odd cast selection but he too was fun to watch.Corman was smart to keep this at a respectable 79 minutes. Had it gone on longer it would have started to drag. It would be interesting to see this film done with today's specialeffects.".

In place of unaffordable fancy effects and perhaps all for the better although it is interesting to fantasize about a more technically accomplished version that would retain the soul of the original movie the story uses gripping and evocative dialog to convey the frightening distortion of Xavier's vision.Throughout the narrative there is an air of tragedy and horror. The lead character thanks to Russell's writing and Milland's performance has been etched out so well you empathize at each moment with what he's going through.The climax is a shocking literal interpretation of the biblical command If thine eye offends thee pluck it out".

	schema:reviewBody "Roger Corman is often passed over as merely a Bmovie director but films like this one really show his brilliance. The Man with XRay Eyes is chilling ingenious and highly original and this becomes even more impressive when you consider that the film was shot on a shoestring budget of just 300000. Because of this Corman doesn't go overboard with the special effects and as such the film concentrates on the implications of the lead character's predicament. This actually helps the film as the idea behind what is happening is far more chilling than how it has actually happened. The plot follows a doctor doing research into the eye. After discovering a new drug that can give its taker Xray vision he decides to test it on himself due to lack of funds. Before long he finds that he is able to see through people's clothes surely a useful ability as well as walls and other surfaces. However this new capability soon takes its toll on the good doctor as he loses the ability to shut out the light and after a tragic event he has to find a new way to make a living.Ray Milland who worked with Corman previously on the Poe adaptation 'Premature Burial' takes the lead and gives a great portrayal of the doctor at the centre of the story. Milland is great at portraying a strain on a character and that ability is put to best use in this film. The story is frightening because as is said at one moment in the film we only get one pair of eyes and therefore that pair is precious. The idea of not being able to cut out the light is frightening also as while many people would see Xray vision as an asset this film does well in disputing that. The way that Corman portrays the 'Xray vision' makes best use of the budget available and actually works rather well as we get treated to seeing the world through the eyes of the lead character. The way that the story pans out isn't particularly original but it works in that it's believable and provides a good backdrop for the major focus of the film. Overall The Man with XRay Vision is proof that a film can work in spite of a limited budget and while Corman may not be the best director of all time he certainly knows how to make Bmovies!".

	schema:reviewBody "The sad thing about the film X is that it was 40 years ahead of its time. Roger Corman should have done this or even redone this film in the age of computer graphics. Maybe at a major studio perhaps.But a major studio would never have taken a chance on a film like this. A science fiction movie without any horrific monsters or buckets of blood and gore the moguls would reason who would want to see that? X could only be done at AmericanInternational Pictures and be done only with someone of the imagination of Roger Corman.Ray Milland as Dr. James Xavier is a research scientist doing work in the field of vision. Dr. Frankenstein only wanted to bring life back from the dead. Milland wants to improve vision so that we see with the eye of God. He develops a serum based on hormones and enzymes and you apply to the eyes. Milland sees things more clearly but as was said in a film some thirty years after X he can't handle the truth.After accidentally killing a colleague friend in Harold J. Stone Milland goes underground still continuing his experiments and working first at a carnival and then at a diagnostichealer under the tutelage of Don Rickles. All the while colleague Diana Van Der Vlis is looking for him because guilty or not of the homicide of their friend Stone Van Der Vlis believes in Milland and his work.The climax of this film which takes place in a tent revival meeting is a sudden death one and unforgettable. Let's just say there are no good choices or fates left for Milland. And he's been given a clarity far beyond what any of these people in that tent can comprehend.Don Rickles will surprise many with his performance as this bottom feeding carnival hustler at how good he is. Actually he's not wrong in what he sees as a practical solution for all concerned hiding Milland from the authorities making money and allowing him to continue his research. But no proper doctor wants a partner like Rickles. It's like Colin Clive teaming up with Dwight Frye. Also in a small role at the end of the film is John Dierkes as the small time evangelist with the tent show. He's also quite good.X does ask some interesting questions much like the original Frankenstein movie. This film really deserves a remake.".

	onyx:emotionText "The sad thing about the film X is that it was 40 years ahead of its time. Roger Corman should have done this or even redone this film in the age of computer graphics. Maybe at a major studio perhaps.But a major studio would never have taken a chance on a film like this. A science fiction movie without any horrific monsters or buckets of blood and gore the moguls would reason who would want to see that? X could only be done at AmericanInternational Pictures and be done only with someone of the imagination of Roger Corman.Ray Milland as Dr. James Xavier is a research scientist doing work in the field of vision. Dr. Frankenstein only wanted to bring life back from the dead. Milland wants to improve vision so that we see with the eye of God. He develops a serum based on hormones and enzymes and you apply to the eyes. Milland sees things more clearly but as was said in a film some thirty years after X he can't handle the truth.After accidentally killing a colleague friend in Harold J. Stone Milland goes underground still continuing his experiments and working first at a carnival and then at a diagnostichealer under the tutelage of Don Rickles. All the while colleague Diana Van Der Vlis is looking for him because guilty or not of the homicide of their friend Stone Van Der Vlis believes in Milland and his work.The climax of this film which takes place in a tent revival meeting is a sudden death one and unforgettable. Let's just say there are no good choices or fates left for Milland. And he's been given a clarity far beyond what any of these people in that tent can comprehend.Don Rickles will surprise many with his performance as this bottom feeding carnival hustler at how good he is. Actually he's not wrong in what he sees as a practical solution for all concerned hiding Milland from the authorities making money and allowing him to continue his research. But no proper doctor wants a partner like Rickles. It's like Colin Clive teaming up with Dwight Frye. Also in a small role at the end of the film is John Dierkes as the small time evangelist with the tent show.

	schema:reviewBody "NOTE Possible spoiler but it all really depends on what you think of as a spoiler.I just finished watching X The Man With XRay Eyes and to tell the truth I'm a little unsure of what to make of it.  It is such a beautifully flawed film I don't know whether to call it quirky great horrendous or what. I suppose I'll just write and figure out what I wanted to say at the end.I'll start with the low points.  Of course it's horrendously dated and tacky but that's the problem of the modern viewer not the film.  The plot is incredulous and has a couple of huge gapng holes pun intended but if you're watching a film called X The Man With XRay Eyes you shouldn't be expecting Mamet.The film's dialogue thins out in many spots and in fact some of the lines seem to come right out of a High School drama project.  The film also seems padded in places most notably the stretch in Vegas and the car chase that seems to go on forever.  It's as if they needed to stretch out the film in these spots in order to make it featurelength. Lastly director Roger Corman relies heavily on the special effects in the film which are quite interesting when first used and then because of overuse rarely reach the same intensity again.However the film's high points overshadow the roughness most of the time. The acting is superb despite some incredibly hokey dialogue especially from Ray Milland in the title role.  However I was personally knocked out by Don Rickles no really who puts in a truly real and unforgettable performance as a sideshow carny who finds his meal ticket in X.Let's see what else...the story is truly wonderful in spite of its hokiness it makes the viewer think about many issues.  Are there things man was not meant to know?  Can science go too far?  Can knowledge drive one mad?  Or as my brother asked Why doesn't he use his powers for good like getting sex?Finally many scenes are both emotionally and viscerally shocking.  The carnies' conversation with the mysterious Mentallo is starkly haunting as a man who has been driven away from everything he knows is being reprimanded by ignorant fools that cannot comprehend his situation.  The final scene in the Christian revival tent is both chilling and shocking as we watch the nearly mad Xavier relating his tale of the eye at the center of the universe and being damned by the preacher who tells him If thine eyes offend thee cast them out!!  In the 1960s this would have been gutwrenchingly sickening it's effect is dulled only slightly on a modern audience.So what are my final thoughts?  Despite its flaws X is still a very good film bordering on great.  It's definitely a mustsee for any fan of horror or scifi and even people who wouldn't normally see a film like this should give it a try.  It may not always be pretty it may not always be shocking it may not always be good.  But the last frame of the film will always remain with you and you'll want to talk about it with someone when you're done even if it's only to say Was that as weird as I thought it was?".

When you see him wearing the dark glasses he very much looks like a person today wearing Virtual Reality Glasses. No one making the film at the time could even imagine that. Roger Corman was on TCM recently saying that at almost 300000 dollars this was one of his biggest budget films. I am not even sure that money would pay for the poor lab monkey who gets too much of an eye full early in this one now. This movie has a cult following today for some very good reasons. The old carnival scenes are a throwback to simpler times with the kind of carnival thrill rides that existed before the huge theme parks that came later.Don Rickles is a perfect example of the early 1960's as his 2 desires are lust of all women and money and more money. A small amount of his standup humor getting into this script does not hurt the film either. To me the iconic scene is the end one which has rarely been duplicated in SciFi. Milland wanders into an old fashioned religious tent revival these still happen and walks up to the fire and brimstone preacher. He tells the preacher what he sees as God due to his XRay eyes. The preacher tells him it is because he has sinned. There are several ways to interpret this depending on your point of view but it leaves one of the deepest closing messages ever put into a SciFi film.".

The basic idea of the film is that a surgeon has somehow concocted an eye drop formula that enables your eyes to see through things  ya' know like xrays how a regular doc was engaged in such successful scientific experimentation is a complete mystery.That's pretty much it for plot. Oh yeah there's some campy stuff where good ol' doc realizes he sees everyone naked etc. etc... pretty routine sixties stuff there. The film really flounders because of the stupidity of the writing. Our good doc Ray Milland stubbornly refuses to test his concoction on anyone but himself because evidently Joe Blow wouldn't be able to describe Xray vision to him I guess the ol' Hey  everybody's naked!! wouldn't be of much use??? The doc is evidently pretty stupid or else these eye drops act like a narcotic because he keeps on and keeps on taking the stuff even after he says he'd just like to be able to open his eyes again and he's going nuts because everything is so bright weird etc. And then there's the odd transition from the point where he has to take drops because it's wearing off even though he kept saying the effect was cumulative and then next thing you know he's seeing to the middle of the universe or something.The ending also was pretty weird completely unrealistic and done for cheap shock value. Even with all that this lowbudget might have worked as a morality play or something of the like but that avenue isn't even on the map much less explored. The whole thing was marginally watchable once but I definitely wouldn't want to suffer through it again. I'd like to give it a little higher rating but there's really not a reason I can think to do so.".

Interestingly the two have been combined onto one DVDand they both are very entertaining and would make a nice purchase for your home video collection.In X Ray Milland plays a crazed scientist who is working on a formula to improve vision. It seems he's stumbled upon a formula to make eye drops that might allow someone to actually see through things! He is so focused on his work that he's willing to even try out his formula on himselfa very very bad decision in retrospect.The film gets high marks for just being entertaining and goofy fun. It's not intellectual or brilliantly made but it is fun to watchsomething too often neglected in film reviews. The only serious drawbacks are the ways that people behave in the filmit just didn't make sense on many occasions. I'll give a few examples. First because Milland had such wonderful xray vision he could see that a child about to undergo surgery actually has a tumorthe other doctor is wrong in his diagnosis. How this other doctor reactsboth before AND after Milland saves the girl makes no sense. Likewise soon after this a psychiatrist way overreacts to Milland's powersa tries to forcibly stab Milland with a hypo filled with a sedative while standing DIRECTLY NEXT TO A GIANT WINDOW!! Is anyone that dumb?! And when the psychiatrist ends up falling out the window after a brief struggle Milland runsyet he'd really done nothing wrongjust reacted to people's overreactions and assaultive behavior. It was as if he had a giant fly head or was Godzilla in the way some reacted! Come on folks he's just got great vision!!My score of 6 is for the overall quality of the film. It ain't brilliantly made. But as far as the entertainment factor goes I'd give this one an 8it is a mustsee for lovers of lowbudget 60s horror.".

	schema:reviewBody "Doctor James Xavier is convinced that he has a major breakthrough in medical science within his grasp.  His research into amazing eyedrops yes eyedrops which bestow xray vision has been shunned by the scientific community so Xavier conducts his work surreptitiously using himself as his own guineapig.  One fateful day he hits upon the perfect formula...     Okay so Roger Corman movies are MEANT to be trashy.  The king of lowbudget scifi horror has been doing it for nigh on half a century and has carved himself a niche of sorts.  But one can't help wincing.  This particular cheapo was made in 1963 but in mood and style it is pure 1957 except for the withit funky party.  Writers Dillon and Russell have cranked out a cruddy script full of stilted dialogue and narrative nonsequiturs.  In order that the viewers may understand that Xavier plans to experiment on himself the script has Diane ask him You're planning to experiment on yourself aren't you?  In noble heroic tones Xavier asks Have you any idea what I'm trying to accomplish here?  Well er yes we have because he spends the first half of the film telling us over and over again what he's trying to accomplish.     Everything about the film is shoddy.  Whether this is glorious camp entertainment or just poor craftsmanship is a matter of personal taste.  I tend somewhat reluctantly towards the latter view.       The opening credits show a pair of disembodied eyes and a rotating spiral executed in purple paint you'll see where the purple paint came from in a moment.  Are these effects meant to send a shudder of terror through us or to make us laugh?  It is not easy to tell.     The long scene between Xavier and Diane Fairfax in the corridor of the Foundation is a prime example of plodding plotexposition which is bad enough but it contains so much visual and verbal naffery that one wonders if it was shot by 14yearolds.  Xavier buying nasty instant coffee from a hideous vendingmachine is intended to look stylish.  That alone will convey a sense of the film's production values to those who have yet to see it.     Sam Brant Harold Stone is an atrociously poorlydrawn character.  He is sort of but not quite the voice of responsible science advocating caution.  The reality is he has been added to the cast so that he can be killed off.  I note in passing that one IMDb reviewer describes Brant's demise as accidental murder.  As an attorney who has appeared in a murder trial I find the concept of accidental murder rather puzzling  but no matter ...     So they cut me off like an arm with gangrene whines Xavier after he has been struck off for malpractice and the crude surgical metaphor reveals a lot.  The writers have no understanding of the medical profession and how it works.  Doctors are constantly depicted in a shallow and amateurish way.     If the operating theatre scene is preposterous the happening is diabolically bad.  Execrable throughout the dialogue reaches its sorry nadir as Diane and Xavier boogie their way through a truly embarrassing scene.  This isn't ironic humour.  It's just plain awful.     The fairground scene is unaccountably shot indoors and for some reason everything that doesn't move has been painted purple.  Banter between the characters is depressingly lame and offduty belly dancers wander around the stalls still wearing their eastern costumes.  Stock archive footage of a fair is spliced onto the scene in an attempt to suggest authenticity but it is woefully unconvincing.     The catalogue of garbage is almost unending  wood and rope used for a splint the arrival of a doctor mere seconds after having been summoned the sketchilydrawn twodimensional innards which Xavier sees when he looks at someone's abdomen ... it goes on and on.  Xavier sets up as a charlatan faithhealer and Diane finds him plying his trade in his squalid new surroundings.  It is odd that she should succeed where a murder hunt failed but actually it has taken her a whole month to locate him when all she needed to do was to ask the patients.  Crane the mountebank destroys his own scam for no discernible reason.     Xavier now heads for Las Vegas and finds himself in a casino which just happens to be decorated with the same grotty purple paint which embellished the fairground.  It is not at all clear at least to me why Xavier leaves without Diane or throws all his money away.     The car smash is shot in an embarrassingly cheapskate way even for this cheapskate film.  Xavier's escape sequence lasts far too long.  His black contact lenses are almost as laughable as the revival meeting into which he stumbles.     It has been suggested that the abrupt ending in fact truncates the original one in which Xavier reveals that he can still see despite the drastic action that he has just taken.  It is not clear why Corman should have made this cut or why the editing is so clumsy but by this stage who cares?  Enough is enough.".

	schema:reviewBody "It is sometimes said of London buses that you can wait ages for one and then two come along at once. So it is with films about Oscar Wilde. The world waited sixty years for a film about him and then two came along in the same year The Trials of Oscar Wilde starring Peter Finch and Oscar Wilde starring Robert Morley. There was of course a third version in the late nineties Wilde starring Stephen Fry.I have never seen the Morley film but The Trials has a lot in common with Wilde. Both tell the same story of Wilde's friendship with the handsome but spoilt young aristocrat Lord Alfred Douglas Bosie and of how Wilde was pressured into bringing an illadvised libel suit against Bosie's father the Marquess of Queensberry who had accused him of sodomy. As a result of the failure of that lawsuit Wilde was arrested charged with gross indecency and sentenced to two years imprisonment. Although the two films acknowledge different source material Wilde is clearly indebted to The Trials the two films have a number of scenes in common. In places the dialogue is almost wordforword the same.There are however a number of differences of emphasis. The Trials as its name might suggest places a greater emphasis on the legal aspects of Wilde's case with a greater number of courtroom scenes. The word trials clearly has two meanings here it is used both in its legal sense and in the sense of sufferings. It omits however details of Wilde's life in Paris after his release and places less emphasis on his relationship with his wife Constance and with his children.There are some notable acting performances in The Trials especially from James Mason as Queensberry's lawyer Edward Carson and Lionel Jeffries as the splenetic Marquess himself a man eaten up with rage and hatred I preferred Jeffries to Tom Wilkinson who played this role in Wilde. John Fraser on the other hand was not as good as Jude Law as Bosie. Peter Finch was a gifted actor but I certainly preferred Fry's interpretation of the title role. Whereas Fry made Wilde witty but also kindly sensitive and generous Finch's Wilde came across as too much the dandy a man who although capable of impulsive generosity often used his wit as a mask to hide his true feelings. Only towards the end of the film when he realises that he is in danger of imprisonment does he become more emotional.The greatest difference between the two films is that The Trials does not actually admit that Wilde was a homosexual. The impression is given that he may well have been the victim of unfounded gossip of a deliberate conspiracy led by Queensberry to blacken his name and of perjured evidence given by the prosecution witnesses in court. In reality there can be no doubt that Wilde was gay and the Stephen Fry version of his life is quite explicit on this point. Queensberry's accusations were largely true and in denying them Wilde perjured himself. It has become a received idea to say that he was the victim of the ignorant prejudices of the Victorian era and to congratulate ourselves rather smugly that we are today altogether more liberal and enlightened. This attitude however ignores the fact that for all his talents and his good qualities Wilde had a strongly selfdestructive side to his nature. As some of his lovers were below the age of consent if he were living in the first decade of the twentyfirst century rather than the last decade of the nineteenth he might actually receive given contemporary anxieties about paedophilia a longer prison term than two years. Even if he avoided a jail sentence for sex with minors he would certainly receive one for perjury.It is precisely because Wilde is more honest about its subject that it is the better film. Peter Finch's Wilde is the innocent victim of other men's villainy Stephen Fry's Wilde is a tragic hero a great man undone by a flaw in his character. Although he is more seriously flawed than Finch's character however he is also more human and lovable and his story seems more tragic.The Trials however probably went as far as any film could in dealing with the subject of homosexuality. For many years it had been taboo in the cinema a film on this subject would have been unthinkable in the Britain of say 1930 or even 1950. By the early sixties the moral climate had become slightly more liberal the influential film Victim which some credit with helping to bring about the legalisation of homosexual acts between consenting adults was to come out in 1961 a year after The Trials. In 1960 however homosexuality was still a criminal offence and there was a limit to how far it could be freely discussed in the cinema. Seen in this light The Trials although in some respects disappointing can be seen as a brave attempt to tackle a sensitive topic. 710".

John Fraser plays the moody Bosie as Oscar's current lover with a balanced mixture of effeminate charm and petulance.  Best acting role is that of Lionel Jeffreys as the Marquis of Queensbury.  Make no mistake his character comes through loud and clear.  He gives a remarkable portrayal of his utter disgust when his 21 year old son Bosie defies him and continues his relationship with Oscar a man of middle age and married.  All London is gossiping and there is much clicking of tongues. Mrs. Wilde played by beautiful Yvonne Mitchell stands by in utter dismay and disapproval.The courtroom scene gives Oscar the opportunity to deliver more witty lines and to describe his inner feelings about true love...interesting because one is not too sure what he is about to say next.  One gets the feeling that Oscar has chosen the path of selfdestruction...or is he just being his theatrical self?After he does his prison sentence with hard labour he is supposed to look tired and ill but I fail to notice much of a change in his demeanour.  He should be much paler with a worn down look.  This would command more sympathy.  Oscar's sexual adventures around the streets of London are not discussed to any extent nor portrayed in this film.  If they had been given more prominence we would perhaps have felt justified in agreeing with the jury's decision.  As it is  the sordid details of his sexual encounters are played down and because the film is presented in this way we feel rather sad that this great playwright both loving and generous should suffer so much at the hands of those who tried to destroy him.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ken Hughes film 'The Trials of Oscar Wilde' may at first appear to be one of those cheesy Technicolor costume dramas when in fact it is a gripping and finely acted account of the appalling treatment Oscar Wilde received at the hands of the English justice system at the end of the 19th century.Peter Finch is superb as the eponymous hero and is totally committed to the role and turns in one of his best performances on screen. The supporting cast is also quite good if more generalized in their characterizations more a fault of the screenplay than the performers. There is one especially fine supporting performance from Lionel Jeffries as the maniacal Lord Queensbury. Jeffries plays Queensbury as a crazed brute a type of man we can no longer countenance in these days though I suspect they are still out there waiting for their chance to pounce on those who they fear and do not understand.Sonia Dresdel is Lady Wilde Oscar's dotty mother at the end of her life. It's a small part but is quietly powerful. Other people in Wilde's life Constance his wife and Ada Leverson his stalwart friend and lifelong supporter are tantalizingly glimpsed but little is revealed of their inner workings. But this isn't a film about them but about the actual trials and much of the film is spent in courtrooms. This might sound boring but it isn't.James Mason appears in the first trial as the defending witness for Lord Queensbury and a more vicious narrowminded lawyer could hardly be found even these days.The technical credits are competent if nothing special the music melodramatic in a soapoperaish way the sets plush and too clean. But somehow the power and tragedy of Wilde's story comes through all the gilding of the script peppered with some of Wilde's wiser quotes wellplaced naturally in the text. There is nothing preachy or moralistic which is a relief compared to the highly politicized scripts being written since this film was made.It is interesting to note Nicholas Roeg as the camera operator. He wasn't the cinematographer but I detected a few Roegish touches in a couple of the more meditative scenes.This is not a film to be sluffed off as oldfashioned simply because there are no sex scenes or vulgar language or violence. The psychic violence suffered by Oscar Wilde was quite sufficient enough and this is a memorable film worth having in the collection.".

	schema:reviewBody "For a movie made in 1960 The Trials of Oscar Wilde was probably ahead of its time given the general taboo against open discussion of homosexuality in that era. Just guessing but it also may have gained the inordinate attention of the censors such as the old Catholic Legion of Decency. I first became aware of it only the other day Sept. 2005 when it was shown on Turner Classic Movies here in the USA. I can't believe this was the first time that a relatively tame 45yearold movie has been shown on American TV but I wonder. The movie tiptoes diplomatically around the elephant in the room but its central theme and the intent of the producers are clear enough for adult moviegoers. I can't remember the word homosexual being uttered in the dialogue but there were unmistakable surrogates such as sodomite. As a heterosexual far be it from me to ask this question but notwithstanding Peter Finch's fine performance in the lead role isn't his movie Wilde a more masculine portrayal than the historical Wilde? Perhaps this was also a necessary concession to the time in which it was made. In any case I also offer this spelling nitpick the Encyclopaedia Britannica 1982 refers to Wilde's nemesis as the Marquess of Queensberry not Queensbury. Also the rules of boxing are the Marquess of Queensberry rules.".

	onyx:emotionText "For a movie made in 1960 The Trials of Oscar Wilde was probably ahead of its time given the general taboo against open discussion of homosexuality in that era. Just guessing but it also may have gained the inordinate attention of the censors such as the old Catholic Legion of Decency. I first became aware of it only the other day Sept. 2005 when it was shown on Turner Classic Movies here in the USA. I can't believe this was the first time that a relatively tame 45yearold movie has been shown on American TV but I wonder. The movie tiptoes diplomatically around the elephant in the room but its central theme and the intent of the producers are clear enough for adult moviegoers. I can't remember the word homosexual being uttered in the dialogue but there were unmistakable surrogates such as sodomite. As a heterosexual far be it from me to ask this question but notwithstanding Peter Finch's fine performance in the lead role isn't his movie Wilde a more masculine portrayal than the historical Wilde? Perhaps this was also a necessary concession to the time in which it was made. In any case I also offer this spelling nitpick the Encyclopaedia Britannica 1982 refers to Wilde's nemesis as the Marquess of Queensberry not Queensbury. Also the rules of boxing are the Marquess of Queensberry rules.";

	schema:reviewBody "The relationship between Oscar Wilde and Bosie has already developed and is in full flow when this film begins so we are almost immediately immersed into the war of hate between Bosie and his homophobic and severely disapproving father. Bosie's father appears to disapprove of his son merely because of his son's lack of manliness and despises Oscar Wilde because of what he perceives as Wilde's role in perverting his son. But the resentment is also clearly due to the fact that Bosie's father just cannot connect with his son on any level well portrayed in this film and it is Wilde that appears to steel that genuine place in Bosie's heart. This just eats away at Bosie's father and so he attempts to destroy the relationship between Bosie  Wilde in any way he can. But the more he tries the more he pushes his son away into the arms of Wilde.Peter Finch plays Oscar Wilde admirably and he convinced me that this could have been the real Oscar Wilde. John Fraser plays Bosie acceptably  although i think it's his clean 'nice boy' looks that help him pull this role off more than his acting talent. Bosie's father the Marquis of Queensbury is played by Lionel Jeffreys and he displays the cantankerous side of the character well. The courtroom scenes could have been tenser and i dont think James Mason as one of the barristers delivers his lines with quite the same passion of some barristers I've seen. It is in one of the courtroom scenes that quite apart from his relationship with Bosie the true extent of Wilde's promiscuity with regard to young men is exposed which was the one point for me in the film that I felt slight disgust at Wilde although his promiscuity still didn't justify in my opinion what then happened to him. I'm just glad that society has become more tolerant nowadays in some parts of the world.The film is approximately two hours long is packed with Oscar Wilde witty one liners which made the film very funny at times. On second viewing the film was even more enjoyable. Shot in 1960 I watched it for the first time here in the UK on Monday 7th Jan 2002 on Channel 4 who played it as an afternoon matinee and the quality of the copy they played was superb  crystal clear. All in all the film was a joy to watch.I would highly recommend it as it illustrates the relative intolerance of the times in England at that time. There are no sensual scenes in the film so its 'safe' to watch for everyone. I say this because I know that a friend of mine recently stopped watching the latest Oscar Wilde film with Stephen Fry released 1997 as soon as he realised that it contained some male nudity  stuff which he said he was personally uncomfortable with. And the 1960 film doesn't lose anything for not having any sexual stuff in it believe me. Please watch it if you get the chance.".

The story of Wilde's rise to become the toast of London and his spectacular fall from grace within month's is well known and The Trials Of Oscar Wilde plays it all very straight no silly joke intended there. But it scores so well because it gets the tone exactly right and there is not one bad performance in it. Wilde was a complex man. He might now be a gay icon and regarded as a trailblazer for gay rights but he was also a devoted and loving father for whom possibly the bitterest blow was not being able to see his children again after his release from jail. Too many have the wrong impression that he was nothing more than a flamboyant poseur but there was in fact far more to him than that he had a sound intellect was a natural writer and he was selfaware. He was also exceptionally honest he was kind and he was generous. Few stuck by him after his fall but notably among his friends were Robbie Ross and Ada Leverson who had the courage to stick by his side when too many other friends revealed themselves as fairweather folk. By his own admission he 'went mad' for a few years and destroyed himself. The greatness of the man is very well conveyed in this version of his trials and I recommend it highly.

It's the story of a man who was a celebrity raconteur and playwright and his fall from grace because of Victorian mores about homosexuality.Today a man like Wilde would not be compelled as Victorian society did compel homosexuals to marry and have children and deny to the world who they were and how they love. Just think that a century later after the controversy surrounding Wilde we are discussing gay marriage and it's being legalized in many countries. Wouldn't it have all been simpler if Oscar had been allowed to marry Bosy.When the film opens Wilde is already a successful author of many plays and stories and maybe the most quoted man of wit in his time. He's married with two children but he's got a side life as a gay man. He's got to take his partners where he finds them a lot of street kids for the most part. And then he falls head over heels for Lord Alfred Douglas played by John Fraser. Fraser is the son of the Marquis of Queensbury the same guy who thought up the rules for prize fighting. He's a rough and crude man played with relish by Lionel Jeffries. Of course the thought of a gay son is an abomination to him. Can't be that young Bosy is gay it's that Wilde guy he's hanging out with.Queensbury calls Wilde a sodomite and Wilde foolishly decides to sue him for libel. And then the trials take place first the civil suit and then the criminal trial because sodomy was indeed a criminal offense back in the day.I often wonder why the real Wilde did not just deal with Queensbury in one of his plays. In real life and in the film Queensbury was a boorish lout who could have so easily been caricatured and laughed out of relevancy. Queensbury retained as his attorney Edward Carson maybe the best barrister of his day. Later on he led the Ulster contingent in Parliamant and was probably the man most responsible for those six counties of Northern Ireland remaining in the United Kingdom.Let's just say that Oscar Wilde uttered one witticism too many during his time on the witness stand and James Mason who gives a great performance as Carson just moves in for the kill. With an international gay movement in full swing now Oscar Wilde and his story may seem quaint to some but it is relevant today to show that it wasn't that long ago that being who you were was a crime. And a reminder of where gaylesbianbisexualtransgender folks will be if our hard won rights even as incomplete as they are yet are ever allowed to recede.".

Specifically if they are trying to present a sympathetic portrayal of Wilde at this period of his life and thus condemn his sentencing to prison then I think they failed. Or perhaps they're just being accurate. One of the two is true but my impression about Wilde from this film is mostly negative. Not because he was gay. But because he appeared to be insufferable. And that insufferability led to his own demise. A Another problem here is that Wilde appears to be pretty straight I doubt that's the way it was.But despite these shortcomings if they are shortcomings the production is an impressive one. Sets are locations are lush and wellfilmed.Peter Finch is excellent as Wilde assuming you buy the premise of a rather straight Wilde. Yvonne Mitchell is very good as his wife. James Mason is around briefly as an opposing attorney. Nigel Patrick is excellent as one of Wilde's attorneys. Lionel Jeffries plays the abominable Marquis of Queensbury. John Fraser plays the gay young man whose father Queensbury sends Wilde to prison.It would have been good had they provided a couple of interesting points at the close of the film. 1.

I have often wondered about the slightly unseemly race to be first or even why there needed to be even one film on the subject at all just then and can only assume that it had something to do with the fact that the releases coincided almost with the sixtieth anniversary of Wilde's death on 30 November in Paris.".

	schema:reviewBody "I initially rented The Trials of Oscar Wilde because it was James Mason's time as Star of the Week. Somehow in the 1960s he got second billing in a bunch of movies but was only in them for fifteen minutes. Long before James even showed up I realized this was a very high quality movie one that was going to be enjoyed instead of just being useful.Peter Finch played Oscar Wilde and he gave an incredible fantastic multilayered performance that of course was completely ignored by the academy. Thankfully at the BAFTAs he won Best Actor and the film was nominated for picture screenplay and supporting actor. Back in 1960 it was a big risk to play a homosexual and Peter treated the role with dignity and much more motivation than plain flamboyance. This is an internal performance one that shows years of pain underneath the famous quips. If you like to laugh at Oscar Wilde's barbs or if you like overthetop parodies of gay characters rent the remake Wilde. For a more realistic interpretation of the emotional turmoil of a gay man in the 1890s rent this one.The story is pretty upsetting to watch mostly because it's not possible to slough off afterwards and tell yourself it's only fiction. This is a true story and shows the horror and hatred of human nature. Don't pop this in for a funfilled movie night watch it when you're in the mood for a very heavy drama.".

	schema:reviewBody "There have been several renditions of the trials and tribulations of Oscar Wilde but this is the best. Oscar Wilde starring Robert Morley had appeared two years earlier and was more typical of the way films had to stomp history into a Procrustean bed in order to fit the time slot and please the audience. As Wilde Morley isn't a pouf but a sensitive soul. He's put on trial and spouts all the apothegms of Wilde's characters as if they were appearing for the first time improvised on the spot.This version The Trials of Oscar Wilde is longer more demanding more historically true and generally superior. It's informative too. There wasn't a trial of Oscar Wilde there were three trials all in all one in which he was the plaintiff one in which the crown prosecuted him and ended in a mistrial and a third in which he was convicted and sent to Reading gaol jail folks for two years during which he lost his wealth his social status and his family and went into exile in Paris.It's not a comedy. At the height of his powers Wilde has a pretty wife and two children whom he loves. He's also having an affair with the handsome young Lord Alfred Douglas Bosie son of the Marquis of Queensberry. Whether the affair is Platonic or assumes more physical dimensions we never find out. Nor in the end does it matter.We don't get to hear the evidence brought against Wilde by four or five scalawags whose integrity is in doubt. Presumably their testimony involved sodomy delicately expressed. But their stories are tainted enough that we can conclude Wilde was convicted because he LOOKED and ACTED queer. He was tried in the press and was guilty. This was in 1893 in Victoria's notoriously prudent England but it happens all the time. We're quick to leap on the suggestion of guilt in popular figures. America has just done it now in the case of a once popular entertainer Bill Cosby. Schadenfreude was Freud's word for it the pleasure taken in seeing others suffer.Most of the characters are given two dimensions except perhaps for the Marquis of Queensberry the reliable Lionel Jeffries who is a flatout halfderanged sadist. The proximate cause of Wilde's trials the extraordinarily handsome Bosie John Fraser is a moral imbecile a psychopath but like other psychopaths he's good at scanning others and generating sympathy for himself. All that's keeping him from being thoroughly evil is a German umlaut.Two events are understandably left out. One is Wilde's experience in prison. He did hard time in the sense of backbusting physical labor. Yet he managed to produce one of his betterknown poems The Ballad of Reading Gaol from which we get lines like Yet each man kills the things he loves Another absentee is Wilde's death in a modest Paris lodging house a place he loathed. A visitor found him dying in his bed staring at the wall. And Wilde said Either this wallpaper has to go or I do. He's buried in Pre Lachaise Cemetery along with Chopin Molire Jim Morrison and most aptly Helois and Abelarde.I found the acting the writing and the direction all pretty much above what I'd expected. As Wilde Peter Finch has to be very careful as if walking a tightrope. He never acts effeminate except in dire situations threatened by a knife or pummeled by unwanted visitors. As Bosie Fraser is a perfectly spoiled and selfish brat. James Mason makes a brief appearance as the court's prosecutor the guy who was Wilde's classmate at Oxford. No doubt he'll treat me with all the bitterness of an old friend. It's hard to recall a better written summary of the defense than that given by Nigel Patrick as Wilde's barrister and it's difficult to beat Wilde's definition of the love that dare not speak its name while on the stand.It's a superior movie.".

And even though the lead character is missing a hand practically NOTHING is done with this.

	schema:reviewBody "Duccio Tessari's L'Uomo Senza Memoria aka. The Man Without Memory  Puzzle of 1974 is not yet a very wellknown Giallo but it sure is a great film worthy of more attention. For the great Giallogenre especially in the mid70s this film bares very few murders and little bloodshed but that does in no way lessen its value as a terrific Thriller that no Giallobuff or even suspensefan in general should miss. Especially to those who set the main value on the mystery aspect of a Giallo this is an essential film. The title The Man Without Memory fits the film perfectly of course as the central character superbly played by Luc Merenda is a man who suffers from amnesia. Yet the aka. title Puzzle fits the film just as well as this is indeed a highly compelling and intelligent puzzle which is capable of stunning the viewer from the first minute.Edward Luc Merenda has lost his memory. Without knowing why he is being followed by people who insist that he owes them something. He finds out that he has a wife in Italy who turns out to be the beautiful Sara Senta Berger. This is only the first step into his mysterious past however... I do not want to give away too much about the plot since this is an ingenious puzzle that all fellow Giallobuffs should experience entirely for themselves. The film is excellent and stunning in its mystery and suspense beautifully shot and accompanied by a great score. The performances are superb. Luc Merenda star of Poliziotteschi such as The Violent Professionals was the perfect choice to play the lead here and beautiful Senta Berger is sexy lovable and great in the role of Sara. The cast furthermore includes the wonderful Anita Strindberg who was part of many memorable Gialli such as The Scorpion's Tail Lizard In A Woman's Skin Who Saw Her Die and most notably in Sergio Martino's Poeinspired masterpiece Your Vice Is A Locked Room And Only I Have The Key which is a strong contender for my personal alltime favorite Giallo. Strindberg only has a small role here but she is doubtlessly great in it. The cast furthermore includes Umberto Orsini Violent City and Genreregular Bruno Corazzari The Strange Vice Of Mrs Wardh Seven BloodStained Orchids.... The Man Without Memory is a very intelligent and enthralling film that deserves more attention and that no Giallolover can afford to miss! Highly recommended!".

But most importantly even though the plot is a quite complicated net of strings that has to be lead together to the climax the story remains plausible until the end which isn't always the case in films of this genre.Apart from the convincing performance by Berger Luc Merenda is also well casted in the title role as is Umberto Orsini in the main supporting role. Look out for Giallo regular Anita Strindberg in a small but crucial role. The lush sound track is also very cool and adds to the viewing pleasure. The only shame is that as with too many other Italian films of the 1970s this memorable Giallo is quite rare and hard to get. Rating 8 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "This Giallo is practically unknown and that's a real shame as Puzzle is an outstanding example of the genre. Director Duccio Tessari made the excellent Giallo 'The Bloodstained Butterfly' three years before this film and the two share the same keenness to buck as many plotting trends as possible as while this film firmly fits into the Giallo in terms of style the plot takes the focus away from common Giallo elements such as sex and murder and puts it more on the characters and an intriguing plot involving amnesia. The film is also known as 'Man Without Memory' and that is down the fact that the central character Peter has lost his memory. He's being treated in a hospital and it's not long before a mysterious stranger turns up and accuses Peter of doublecrossing him. We later learn that peter is really Edward and he's married to the beautiful Sara. He finds out about his wife and travels to Italy in order to meet up with her although she has chiselled out a new life for herself which involves a male friend named Reinhardt and a young kid with a crush on her...Director Duccio Tessari uses the first half of the film to get the plot basics in place and as a consequence it's not always exciting. However the director manages to hold the audience's attention long enough for the film to begin revealing itself in the second act. Puzzle was scripted by Giallo luminary Ernesto Gastaldi and the film represents one of his best works which says a lot considering the other films he penned. While the plot does take a while to get going once it does the film becomes a real thrill ride and this both offsets the sombre tone of the first half and is hugely entertaining. The main influence would appear to be the American classic 'Wait Until Dark' although the film doesn't take too much from the Audrey Hepburn film. The acting is above average with Senta Berger Luc Merenda and Umberto Orsini delivering fine performances in the central roles. The ending is superb and ensures that the film ends on a high as a chainsaw revs into action and the film makes up for its lack of bloodshed. Overall I really hope that Puzzle gets a wide release soon as this is a film that really deserves to be more seen!".

	schema:headline " Amnesiathemed giallo from scriptwriter Ernesto Gastaldi";
	schema:reviewBody "An obscure and rather subtle Italian giallo which forsakes a string of bloody murders in favour of building up a gentle atmosphere of suspense. This isn't one of the finest films of the genre but neither is it one of the worst instead a matteroffact movie that sits amiably in the middle and is worth at least one watch for genre fans. The slow pacing of the first half is a little offputting at first but the movie soon picks up to offer plenty of menace and some fine action at the finale. The central theme of the film is that old chestnut of the participant having lost his memory and having to gradually piece together the events leading up to his current situation but the interest is retained through some interesting fleshedout characters who make the whole thing worthwhile.The small cast also deliver accomplished performances adding to the viewer's enjoyment. First up is Tommy Lee Jones lookalike Luc Merenda playing the amnesic victim. Although the character is a romantic led Merenda still keeps something sinister and hidden about him a man with a dark past who may not be entirely trustworthy. This ambiguity surrounding his character makes for an interesting part and Merenda pulls it off performancewise. Rather more straightforward is Senta Berger's turn as the heroine a damsel in distress who is repeatedly menaced by human scum George a wicked part played superbly by Bruno Corazzari who in one memorable scene throws lighted matches at her. Finally we have Umberto Orsini as a doctor and family friend who may or may not be hiding some dark secrets of his own Orsini is also very good in the part. The only other notable cast member is a young boy who is actually rather endearing.Don't come here looking for a blood and guts movie because in terms of bloodshed it's fairly restrained. In fact the only gore for the most part is the brutal murder of a lovably cute dog and a guy having his throat slit slowly ouch in a flashback. However the finale  in which a chainsaw figures predominantly  certainly rewards the viewer's patience a powerful battle between good and evil which ends with a fine unpleasant death for the villain and an excellent highlight to top off the film. PUZZLE is a movie with a fine buildup of mystery and suspense highlighted by a realistic script from Ernesto Gastaldi and some acceptable camerawork to keep things fluid and interesting.".

	onyx:emotionText "An obscure and rather subtle Italian giallo which forsakes a string of bloody murders in favour of building up a gentle atmosphere of suspense. This isn't one of the finest films of the genre but neither is it one of the worst instead a matteroffact movie that sits amiably in the middle and is worth at least one watch for genre fans. The slow pacing of the first half is a little offputting at first but the movie soon picks up to offer plenty of menace and some fine action at the finale. The central theme of the film is that old chestnut of the participant having lost his memory and having to gradually piece together the events leading up to his current situation but the interest is retained through some interesting fleshedout characters who make the whole thing worthwhile.The small cast also deliver accomplished performances adding to the viewer's enjoyment. First up is Tommy Lee Jones lookalike Luc Merenda playing the amnesic victim. Although the character is a romantic led Merenda still keeps something sinister and hidden about him a man with a dark past who may not be entirely trustworthy.

	schema:reviewBody "Luc Merenda plays Pete a guy in London who has no memory following a car crash eight months previous. In fact although his driving license says Peter he might actually be called Ted. At least that's what the guy who tries to kill him calls him before he himself is killed by a mystery assassin. It's around this time that PeteTed receives a telegram telling him to get ass over to Italy where his wife is waiting for him. Problem being is that Ted didn't even know he was married.Still he heads over there anyway and luckily enough a mysterious guy with a runny nose points out his wife at the train station. Now Sara's got problems of her own seeing as she'd written off Ted's disappearance and now gotten a job as a swimming instructor at a local school hooking up with new guy Reinhart Orisini. Sara actually finds this new Ted a lot more pleasing than the old one and starts falling in love with him all over much to the dismay of Reinhart. Runny nose guy turns out to be George a very aggressive man who claims that Ted owes him something and that he needs it before 'they' kill him and if doesn't get it he's going to kill Ted but Sara first. Ted around this time also starts getting flashes of the past and that turns out not to be good news as his first recalled memory is seeing a man getting his throat cut by a mystery figure. To make things worse George also starts on Sara but when someone slashes her dog's throat he's adamant that it wasn't him.The first thing you'll notice is the complete absence of the black gloved killer in this giallo but all the mysterious plot elements are there for the viewer to figure out. Is Ted suffering from amnesia or is he pretending? If he's not pretending how can he trust anything that's going on or anyone he meets? And what exactly is it that George is after?This film while not action packed has a lot going for it. Starting with the great cinematography and use of colour as usual for a giallo the predominant colour here is blue which appears in many shades and forms. Better still is Bruno Corazzari having a much larger role than usual. He always plays sinister types but here he's given the space to branch out and his presence hangs over much of the film. His best scene is when he corners Sara who is recovering with a broken leg and just stands throwing lit match over lit match at her. Not life threatening but a tense scene indeed. Umberto Orisini also has a bigger role than usual and has a very natural acting style I notice that serves him well throughout the film. Luc Merenda of course is all eyebrows and glowering and still comes across like a really thin Arnie. There's a lack of blood and gore in this one that pays off in a later scene involving a chainsaw. One thing I did notice was that when one character falls to their death the dummy's head falls off. Strange gaff from Tessari whose composition and execution are usually flawless.".

	schema:reviewBody "Duccio Tessari really ought to be applauded for this truly proficient but sadly still neglected Gialloachievement! I sincerely hope this film receives a properly legit and worldwide DVDrelease soon because avid fans of the genre are guaranteed to get a kick out of it. Puzzle is already available in France or at least in the French speaking part of Belgium where I got it even though the transfer to disc is fairly rudimentary and inconspicuous. Puzzle embraces all the regular elements Giallodevotees anticipate like convoluted plot twists and a couple of bloody murders but truly remarkable is the high number of nailbiting suspense moments. Tessari invokes a nearly indescribably nerveracking ambiance from the start of the film and gradually builds up the edginess towards a masterful climax. Even some of the widely acclaimed directors in the genre like Dario Argento or Sergio Martino never managed to include this much genuine tension in their masterpieces. And yet the basic plot outline of this film isn't that original or revolutionary. In fact the plot largely exists of typical and even clichd themes like a protagonist suffering from amnesia the involvement of beautiful women and a large scaled drugsmuggling crime network but somehow Ernesto Gastaldi's screenplay continuously feels refreshing. The fairly complex structure and unexpected plot twists also always stay several steps ahead of you ... indeed like a hardtosolve puzzle. I wouldn't even think of elaborating on the plot too much as it's really convoluted and twisted and I don't want to be the one spoiling it for you. I can briefly mention that the lead character Edward has been living in England for at least the past eight months and as the result an accident he remembers absolutely nothing of his past. He's lured to Italy where he apparently also has a gorgeous wife by a suspicious individual who repeatedly forces Edward to remember stuff. Who is this man and why does he so desperately want to bring Edward's memory back? What vicious affair was Edward involved in to begin with and is his lovely wife Sara honestly as innocent as she pretends? Puzzle is a nonstop challenging and solidly scripted Giallo highlight and even if the plot contains some holes or improbabilities which it probably did I personally was too excited and entertained to make notice of them. The film surprisingly enough doesn't feature any sexual footage but the soundtrack is wonderful and particularly the exterior filming locations are stunning. Puzzle also isn't as gory as most contemporary Giallo but nonetheless there are some noteworthy peaks of brutality the slaughter of a harmless little dog and massive bloodshed chainsawfinale anyone?. Supreme acting performances as well with Poliziottescoregular Luc Merenda The Violent Professionals The Kidnap Syndicate beauty queen Senta Berger and a brief but important appearance by Giallo princess Anita Strindberg A Lizard in a Woman's Skin Who Saw Her Die?  Oh and Duilio Cruciani is probably my pick for the LEAST annoying childactor ever. He's actually quite good and convincing. Highly recommended!".

	schema:reviewBody "Really funny sweet and moving take on the American western done by a soviet female director. Mr. First comes to a small town in the wild west to introduce the population to the art of cinematography. He brings a projector and an array of silent movies including romance and comedy. Rowdy cowboys discover a different way of life and try to improve their own existence. Amazing cast Tabakov is especially endearing as a saloon owner torn between greed and love for the movies. Surprisingly effective fight scenes could probably challenge those of the American counterparts. Karachentsov gives it his best with some of the best fight moves I've seen. Mironov is great as usual as an idealist out to change the world and bring enlightenment to the wild wild west. Highly recommended as a comedy romance western and a meditation on the role of art and mass entertainment in our society.".

	onyx:emotionText "Really funny sweet and moving take on the American western done by a soviet female director. Mr. First comes to a small town in the wild west to introduce the population to the art of cinematography. He brings a projector and an array of silent movies including romance and comedy. Rowdy cowboys discover a different way of life and try to improve their own existence. Amazing cast Tabakov is especially endearing as a saloon owner torn between greed and love for the movies. Surprisingly effective fight scenes could probably challenge those of the American counterparts. Karachentsov gives it his best with some of the best fight moves I've seen. Mironov is great as usual as an idealist out to change the world and bring enlightenment to the wild wild west. Highly recommended as a comedy romance western and a meditation on the role of art and mass entertainment in our society.";

One of the first cinematographershis name is Mr.First performed by Andrey Mironov arrives in a sleepy Wild West town and brings a primitive film projector with a number of bobbins of first Chaplinlike films. Every night he shows films in the local saloon and his arrival has a dramatical effect on the local cowboysprobably cowboys will seem rather strange for real Americans but don't forget the film is made in Russia and they also have some stereotypes about the Wild West. After his arrival they stop fighting with each otherstop speaking bad words start behaving very politelylike real gentlemen and in the evenings come to the saloon to have a drink of ... milk instead of whiskey!!! After solving many problems and passing through a wall of misunderstanding Mr.First makes a lot of friends and eventually the local beauty Diana falls in love with him. The film has a lot of funny episodes and twists e.g. the local Comanches start the war with the cowboys only to have a possibility to go to the movie saloon as well.It's really worth watching the film wherever you live.".

The plot is quite original. It's about a town in Wild West who's people are only drinking and fighting every single day and about an intelligent man who arrive to the town to introduce towns people with Cinematography. Soon people of town get fascinated by cinema they stop drinking and fighting and become more polite to each other. The movie is really funny and interesting.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is hot. It seems to be the only real representative of a serious cowboy flick in Russian cinema. And this one makes us proud. It was directed by a woman! The plot goes here. The very beginning of the 20th century. Wild West. A cinema devotee  Mr First  comes to an American town where everybody drinks fights and swears. Mr First introduces the world of blackandwhite cinema to the cowboys and the life changes. All the good movies he shows them have a direct effect on their living. The population of the town stops all the drinking fighting etc. The people start to respect each other and to behave in a good manner. Mr First leaves the town for some time. During his absence some freak comes to town  Mr Second  who is also a cinema devotee but he is into some nasty types of movies. As a result of watching those nasties the people turn into violent morons again.It has got plenty of fistfighting swearing numerous shootings easy catchy songs lots of nice women tons of whiskey being consumed hundreds of cigars being smoked over and over machoIndians and of course machocowboys. Those crazy fights and quarrels in the saloon alone deserve an Oscar. On top of it it has a clever story to deliver. All this makes the film one of the very best movies of our time.Please throw away something from the IMDb top 250 and put this one onto the top list. That will be fair. Think it over a girl directs a western makes it in an insane manner with lots of fighting and shooting and what is more makes it thoughtprovoking. This deserves the ultimate worldwide recognition. No wonder we all went to cinema multiple times to watch it again and again. Even the tough American flicks of the 1980s could not overwhelm our perception of this picture.A goof in one scene the drunk oneeyed cowboy looses his band and becomes a normal goggler  that's ridiculous.10 out of 10 very enjoyable for all generations and all nationalities. Thanks for attention.".

As a basis for the comedy there is a plentiful supply of plain good gags from the cowboys dutifully repairing the saloon after they have destroyed it in a bar fight to the That was my steak! running gag to the perfectly stereotypical Indian Chief soberly declaring that the cowboys must never have heard of Charles Darwin. The cowboys are of course perfectly selfconscious movieland cowboys   harddrinking and hardfighting reductio ad absurdum. And they're utterly unfamiliar with the concept of art. So when Mr First arrives with the Absurdist premise and delivers cinema it's films themselves that transform the cowboys from their unabashedly filmsourced stereotypical personalities. Is it a change for the better? Like all changes that art brings that's open to interpretation. But it leads to the sight of an evil pastor declaring movies the opium of the people.And of course in an artless world where art is introduced it has a literal magical effect. The undertaker is out work because people don't want to die any more he's a former philosopher but that skill wasn't so much needed on the frontier and our heroine wants a baby immediately after kissing  because that's how it is in the movie. And of course  in a wonderful moment that perhaps encapsulates how this film makes memorable philosophical points almost casually while it jokes  when the building is burnt down the movies and apparatus are undamaged because in a possible nod to Bulgakov quite literally art does not burn iskusstvo ne gorit!And while Mr First's influence may have been purifying we see that Mr Second arrives at the end to put the money into film where we know it remains returning our cowboy heroes to their debouched ways. So art is powerful but perhaps equivocal in it's power. And it ends with that cynical note and a cheerful song the music by the way its all extremely catchy. The performers are excellent too this is the third film of Andrey Mironov's that I've seen and he keeps impressing me as a comedy performer. I'd almost call this obligatory for those who like me have a taste for Absurdist comedy and reflexive postmodern wit. And for those who just looking fro something funny my recommendation still stands.".

The only clue thrown in is Mr. First's song without rage and mourning for the benefit of the planet Earth as we dreamed since long but still can not live up to our dream. Well perhaps's that's it.

And all this garnished with carefully choreographed fist fights in the saloon fighting Indians and Lemonade Joe style story of how a rotten dangerous hole of American town turned into a descent place thanks to the traveling projector ?
