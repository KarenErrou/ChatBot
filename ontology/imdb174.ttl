	schema:reviewBody "A lot has been said about Shinjuku Triad Society as the first true Miike film and I thought this sort of description might have been a clich. But like all clichs it is based on the truth. All the Miike trademarks are here the violence the black humour the homosexuality the taboo testing and the difficult to like central character. Shinjuku is however one of Miike's most perfectly formed films. He says in an interview that if he made it again it would be different but not necessarily better. I think what he means is that the film possesses a truly captivating energy and raw edge which seems so fresh that although he might be able to capture a more visually or technically complex movie he could not replicate or better the purity of this film. As you might expect the violence is utterly visceral gushing blood and gritty beatings are supplemented by a fantastic scene in which a woman has a chair smashed over her face. Only a Miike film could let you get away with a sentence like that. The film has a fantastic pace unlike Dead or Alive which begins and ends strongly and dips in the middle. Dead or Alive also deals with similar issues Miike is clearly concerned about the relations between the Japanese and Chinese in the postwar period and this emotive subject is handled well here the central character really coming to life when you begin to understand his past. I cannot sing Shinjuku's praises enough. I do not want to give away too much. This is Miike before he began to use CGI to animate his films and is almost reminiscent of something like Kitano's Sonatine. The central characters are superbly realized and the final twist guarantees that as soon as the film has finished you'll be popping it back on again to work it all out.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is the first of Miikes triad society trilogy and the trilogy kicks of to a great start. The movies in the trilogy are only connected thematically and these themes are actually apparent in all his films if you look close enough. Shinjuku Triad Society is about a cop trying to prevent his kid brother from getting too involved with a rather extreme gang of outsiders struggling their way to the top of Tokyos yakuza. The kid brother is a lawyer and the triad gang is becoming increasingly in need of one as the movie progresses. The movie takes place in a very harsh environment and is therefore pretty violent and tough. Miike has done worse but since this is a serious movie it hits you very hard. As usual there is also a lot of perverted sex mostly homosexual in this one. The movie is in many ways a typical gangster movie but with a great drive and true grittiness. If you've only seen Miikes farout movies Ichi the killer Fudoh etc. this is worth checking out since it is sort of a compromise between his aggressive overthetop style displayed in those movies and his more serious side as seen in the other films of the trilogy. And as always with Miike there are at least two scenes in this that you'll NEVER forget see it and figure out which ones for yourself.810".

	schema:reviewBody "Shinjuku Triad Society albeit from perfect is a fiercely compelling film for what it tries to depict in its uberconventional realm. It's a yakuzatriad picture involving cops versus Japanese or Chinese gangsters mostly Chinese as the title suggests but already even in his first technical 'debut' Takashi Miike is already establishing many aspects to films that he would make from hereon in. Social issues like black market trading of precious goods in this case human organs usually from children nostalgia for childhood and one's roots which was especially prevalent in Dead or Alive 2 thumbingofthenose at taboos like gay sex and satirical rapeviolence towards women bloodcurdling violence. It's certainly not as surreal as some of Miike's most recent films but this is expected as he's trying out things that he's just starting to learn following a track record of straight to video programmers. It's got all of those qualities and it's also like the films that would follow from it equally savage and heartfelt crazy in spots and sardonic in its drama and solid for genre fans.The story concerns two brothers one a Chinese orphan raised in Japan Tatsuhito Kiriya Kippei Shiina pretty decent as a Eastwoodesquire antiherohero who's become a detective and another who's become a gangster or a wouldbe one. The main arch likely takeover gang comes from Wang a definite pun on what the gang represents during its sparetime played by Tomorowo Taguchi as a typical wacko with real terror in his eyes and his partner Karino Takeshi Caesar who's threatening even when just repeating a commandment over and over to a woman who's just had her eye plugged out following a sour deal who are the ruthless kind to pop up almost organically in a Miike movie. There's some intrigue involving the organtrading scheme with the gangsters which Kiriya almost becomes a victim of and the gang's penchant for gay sex at least with one little puppet of sorts who does whatever the main gangsters want. It all leads up to vengeance and redemption qualities that Miike and his writer are trying to emulate from Shakespeare hence the Macbeth bit with Wang washing his bloody hangs over and over after some gay sex saying it won't come off.If it doesn't add up to the same emotional level of impact that a great Shakespeare play would have it's par for the course of a film like this. Miike's goals are met though just met in his lowscale ambitions a gangster picture with some added levels of harsh familial trouble the main tension between the brothers comes out of profession and duty to parents notes on the crueler aspects of underworld crime and what the realm of unrepentant sex with both sexes brings out psychologically in the characters. At the same time Shinjuku Triad Society also contains more than a few moments of classic biting blackcomedy from the Miike oeuvre. Some of it just has to be taken with a grain of salt for what the director does in his outrageousness like the bit at the beginning with the chair smashing over the face or the randomness of the interrogation as it goes into a very twisted area. There's even a laughoutloud line from the young sexslave after finishing an act on one of the bosses Thank you Mr. WeenyBurger. Miike and his writer don't have enough here to make the film a fullon dark comedy like Ichi or of course Visitor Q but there's enough to bring some appropriate levity to the darker aspects to the story and characters.As the first entry of the Black Society trilogy as it's called I was quite impressed and it's a fine quasicalling card from one of the craziest new artists in contemporary cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "The world of Takashi Miike's cinema is an abstract and ever conflicting one moving from moments of gritty realism character depth and almost tranquil beauty to jarring elements of outlandish violence tongueincheek humour and outrageous visual exaggeration. This continual juxtaposition of tone can be problematic for some viewers as the film announces itself as a serious worthy crime picture only to then undercut this notion with a flashcut of a forensic detective offering peace signs as he poses with a severed head. This continual approach of more serious dramatic moments undermined or subverted by remnants of mocking humour is emblematic of Miike's work and can be seen in many of his greatest films such as Ley Lines 1999 Dead or Alive 2 Birds 2000 and the masterpiece Visitor Q 2001. It's an approach to cinema that seems deliberately intended to challenge the preconceptions of an audience and to provoke an immediate reaction often through shock which can be further witnessed in the director's often bold disregard for the notions of genre convention or traditional narrative design.With Shinjuku Triad Society 1995 we see many of these ideas and characteristics in their earliest stages of consideration with the film in some respects establishing Miike for the first time as a serious filmmaker of bold intent and critical worth. Though it lacks the obvious finesse and sterling confidence of his later work it is nonetheless an important film worthy of repeated viewings and serious critical analysis. As ever with the director the film focuses on elements of the criminal underworld here the black society of downtown Shinjuku with loyalty betrayal honour and responsibility all driving the plot forward towards a violent and confrontational finale. We also have the inclusion of one of Miike's favourite dramatic motifs the idea of the outcast within society with the combining influence of geographical displacement and the search for somewhere to belong  often manifested in the representation of family  becoming central to the duality of the relationship between both criminal and cop. These themes would be further defined in the two subsequent films that would eventual come to form the backbone of this loose thematic trilogy with the themes of Shinjuku Triad Society leading off into Rainy Dog 1997 and the aforementioned Ley Lines.The film could also be seen as a run through for the more elaborate and postmodern experimentation of the original Dead or Alive 1999 with the cop vs. criminal aspect of the story being the catalyst for the drama despite the apparent fact that both of these particular characters are as flawed and viciously corrupt as one another. Once again with Miike we have a series of vague characterisations that suggest a background and personality through scenarios and brief enigmatic images for example the quick cut of the small boy sat melancholy in the yard of a lowrent tenement that we see right near the beginning of the film  establishing the themes behind the story on an entirely cryptic and puzzling note  which is repeated again towards the end of the film to offer an implied sense of closure. This will no doubt prove problematic for some viewers who demand closure or a character that we can root for and identify with but as ever Miike is unconcerned with such routine presentations and instead gives us two warring characters that are both morally repugnant yet ultimately sympathetic almost in equal measures.The tone and presentation of the film is provocative throughout with Miike underlining the violence of the world in which the film plays out by abstracting it to near comicbook like levels of excess. It's never as bold or as farcical as something like Ichi the Killer 2001 though we can clearly see an attempt on the part of the director to establish an attitude and approach that undercuts the grittier elements of drama to instead present something almost otherworldly again this was done more successfully in the underrated Ley Lines. Nonetheless it can be seen as another example of Miike's subversive approach to cinema disarming us through shock scenes and outr moments of pitchblack comedy that seem almost purposely out of place within the world of gang war and routine police investigations. It's the kind of film in which scenes of lengthy dialog discussion give way to scenes of gay rape gunplay and a subplot involving Taiwanese orphans and organ transplants where the main villain is an eyegouging homosexual exhibitionist and the main representation of the law thinks nothing about raping a prostitute or smashing her in the face with a steel chair.Certainly it won't please everyone  with the disregard for logic and convention going against our preconceptions of this kind of genre  though again the film is ultimately beyond such notions. Despite the gangland theatricality and obvious crimethriller aspects of the plot Shinjuku Triad Society has deeper themes expressed within the odd similarities between the wayward police officer and the perverted criminal that goes back to the ideas of loneliness alienation and the longing to fit in. The film ends on a sad note leaving unanswered questions about the fate of the characters or the actions that led to the climactic revelation but with the clear implication that the thing we most desire is always slightly out of reach. It may not be as polished or as successful as some of the director's other films  with the obvious lowbudget and perhaps lack of experience clear within some elements of the script  nonetheless this is one of Miike's most interesting and thoughtprovoking films made all the more worthwhile by the two excellent central performances from Kippei Shiina and Tomorowo Taguchi.".

	schema:reviewBody "Amidst a Chinese and Japanese mafia war a lawyer for the Chinese mob finds a rift forming between him and his corrupt police officer brother. Welcome to the black society the underworld that exists just beyond the periphery of our vision.In this world many of the characters have a grey ambiguous morality and in the words of Tom Mes nobody does what you expect them to do. In this sense the film is not terribly far removed from the classic noir with its gritty scenarios and antiheroes. Of course here it goes in directions never before considered.The ethnic  nationality aspect is fascinating even if not fully comprehensible to an American audience. We can understand the ancient divide between China and Japan and appreciate how this battle is now playing out between the Triads and yakuza. But the use of a character halfJapanese halfChinese is brilliant. Americans who do not understand the languages or customs may miss the point but for their culture it is no different than how we once thought of the mulatto  rejected by both black and white cultures.Sight  Sound noted the film was similar to the gangster films of Kinji Fukasaku while noting that it still contained scenes such as the one where sodomy is used as a police interrogation technique bear Miike's unmistakable signature. Interestingly neither Miike nor Fukasaku are primarily known for their gangster films  Fukasaku is connected best to Tora! Tora! Tora! and Battle Royale. The film is one of the earliest examples of Miike's use of extreme violence. We have decapitated heads eyes ripped from their sockets and the aforementioned sodomy. The film also has some unsettling sexual aspects. Not quite on par with Miike's Visitor Q but what is? Also worth noting is the soundtrack which often sound like more 1980s synth than 1990s techno. Was this a style choice or was Japan in a different musical era than the United States in 1995? Interestingly this film is composer Atorie Shira's only credit. Another anachronism is a trunk shot very reminiscent of Reservoir Dogs 1992. Coincidence? It's no secret that Tarantino borrows from his favorite films but was Miike borrowing from Tarantino?Arrow Video has released the film as part of their Black Society Bluray box set complete with an allnew audio commentary from Miike expert Tom Mes the author of Agitator. This is actually the second Mes commentary for the film so anyone who has an old DVD can now hear him twice. Interestingly he feels this film has a gothic element which is not something that immediately comes to mind when you are talking about Miike.".

Well after this movie I realized he's more than that  these two directors are completely different. Also if we consider some other movies by Miike I don't think Tarantino could go that far about taboo subjects.MovieTatsuhito Kiriya a Japanese cop with Chinese descent trying to take care of his old parents while trying to either catch or eliminate a triad boss who's running the organ trafficking business and Kiriya also wants to keep his younger brother Yoshihito who is a lawyer working for that gang's legal department away from the underworld.Now this movie is definitely not for everyone. Violence and sexuality plays a big role and movie never shies away from using bizzare images which can be uncomfortable to watch sometimes. Even the main character who supposed to represent the ''goodness'' isn't that much of a good person. In fact there isn't a ''good guy'' in this film. It's about bad guys vs. worse guys.Note Even though this movie is often mentioned as a Yakuza film it's mostly about a Chinese triad. Not a cinematical masterpiece but movie has something to tell  tells it quite well. I enjoyed it.810".

In layman's terms it's a film about two brothers one's a police officer Kiriya the other is a lawyer Yoshihito working for the mafia. During the course of the film a war breaks out between the Chinese and Japanese gangs and it's down to Kiriya to keep his younger brother safe from the fallout.Shinjuku is one of Miike's early projects and was the first one to get him noticed whether that's from the sheer shock factor or genuine talent I don't know. The film has a certain low budget aesthetic that works really well. The film also has a genuine sense of grit and nihilism to it. The characters are all horrible and they do horrific things to each other. From scenes where the police interrogate their suspects by anally raping them to the mafia harvesting organs from children there are no good guys in this film only shades of grey.The film also tries to deal with a wide range of taboo topics most notably having a homoerotic undertone which at times felt out of place and only there to serve as shock value. Overall there are some interesting aspects to the film. I liked the main story and the juxtaposition between the two brothers despite it not being very original. Shinjuku had moments of brilliance but for the most part I didn't buy into what Miike was going for.".

It's also the first part of what would later become the Black Society Trilogy that focuses on gangsters living in foreign countries. This film is also a movie that establishes many trademarks that can be found in numerous Takashi Miike movies until today such as having controversial antiheroes as protagonists focusing on a slightly depressing melancholic and at times surreal atmosphere and including a lot of coldhearted violence including several anal rape scenes between both homosexual and heterosexual partners an eyeball being ripped out of an old woman's face and a police officer that nearly gets beaten to death in this particular case. This movie shows the ugly sides of life and how each and every single human being has some serious flaws. Takashi Miike's movie aren't for the fainthearted but that what makes them so unique after all.It has also become a trademark that many of Takashi Miike's movies feature numerous characters and are at times difficult to follow. This is also the case here and it might take about half an hour to figure out who is who and on whose side. You patience will be rewarded with a movie that is equally entertaining and profound.The movie shows how a Chineseborn Japanese police officer who isn't fully accepted by either society tries to take care of his old parents who have failed to integrate into Japanese society protect his younger brother who gets involved as a lawyer for a local triad group and hunt down a homosexual Taiwaneseborn gangster boss who is specialized in organ trafficking. The movie shows us flawed but very profound characters who are trying to find a way to be accepted and have a decent life but struggle to succeed in one way or another. This film is a brutal action movie and a suspenseful gangster thriller but also a thoughtprovoking drama. Despite the depressing settings and the desperate main plot Takashi Miike also includes a few moments that lighten things up such as his absurd and black humour but also some short moments of compassion between the main character and his parents a prostitute and his brother.Shinjuku Triad Society is a charismatic masterpiece in Takshi Miike's early career that already shows how unconventional and unique his approach to filmmaking was back then. This movie's brutal direct and gloomy attitude breaks several taboos in traditional Japan and that's why this film has developed a cult following among younger audiences over the years. If you like twisted dramas gangster movies and neonoir cinema you should not only watch this outstanding movie but the entire Black Society Trilogy that has recently been released in North America with a detailed booklet analytical commentary and exclusive recent interviews.".

The Story is good and the actors do their thing very well. I haven't seen the UK or Japan version but I have to say that I believe that the German DVD is a bit censored. If you haven't seen the movie already and live in Germany maybe you better look out for a DVD from the Nederlands or Austria. The ION DVD contains a lot of very hard and nasty scenes but at the showdown I felt that something was missing about one or two very short scenes.All in all a good perverted movie with crazy characters and a high level of violence that's what I like Miike for!!".

But when a police officer is killed one Tatsuhito gets involved... and when he discovers that his brother Shihito is also involved things get bloody quite fast.An earlier work of Miike's Shinjuku Triad Society is still filled with his usual in the ol' ultraviolence and sadistic sex acts though it's not one of his more eclectic or flamboyant pieces. Rather it's a pretty well crafted bit of pulp fiction as Tatsuhito digs his way through the underground a maze that leads him to a gay Triad leader who sells illegally gained body organs from Taiwan and keeps an almostbrothel of young boys one in particular the character who kills the cop at the beginning. Tatsuhito's brother is getting involved with said society so Tatsuhito himself is forced to become a dirty cop and use similarly violent and sadistic tactics to penetrate into this sordid realm.What's mainly interesting about this little bit of work is the relationship Tatsuhito has with his nemesis Wang. Tatsuhito is a Japanese born in China later moved back into Japan and alienated for it. Wang is a Chinese who felt alienated in China so killed his father and developed a crime wing in Japan. Wang also is a surprisingly Shakespearian character which is weird enough as it is much less that you actually begin to feel sorry for him by the time his ultimate showdown with Tatsuhito comes to be. And Tatsuhito himself is a similarly tragic figure when he's forced to contend with his lack of ability to control his brother. While it would be rude to state that Miike's movies are successful mostly on their shock value it is true that sometimes it's easy to lose track of how well Miike can create bitter disimpassioned characters.PolarisDiB".

The fighting scenes looked sometimes very improvised but were in fact strongly choreographed and filmed in a stylish way that gave you an intense feeling while watching them. But there were also scenes where I unfortunately didn't get the point. For example 1.The excop is sitting in a restaurant his wife and daughter are at the restroom so he is waiting. Then a cut and suddenly everybody in the restaurant has disappeard  no guests can be seen anymore no waiters and so on. The wife and the daughter come back and the action begins... and where is the rest? That was definitely a directional flaw.2.When the man with the rainboots comes home he sees his daughter  all fine. He goes in the room of his son but he can't even see that his son is lying dead in the bed. His wife has obviously left him so he is phoning a prostitute and 2 secs later the action begins again. Exscuse me but that's terribly directed.3.The mistress is attacked by the two hit men escaping in a restroom waiting there behind a door made of wood. The hit men fire through the door they scream and seconds later the hit men are away. That's sheer nonsense in my opinion... The characters seem to be underdeveloped. What's up with their background story anyway? Nothing can be found... Especially the Chinese bookie. I Still don't know what's up with that person. So yeah that is clearly another directorial blurb.I bought this crap in chinatown thinking WOW! A Yakuza Video 5. I am a fan so I had to buy it. Little did I know it turned out to be a little bit too far out for me. Since director Miike NIPPON UNDERWORLD seems preoccupied with homoerotic themes phallic symbols and anal buttplugs. My advice don't get it. I have since given this movie to a fruity guy next door. Instead get Gozu or Killer Klowns.First and last an interesting movie with a scene wherein a cart full of organs gets overturned in a tussle that seems to be missing from all known prints...".

	schema:reviewBody "For the most part films which were intended to frighten the viewing audience usually succeed in instead producing involuntary laughs. So it was nice to see a 'horror' film that not only has a brain for a change but actually succeeds in being frightening. It may help that the film is allegedly based on true events which gives credibility to the storyline and prevents the movie from having those annoyingly gaping plot holes. And indeed the heading Based on a true story doesn't come off as a glaring lie. There are indeed events happening in the film which are questionable as to whether they actually occurred in real life but the beauty of 'Emily Rose' is that most of the film is retold by various characters so the events described are as the character perceived them. In this way the film doesn't distance its audience by declaring that well demons were in the film which was 'based on a true story' so demons must actually exist.But in many ways 'Emily Rose' is different from almost every past horror movie in the sense that it doesn't make really obvious attempts to frighten its audience. Instead directorcoscreenwriter Scott Derickson seems content to make us think. There are several questions raised in the film regarding religious beliefs and the public's general perception of them but these are all handled in an objective and impartial manner. And as for the scare factor since the filmmakers aren't overly obvious in trying to scare the audience the film actually is frightening at several points  again unusual for a horror film. The frightening events regarding Emily Rose's exorcism are all the more frightening as they don't seem horribly staged and predictable. although the cheesy demonic animation as shown in the trailer could have been done far better It's true that composer Christopher Young seems unable to resist the horror movie clich of having horribly overdramatic music which builds to a climax at the most frightening moment but for the most part the movie is able to surpass the usual horror clichs.It helps of course that the cast all deliver quality performances the obvious standout being Jennifer Carpenter as Emily. Her possession scenes are nothing short of incredible the sheer torment she seems capable of portraying is utterly captivating. Laura Linney also shines in the lead giving a powerful and affecting performance as the attorney of the convicted priest who performed Emily Rose's exorcism. As said priest Tom Wilkinson also manages to impress delivering a quietly effective and very human performance. My only complaint is that the characters of Campbell Scott and Colm Feore were really badly written coming off as the typical antagonistic figures and nothing more. Both give satisfying performances despite their one dimensional characters especially Feore who has always been talented at taking terribly written characters and giving them life and personality nonetheless. So The Exorcism of Emily Rose may not quite be the very best of its genre but it certainly proves to be one of the more intelligently made ones. The director seems to have for once taken that extra step and put aside the endless thrills and shocks in favor of making us think a bit. There are some cheesy effects such as the demonic visions but there are some genuinely frightening parts especially the actual exorcism scene mainly due to the chilling and captivating performance from Jennifer Carpenter as the title character. The principle cast members Laura Linney and Tom Wilkinson also give strong performances bringing many layers to their characters. Quite the quality piece overall and one worth seeing.810".

I know a lot of people won't be able to see it for what it is because of the supernaturalhorror elements which are usually a turnoff for film snobs but the movie is just extremely wellmade.Consider the fact that Linney's character's true conflict is not winning the trial but a satisfyingly complex internal struggle which I will not name so as not to spoil the movie. Or the plethora of food for thought that the movie offers regarding existentialist issues of perception vs. objective truth and social issues of liability and responsibility.Some very interesting scenes that find ways to express things in subtle and creative ways without spelling them out. And an incredible and ballsy performance by Jennifer Carpenter which takes Linda Blair's possession to a whole new level. Also notice how a key dramatic monologue is presented contrary to what we might expect with no sentimental music in the background. The cinematography is also great. I was reminded of Dario Argento's vivid colors in Suspiria on more than one occasion.Although it's not the focus of the film the movie also offers a few very cool scare moments and seeing Emily possessed is terrifying.This is my favorite underdog movie of the year so far.".

Or the plethora of food for thought that the movie offers regarding existentialist issues of perception vs. objective truth and social issues of liability and responsibility.Some very interesting scenes that find ways to express things in subtle and creative ways without spelling them out. And an incredible and ballsy performance by Jennifer Carpenter which takes Linda Blair's possession to a whole new level. Also notice how a key dramatic monologue is presented contrary to what we might expect with no sentimental music in the background. The cinematography is also great. I was reminded of Dario Argento's vivid colors in Suspiria on more than one occasion.Although it's not the focus of the film the movie also offers a few very cool scare moments and seeing Emily possessed is terrifying.This is my favorite underdog movie of the year so far.";

	schema:reviewBody "Yes I know we've seen too many mediocre horror movies in the past few years. Yes I'm fed up with horror stories that are based on true events too but don't write this movie off too soon. If you ignore the assertion that this has all happened in reality and just accept that you're in for a supernatural movie you'll have a gay ol' time with The Exorcism Of The Emily Rose.The first thing to mention is that there has never been a combination of horror movie and courtroom drama before and while some reviewers have stated that the two genres don't go together well I have to disagree. The courtroom setting added a lot of suspense to the story and horror movies always work best when there is suspense added to the spooky and creepy elements. And boy does this movie have some creepy scenes.The four main actors do a fine job and the restrained direction is pretty atmospheric too except for some minor fashionable shots that are probably not going to age very well for example one time Scott Derrickson reverts to Darren Aronofskycam which is already getting old. Anyway the main attraction is the story itself and as I've said it's fast paced and exciting  at least until the third act. Up until that point it's hard to watch the screen at times because Derrickson uses his shock scenes so effectively and steers clear of any jumpclichs. Then a certain climax is reached the movie reduces its supernatural elements and relies maybe a bit too much on the courtroom drama aspect. On the plus side Derrickson avoids going over the top like so many other horror movies do including embarrassing CGIorgies in their showdowns. On the other hand it is exactly that relatively quiet ending that prevents The Exorcism Of Emily Rose from becoming a real classic. One just has the feeling that the priest and the trial made a whole lot of fuss about nothing because there's no real solution in the end.The Exorcism Of Emily Rose has enough chilling moments not to be overshadowed by The Exorcist the big Kahuna of the exorcism genre but it's not going to be remembered as a cornerstone of the horror genre. In 2005 you couldn't find a lot of spooky movies that were better than this one though.".

However there is no sparing of pure psychological terror. All and all an excellent movie. Other posters have observed that believing in Christianity or the lack thereof is not shoved down the viewer's throats. It allows one to form their own opinion.My only concern the PG13 rating.

The fact that it's based on the reported possession of Anneliese Michel circa 1970 Germany does make the film more unnerving. The actor's performances while not exceptional are at least engaging.

	schema:reviewBody "Ironically enough The Excorcism of Emily Rose got released in my country Belgium synchronously with another similar reallife lawsuit. A selfacclaimed exorcist has to justify the death of a young girl after performing inhuman rituals and fatal exorcism tricks. It's weird having seen this movie and then follow the lawsuit on TV and in newspapers. It's so easy to deny the existence of demonic possession and to brush aside exorcism as quackery but then  as this film shows  you're also questioning people's beliefs and family values. Emily Rose is the sympathetic daughter of a poor but deeply religious rural family. Shortly after her longanticipated start at the university her body becomes the host of no less than 6 different demons. The priest of the little town where she lives father Moore is doing everything he can to purify Emily's body but the demons are too strong and she doesn't survive the exorcism. What makes this film different than the obvious 70's classic The Exorcist which also entirely revolves on the possession of an innocent girl is that the story takes place after the actual exorcism and in the courtroom where father Moore is on trial for negligent homicide. His ambitious lawyer Erin Bruner goes straight for the acquittal of her client but father Moore only cares for telling Emily's story despite the fact that this can cost him his career as a priest. The screenplay of this film was based on a true story and director Scott Derrickson does a great job in making the extended courtroom sequences interesting and compelling. The flashbacks showing Emily's horrible decrepit are very atmospheric and contain multiple shockmoments. The acting is sublime with a powerful Tom Wilkinson as the devoted priest and an enchanting Jennifer Carpenter as the poor Emily Rose. This is not a fullblooded horror film but definitely one of the most unsettling disturbing and thoughtprovoking dramas of the last few years. Highly recommended!".

That film is truly understandings for reasons that are pretty much its psychological ties to the fears in all of us. In Emily Rose the emphasis is on our perspectives and how it affects our choices. Laura Linney is truly phenomenal in the film and I sure hope she finally receives all the prizes that have eluded in the last few years. As a side note I have just witnessed the remarkable work by Rachel Weisz in The Contant Gardener and I have to state my opinion that Ms. Linney is a bit more powerful and effective in her multilayered performance as the defense attorney.Emily Rose will have people talking because it demands its audience to take sides as it reveals the events that led to the exorcism of the title. In here the church grants permission to go ahead and perform an exorcism on Emily Rose the title character. Things turn out to be a little different and suddenly the priest who performed the exorcism finds himself in the middle of a big mess. Throw in the elements of psychological and physical ailments versus theological beliefs and you really have a collision of very powerful forces.The film presents both sides quite well and there are times when you have to really make an effort to avoid switching perspectives. In the end it's very clear what the writers and filmmakers set out to do but it's an intense and very emotional 2 hrs. The film works very well because of Wilkinson's fiery priest and the outstanding work of Campbell Scott. Yet it belongs to Laura Linney in what might be her most powerful performance yet. She truly presents a case with steely assurance she is one of the best things to come out of Hollywood in the last two decades. Now we know her work You Can Count on Me and Kinsey were just the beginning. One could sense the power in the chilling closing scenes of Mystic River and her limited appearance in The House of Mirth. Nothing comes close to what she achieves here.".

He was so inspired by the novel and intrigued by the issues presented that he ended up making this movie. It shows that he has done extensive research.What I liked about the horror element is that even though there are a few jumps it does not derail into ridicule. The director doesn't overdo any violence blood scary faces and whatever. Derricksen uses a lot of silence which leaves the viewer in a heightened state of suspense desperately wondering what will break the silence. His use of colour is clever and it sets a chilling atmosphere. You can see hints of Dario Argento and Gaspar No. For example the red lit corridor in Emily's dorm looks eerily like that underground subway passage in 'Irrversible'. The exorcism scenes are quite chilling unlike the unintentionally funny ones in 'The Exorcist'. The courtroom sequences raise some interesting questions about scientific reasoning versus the unknown and unexplained. I was impressed that it didn't become one of those God versus Science movies but the Shohreh Agdashloo track left a lot to be desired.In addition to being a well crafted film the performances are among the highlights. Tom Wilkinson gives a phenomenal subtle performance. A ravishing Laura Linney is equally electrifying from the yuppie ambitious lawyer to one whose internal conflict makes her doubtful. Jennifer Carpenter delivers an astonishing performance. It couldn't have been an easy part to pull off and would have been easier to mess up but she does a solid job. It definitely makes Linda Blair's bad performance in the 'Exorcist' look miserable.I'm not much of a horror movie fan mostly because they tend to be ridiculous and end up being funny or boring rather than having the intended effect. It will be wrong to lable 'The Exorcism of Emily Rose' is much more than just another horror flick because it does raise questions and tackles some issues without coming to a definitive conclusion as there are simply no answers to some things that happen.".

I won't give it away except to say that the plots and subplots and intrigue and characterizations were all woven together to spin a simply riveting terrifying provocative endearing challenging Story.I really liked the multiple depictions of What Happens and How the Characters React. You see Something Happen and then feel Fear and then watch the Face of the Character on hand experience Fear and then perhaps the order is slightly changed you see the Face of the Character experience Fear as the Character gazes in terror over the viewer's shoulder. Then you see What the Character is looking at. And experience Fear.I also really liked the legal conflict ... and the way the Story honored both sides. There's no doubt ever where our sympathies lie with the Laura Linney character. Yet the prosecutor is not at all a straw man. He is give a great opening and is effective and believable throughout. This enhanced greatly the Doubt vs Faith conflict that reinforced the Story throughout.And through all this the Priest's insistence that the Story should be told is what really drove the action above all. This gave a feeling of authenticity to the Story that both made it appealing and frightening.A wonderful wonderful movie ... !".

This enhanced greatly the Doubt vs Faith conflict that reinforced the Story throughout.And through all this the Priest's insistence that the Story should be told is what really drove the action above all. This gave a feeling of authenticity to the Story that both made it appealing and frightening.A wonderful wonderful movie ... !";

I had to look away sometimes because being a suspenseful movie watcher all my life I knew by the sound of the chilling music something was gonna happen that would freak me out and boy did it do its job.It wasn't overly predictable. It was a look back on what exactly happened when Emily Rose got possessed and how it ended. It wasn't a push the catholic belief down everyones throat because defending the Priest was an agnostic lawyer trying to not only get ahead in her career but convince a journey that medical science could not determine she had a medical condition but a demonic possession. Cant tell you anymore than that.The movie had a dark look and was cozy it kept me on the edge of my seat and the way she got possessed and how she looked was way freaky. Good movie and worth to own on DVD!".

	schema:headline " Obscene exploitative propaganda piece";
	schema:reviewBody "First of all The Exorcism of Emily Rose is not a well crafted film. The hollow plot devices and dialogues are laughably stale cinematography and editing are lacking any style and the scares simply fall flat. A cast of usually brilliant performers delivers uninspired phonein performances. Of course I could dismiss this flick as a dumb misguided scarefree piece of drivel. Unfortunately it's much worse than that.Like most pictures dealing with the subject this film actually treats demonic possession as real and thus depicts the practice of exorcism not only as viable but as a necessary tool against the forces of evil. This generally makes exorcism pictures propaganda material for a rather medieval method still covered by today's catholic doctrine. Now it's not that I generally oppose the catholic faith but this particular practice is despicable. While most pictures of this horror subgenre go more for simple scares than philosophical discussion this film takes a stance for exorcism by putting the conflict in a court room.The filmmakers make a big deal out of the fact that the film is based on a true story suggesting that the case of Emily Rose substantiates the existence of demonic possession and that all the people involved were in fact not unscrupulous religious fanatics but upright men of faith. If you are familiar with the true case which took place in Germany in the late 1970s this depiction will strike you as disgusting and cynical spin doctoring. An obscene exploitative propaganda piece void of any integrity or empathy for authentic human suffering. Anneliese Michel the real Emily and her grueling fate are not treated with the proper respect.In short Michel was a deeply religious though psychologically disturbed young woman who was basically tortured to death by a her parents and some priest because everyone involved agreed that her epileptic convulsions and tourettelike rantings were clear signs of demonic possessions. Severely beaten up with her front teeth knocked outall supposedly by the demon inside her she died of starvation after days of exorcism. The practice of exorcism had been made fairly popular in catholic circles through the smash hit success of Willam Friedkin's The Exorcist a few years earlier so it was a small leap of faith for Michel her family and that priest to believe exorcism was a viable option. After Michel's death copies of an audio taping of her exorcism became a very popular device to promote the catholic cause in church groups  basically making Michel a poster child for exorcism. Two years after Michel's death her parents and her exorcist were convicted but came off with ridiculously short jail sentences.Treated with the proper respect and integrity and with some actual brains behind the project this film could have made some powerful statements about fanaticism and homicidal tendencies if it only had stayed true to it's source material. The true story of Anneliese Michel is a haunting testament to the cruelty of men. It could make for a very intense grueling drama. The Exorcism of Emily Rose is quite the opposite. It's an unwilling farce exploiting the sad cruel fate of Michel using cheap shock effects and cheesy storylining.It is beyond me why such brilliant actors as Laura Linney Campbell Scott two of my absolute favorite actors and Tom Wilkinson would have participated in this horribly illconceived borefest. After all they have been known to usually star in intelligent independentminded films. This is just a clumsy exploitation flick pandering to the religious right who made this cheap movie a box officesuccess. It saddens me to think they did it for the money but it saddens me even more to think that they actually believed this film to be a project of integrity.The torture of psychologically disturbed Anneliese is turned into the saintly martyrdom of Emily who decides upon meeting Mother Mary halfway into the exorcism that she would rather have some more fatal demonic torture than being let into heaven right away  because that is the true way of showing Satan and his pals who's boss beats me how that works. All of this is being told through some corny letter from Emily that the exorcist reads out aloud while in the witness stand. The jury then decides that even though he is clearly guilty he should not be put in prison because he's not a homicidal fanatic but rather a nice old man who stands by his faith. The judge agrees and let's good old Tom Wilkinson go. Of course by this time close to the end credits the film has already established that the priest actually is right  since we can see the demon doing all sorts of shenanigans harassing Laura Linney's lawyer lady and stopping her watch at 3am the demonic witching hour we learn  by the way the only demonic thing going on at that time around where I live is Larry King interviewing Dr.Phil and other phonies yanking poor Emily around widening her pupils to give her what can only be described as Demonovision making her play piano and letting her speak Aramaic Latin and of course the ever evil German so the demon is musical and multilingual  neat eh?. To make the whole thing a fair and balanced experience for the audience Campbell Scott's disgruntled prosecutor gets to show his cynical debunked view of events but it's clearly established through light switches moving by themselves some kooky doctor witness mysteriously getting run over by a car a lame version of aforementioned audio tape the true recording is terrifying by the way and some silly locket with the defender's initials that there are definitely divine and hellish forces battling it out here.So in the end this film cheesily gives a thumbs up to exorcism while using the horrific true story of a victim of that very practice as a basis. It's sickening.".

In the case of THE EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE I believe the film makers committed an even bigger sin they made a film that was just plain stupid.When young Emily Rose Jennifer Carpenter Whit Chicks went off to college she thought all her dreams were coming true. That is until the six demons climbed into her body one claiming to be Lucifer himself. The medical community thinks she may have epilepsy and so they put her on meds. Her parish Priest Father Moore Tom Wilkinson In The Bedroom suggests a higher form of intervention and performs and exorcism on her. Now Emily Rose is dead and it's up to a hotshot Lawyer Lauren Linney You Can Count On Me to defend Father Moore's actions and to keep him out of jail.Director and CoScreenwriter Scott Derickson HellraiserInferno claims to have invented the first HorrorCourtroom Drama. I think he's right and after sitting through this film I know why it took so long for it to happen. It doesn't work Not only because you cannot stop and think for one moment that this is how a courtroom is run. But mostly because you're not quite sure why Father Moore is up on the stand and not the doctor Duncan Fraiser The Claim who was checking her vitals the whole time Emily's Father andor Emily's Boyfriend who were all there at the scene of the crime . They were all present and did nothing to stop it. Why the heck do you only charge Father Moore with the crime? If you go to this movie thinking it's a horror film your seriously mistaken. It's more like the worst written episode of Law and Order you've ever seen. Courtroom clich's abound even a minor character who can shed light on the situation is bumped off. Why? Well for once it was an accident or was it an act of God? The plot thickens okay not really.The sad part is that there could have been a compelling movie here. Emily Rose's story could have been fascinating. But alas for a film in which the Father Moore spouts out a half dozen times I need to tell Emily's story. We only scratch the surface of who Emily Rose was? Why was she possessed? I can't for one moment believe it was for the halfbaked and silly reason the film claims. What was she like before she went to college? Except for on old house full of cats and parents whom I might consider a little odd the film never delves into that.Instead of telling Emily's story the film focuses on a trail that is so convoluted and silly that I almost burst out laughing. The final argument for Father Moore's innocence is that There are No Facts Only Possibilities. Give me a break what kind of numbskull logic is that? Did Linney's character get a law degree off the back of a fortune cookie? That's not to say their aren't some redeeming qualities to the film. Lauren Linney and Campbell Scott The prosecutor do a tremendous job with a half baked script and while he should probably stick to directing Scott Derrickson shows that he could make a nice moody Horror film if given the right material.THE EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE misses the mark so badly its pretty much unredeemable. It's almost a shame because you can tell that a great many minds worked hard to make a film that asked us to explore our faith with fear and trembling. Next time forget platitudes and try to tell a good story. Because good intentions with poor plotting and sloppy story telling make a joke of any message you might try to foist on your audience.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie didn't suck and the acting was great all around. That's about all the good I can say about it. I would have enjoyed it as a halfwaydecent thriller or a courtroom drama more if it hadn't claimed to be based on a real story. But when Laura Linney says during trial that this case is not about facts that summed up about everything wrong with the religious apologists I've seen in the media lately from George W. Bush to the Kansas Board of Education. This idea that facts don't matter has poisoned cultural discourse for the last decade or more some people seem to think that as long as we have Faith our negligent factchecking won't lead to any wrongdoing.It would be one thing if writerdirector Scott Derrickson and cowriter Paul Harris Boardman simply presented the facts don't matter tactic as part of the defense's legal strategy but they add details to the story that try to shore this argument up. To its credit the story concludes with the priest being found guilty of negligent manslaughter which is apparently what happened in the reallife case in Germany. Weighing against this are the madeup story details about Linney's and Tom Wilkinson's characters being plagued by evil signs and visions and the attending physician being killed just as he tells Linney that he sees the demons. Combined with Hollywood poppsychology schizophrenics never know they're schizophrenic these would be workable if clichd in a movie that admitted it was solely fiction but here they serve only as a crutch to prop up the sagging drama and as evidence of the screenwriters' bias.The acting was excellent but not having seen Hellraiser Inferno I can't say that this is due to the direction. I do know that Laura Linney has handled herself well before in Mystic River and You Can Count on Me and Tom Wilkinson was great in In the Bedroom and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind here they clearly pick up the slack left by the script. Wilkinson in particular plays the best Flawed Holy Avenger since Jason Miller. It is not an easy thing to come up with a convincing character when the story around you is thin but they manage to do it. Relative newcomer Jennifer Carpenter did fine as Emily although her role consisted mostly of contorting herself and screaming hysterically. I really felt for her at moments thinking that regardless of whether it was demons or psychosis that ailed her it was horrifying to think what she must have been going through.That emotional level got me through the movie. The storytelling shortcuts and the intellectual dishonesty grated against me but I was able to cope with it for the two hours or so that I sat there. If only it hadn't claimed to be based on real events it could have told a better story and more honestly.".

Well neither Feb 15 16 and so on.On the other hand it is not overdone as Saving Private Ryan. As usual in life it's got some humor some drama some mediocrity some insanity. I'm not much of a critic just a normal person but i totally believed and lived the movie with the actors. They played beautifully. All of them. All three were outstanding by my standards  again which might be low for a critic What i can comment on with more understanding is camera work. 10 out of 10. Nothing extra to distract you from the main line. Even drama is in small doses not to lose you in your own feelings.It is not entertainment. It is more of an art. Watch it. Alone.

It depicts the bleakness of the war the UN's involvement and the intruding media presentation of it in black humour and sharp sarcasm while still the suspense and the humanity of the situation doesn't get discarded but makes it more fascinating and quite constructive.The intelligent script and story are very fresh in portraying the madness of war and also building up the tension that never falters as we see how much the two countries hate each other with the soldiers continuously blaming each other for the war and the stupidity of the situation that they are in. It was definitely an unpredictable and confronting war story that didn't try to manipulate the circumstances for a change but actually draws you into the mess.The thing is at first you don't feel any for sorrow for the soldiers separately as they are no worse than each other but then after while we come to know them in detail and see their point of view. The main hatred you feel is towards the UN Leaders as they sit back unwilling to budge while their soldiers sit around wanting to help... you would know what I mean especially at the end of the film as the ending really does pack a punch and makes you question humanity.Not only the UN's priorities and methods are questioned but also the artful and shallow media that see this as good news scoop then actually coming across as caring for the welfare of the soldiers. There's one quote that provides that point from a news reporter that declines to film the bunker and explains that when you've seen one bunker you've seen them all which is pretty ironic well you'll what I mean when you see it.The performances are impressive and truly absorbing from the three soldiers caught in this mess Branko Djuric as Ciki Rene Bitorajac as Nino and Filip Sovagovic as Cera . This film reminded very much of 'Three Kings' in the humour side of things but also the grief you feel for those involved in the war but 'No man's land' is far more involving and far less buoyant than 'Three Kings'.What you get is a solid antiwar film that keeps you gripped to the end and when it finishes it definitely leaves you pondering.".

Danis Tanovic wrote and directed a debut that easily is one of the best films since the new Millennium. Seemly without trying Tanovic succeeds in bringing what so many other directors desperately attempt and fail namely a satirical attack on the absurdity and uselessness of war! But without losing grip on the suspenseful and credible story an that's an extra achievement. The story is simple but efficient and stuffed with little ingenious findings and subtle sarcasm. No Man's Land involves three soldiers  two Bosnians and one Serb  trapped in a trench between the two fronts. One of the Bosnians is wounded and lying on a mine that will explode and kill everybody in a range of 50 metres. While he carefully tries not to move an inch the other two soldiers are bickering about what side actually began the war. There's a group of UN soldiers trying to help them but these people are constantly facing obstacles intrusive press people and obnoxious superiors that prevent them from saving the trapped soldiers. Tanovic sense of clever dialogue and his courage to openly condemn the situation in his homeland make this one of the most admirable films of the last few decades. I'm really really glad that this No Man's Land won the Academy Award for best foreign language film over that dreadfully overhyped 'Le fabuleux destin d'Amlie Poulain'. One of the best choices the Academy ever made!".

	schema:headline " Excellent";
	schema:reviewBody "The story was set in the Yugoslavian civil war in the early 90's. One soldier from each side of the battle was trapped between the front lines of the two rivals. They cannot leave the trench because if they do the army will fire and kill them. To make things worse there was a third soldier who was placed on a landmine which would explode when the pressure on the landmine is released i.e. when he gets up from a lying down position.This is such a sad story with plenty of extremely touching scenes. It provokes people to think that there are so many ridiculous things that people do to each other during wars. People think that by killing each other the problem can be solved. This is a highly upsetting idea. It also revealed the terrible bureaucracy of some organisations which gives little regard for human life.Although it portrayed that the two rival soldiers had a lot of anger and distrust between them there are times that it showed that they are also human. The two of them talked and found out that there was a girl that they both knew. I think that they were living in the same country and they were just like any other civilians just like you and me. They could have been living the same type of life and suddenly friends became enemies.In this film there were no large scale battle scenes like in Saving Private Ryan' or Gallipoli'. However this film is just as sad and emotionally provoking like any other outstanding antiwar movie. It tells people the absurdity of war and how crazy people can be during war. I was very shocked to know that the soldiers in Yugoslavia really put landmines beneath bodies so that when the bodies are cleared away the landmine would explode and kill the dead man's friends and relatives. This behaviour is extremely sickening. The inventor of such landmines is also very disgusting. I wonder how can people create such a sophisticated device and use it in such a ruthless way to kill? I have always thought that if these people who invent killing machines go to invent some other machines instead maybe we would be living in the future world' portrayed in the film already. Our technology would be more advanced than it is now.However nowadays the weapons are getting more complicated advanced deadly and destructive every day. It saddens me a lot because I never understood why a war has to start. The most ironic thing is that the man who decides to wage a war against another country is always unharmed because he sits in his office and has a large team of army to protect him. He does not die in the war. But because of his decision millions of young men have to die.Though there is such a grave message behind this film there is also a lighter side to it. There were a lot of scenes which are funny and all the viewers laughed and clapped for the witty statements. For example when the two soldiers were trapped in the trench they were discussing which side did more war crimes. The soldier who got the gun won the argument and the possession of the gun changed a few times. There was another scene which a soldier searched the pockets of a soldier whom he just killed and found a picture of a naked man.Another scene which everyone laughed was that a soldier asked the soldier lying on the landmine if he was OK. The poor soldier replied 'Of course I am OK I got shot and then I was unconscious and then woke up and found there is a landmine beneath me and then the whole world is watching me and then I want to go to toilet and now I was greeted by rubbish statements from my friend'.I hope this film would make people understand that wars are completely vile and barbaric and no one would start a war again.".

	onyx:emotionText "The story was set in the Yugoslavian civil war in the early 90's. One soldier from each side of the battle was trapped between the front lines of the two rivals. They cannot leave the trench because if they do the army will fire and kill them. To make things worse there was a third soldier who was placed on a landmine which would explode when the pressure on the landmine is released i.e. when he gets up from a lying down position.This is such a sad story with plenty of extremely touching scenes. It provokes people to think that there are so many ridiculous things that people do to each other during wars. People think that by killing each other the problem can be solved. This is a highly upsetting idea. It also revealed the terrible bureaucracy of some organisations which gives little regard for human life.Although it portrayed that the two rival soldiers had a lot of anger and distrust between them there are times that it showed that they are also human. The two of them talked and found out that there was a girl that they both knew. I think that they were living in the same country and they were just like any other civilians just like you and me. They could have been living the same type of life and suddenly friends became enemies.In this film there were no large scale battle scenes like in Saving Private Ryan' or Gallipoli'. However this film is just as sad and emotionally provoking like any other outstanding antiwar movie. It tells people the absurdity of war and how crazy people can be during war. I was very shocked to know that the soldiers in Yugoslavia really put landmines beneath bodies so that when the bodies are cleared away the landmine would explode and kill the dead man's friends and relatives. This behaviour is extremely sickening. The inventor of such landmines is also very disgusting. I wonder how can people create such a sophisticated device and use it in such a ruthless way to kill? I have always thought that if these people who invent killing machines go to invent some other machines instead maybe we would be living in the future world' portrayed in the film already. Our technology would be more advanced than it is now.However nowadays the weapons are getting more complicated advanced deadly and destructive every day. It saddens me a lot because I never understood why a war has to start. The most ironic thing is that the man who decides to wage a war against another country is always unharmed because he sits in his office and has a large team of army to protect him. He does not die in the war. But because of his decision millions of young men have to die.Though there is such a grave message behind this film there is also a lighter side to it. There were a lot of scenes which are funny and all the viewers laughed and clapped for the witty statements. For example when the two soldiers were trapped in the trench they were discussing which side did more war crimes. The soldier who got the gun won the argument and the possession of the gun changed a few times. There was another scene which a soldier searched the pockets of a soldier whom he just killed and found a picture of a naked man.Another scene which everyone laughed was that a soldier asked the soldier lying on the landmine if he was OK. The poor soldier replied 'Of course I am OK I got shot and then I was unconscious and then woke up and found there is a landmine beneath me and then the whole world is watching me and then I want to go to toilet and now I was greeted by rubbish statements from my friend'.I hope this film would make people understand that wars are completely vile and barbaric and no one would start a war again.";

	schema:reviewBody "This movie plays like a primary school lesson on ethnic strife in Bosnia. Parts of it could have been named Bosnian War for Dummies. It's made with uninformed and generally disinterested Western audience in mind and it's as if Tanovic is saying Look I know it's a drag to go out and look for serious material on ethnic groups you've barely heard of fighting over a godforsaken piece of land you probably can't pick out on the map so here's a condensed  simplified version that will make you think you now understand what went on in Bosnia during the early 1990s. With his way too broad a brush he attempts many things. Among them touching on the seeds of conflict between Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Muslims who now days prefer to be called Bosniacks and in this movie are referred to as Bosnians explaining the role of international community through UN's UNPROFOR contingentconveying the hopelessness and chaos of war etc etc.. .With some of them he's more successful than with others. For example in the beginning chaos and confusion of an armed conflict are quite vividly and successfully laid out. In so many other war flicks soldiers shout orders move troops on a whim and generally look firmly in control at every moment. Well here most aren't really sure what to do. They doubt their decisions and seem to reevaluate their involvement in this mess with every new gruesome event. This definitely rings more true. Civil wars certainly don't come with rulebooks and howto guides.Other parts of the movie however can be viewed as personal political statements. I didn't exactly expect Tanovic himself a Muslim and a soldier in the Bosnian Muslim Army during the war to entirely stay clear of this but even so I thought he'd concentrate more on human stories and less on scoring points for his side. As it is he portrays Serbs pretty cartoonishly and same goes for the portrayal of UNPROFOR and Western media. Dialogues invloving these 3 groups are so weak and onedimensional they literally sound like something out of 'Full House' or other lets state the obvious since our audience is too stupid sitcoms.Also there's a whole lot of second layer cheap and childish propaganda that's probably going to go unnoticed by most Western eyes but it's most definitely present. Men on Serbian lines played by Slovene extras are shown as overweight greasy hateful Englishlanguageilliterate boorish pigs who seem to communicate through backslaps and inarticulate grunts whereas Muslims are cleancut cheerful fashionably retro polyglots who fight a war in 'Rolling Stones' Tshirt and Chuck Taylor AllStars while quiping about global issues. No doubt who the beauty and who the beast is in Tanovic's eyes. Nowhere is this more obvious than in a scene when Muslim soldier picks through pockets of a dead Serb troop whom he had just killed. Camera zooms in to show us that he found a photo of a naked guy striking a sexy pose in dead Serb's wallet! At first I thought there might be a payoff to this later on but it never happened which left me wondering as to what exactly was Tanovic trying to sayimply? Since Serbs are implicitly presented as bad guys I suppose he's delivering the final insult which in his world means  showing their gayness!? Still most of Tanovic's wrath is saved for international community and its military arm  UNPROFOR. His thinly veiled position seems to be that the international community should have taken the Muslim side in Bosnia by helping them not only in humanitarian aid but in arms too fight the other two better equipped sides Croats were in this civil war as well though the movie makes no mention of them. That is definitely a first  an antiwar movie that advocates more armed involvement. Tanovic again lets his emotions get the better of him and goes way over the top by portraying most of the official foreign element in Bosnia somewhere in the range between incompetent clueless retards and amoral bordering on sinister worms.I mention all this due to the fact that this film is being marketed as another Catch22  supposedly showing all of the absurdity and senslesness of war. And while it does that in certain part it is also much more of a soapbox for Tanovic to air his obviously subjective views on a conflict he took an active part in.No Man's Land possesses certain redeemable value but tries to be too many things at the same time many of which ultimately dilute and diminish its antiwar message. Srdjan Dragojevic's Pretty Village Pretty Flame did a better job at this since Dragojevic didn't take part in the actual fighting but was close enough to feel its gruesome effects. That meant his movie wasn't burdened and hindered by heavy personal baggage which is something that can't be said for Tanovic.".

	schema:headline " The Universe of an Insane War Showed in a Trench in BosniaHerzegovina";
	schema:reviewBody "In a trench in BosniaHerzegovina two Serbs are looking for Bosnian soldiers. They find one of them apparently dead and one of the Serbs puts a fragmentation mine under his body. Ciki Branko Djuric another Bosnian soldier hidden in the trench shoots at them. In the end the apparently dead Bosnian soldier Cera Filip Sovagovic is indeed alive with a mine under his body and Bosnian Ciki and the Serb Nino Rene Bitorajac are hurt and equally armed in an even situation. They decide to ask for help in a very peculiar way. The French UN soldier Marchand Georges Siatidis tries to help the men and disobeys his superiors order using the journalist Jane Livingstone Katrin Cartlidge as a kind of scapegoat in a very uncommon situation. In the end a circus is armed in the trench and nothing is resolved. Yesterday I saw this excellent movie for the third time. In a surrealistic situation the director Danis Tanovic offers the universe of this insane war using a few characters. It is very metaphoric and has a kind of black humor. We have two Bosnians and two Serbs one of them having the sick idea of mining a dead body. The rage among the three survivors alternates with some dialogs about a common friend and who initiated the war. Indeed they do not clearly know why they are fighting against each other and the other soldiers are unable to identify who is who without wearing uniforms. The ridiculous bureaucratic and hypocrite role of the UN in this war is explicitly demonstrated. Maybe this is the unique film that really touches the wound relative to the performance of UN in this war. The idealist soldier is unable to help whom needs and feels very frustrated when the situation is ended. The journalists trying to obtain a matter but not taking care in investigating the trench' a little further after achieving their objectives.  No Man's Land' is another excellent movie about the Bosnian war inclusive an Oscar winner for Best Foreign Language Film in 2001 and highly recommended for any audience. If the reader likes this theme I would like to suggest the excellent Harrison's Flowers' Vukovar' Pretty Village Pretty Flame' Shot Through the Heart' Welcome to Sarajevo' and Savior'. My vote is nine.Title Brazil Terra de Ningum'  No Man's Land'".

	onyx:emotionText "In a trench in BosniaHerzegovina two Serbs are looking for Bosnian soldiers. They find one of them apparently dead and one of the Serbs puts a fragmentation mine under his body. Ciki Branko Djuric another Bosnian soldier hidden in the trench shoots at them. In the end the apparently dead Bosnian soldier Cera Filip Sovagovic is indeed alive with a mine under his body and Bosnian Ciki and the Serb Nino Rene Bitorajac are hurt and equally armed in an even situation. They decide to ask for help in a very peculiar way. The French UN soldier Marchand Georges Siatidis tries to help the men and disobeys his superiors order using the journalist Jane Livingstone Katrin Cartlidge as a kind of scapegoat in a very uncommon situation. In the end a circus is armed in the trench and nothing is resolved. Yesterday I saw this excellent movie for the third time. In a surrealistic situation the director Danis Tanovic offers the universe of this insane war using a few characters. It is very metaphoric and has a kind of black humor. We have two Bosnians and two Serbs one of them having the sick idea of mining a dead body. The rage among the three survivors alternates with some dialogs about a common friend and who initiated the war. Indeed they do not clearly know why they are fighting against each other and the other soldiers are unable to identify who is who without wearing uniforms. The ridiculous bureaucratic and hypocrite role of the UN in this war is explicitly demonstrated. Maybe this is the unique film that really touches the wound relative to the performance of UN in this war. The idealist soldier is unable to help whom needs and feels very frustrated when the situation is ended. The journalists trying to obtain a matter but not taking care in investigating the trench' a little further after achieving their objectives.  No Man's Land' is another excellent movie about the Bosnian war inclusive an Oscar winner for Best Foreign Language Film in 2001 and highly recommended for any audience. If the reader likes this theme I would like to suggest the excellent Harrison's Flowers' Vukovar' Pretty Village Pretty Flame' Shot Through the Heart' Welcome to Sarajevo' and Savior'. My vote is nine.Title Brazil Terra de Ningum'  No Man's Land'";

Bosnians and Serbs act in this movie  mixed and also the other ethnicity branko djuric is Serb and acts a Muslim! he did a great job movie very passioned  romantic but hard till the end. the Serbian general is acted by a Bosnian so its a multiethnic movie which is directed very lovely and sensibly because it doesn't care who started war. the spot is on the situation and what the people were and actually are. the tragic situation that the Bosnian soldier lies on a mine is nice directed. the fact that the UNtroops cant help in the end s sad and something to think about. i think this movie was edited very nice it has heart something to think about. excellent movie thumbs up.".

The situation has been presented in an island Hell in the Pacific and in a lone planet Enemy Mine among other films the two oppositesided warriors that have to overcome common troubles to survive. In this film the islandplanet is a trench in the middle of a warfield somewhere in the Balcans in which because of the stupidity of their superiors both soldiers get trapped.Now the interesting side of this story is that the characters are at shooting distance of both enemy armies and therefore at risk of dying from friendly or enemy fire. As a further complication the believeddead friend of one of the soldiers has been boobytrapped with a mine by the other's friend who is shot dead early in the movie. They cannot run for they will be shot by the other army and the soldier lying over the mine cannot move or it will blow appart.The situation develops fast into a major international matter with the notsofortunate intervention of the UN soldiers and off course the international press. How can it get worst? How can it get better? The film mirrors the well intended actions that a Worldwide peace organization with an internal egowar lack of credibility and quite unclear agenda did in the Balcan's conflict. It presents the misguided reasons by which hate led to fraticide in which nobody remembers the origin of the conflict but the consequences are written in blood in the papers. And also portrays the roll of the media not only as wintnesses but also as beholders of the Public Opinion.The story goes on with very wise and satiric even comic dialogs inserted among very serious situations which lead the public lightly but reflexively into the tense and very likely ending.A great film which with a very low budget and a very inteligent and documented script puts itself among the best war films of all times. Only thing I hope is that the story was not based on a reallife situation which would be by far more terrifiyng that most fiction endings in film history.".

But some people praise it as a realistic take on war maybe the most realistic ever. Well if you want realistic take on war watch The Hurt Locker. No Man's Land is basically the Hollywood version of that. Even the first Rambo is more realistic and deeper in some ways. Why? Many thing happening in the movie make no sense for example Ciki looks like a calm guy he didn't lose his judgement when he was struck by a tank projectile no he just went to search for a cigar to smoke. But after being saved he makes the dumb decision of threatening a whole army with a pistol what was he thinking? That action did not fit the character of Ciki we saw earlier. This is just a sign of amateurish plot design. And the french UN sergeant he defied his superiors and risked his life just for a mission he didn't even knew what was about until he got there.As a tragedy it was hard to feel bad for any of the main characters they are not very sympathetic and they don't show enough of their personality to make you care for them. If a situation like this was real maybe i would but then again you hear stuff like this on TV often and it's about innocent civilians. I only felt bad for the UN soldiers that wasted their time trying to save 2 people that didn't want their help.It's not a that bad movie but almost everything it shows has been done better somewhere else.".

	schema:reviewBody "The film is telling the dramatic story of three soldiers one Serb and two Bosnians caught between two frontlines during the Yugoslavian war. Some UN troop try to free them but their very bureaucratic hierarchy prevents them of doing so and they require the help of a British journalist.The plot is very credible and shows perfectly the absurdity and cruelty of war and the influence of the TV press on the battlefield.But I would not qualify this film as a masterpiece. I found the acting not that convincing. Watch Kirk Douglas in Paths of Glory! Moreover the story is quite melodramatic. Some effects in particular the UN colonel and his sexy secretary are not really welcome the director should have chosen between the MASH style or the documentary style and not oscillated between both. I really felt the whole was too long and not deserving such eulogistic comments as you can read on IMDb.This film can be compared with the BBC TV series Warriors 1999. I really believe Warriors was very much superior. The pace was faster. The acting was better. The plot was more credible and more informative. Of course this was only a TV series and the quality of the film direction cannot be compared but all in all Warriors touched me much deeper.".

The very atmospheric nature of the film is supported very strongly by excellent performances all around. Christian Bale takes things to the extreme in his embodiment of his character. It is hard to take seeing him in his nearstarvation body mass which elevates the tension of this piece even further. The storyline leaves a little to be desired. While it creates its mood excellently it does tend to plod along a little too much.One thing that does stand out is how reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock this film plays. Almost everything about the film screams Hitchcock from the editing of certain scenes the driving sequences are very much in the style of Psycho to the Bernard Herrmannesquire score lots of bass clarinet the lack of fullyexploringrevealing some of the creepier points of the film what is dripping from the fridge? and the washed out grainy photography. If you want to see what a film would look like if Hitchcock were alive to film it today this is the closest thing you could probably come across. And if that was part of Brad Anderson's intention in directing this I have to commend him on the execution because it is uncanny.Overall I would recommend this film but not to casual moviegoers. This is very much a moviephile experience for those who appreciate character development and cinematography as much as plot points and a storyline that can be defined and followed from one action to the next. In that way it is closer to films like Magnolia or the Others where the apex is the characters. If you are looking for a typical popcorn Hollywood thriller this is not what you are looking for.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film at the Stockholm International Film Festival in November 2004. In the audience was director Brad Anderson and i think he very much appreciated how the film was received by the rest of the audience. And this film was well worth the applause.This film is about a man Christian Bale working in a heavy industry. He suffers from insomnia and hasn't slept for a year. This condition is causing him to lose weight and his perception of reality to become twisted. Soon he doesn't know what's real or not.I won't elaborate any more on the plot since it could really spoil the film for you. There are some twists and turns along the way that might not be all that obvious and you should be able to enjoy them without being told too much. What i can say though is that the story is in no way revolutionary. A couple of films have been made in the same vein as this one the most famous perhaps being Memento and Fight Club. And The Machinist shares elements from both these films but still i think manages to create an identity of it's own.But aside from the story Christian Bale really steals the show. Having seen him in his previous films it's hard to be prepared for what he looks like here. For this film he has turned himself into a walking skeleton a rundown shadow of a man. And his performance is throughout the movie mesmerizing. I have ever since American Psycho been fully convinced of Bale's talents as an actor and this further proves his talent and commitment. The rest of the cast also do a good job strengthening the overall strange mood of the film.Although i thoroughly enjoyed this film i understand it's not for everyone. This is not the least proved by the fact that Brad Anderson as he stated in the interview after the screening could not get funding for it in America. Instead he had to go to Spain to make the film the way he wanted to. And i'm not surprised this is not your standard Hollywood fare. But for those of us who enjoy films that go beyond the will to suit everyone and make loads of money this is a rewarding experience. I rate it 710.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's a common rule that people subconsciously decide within the first ten minutes whether they like a movie or not. It didn't even take me that long to know that I would be intrigued by The Machinist.The set up is perfect. It's adorable how the movie constantly establishes new plot points without ever getting tedious. As the story goes on it gets hard to believe that the ending will be able to explain everything and you start pondering that there can only be one possible conclusion for all the weird events. It may be disappointing at first to learn that your predictions are probably deadon and you might go Not that old twist again. The beautiful thing however is that there's an explanation to the twist that really adds a lot to the concept. Much later when you've already left the theater and you rethink the whole thing you'll find that the script is much cleverer than you had thought at first. To me the biggest achievement of the movie in retrospective is that it's never creepy just for the sake of freaking the audience out and hell the carnivalsequence is so friggin creepy and well made it's delightful. Every scene has its purpose and that is not often the case in horror and mystery movies.Although the whole cast did a fine job Christian Bale's terrific performance must be mentioned. Usually I'm annoyed by stories about actors losing or gaining weight in preparation for a role because mostly it's uncalled for anyway and not even worth a mention. What Bale did to prepare for The Machinist however is nothing short of heroic. He lost 60 pounds and looks so unhealthy throughout the whole movie that it's hard to believe he turned into himself again after the director yelled cut!.I can recommend The Machinist to anybody who's looking for a movie that keeps you intrigued longer than just during its running time. If after 10 minutes you like the movie after days you'll find yourself still obsessed with it. I love it when a movie does that to me!".

He is obviously scarred by some past incident but what is it? He finds mysterious notes on his refrigerator saying 'who are you?' He sees colleagues that don't exist. He seems to have lost it completely.A Spanish production but with Brad Anderson at the helm as director and an almost exclusively American cast this is basically an American film. I must admit I kept shelving this one due to reasons I cannot really recall now I've finally watched it but it probably had something to do with Christian Bale's insane weight loss and all the surrounding publicity. I assumed the film was all about Bale's loss of weight and not much more. A method boy in a film solely hyped for an actor's dedication to play the part but the film blew me away as simple as that. Christian Bale gives a solo turn here almost unseen before. No matter how many pounds he lost it's a remarkable performance. Director Brad Anderson succeeds brilliantly in conceiving an atmosphere that is so compelling as one other user on the IMDb stated 'You just HAVE to know what the hell is going on here.' I think that's the key factor in what makes this film so incredibly compelling. The whole setting is an anonymous industrial town somewhere in the US that could be Pennsylvania Michigan or upstate New York actually it was shot near Barcelona but it doesn't really matter where the story is located. It's the atmosphere of estrangement that does it. And Christian Bale gives such an intense performance you really want to know his cause and background. Where on earth does he come from? We know he works in a greasy factory but why is he skinoverbone? Why hasn't he slept in over a year? Brad Anderson creates an atmosphere so broody and sleazy it's like a netherworld an urban nightmare. In a certain way it reminded me of the strange urban landscape in Eraserhead by David Lynch.Camera Obscura  910".

While the previous movie took advantage of our imaginations leaping around a spooky environment The Machinist makes our discomfort palpably visual in Christian Bale's painful to look at body as his character is ravaged by insomnia and loss of appetite by the end of the movie it's shocking to see his normally handsome face. But all the focus on his astounding weight loss takes away from the other elements in the almost black and white film that make it a scare fest. The movie establishes The Twilight Zone mood immediately with the soundtrack which includes generous use of the theremin as Hitchcock did in Psycho. The production design is excellent at supporting the mood.The suspense builds and is sustained through to the satisfying conclusion as you genuinely get involved in Bale's efforts to solve the increasingly mysterious happenings around him.

Despite looking like a caricature of a Holocaust victim Bale creates a full character from the jocular male camaraderie of the factory where he doesn't quite seem to fit in to responding one beat off to the warmth of the two women in his life a waitress and a prostitute with the an open heart of gold played as usual by Jennifer Jason Leigh but effectively languid.".

Not only did Resnick remind anyone of Raskolnikov? put down a copy of Dostoyevsky's The Idiot at one point but the whole movie owed a lot to Notes From The Underground Crime And Punishment and The Double. Did anyone spot the sign in the Ghost Train sequence which read Crime And Punishment? Or that Sharian's character is called Ivan cf The Brothers Karamazov  especially the chapter Ivan's Dream? Jennifer Jason Leigh's character is very familiar from Dostoyevsky as was the saintly Maria.Its a cracking film and none of these references are indispensable to enjoying it but I thought I would point it out.".

Jennifer Jason Leigh's character is very familiar from Dostoyevsky as was the saintly Maria.Its a cracking film and none of these references are indispensable to enjoying it but I thought I would point it out.";

He's losing weight his health is declining and there's the possibility he's losing his sanity.Christian Bale is excellent as the emaciated machinist Trevor Reznik. The amount of weight he lost for this role is truly shocking. He lives in a dark depressing world in which he is literally slowly disappearing. Eventually he starts seeing strange things A creepy coworker no one else can see. A waitress and her child who might not even exist. Cryptic notes are left on his refrigerator at home. Is he the victim of a conspiracy or is he losing his mind?The film attempts to weave a complex plot that keeps us guessing by blurring fantasy and reality. The Machinist falls in the same genre as Fight Club Donnie Darko and Mulholland Drive. However while those excellent movies gave us complex characters and intricate plots there's not much mysterious about The Machinist. Most seasoned moviewatchers will guess that Reznik is living in a fantasy world fairly quickly. There's no real shock or surprise at the conclusion. We've seen this done before in better films.I won't give an exact spoiler detailing what has caused Reznik's psychological break from reality. Rest assured it's fairly trite and expected. This is essentially a morality tale about lingering guilt and eventually doing the right thing. For a film with an artistic independent attitude The Machinist is little more than a formulaic psychological thriller. Director Brad Anderson is clearly talented and this movie almost worked brilliantly. It just needed a little more complexity in character development and plot to truly engage and surprise the audience. After well over an hour of building suspense one is left disappointed by the mundane conclusion.".

This review is not meant to just show the aesthetic and structural qualities Anderson's movie has but also to distance it from the impression of being a Fight Club ripoff. The review CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS on both The Machinist and Fight Club and should only be read by people who have already seen these two movies.Those who are familiar with Aristotle's view on art and specifically the mimesis and catharsis theories will find similarities here or should I say an exact match to his idea for a tragedy. The Machinist mimics the real world. It is not a supernatural or fantasy story but something possible in the context of reality keeping to the mimesis theory art should be something that imitates life stays close to the rules on what is possible. The protagonist a machinist is plagued by insomnia and weight loss the reason for this suffering isn't explained from the start but later on. We sympathize with him with the problems this man Trevor Reznik has. Why should an innocent suffer like that we ask. Why should he be punished if he hadn't committed a crime? The tragic catharsis writes Aristotle is the moment when the protagonist's sin is revealed when we the audience learn that the punishment he has received isn't unjust when we know that innocence isn't subjectable to punishment sin is. Scott Kosar wrote a Greek tragedy Brad Anderson brought it to life.The atmosphere? A bleak nearly colorless look sadness and dread combined. The gloomy melancholy jitters the mind. Christian Bale's dedication to his craft is outstanding he takes it to a whole new level. What he underwent for this role the performance a range of emotions ranging from fear shock paranoia regretsorrow. It was more than Oscarworthy it was unreal. Director Brad Anderson creates tension and unease at places you wouldn't think it was possible he delivers surprise after surprise in what may seem more like a hellish rollercoaster ride then a traditional thriller. A low key musical score perfect choice for the tone. Quite a catching opening tune.The Machinist it seems ends with questions unanswered. The main plot line has been completed but some mechanisms that lead towards the conclusion are a bit fogged out of perception. Nonetheless they are there. The movie is of course open for interpretation and the following is simply my take on some of the subplots and characters.On the opening scene. The opening scene is as we've learned not a chronological first but a sequence taken from the latter stage. Why? It exists as a stylistic approach to create tension to grab the audience's attention from the start. an early tip for the mystery the movie has note Reznik's reaction the shock in his eyes when dumping the body and when someone flashes him with a flashlight.On the insomnia weight loss and Ivan. The insomnia and Ivan are the reasons for The Machinist being a Fight Club ripoff argument. There were movies that used such ideas before Fight Club Lynch's Lost Highway for example it's nothing all too original. What these elements represent that is what's important. In The Machinist they are the punishment Trevor's guilt inflicts on him. We've all experienced guilt at one point or the other and we know it can have an effect. Here that effect is taken to the extreme. Fight Club on the other hand had the Narrator's insomnia and split personality Tyler Dyrden created from frustration his inability in adapting to the status quo he can't sleep because he cannot see a reason for his existence he makes Tyler who gives him a reason. Ivan is not a split personality he doesn't take control over the protagonist's body like Tyler no one except Reznik has seen or heard of him he is a manifestation like Nicholas or Marie he is the projection of sin and Trevor in the past. The Trevor who caused the accident he will repeat it again in order to guide Bale's character to the truth.On how Trevor Reznik lost his memory about the accident. During the sequence at the theme park where Trevor and Nicholas are walking through the dark tunnel Trevor notes the similarities between his childhood and Nicholas's current life. Both lacked or lack a fatherlike figure in their life both are in a good relationship with their mothers. This is not an accident since Nicholas is merely one of the manifestations in Reznik's subconscious mind there is little doubt that he is also a mirror image of Trevor as a young boy living with his mother. His subconscious guilt fills the gaps and fleshes out the two fictional characters using bits and pieces of his past life. This is done in order to make the two manifestations become believable to Trevor's now doubtlessly distorted perception. If Nicholas is in fact Trevor then what happened to Nicholas during the ride through Route 666 is what actually happened to Trevor shortly after the accident. Epileptic shock as explained by Marie causes loss of memory he will forget it ever happened. And indeed Trevor forgot partially in his subconscious the memory still existed.Complex but structurally sound The Machinist is the dark modern reincarnation of a Greek tragedy. Twisted and disturbing sad but liberating Scott Kosar Brad Anderson and Christian Bale create a work of high caliber. Not something that can be enjoyed the way a Hollywood Blockbuster can be enjoyed it is exhausting yet pleasing in its own way.".

It exists as a stylistic approach to create tension to grab the audience's attention from the start. an early tip for the mystery the movie has note Reznik's reaction the shock in his eyes when dumping the body and when someone flashes him with a flashlight.On the insomnia weight loss and Ivan. The insomnia and Ivan are the reasons for The Machinist being a Fight Club ripoff argument. There were movies that used such ideas before Fight Club Lynch's Lost Highway for example it's nothing all too original. What these elements represent that is what's important. In The Machinist they are the punishment Trevor's guilt inflicts on him. We've all experienced guilt at one point or the other and we know it can have an effect. Here that effect is taken to the extreme. Fight Club on the other hand had the Narrator's insomnia and split personality Tyler Dyrden created from frustration his inability in adapting to the status quo he can't sleep because he cannot see a reason for his existence he makes Tyler who gives him a reason. Ivan is not a split personality he doesn't take control over the protagonist's body like Tyler no one except Reznik has seen or heard of him he is a manifestation like Nicholas or Marie he is the projection of sin and Trevor in the past. The Trevor who caused the accident he will repeat it again in order to guide Bale's character to the truth.On how Trevor Reznik lost his memory about the accident. During the sequence at the theme park where Trevor and Nicholas are walking through the dark tunnel Trevor notes the similarities between his childhood and Nicholas's current life. Both lacked or lack a fatherlike figure in their life both are in a good relationship with their mothers. This is not an accident since Nicholas is merely one of the manifestations in Reznik's subconscious mind there is little doubt that he is also a mirror image of Trevor as a young boy living with his mother. His subconscious guilt fills the gaps and fleshes out the two fictional characters using bits and pieces of his past life. This is done in order to make the two manifestations become believable to Trevor's now doubtlessly distorted perception. If Nicholas is in fact Trevor then what happened to Nicholas during the ride through Route 666 is what actually happened to Trevor shortly after the accident. Epileptic shock as explained by Marie causes loss of memory he will forget it ever happened. And indeed Trevor forgot partially in his subconscious the memory still existed.Complex but structurally sound The Machinist is the dark modern reincarnation of a Greek tragedy. Twisted and disturbing sad but liberating Scott Kosar Brad Anderson and Christian Bale create a work of high caliber. Not something that can be enjoyed the way a Hollywood Blockbuster can be enjoyed it is exhausting yet pleasing in its own way.";

	schema:reviewBody "I really wanted to like The Machinist. As this film and his previous effort Session 9 show Brad Anderson is one of the best visual stylists working in film today able to conjure up a dank eerie foreboding atmosphere from a budget that would not pay for David Fincher's lunch. He has a great compositional sense is not afraid to be leisurely and has a refreshingly uncluttered approach to misenscene. Yet The Machinist like Session 9 ultimately disappoints. I think there are two reasons for this.The first is that absent the conceit of Christian Bale's astonishing transformation there is very little reason for this film to exist. The Machinist is a character study of a character who has yes very little weight. Despite Bale's best efforts Trevor Reznick is a blank a cypher unpleasant and uninteresting. Although the film abounds in Hitchcock references Anderson screenwriter Scott Kosar and Bale fail to assimilate the master's most important lesson that the film's weirdo should be its most sympathetic and likable character. Anthony Perkins was cast as Norman Bates because of his image as the sweet sensitive boy next door Christian Bale a prodigiously talented but chilly and distant actor was most assuredly not.As a character Resnick lacks progression because he is skeletal and bonkers from the beginning there is no sense of horror as he is quite literally consumed by his own guilt. For this to work some kind of contrast with normality is needed  the audience must witness a sensitive precious soul slowly destroyed because of one small dreadful mistake. But Resnick is no Prince Myshkin. Rather his guilt seems to be the only interesting thing in his otherwise dim uncomprehending existence. The guilt gives his tedious life drama meaning and coherence. The film's final revelation should have been a shattering emotional climax instead it is the excuse for Resnick to take a much needed nap.The second reason for The Machinist's failure is that Anderson seems to have trouble abandoning himself to his chosen genre. His direction of The Machinist and of Session 9 as well is detached clinical unengaged. There is no sense of love or of passion in what he is doing. Anderson seems drawn to horror tempted by the opportunity it offers him to show what he can do with a camera but he seems afraid to commit to give himself over. It's as if he is too good too cultured too intelligent too rational for this kind of film. Yet he keeps coming back as his next assignment a remake of George Romero's The Crazies shows.There is no singular vision in Anderson's horror films as there is in the work of Cronenberg for example. There is no exuberant celebration of style as there is in Argento's or DePalma's best works. Nor does there seem to be any political agenda as there is in Romero's films. But despite the relative failure of Session 9 and The Machinist I think there is something in Anderson unformed and embryonic waiting to burst forth if only he can let go. He is a late talent a grower not a shower. I don't think it will be seen in The Crazies but I'm still waiting.".

The reviews for The Machinist are way up there which I suspect increased my expectations. Regardless of the reviews I would have watched it merely for Bale's decision to be in it. But here all of the actor's talents go to waste which is a shame as Mr. Bale possibly shortened his life by losing so much weight for the role.Spoilers and rants ahead  The plot was unfortunately made incredibly obvious to me early on in the scene where the machine shop head honcho in the office said that no one with the mystery man's name worked there. OK so the mystery man is a figment of the main character's imagination no other explanation. Why do I need to watch the rest of the movie again? It was really a stupid move writing the scene that way a little ambiguity here would have gone a long way.Outside of the plot itself being the tired overdone reveal the lameandonly twist too early sort the music was annoyingly Hitchcockian and obtrusive. Telegraphing scenes with buckets of Thereminladen orchestration worked pretty good back in the day but there are good reasons no one does it in supposedly wellcrafted movies anymore.And the gritty depressing blue filter thing has got to stop and I mean now! A touch of blue is perhaps OK now and then but nothing but shades of sickly blue just whacks you over the head and screams look how arty we are! Enough already. Drop the editing machine and back away from the blue filter I just can't stand it anymore.This is the kind of movie you get when the writing and direction just aren't up to snuff. What a waste of everyone's time involved with it including this viewer's. Rating  210.".

It was really a stupid move writing the scene that way a little ambiguity here would have gone a long way.Outside of the plot itself being the tired overdone reveal the lameandonly twist too early sort the music was annoyingly Hitchcockian and obtrusive. Telegraphing scenes with buckets of Thereminladen orchestration worked pretty good back in the day but there are good reasons no one does it in supposedly wellcrafted movies anymore.And the gritty depressing blue filter thing has got to stop and I mean now! A touch of blue is perhaps OK now and then but nothing but shades of sickly blue just whacks you over the head and screams look how arty we are! Enough already. Drop the editing machine and back away from the blue filter I just can't stand it anymore.This is the kind of movie you get when the writing and direction just aren't up to snuff. What a waste of everyone's time involved with it including this viewer's. Rating  210.";

Comparing this film to Memento or Angel Heart just to mention two REAL masterpieces is plain blasphemy. There is no way Memento or Angel Heart could last 15 minutes for example. But this one could perfectly fit even in 10. I still have to underrate in order to try average real rating. For me true real rating for this one is 5 out of ten not a cent more. Only worth if free on TV or cable. And if you are in visually dark mood of course.".

	schema:reviewBody "It is so difficult to craft a firstperson narrative from the viewpoint of a psychotic. When someone does manage this feat however the results can be fantastic easily trumping any other type of thriller.The Machinist is such a movie.First we have the protagonist played remarkably by Christian Bale. The problem with firstperson psychodramas of this type is keeping the audience's empathy with the creep. Yes it will be revealed that the protagonist is actually less than savory but the audience has to still relate to the character as if he was the protagonist. The writer and actor do this brilliantly with Trevor. You not only physically see his pain but you find yourself caring about the guy and wondering what in the world happened that led him to this awful fate? We care about Trevor yet we know that somehow he has done something horrible.Then we have the plot line. Psychodramas can overdo the plot by overdoing the creep factor or make the person see obvious hallucinations. If it's too telegraphed you've demeaned the film by making it another teen shocker. But you can't underdo it either making it so boring the audience loses interest. The filmmakers here have kept a great balance. You're trying to figure out what's happening what's real vs. what's imaginary trying to see how the pieces fit. It's this puzzlement with enough answers yet still enough questions that keeps an audience involved. Too many questions and audiences give up too many answers and the audience doesn't respect you.Finally and most importantly you have the climax. So many good psychothrillers resolve themselves in outlandish ways or in mundane pathetic ways. The Machinist ends so aptly in a way that you can both despise and pity Trevor. So the whole buildup isn't wasted on silliness nor is it lost in a sea of gore and action. The Machinist strikes a perfect balance.A few other things work in this film's favor  Supporting cast is very strong. Jennifer Jason Leigh is very believable as a sympathetic hooker and the cast of the machine shop are spoton I've worked in machine shops and they got those guys down pat!.  Cinematography. All throughout the film the lighting is just subtly off and I mean that in a good way. It keeps you just slightly off balance adding to the protagonist's unstable state. Set design. It's filmed in Spain but dressed up as America. While I was watching this movie I felt the surroundings were also a little bit off. I wasn't entirely sure why until I learned it was filmed in Spain but dressed as America. This doesn't come off as cheesy at all however. It actually adds to the tweak of visual psychosis. All the details are accurate but the feel is wrong. It was probably a happy accident that this happened but it does add to the feeling that Trevor simply isn't seeing things correctly.Overall this is a well done psychodrama. 9 out of 10. For a bit of time it repeats itself but other than that it's quite excellent.Barky".

	schema:reviewBody "This pleasant collage by firsttime directors Jos Corbacho and Juan Cruz is made up of three loosely interwoven stories of various people in a Barcelona neighbourhood with a tapas bar as the central location where most characters' lives intertwine. The title not only refers to those small appetizers Spain is famous for but also to the Spanish verb tapar which means to cover up or to hide. I found the story of Lolo the bar owner the most engaging. His wife abandoned him he is full of prejudice against women and foreigners cannot show his emotions and has developed a deeply rooted incapability of engaging in any meaningful relationships. He needs a new chef and ends up with Mao a Chinese immigrant who's kungfuing all the time but is the most efficient cook he ever had and suddenly people are flocking to his bar because his dishes are actually really good now. Some of the insights springing from this story are a bit contrived. Lolo who's learning that not all Chinese are communists or illiterate paupers seems like 40 years too late to me but somehow the actors and the lowkey filming make even obnoxious Lolo seem sympathetic and near the end of the film I really rooted for this man.Rubn Ochandiano gives an exceptional performance as Ruben a teen supermarket worker who engages in a sexual relationship with middleaged shop owner Raquel Elvira Menquez. A very talented young actor a natural screen presence. I hope it ensues in more prominent roles in the foreseeable future.It's all lowkey and unpretentious with sober direction and cinematography but surprisingly effective. Many of its characters could easily have befallen victim to stereotypes but the cast does an amazing job to give this a real breath of fresh air. Hard to resist.Camera Obscura  810".

	schema:headline " Agreeable film deals with Barcelona neighborhood including enjoyable acting and slick filmmaking";
	schema:reviewBody "The flick gives a short description about lives of people under the focus of a lowermiddle class neighborhood . The small everyday stories of a group of neighbours who live in a suburb of Barcelona and the little secrets that they hide . The tale introduces us an old marriage  as husband Alberto De Mendoza suffers cancer  as his wife Maria Galiana does business with dope  a spinster Elvira Minguez who falls in love for a young man Ruben Ochandiano  and a barman Angel De Andres Lopez who hires a Chinese boy expert on martial arts . Tapas turns out to be a moving drama well realized by Jose Corbacho and Juan Cruz about human relationships . This is an interesting Dramedy  drama more comedy in less than 90 minutes of length and yet with an air of naturalness and credibility . This is a thoughtprovoking as well as pleasant flick filmed with great sensitivity and feeling . The film knows very well intercross these two genres  drama with brief touches of comedy  although the most comfortable note in the enjoyable drama . It's less fun but no less likable  though some infinite sadness follows the film at times . The film moves in fits and starts most of which would be desirable  with more traps the viewer resists any kind and some moments of enjoyment and others quite a few disconcerting . It's an intelligent and touching story although sometimes is slow moving and tiring but is finely developed with sense of style and sensibility . Attractive drama filled with emotion  artistic scenes and plenty of sensitivity . There are moments of humor but predominates drama and above all there's a good feeling . The picture relies heavily on the unusual relationship between a frustrated woman and a 20yearold shopkeeper  but it doesn't makes boring  but results to be entertaining . This is an amusing movie plenty of nice feeling  drama  stirring scenes and a peculiar love story . Interesting screenplay by the same filmmakers  including some autobiographic elements . Most of the film locations are around the Santa Eulalia neighborhood in the city of Hospitalet De Llobregat which is the neighborhood where director Jos Corbacho grow up. The picture is primarily supported on two sensational players Alberto Mendoza and Maria Galiana they give sensational acting . Both of them carry out their characters to perfection and show a look that says it all . Furthermore  stand out ngel de Andrs Lpez as Lolo  Elvira Mnguez as Raquel and Rubn Ochandiano as Csar . Support cast is frankly well such as Blanca Aplanez  Amparo Moreno and Rosario Pardo . Emotive musical score by Pablo Sala  the soundtrack flows great with the film in every way and creates a catching atmosphere in every moment  adding a sensitive leitmotif . The film enjoys a breeze as well as moving final  and gives us much to think about it and in which doesn't deceive or dramatize unnecessarily. Along these lines it is clear that writersfilmmakers Jose Corbacho Juan Cruz try to create a peculiar picture . Apart from that  it has a touch Berlanga and Azcona that always feels good . The motion picture was professionally written and directed by Jose Corbacho and Juan Cruz at their best . Both of whom presents a fresh portrait with moments to smile and laugh  but mostly so that you shrink the heart with these unfortunate people . Corbacho and Cruz have written and directed various films and TV pictures such as Pelotas Cobardes  Somos Gente Honrada and Holmes  Watson. Madrid Days among others .".

I love Spanish movies so I had great expectations from this one and first time directors Corbacho and Cruz did great job in my eyes. Their story is so real and very simple. We're actually watching 4 stories about lives of ordinary people in suburb of Barcelona. Lolo is owner of the main restaurant in town and his wife cook in his restaurant left him because he never really paid any attention for her only for money. So Lolo hires Mao Chinese who is a great cook. Raquel is middleage woman who is very lonely because her husband left her so she keeps some sort of relationship with one man on internet. Doa Conchi and Don Mariano are one old couple that are hit with news that Don Mariano is dying of cancer. Doa Conchi tries to make his life beautiful by selling low drugs to others. She gets money so she can buy him everything he needs. Csar and Opo are two teenagers who only wants to have some good time. Their conversations about sex Bruce Lee and life are great. Main message of this movie is love. Cause love connects every character in this story. Tapas is drama with elements of comedy and I really recommend it to everyone who wants to hear stories about life and love told in beautiful simplicity.".

One reviewer called the neighborhood lower middle class. Not really as in Spain it's really hard to tell the difference in incomes from one neighborhood to the next. Everyone lives at a good level and the modest jobs depicted in the movie are respected positions as they should be. Hollywood seems to have a huge problem depicting the lives of ordinary people. They always give normal slobs jobs like lawyers or ad executives and even if the characters have real jobs they always live in swell apartments with exposed brick and high ceilings. Spanish movies portray life as it is lived by the vast majority of Spanish people. They even look like you and me instead of stars airbrushed to within an inch of their lives.And what's wrong with just being a normal person with an average apartment?

	schema:reviewBody "Amy Kate Beckinsale and David Fox Luke Wilson are returning from an arduous family reunion on their way to Los Angeles. On their trip they encounter car problems and inevitably pull into a motel Norman Bates could feel right at home at. After some awkward exchanges with the owner they reluctantly decide to spend the night. Upon viewing some tasteless horror films in the room David begins to suspect their authenticity and that these are actual murders taking place. Furthermore he is led to believe the room that these events take place in is none other than the room they are currently residing. With this initial setup Vacancy wastes no time launching the audience into an engaging gripping and somewhat macabre story while borrowing sparingly from Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho and managing to side step many land mines other horror films fail to see. Vacancy has both positives and negatives going for it however the negatives don't seem to affect the narrative as frequently as in other films. The first thought that came to my mind was its running time. At eighty five minutes the film may move at too brisk of a pace for some and at times it feels like it should be part of a short horror film festival rather than a stand alone feature film. The clichs are very apparent as wellthe brokendown car the mysterious stranger the outofrange cellphone and the creepy hotel are included but rather than using them as a crutch for a poor script the film seems to celebrate their existence. It epitomizes all horror films where the main characters are stranded encounter mysterious people or creepy locations. The film also fails to successfully flush out the snuff film aspect that was so heavily advertised and anticipated. The screen time of these films is very limited and the focus on them is brief. They serve as an fundamental setup but after their initial appearance they fall out of sight and out of mind.What makes the film much more successful than the average teen slasher horror film is ironically the absence of teens in the film. In recent years the most successful horror films in my opinion like The Sixth Sense What Lies Beneath Stir of Echoes and Hide and Seek all revolve around families and in particular the relationships between adults. In Vacancy Amy and David are a married couple one argument away from a divorce and unlike an amorous oblivious teenage couple about to become mincemeat for an axemurderer the tension between David and Amy puts them on edge throughout the whole film and translates to tension in the audience while the film builds its suspense. The build of the film also differs from the main pattern set by modern slasher films. Winding like a key the tension never lets down and unlike the ups and downs of slasher films where there are multiple apexes of horror there is a ratchet effect in Vacancy where there is no relief and each scene is built upon the previous one. The other very obvious asset to the film is its relative lack of violence compared to most other modern horror films. In recent years films such as the Saw series Hostel The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and The Hills Have Eyes have lazily resorted to the shock factor to scare their audience rather than rely on the old saying It's not the bang that is scary but rather the anticipation to the bang. That's not to say that the film isn't violent free there is some definite violence involved but in comparison to other films it seems dare I say minimal or practical.The references to Hitchcock's Psycho are refreshingly flattering rather than annoying. In Disturbia a recent loose remake of Hitchcock's Rear Window the similarities become annoying and the film loses its intrigue. In Vacancy the nods to Psycho are very slight. The Pinewood Motel itself is the most obvious example which like the Bates Motel is in serious need of redecorating. The beginning credits also throw back to Psycho with its vertical bars violently moving around to forceful string instruments. There are similar references to Halloween as well but the one thing the film lacks is the characters' emotional dilemma and their feelings of guilt involved in their situation. In Psycho it is Marion's Janet Leigh moral dilemma over stealing the money and in Halloween it is Laurie's Jamie Lee Curtis feelings of social inequity. Amy and David do not share this external baggagetheir troubled relationship is seemingly repaired through this trial that they are put through and not manifested by a killer such as Michael Myers or Norman Bates. There is no name given to whoever pursues them and there is no correlation that can be drawn between the characters and their tormentors. All in all Vacancy hits a few high points and is a smart enough film to stay clear of areas where previous horror movies have failed horrible twist endings such as in Identity. Vacancy has a decent build of suspense the exclusion of gratuitous violence helps and the characters are more likable than those of the average horror movie. The letdown is that the film doesn't take any substantial risks. It follows a very linear path with no deviations and stays almost exclusively at the motel. It is a film that will entertain but won't allow for too much out of the box thinking.".

	schema:reviewBody "If we learn anything about David Luke Wilson and Amy Fox Kate Beckinsale the heroes of Vacancy it is that they have obviously never watched a horror movie in their lives. If they had they would have known better than to check into the Pinewood Motel and we would be left without a movie. The obvious signs are numerous and ominous. There's the sound of a woman's bloodcurdling screams coming from behind the front desk when they check in there's the mousy and immediately suspicious man running the front desk Frank Whaley who makes Norman Bates look like a welladjusted model employee and there's the overall creepy vibe that the entire building itself gives off. It's not until they discover the gruesome snuff films in their motel room and the masked madmen start chasing them down that the two finally start fearing for their lives. All the audience can do by that point is sit back and silently say told you so to the characters.When we first meet the unlucky couple they are a constantly feuding husband and wife who are taking an illadvised road trip together as kind of a last memory of their relationship before the divorce papers become final. Tensions are high and the fact that their car breaks down in the middle of nowhere does not exactly help matters. This leads them to the Motel from Hell where they ignore the previously mentioned signs of trouble and check into a scuzzy room where roaches scurry about and mysterious stains cover the bed sheets. They quickly catch on that there's much more to worry about when David discovers some videotapes of what appears to be former guests in the same room they're staying in being brutally beaten and murdered by masked men. Discovering that they are being videotaped at all times by numerous hidden cameras in the room the couple try to escape but find the outside area of the motel being patrolled by those mysterious men on the video who refuse to let them leave. It turns out this entire building is a trap set by some very deranged individuals who murder any guest unfortunate enough to check in and videotape the results for their own twisted amusement.With a running time that barely manages to hit 80 minutes Vacancy is tightly edited and tightly paced. Not a second is wasted as the movie dives headfirst into its genuinely creepy premise. There are a number of scenes that are bound the raise the tension of all but the most jaded of horror buffs. The brief glimpses that we see of the crudely made murder videos are terrifying without being exploitive as the movie is wise not to linger too long on the images. The tension is built up even more when creepy and mysterious stuff starts happening. There's a very loud banging on the door of the motel room and even on the walls from the room next door. The power starts flickering on and off at random and it's obvious that someone or something is messing with them. It's when the mysterious men start popping up and chasing our heroes that the movie stops being frightening and intriguing and simply turns into a generic slasher film. Albeit a slasher film with better production and acting values than the norm. The men lurk about in the dark just outside the motel room pop up in front of windows suddenly and really don't do a whole heck of a lot. It's a bit of a let down after such a generally creepy set up.Filmmaker Nimrod Antal has a strong look and an obvious eye for creeping out his audience but he seems to run out of ideas once his characters start running away. That doesn't mean he doesn't do what he can with the material. He makes the most of his limited setting managing to find ways to avoid making the movie come across as being repetitive. He stages some sequences in a large variety of places around the motel as well as a complex series of tunnels underneath the building that the villains use to get around. He is further aided by a game cast that help lift the material up a little bit from the Bgrade junk it obviously is. Mainly known for his comedic work Luke Wilson makes for a pretty decent everyman in the male lead. He seems genuinely unnerved as the realization of just how bad the situation is slowly dawns on him. As his wife Kate Beckinsale is given slightly less to do until the final 10 minutes or so when she is forced to take control and fight for both of their survival. Until then she mostly switches back and forth from being bitchy and irritable to being weepy and fearful. As the head of the whole shady motel operation Frank Whaley is appropriately slimy but much like the other villains he is given very little to do once his role in the plot is revealed.Vacancy has no notions of being anything but what it is  a somewhat enjoyable little piece of horror escapism that hits some good notes but is far too slight and forgettable to leave much of an impression. It's not bad but it is disappointing after a fairly strong opening half hour that hints at much more. The movie is brisk and wellmade at the very least. Still I can't get over the notion that perhaps the film does it's job a bit too well at setting up an ominous atmosphere at the motel. I don't think anyone would be able to set foot there without expecting murderous masked madmen lurking about somewhere nearby. If you're trying to lure people into a death trap I would suggest maybe using a somewhat more cheerful facade. Might attract more business. Couldn't hurt is all I'm saying.".

It's not bad but it is disappointing after a fairly strong opening half hour that hints at much more. The movie is brisk and wellmade at the very least. Still I can't get over the notion that perhaps the film does it's job a bit too well at setting up an ominous atmosphere at the motel. I don't think anyone would be able to set foot there without expecting murderous masked madmen lurking about somewhere nearby. If you're trying to lure people into a death trap I would suggest maybe using a somewhat more cheerful facade. Might attract more business. Couldn't hurt is all I'm saying.";

There isn't any sugar coating no senseless nudity just a claustrophobic atmosphere and tense build up that will have you on the edge of your seat anxious to see what will happen next. It's the way a movie should be done and makes for a satisfying late fright night.A thrilling horror shocker that follows a quarreling married couple David and Amy Fox Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsale that end up breaking down in the middle of nowhere and have to walk a few miles to a gas stationmotel. The strange and creepy manager gives them the honeymoon suite. The room is of course the worst motel room you will ever see cockroaches no TV channels come in etc. With nothing to do David begins watching the videotapessnuff films in the room. They both begin to discover that the films are real and were filmed in their room. They find themselves in a life or death situation and try everything possible to survive the night. If you liked the trailer and the synopsis or any of the actors you will definitely find that you like this movie. When I first saw a trailer for the movie I thought it looked good but was a little hesitant because of the way that horror movies are made today gore and bore. This film has a very good plot and is solid in structure. Even though you do not get the full back story of the characters you get their painful story through the excellent writing. In the beginning you don't quite get why they fight or seem to hate each other but it doesn't take long to understand maybe 15 minutes counting the beginning montage of credits. I was literally on the edge of my seat throughout almost the entire film and found not one dull moment. Suspense and tension are the real deal in this movie and it is done incredibly well. Lots of excellent camera angles and authentic startling sequences add to the tense nature of the film. The characters seem very genuine and real the relationship between the main two characters is portrayed extremely well. Wilson and Beckinsale come off as a real couple with a history. Their acting is extremely believable and the writing of the characters is done extremely well. Another great thing is that they aren't your typical brainless genre characters who get naked and drop to the floor when the killer approaches they are much more real. They do everything that you expect that you would do if you were in their situation. They make good decisions which make them much more realistic winning sympathy rather easily. There are heartpumping fight sequences which were well executed and will make you cross your fingers for Beckinsale and Wilson. There are also tender moments that will add to your root for them. By the end you will want them to stick it to that manager for everything he's done and for a reconciliation between the two main characters. I enjoyed it ten fold but you'll have to watch it to see whether they make it in the end. Overall Vacancy is an original psychological thriller that is heavy on suspense while not so heavy on bloodshed.The movie does contain a far amount of vulgar language. I would recommend this movie. Your missing out if you don't see it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Vacancy has Alfred Hitchcock's finger prints smeared all over it in fact at several times especially the quite nifty looking opening credits seems a lot like a homage to the great horror maestro himself. Its true that even many years after Hitchcok finished making movies that his movie still stay in memory for longer than most of the recent Hollywood horror that has arrived. The Birds and Psycho are far more memorable than the House of Wax remake or The Reaping. Hitchcock's movies worked because he had great characterisation and also a great sense of atmosphere you could sit and watch a Hitchcock movie and be terrified for half an hour before anything scary actually happens. The sense of foreboding and incredibly skilfully done atmosphere did that to an audience. Nowadays we get cheap jump out of your seat scares and torture scenes designed to sicken. Initially my thoughts towards seeing Vacancy were not great the trailer looked alright but my guess was it would just be another lame modern slasher flick. So what a great surprise to say that Vacancy is a good little movie that actually has some genuine scares in it. The movie isn't gory nor is it jumpy the movie is unsettling and creepy. Now this is what a true horror movie should do in my eyes if a movie can unsettle without resorting to jump scares then it is a success. Vacncay pulls this off well it pulls this off for a majority of the time. The movie is an absolute success until the ending at the ending it seems to flounder a bit and leaves a bitter taste in the mouth. But everything up until the ending is a joy to watch.What surprised me most about Vacancy has to be the actual acting. When I saw the trailer and saw that Kate Beckinsale and Luke Wilson were the leading couple I nearly burst out laughing. For starters Luke Wilson is a comedy man he's designed to make funny movies. Well when I say funny movies I mean if he has the right material as just recently I've found him as unfunny as can be. Kate Beckinsale just doesn't seem the type to be in a horror movie. But its this bizarre casting that pays off so well. Luke Wilson really proves himself in this movie to the extent I want him to focus more on a serious acting career he seems to be more at home here than he has in years with his comedy movies. Kate Beckinsale also proves herself admirably. The pair are believable and you actually start to care for them. Wishing that they will escape the nightmare hoping that they find a way out. Their performances are so much different from the usual stupid teenagers we see in horror movies today its refreshing to see adults in this horrific situation. The villains of the movie are also quite menacing for the majority of the time the hotel manager played by Frank Whaley is a good character. He's not on screen too often but he does play a creepy little man very well.So what of the scares then? Well as I've said the movie is at times pretty scary. Not for the first twenty minutes mind you that is dedicated for set up and too increase the atmosphere. Those scenes work very well and once again its refreshing to see genuine character development in a horror movie made better by the fact the two leads are great. However the minute the couple enter the hotel room the focus shifts. Bangings on the wall and doors begin the phone rings with nobody on the other end. From that point onwards the movie gets terrifying the bangings on the wall really starts to creep you out at one point. Once the big bad secret about the motel is discovered after watching some tapes and the lights suddenly go out. The movie succeeds in terrifying. After the lights go out I guarantee you will be sitting on the edge of your seats. The movie does a couple of jump scares here and there but it focuses mainly on the unseen terror. The minute the bangings stopped you aren't relieved you're even more terrified because then you don't know what the people are up to. Its this sense of terror that makes the movie worthy of a recommendation. Its nice to see a horror movie try scaring and unsettling the audience once in a while. Its nothing a hardcore horror fan can't handle but it definitely will unsettle the general population of people.As I've said the movie isn't perfect. The ending being the major setback of the movie. After the brilliant set up and the scary middle section the ending seems to run out of steam. In fact it seemed like the writers wasn't sure what to do anymore and did a few obvious things and quickly ended the movie. It feels rushes and unlike the rest of the movie unskillfully made. Its the ending that fails in making this a complete homage to Hitchcock Hitchcock could deliver an ending this movie doesn't really get an ending. The ending is enough to leave you satisfied but in a movie that exceeds all expectations you expect more from the ending.Vacancy is a good old fashioned horrorthriller. Its only let down by its pretty disappointing ending. The run time is pretty short making the experience short and sharp enough to pack a real punch. Its really worth checking out just for the brilliant set up and middle section. But the ending really does make the movie suffer a little bit. Still this is definitely a good horror movie and more horror movies made in this style would be a welcome relief.".

	schema:reviewBody "Vacancy is a suspenseful horror shocker that follows a young disputing couple on their way home from an anniversary party Amy and David Fox Kate Beckinsale and Luke Wilson who have just recently lost a child and are about to enter a divorce. The bickering couple end up stranded outside a small service station in the middle of nowhere and decide to to check into the Pinewood motel a cheap little place for them to spend the night until they can get help the next morning. The quirky desk clerk gives them their room and they find it to be a complete dump. But their dingy motel room is the least of their problems when they find videotapes of homemade snuff movies where previous guests were filmed as they were brutally murdered. With a team of masked killers surrounding the entire motel and every area under surveillance Amy and David find themselves in a lifeordeath struggle as they try and survive through the night.If the plot summary for this movie sounds like something that interests you you will more than likely enjoy this suspenseful horror flick. I went into Vacancy with pretty average expectations  I wasn't that wild about this movie when I'd first heard about it but it sounded interesting enough so I decided to give it a try and I'm glad I did. Unlike the vast majority of the horror junk that gets released lately this film actually boasts an original and solidlyconstructed premise. Take some elements from Hitchock's Psycho was it just me or were those opening credits played over with the Bernard Herrmanlike score a direct reference to Hitchcock? throw in some aspects from the Saw series and tie things together in a tense little package and you get Vacancy. I was literally on the edge of my seat throughout almost the entire film and found not one dull moment. Suspense and tension are the real kickers in this movie and it is done very well. Lots of moody camera angles and some genuinely frightening sequences take the underground cave scenes for example add to the tense nature.Our lead performers are Beckinsale and Wilson both of whom turn in some great performances. Wilson plays the husband hero and Beckinsale is the damsel in distressgone fighting machine and both capture this effectively. Their acting is believable and I think that the writing has something to do with it as well because their characters are written really well. They're not your typical genre morons who drop to the floor when the killer approaches they are much more real. They make good decisions and the right moves which makes them much more credible and realistic winning over the audiences sympathy rather easily. There were some heartpumping fight sequences as well between the heroes and the villains which were well executed and had you rooting for Beckinsale and Wilson. The ending was a little uneven I have to admit but compared to the tense hour and twentyfive minutes before it it doesn't come close to bringing the movie down.Overall Vacancy is an original horror flick that is heavy on suspense while not so heavy on bloodshed. The claustrophobic atmosphere and the tense build up in this movie is it's real charm and it will have you on the edge of your seat anxious to see what will happen next. It's the way a thriller should be done and makes for an enjoyable latenight fright fest. Exceeded my expectations and went beyond. 910.".

	schema:headline " Not for the casual vacancy still a OK movie";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie wasn't the Bates Motel of horror movies but more like the cheap motel of horror. It's cheaply made but what they do with the resources they had is interesting. The opening credits use a very Saul Bass style. They're being creative with fonts and titles in the opening. The music was surprisingly catchy as well. The banging at the beginning was good that created an atmosphere of tension. A vacationing couple David Luke Wilson and Amy Fox Kate Beckinsale check in a nearby motel when their car breaks down. This motel is run by a weird little night manager Mason Frank Whaley and the couple take the honeymoon suite. In their room looking for entertainment for the evening the pair finds a VCR tape. They put it on their television and find it to be a lowbudget slasher film. After watching for a while they come upon realizing that all of the films seem to have been shot in the very same room they currently occupy. David and Amy suddenly become the stars of a real life horror snuff film. They realize they must escape or they will become the next victims. The filmmakers sketch in enough of David and Amy's back story for us to want them to survive. This thriller is scripted by Mark L. Smith and directed by Nimrd Antal. Nimrod use hidden cameras to track their every move and takes the cue from Hitchcock opting for suspense over graphic violence and torture. Vacancy might not get Mr. Hitchcock smiling from above. But he won't be spinning in his grave either. The film has a pure catandmouse chase. The movie squeezes the maximum in suspense out of one location as all the scenes are film just there. It runs through every permutation of the motelhell concept. The film has a nice sense of claustrophobia particularly when the couple discovers a labyrinth of dirt tunnels under the motel. Luke Wilson doesn't have time to indulge in acting when surviving. The roles of both can be judge by the amounts of yelling and running not only between them and the killer but with each other. The audience can really felt the distance between the 2 main characters in the beginning. Other than that the female character Kate plays is bitchy and Luke's performance was boring and wooden. I'm all for female empowerment but I found Kate Beckinsale's survivor transformation a little hard to believe. Up until very late in the film and after she stops being a jerk she's usually whimpering in a corner. In fact she doesn't seem to be able to do anything but follow her husband around. And yes I understand that it's all about juxtaposition if she wasn't fragile at first her later transformation wouldn't be as evident later. Still survival instincts can only go so far. Whaley creates a memorable crackerbarrel crazy man that borderlines modes his role on Dennis Weaver's jittery night clerk in the Orson Welles classic Touch of Evil . The film use subtle fright tactics sound effects over gallons of blood a shard of glass over a chainsaw which gives it props but Vacancy suffers from too many horror flick clichs using killers in masks cellphones that are conveniently out of range etc. etc. There is still enough violence to warrant its R rating. Without spoiling the endingcheck out the film to see how it ends. Check in the motel indeed.".

I mean I was like ok this is the part where they find the underground hole the killers used to get to their room it was that predictable. While I would admit that it was a good thriller the trailer just ruined the movie for me. Not to mention that the ending was predictable and just ended too quickly and was just so offhand.Amy and David are coming back from a party they are having a troubled marriage from a tragedy involving their son. But when the car breaks down they pull into a garage and a man helps them but the car breaks down again they head back to the garage to learn that the guy is gone and they have to stay in a cheap and filthy motel. But things quickly get scary when David finds a tape that contains people being brutally murdered in their hotel room! Huge noises happen and all of a sudden the killers are after them! They have to live a night of horror and try to survive what could happen to them! Vacancy is a great thriller I will always admit it was scary at times but like I said the trailer just reveled too much and I was a little disappointed but over all I would recommend it for a scary night. But jus to warn you there are some pretty stupid people in this movie like the way the characters acted and responded to things it makes you wonder if they should have been killed. P LOL but still go ahead and have fun and a word to the trailer editor I advise please don't reveal the best parts of the movie in your next trailer because otherwise you might just blow an entire movie! 610".

I mean I was like ok this is the part where they find the underground hole the killers used to get to their room it was that predictable. While I would admit that it was a good thriller the trailer just ruined the movie for me. Not to mention that the ending was predictable and just ended too quickly and was just so offhand.Amy and David are coming back from a party they are having a troubled marriage from a tragedy involving their son. But when the car breaks down they pull into a garage and a man helps them but the car breaks down again they head back to the garage to learn that the guy is gone and they have to stay in a cheap and filthy motel. But things quickly get scary when David finds a tape that contains people being brutally murdered in their hotel room! Huge noises happen and all of a sudden the killers are after them! They have to live a night of horror and try to survive what could happen to them! Vacancy is a great thriller I will always admit it was scary at times but like I said the trailer just reveled too much and I was a little disappointed but over all I would recommend it for a scary night. But jus to warn you there are some pretty stupid people in this movie like the way the characters acted and responded to things it makes you wonder if they should have been killed. P LOL but still go ahead and have fun and a word to the trailer editor I advise please don't reveal the best parts of the movie in your next trailer because otherwise you might just blow an entire movie! 610";

That is pretty much the premise for Vacancy a modest HorrorThriller starring Kate Beckinsale and surprisingly funny man briefly turning serious actor Luke Wilson.What I can say about this film is fans of a more traditional thriller will like this more than the last movie I reviewed. Disturbia as it does not play to a younger audience and does not date itself with trite dialog and wacky teenage humor. The sad thing is this could have been a very solid film however thanks to some missed opportunities and a very hohum ending this plays out like a by the numbers middle of the road thriller.Don't get me wrong it has its moments but nothing we haven't seen already done before and in other cases better. I cannot recommend a full price admission to this one only a matine or even a rental. Again its not a bad movie just nothing that you will be singing its praises over several years from now.With a modest story and enough going on to keep you interested I give Vacancy the standard 510Average. With a more original ending and some additional back story on the killers this would have been an above average Thriller however as is this is an average Thriller that will entertain fans to a point but you will more than likely feel like something is missing here.".

	schema:reviewBody "What a cheesy unbelievable waste of 85 minutes. After watching Underworld seeing Kate's ZoloftProzac addicted girlie girl character was more painful and disappointing than the plot and ending of the movie. Luke Wilson's character was no better doing stupid things like cutting himself while breaking a mirror to make a weapon that he never uses and generally being as effective as a rat in a maze running around in circles. And what is up with this sideplot of the dead son that drives the couple to a divorce that they're driving home to finalize? It takes the threat of death for Luke to tell Kate that it wasn't her fault and he loves her? Of all the ridiculous scenes... And the fact that he remains alive hours after being stabbed multiple times pushed suspended disbelief to its limits as did the scene where the second 911 operator says Duh didn't we send a deputy out there already? Must be the Keystone cops that don't send help out when their deputy doesn't check in after responding to a 911 call. As satisfying as it was seeing Kate finally grow a backbone and a will to live and manage to kill all her sadistic assailants this transformation from her former passiveaggressive whimpering Prozacpopping self just wasn't believable either. The movie would have been much better if it stuck to a Texas Chainsaw Massacre The Beginning mentality where no matter what the protagonists did they were screwed... and I have to say that the protagonists in Texas Chainsaw Massacre The Beginning were much more likable than Kate and Luke. At least if the movie pushed it all the way and Luke was really dead and Kate was blown away even though she managed to take out a couple of the guys it maybe would have been more believable and would have retained more of its shock value. Aside from all of the above the gratuitous extended snuff film footage in the Special Features section is yet another reason to stay away from this one.".

It has a goal and a mission and it doesn't need a bunch of college kids looking to get wasted to move the plot along. Wilson and Beckinsale do really well with their roles as does Frank Whaley Mason. I guess you could compare this to a modernized Psycho while certainly not a remake I got similar vibes when I saw Psycho a few months ago. Vacancy had a lot of guts to be made right in the middle of the Torture Porn Era of horror movies but like Disturbia it manages to succeed with it's story characters and simple plot.".

It's quite a straightforward movie and it sticks to the main story and the end credits will be rolling after a crisp 80 minutes. Unlike most Hollywood films of the genre 'Vacancy' does not overuse twists like after suffering dozens of fatal stab wounds the killer with its last breath suddenly jumps to life for one last attempt to kill the heroheroine that tend to ruin the entire popcorn experience these twists have become so frequent that they tend to be unintentionally funny. Sure 'Vacancy' is not without its share of flaws. There are plot holes like why did the policeman drive alone to the motel after receiving the emergency call? The dialogue is nothing great and typically there is a lot of swearing. The characters David and Amy are quite well written and the viewer does sympathize for them. I liked the subplot about the trauma of the accidental death of their child destroying their marriage. The villains are caricatured. The viewer gets no background info on them and they appear as mere sadistic killers enjoying making snuff movies. Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsale are brilliant. They do bring a certain amount of depth that rises above the usual kind of performances you see in such films. 'No Vacancy' is a typical slasherish thriller that is well edited and well acted by the two leads and those who enjoy this genre may like this picture.".

However if you are looking for an intelligent and complex thriller then keep driving down the highway. And don't be afraid to run over any raccoons or you may find yourself in the same predicament as Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsale.Those two play a young couple who find themselves with a broken down vehicle and nowhere else to go but a rundown motel just off a lonely stretch of highway. I'll skip their personal circumstances dealing with the state of their marriage and child since they don't really add much to the story. After renting a room from the sleazy desk clerk Frank Whaley the two get ready to settle down for the rest of the night. The room is filthy and it appears nobody else is staying in the other rooms. Almost from the getgo someone starts loudly banging on both the exterior door and the door to the adjoining room. This seems like merely a prank but then Wilson discovers some VHS tapes near the TV that show previous occupants of the same room being killed by sadists. From this point on Wilson and Beckinsale are on the run from masked killers attempting to keep them prisoner and eventually kill them.This film has plenty of moments that will make you jump. There is no question about that. The loud door knocking is very effective and the masked killers are effectively creepy as well. As the film nears its abrupt end however there are a few moments that just make no sense at all. First off it seems to be taking the killers forever to get inside that room and finish the young couple off. Why wait until nearly daybreak? The longer you wait the better the chance that the victims might escape. And when a lawman is finally summoned to the motel he is quickly disposed of. Wouldn't the sheriff's dept have sent someone to check on this man after he failed to return or report back in to headquarters? And would these killers be so incompetent as to allow Wilson to lie in one place for what appears to be hours and not make sure he's actually dead? Once the sun came up wouldn't they have tried to remove his body from virtually plain sight from anyone who might be stopping at the motel or gas station????? The film ends quite abruptly as the killers are disposed of in somewhat routine ways. Sure this film will frighten you in places but it really could have been much better. Gore lovers will be disappointed too. See it if want to but don't expect a classic. 5 of 10 stars.The Hound.".

Following hot on the heels of last weeks number one box office champ  Disturbia Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsale lead a cast of about seven  in the taunt and effective thriller Vacancy.  Vacancy is a tight well paced thrill ride about two separating  spouses Dan and Amy Wilson and Beckinsale that have the misfortune  of ending up at a remote motel due to car troubles. The isolated room  for rent hole in the wall looks like a 1972 Trading Spaces project gone  awry and the disgusting carpet and wallpaper is only slightly  overshadowed by the cockroaches the size of a Chernobyl chicken that  scatter under the carpet once the lights are turned on.  Immediately Dan and Amy feel uncomfortable as Paris Hilton at a  Spelling Bee but with the morning only a few hours away and the car  left abandoned on the side of the road about a mile away they decide  to grin and bare it until daylight gives them the luxury of finding  their way back.  Good plan? Perhaps. But this is Motel Hell 2007 and when Dan utilizes  the room VCR in hopes of entertaining himself with porn he is quickly  aghast with fear as video tape after video tape reveals snuff films of  people suffering painful demises at the hands of intruders that seem to  be having as much fun as Hannibal Lecter did when skinning his guard's  face in Silence of the Lambs. At first the tapes are looked at with  almost a morbid curiosity but that soon turns to terror when the  unsuspecting couple decipher that the killings took place in the very  room to which they are occupying. Think of the scene in 1979's When A  Stranger Calls when she realizes the calls are coming from the same  house and you might have a sense as to the immediate adrenaline at  follows this revelation.  So for the next 70 or so minutes Dan and Amy will try and escape from  the encroaching knife wielding psychos while utilizing horror smarts  and secret passages under the hotel flooring to survive the night.  Hmmm where is a peaceful Hostel when you need one wink wink nod nod.  Vacancy is one of those films that I wasn't expecting to enjoy that  ended up being a fun catandmouse game where two characters are smart  enough to know what they are up against and what actions are in their  best interests to survive. Like Disturbia and with last years Red Eye  the screenwriters for Vacancy seem to appreciate that average folks  don't always have to be outweaponed AND outsmarted when trying to  escape the pointy end of a blade. Dan and Amy do enough things right to  keep themselves alive for the night and in turn the audience plays  right along without the usual shaking of the head in disbelief that  someone would be stupid enough to play into the hands of their killer.  If you are looking for gore a la Hostel Vacancy will be a  disappointment. The scares are primarily in the form of the chase or  some loud door banging that shook my popcorn to the floor. There are  scenes with plenty of the red stuff but for the most part the horror  comes in imagining the unimaginable while rooting for the underdog.  But for those who liked Disturbia Vacancy has all the elements of the  genre and more to provide you with value for the admission ticket. The  acting is pretty good yes I said it Luke Wilson does an admirable  job in a noncomedic role and the direction under a guy by the name of  Nimrod is  for the most part  lean and without many wasted shots.  If I had a complaint about Vacancy it would be of the small potholes  the film falls into by following the horrorthriller playbook. When it  is revealed that Dan and Amy are separating after the death of their  child a story that is never really played out and completely  unimportant to the overall plot I rolled my eyes wondering how such a  good film could fall into such a stereotypical misstep. So too was the  flashlight that needed the horror standard knock with the other hand a  few times to keep the torch lit Hmmm ain't seen that before.  But when the sum of all the body parts are collected together Vacancy  is a better than average film that will be one of those horror films  that when showed on TBS in a continuous loop during a hot summer  evening you will watch over and over again enjoying each subwoofer  induced bang on the wooden motel door.".

The plot i have to say was well thought out but on the other hand at times the movie it self was near ludicrous. I was hoping that you would see a great deal of lead up to the actual horror scenes if you will but no. All we got was that a married couple that were seeking a divorce and had some how lost their son. Instead of a back ground we get nearly the entire 80 minutes which by the way is absurd for a movie of Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsale trying to escape the 2 masked psychos who have absolutely terminated dozens of people as seen in the videos. Unresonable??? Yes. We all know that if a cop goes out after a mysterious call about people trying to kill someone they most likely wouldn't go alone. So they were short staffed. Well if an officer doesn't respond after hours the word backup has to creep into your mind. Something i don't even want to touch on but i will is Luke Wilson is dead. plain and simple. Are they trying to tell me these vicious killing machines decided to only stab the person that put up the biggest fight once. Highly doubtful. Tell you what i was sitting by some kids who looked like they were about 8 in the movie theaters. They probably loved it Me I guess I'm just not that gullible.".

Any action fan that thinks Matrixstyle slow motion bullets are the endall beall of effects should check bulletride effect at the end of this film. And to its amazing credit this film was made without the help of Hollywood digital effects. I haven't even mentioned CHOW YUNFAT. He is AWESOME in this film. The man is as badass as Mel Gibson any day. Full Contact is based on the same book as PayBack. Let me tell you this film runs ring around payback in areas of acting directing violence and coolness.

	schema:reviewBody "Ringo Lam's characters in Full Contact come in three flavors bad guys with values bad guys without values and victims. The first category is led by antihero Godfrey Jeff or Gou Fei in other translations one of Chow Yunfat's most adversarial characters not counting his Emperor role in Curse of the Golden Flower who is a thief with a conscience who can deftly ride a motorcycle and wield his balisong knife. He is set to marry Mona whose creative dancing career apparently does not make enough money. Look for a later dance scene resembling something out of Encino Man. Their friend Sam Anthony Wong Exiled had to borrow money from a loan shark in Thailand named Hung to help pay for her Mother's burial the translation states this but I think it meant internment costs. Since he cannot pay back he is in deep trouble until Godfrey helps him out. This causes Hung to put out a hit on him.Sam has a job coming up that could make him and his friends a lot of money. It is with his cousin the overlyflamboyant homicidal homosexual Judge Simon Yam PTU and his two lackeys the muscular Psycho Frankie Chan who has a penchant for big guns and loose women and his girlfriend the nymph Virgin Bonnie Fu. This job involves busting an ammo truck worth millions of dollars. However unbeknownst to Sam at the time they will get paid by Hung to take care of Godfrey and they will ultimately kill other pal Chung. In the meantime Mona has to take her Mom's ashes to Hong Kong. While Godfrey promises to marry her when she gets back we all know that any promise before a big job will not be a promise kept. Those who see this will wonder why Godfrey takes this job when their initial meeting does not go well.The operation goes almost exactly as planned for Judge. However it is not as easy as he would have liked. While he finds Godfrey attractive he still has to kill him. This leads to an explosive showdown that leaves Godfrey with a missing thumb and trigger finger on his right hand an innocent family dead and its daughter severely burnt. Sam capitulates in allowing this because he is a sniveling coward his 180 degree personality change in the film is too unrealistic even though Anthony Wong still did a good performance with this character and even shoots his friend and leaves him for dead. Why Judge doesn't check on the death of Godfrey I do not know but it allows him to live take a cute dog time to heal and time to learn to shoot with his other hand so he can exact revenge. His monomania allows time for Sam to sneak in on his girlfriend while everyone else thinks he is pushing up daises.Lam's directorial style is grittier than John Woo's operatic mode of direction but the spirit of Woo is in this film. He refers to Woo in a few scenes from the briefcase ending analogous to The Killer to Chow Yunfat spitting out his cigar before killing like Tequila spitting out his toothpick in HardBoiled. While the action is not as hyperbolic as Woo's his characters are more exaggerated. Godfrey becomes a vessel for brotherhood yi in his quest for vengeance with his own code of conduct. He is not only taking revenge for a lost friend he is taking revenge for a family wrongly slaughtered and a disfigured daughter. This film feels like a mixture of John Woo and Chang Cheh  it fits well in the subgenre of heroic bloodshed. With a plot that could have been taken out of an oldschool martial arts film what better place for Godfrey to get over his injuries then in a monastery with the help of a monk.The onedimensional characters are one of the biggest weaknesses with this film. When Judge states one sentence late in the film on why he acts the way he does it comes a little late  though Simon Yam's performance is a high point in this film. Virgin and Psycho are completely overthetop as well but they do not have the finesse that Judge has. But in their excess with Psycho's musclebound dumbbell and Virgin's oversexed vixen there is a camp factor that I found enhanced the emotions and nihilistic content of this film. The triangle relationship between Sam Mona and Godfrey annoyed me a bit but it did keep in line with the protagonist's revenge motif.Where this movie excels is the gunplay scenes fight action scenes choreographed by longtime Shaw Brother's actoraction director Lau Karwing and the excellent direction of Ringo Lam. He has a solid aesthetics in putting together scenes and creates a brute force style of action. The scene most mentioned from this film is club shootout between Godfrey and Judge. It sublimely employs the use of the bullet POV. There are also a couple of pyrotechnic scenes that are also quite extraordinary in explosive carnage and were a good reason for the overinflated budget.This movie was not viewed as a success in Hong Kong. It was not a flop though since it made almost 17m HK dollars however since it cost over 23 million HK dollars it was a loss for Golden Princess. It has a better reputation here in the United States and along with City on Fire is it his most popular. I highly recommend it to viewers who are interested in action cinema. If you take a character first approach to film then you can probably avoid it. But for those who have gone this far in the review I figure you either have seen this movie or are interested in seeing this anyways. With great lines like wash your butt and wait for me I know you will like it.".

Having any one of these actors in a film automatically makes the movie better  in Full Contact we get all three. Chow Yun Fat is in full antihero mode and is the most sympathetic character in this revenge flick. Anthony Wong is his buddy who gets CYF to rescue him from a loan shark which escalates to more trouble with Wong betraying him also. Simon Yam is Wong 's cousin and a ruthless and sleazy gangster . He also is gay and is attracted to CYF. CYF is betrayed and left for dead and an innocent family is killed and a young girl is badly burned and disfigured as well. Anthony Wong steals CYF 's woman and continues to work with his cousin 's gang. CYF then resurfaces to get even and bring street justice . Full Contact is a unique take on the heroic bloodshed genre brought to life with HK's A list cast and director . Classic.".

XIA DAO GAO FEI is one of the finest action films ever to embrace audiences of any and all interests.  It tells a compelling story of friendship turning into betrayal and reprisal growing into a motivation for justice. Director Ringo Lam has done a fine job with one of his best masterpieces and it is enhanced by better than average performances particularly from Chow and Wong.  Chow has fun as a vigorous hero who turns the tables just when everyone he knew has practically became his nemesis. Anthony Wong has a sympathetic supporting role as an old friend who may very well switch allegiances with a foul enemy.  The villains are conniving and appropriately nasty.  Simon Yam is excellent as an essentially slimy villain.  His cunning attitude his sickminded perverse personality and tasteless vulgarity make him a repugnant yet compelling bad guy.  Bonnie Fu has a debonair appeal.   Her beauty is potent enough to ignite an endless array of fireworks.  The strong performances establish substantiation in designing the main characters.The action in FULL CONTACT is of course at its breathtaking pace with absolute quality and the film offers a surreal environment that is often rare in pro forma American made action movies.   There are plenty of chances to cheer on for the good guy but the film has carefully mounted tension which will grip your interests.  The bullet cam itself has to be seen to be believed.FULL CONTACT is a rare movie and I was lucky to stumble across a copy of this film at a local store in New York City's Chinatown.

FULL CONTACT is one fashionably violent movie in the tradition of film noir.Ringo Lam is a virtuoso at filmmaking who exhibits   exceptional direction slam bang camerawork and majestic editing.  He also has a proud technique of drawing audiences into the story.  This movie continues to keep people amazed due to its technical competence and its poignant elegance.

He and his friend Sam Wong get mixed up with a gang of three unhinged criminals the flamboyant and amoral Judge Yam his mohawked meathead sidekick Dino Frankie Chan and Virgin Fu the overheated female member of the group. While Jeff is after the money a potential heist might bring so he can help Sam with his gambling debts not to mention to improve his own life and the life of his girlfriend Mona Bridgewater things naturally get out of hand and Judge gets very close to killing Jeff but Jeff narrowly escapes. Jeff then spends his time in Thailand training to get back into fighting shape so he can take on Judge and his buddies once and for all. And the final showdown will be an epic one for the ages. So get ready because this is going to be some FULL CONTACT revenge! In our estimation Full Contact is among the finest action product  or any product  produced in the fertile 90's in Hong Kong. It's a crown jewel of the genre a shining example of what action could be and should be. It's just an awesome movie directed with energy and verve to spare that's gigantically entertaining and holds up to multiple viewings easily. From the opening guitar lick forward you know you're in for something special.Chow YunFat has never been better. As Jeff the seemingly indestructible bouncer who coasts along on his motorcycle while wearing sunglasses and smoking a cigarette while shooting baddies with two guns he defines the word cool. This is the role he should be known for. Every great action movie needs a superevil baddie and Simon Yam as Judge is perfect. He's deceptively fey one minute and deadly the next. His charisma is of a completely different sort than Jeff's and the contrast is noticeable and they make perfect rivals.Adding to the excellence of this movie are the timehonored training sequences and disco scenes. The song used The World Has Gone Insane by Alan Tam perfectly captures the spirit of not just the movie but the time in which it was produced. As do the songs by Extreme. Full Contact is also Ringo Lam at his best. He fashioned a powerful intense and fastpaced ride of a movie that's directed slickly and confidently. It's filled with the violence and stunts we've come to know and love but somehow this movie is on a higher level than most. There's even subtle themes to look out for such as Jeff getting shot in the middle of his hands and bleeding possibly a reference to the stigmata of Jesus? Regardless Full Contact delivers the goods in spades and at this point in time is in a much imitated never equaled sort of situation.".

So while visiting a new video story in my area low and behold there was a copy of it sitting there on the shelf calling to me.  After watching it the first aspect of the film that struck me were the outrageous villains.  There were three of them a homosexual magician who could make guns appear out of nowhere an overthetop rock star looking guy that reminded me of a prowrestler and a nymphomaniac female companion that........well let's just say she had problems keeping her clothes on.  Chow Yun Fat plays a role fit for Stallone.  It's got that '80s style Cobra look to it.  He's kind of like an outlaw or desperado type who must avenge his near death by the hands of the deadly trio.  If you are a fan of any '80s action movie then you'll love this.  Keep your eyes open for the shootout at the end in the bar with the bullet P.O.V. shots.  Great stuff.  12 stars.".

	schema:reviewBody "Another entry into the cheer for the most likeable bad guy series of Hong Kong action flicks. Full Contact tells the ofttold tale of betrayal and revenge served up as a potent cocktail of Western convention mixed with the trademarked Hong Kong style. When Jeff's Hong Kong superstar Chow Yun Fat in true hardcase form friend Sam Anthony Wong steps on the feet of a local loan shark Jeff comes to his rescue creating a powerful enemy in the vengeful gangster. Seeking to skip town and make good the two hatch a plan to hijack an arms shipment with the help of Sam's flamboyant and malicious cousin Judge a delightfully sleazy Simon Yam and his gang of dysfunctional thugs. What Jeff doesn't know is that he's being doublecrossed by the wild group of brutal killers who plan to bury him as they make their getaway. Judge forces Sam to off his loyal friend Jeff but Sam botches the job leaving Jeff to return for bitter revenge after dealing with an emotionally painful betrayal and a physically challenging rehabilitation. Lam foregoes the melodrama of Hong Kong counterpart John Woo and goes straight for the jugular with unremittingly stark and graphic violence. At the same time the characters retain a certain amount of sympathy. Frequently outrageous and over the top Full Contact is nonetheless a well made film suffering from a fairly weak script. Though comparisons to Woo are inevitable especially because of Chow YunFat in the lead role Lam is a different kind of director and accordingly Full Contact is a different sort of beast. Although it opens with a robbery that rapidly turns into a shoot'emup there's none of the balletic elegant violence that characterizes Woo and his imitators. When the camera lingers over the carnage it's not a lovingly choreographed sweep.  Unlike in Chow's films for Woo for which he is best known in the West there's little that's noble about Chow's character in this one. He's heroic only by comparison to the psychotic gangsters he takes down one by one. Fortunately Chow is up to the challenge of portraying a character of questionable morals in an honorable light and Anthony Wong and Ann Bridgewater respectively playing his best friend and wife are equally topnotch.  Lam's direction is excellent as well. His fine control of the action and pacing keeps the film from peaking too soon and even a bullet'seye view during a climactic shootout in a nightclub works in the movie's favor. The level of violence makes most of what Hollywood produces tame by comparison.".

	onyx:emotionText "Another entry into the cheer for the most likeable bad guy series of Hong Kong action flicks. Full Contact tells the ofttold tale of betrayal and revenge served up as a potent cocktail of Western convention mixed with the trademarked Hong Kong style. When Jeff's Hong Kong superstar Chow Yun Fat in true hardcase form friend Sam Anthony Wong steps on the feet of a local loan shark Jeff comes to his rescue creating a powerful enemy in the vengeful gangster. Seeking to skip town and make good the two hatch a plan to hijack an arms shipment with the help of Sam's flamboyant and malicious cousin Judge a delightfully sleazy Simon Yam and his gang of dysfunctional thugs. What Jeff doesn't know is that he's being doublecrossed by the wild group of brutal killers who plan to bury him as they make their getaway. Judge forces Sam to off his loyal friend Jeff but Sam botches the job leaving Jeff to return for bitter revenge after dealing with an emotionally painful betrayal and a physically challenging rehabilitation. Lam foregoes the melodrama of Hong Kong counterpart John Woo and goes straight for the jugular with unremittingly stark and graphic violence. At the same time the characters retain a certain amount of sympathy. Frequently outrageous and over the top Full Contact is nonetheless a well made film suffering from a fairly weak script. Though comparisons to Woo are inevitable especially because of Chow YunFat in the lead role Lam is a different kind of director and accordingly Full Contact is a different sort of beast. Although it opens with a robbery that rapidly turns into a shoot'emup there's none of the balletic elegant violence that characterizes Woo and his imitators. When the camera lingers over the carnage it's not a lovingly choreographed sweep.  Unlike in Chow's films for Woo for which he is best known in the West there's little that's noble about Chow's character in this one. He's heroic only by comparison to the psychotic gangsters he takes down one by one. Fortunately Chow is up to the challenge of portraying a character of questionable morals in an honorable light and Anthony Wong and Ann Bridgewater respectively playing his best friend and wife are equally topnotch.

Don't get me wrong it's still a very recommendable action flick but it's nothing truly special.The story mostly revolves around backstabbing and revenge. Very simple but very enjoyable stuff. And when you add in a bunch of talented actors some goofy characters and pretty cool shootouts you have yourself an entertaining action flick. But unfortunately it's not all gunblasting mayhem. There is a lot of needless filler that's really plain old boring. Whenever Chow Yun Fat's girl is on screen you're either watching her do some incredibly corny dance routine showing off her polebean body or she's trying to initiate an emotional response with the audience since she's OhSo innocent. Gimme a break. Full Contact relies much too heavily on trying to get you invested into the characters. They did succeed in making you like the heroes and dislike the enemies but hell it's not that tough with such wellknown actors and such offthe wall characters....let's just get on with the action already. Truthfully the one character I cared about most was that little pug.But overall Full Contact does shine pretty bright with it's action. There are some very cool bullet effects some equally as cool cinematography and some nice performances especially by Simon Yam who plays the homosexual bad guy. If you're into Asian action flicks this should be a must see but if you're not into this stuff it's just more of the same.".

It's one of the Hong Kong action films that is more popular here than in Southeast Asia quite possibly because it undercuts all expectations especially with the screen image of Chow Yun Fat. Chow doesn't play his usual suave or debonair type of character. In this film he plays Jeff a bouncer at a nightclub recruited into a heist by a friend. During the heist there is a doublecross and Jeff is left for dead. To a soundtrack of late 80s heavy metal he recuperates and seeks vengeance. It sounds simple enough but the style and acting carry it far above its story. Chow Yun Fat is relentlessly cool in this film playing a guy who will not be stopped at any cost. Anthony Wong is great as usual playing Chow's cowardly friend. But the movie really belongs to Simon Yam who plays Judge a doublecrossing psychopathic homosexual mob boss. He's also quite handy with a knife as several scenes show. This is one of the most entertaining films I have ever seen  a pure rush of energy and an action film executed by a genius of the genre.".

Yes this is straight out of 1940's noir but it all works.A lot has been said about the sex and sexuality switch of Swinton's son but it works perfectly.  One might ask . . . why doesn't she ask her son about the body before she dumps it?  But that would involve TALKING to her son about his sexuality.  She'd rather bury the evidence than ever admit to herself that her son is gay.Over the course of the film Swinton begins to understand her son better she realizes that everyone has their secrets and desires.  Her son also realizes the worry he has put his mother through.  The last shot of mother and son huddled together on the bed is of two strongwilled people finally understanding each other as equals.  It's a wonderfully telling moment.Be sure to watch this film more than once . . . it can be taken on many levels.james".

In the THE DEEP END a modern retelling of Max Ophuls' 1946 thriller THE RECKLESS MOMENT Margaret Hall is a mother of three willing to do whatever it takes to keep her family safe from the irrational forces that follow her teenage son home one night from a nightclub of ill repute. But mom played with stoic intensity by Tilda Swinton quickly learns that heroism doesn't fit on a calendar already packed with soccer practices trumpet lessons and visits to the grocery store.Superficially the story concerns a vicious run of bad luck. Noirish events are set in motion when Margaret tries to cover up the accidental death of her son's unsavory friend Josh Lucas as a spookily playful predator. The next day a man with a dice tattoo on his neck knocks on her door and demands 50000 to suppress a videotape linking her son to the death which police have ruled a homicide. The dramatic heart of the film concerns Margaret's dealings with the blackmailer cagily played by Goran Visnjic ER's Slavic heartthrob in a less soapy but perversely related role. Mr. Visnjic is credible though never quite menacing as a predator in awe of and ultimately vulnerable to his tender prey.Taken at this level THE DEEP END luminously shot in the gambling resort of Lake Tahoe is an eerie joy ride that leans heavily on coincidence to tangle then unknot its plot. But the presence of Tilda Swinton indicates that more is going on here than melodrama.  Ms. Swinton is a brilliant postfeminist actress whose work sheds light on paradoxes of femininity and female power. Her earlier films include ORLANDO in which she explored androgyny and immortality and FEMALE PERVERSIONS a Freudian critique of the feminist myth of having it all.  In THE DEEP END Ms. Swinton's nuanced performance comments on  motherhood as a source of both power and vulnerability.  A woman may be willing to do anything for her son as Margaret Hall clearly is yet still be constrained by a glass ceiling of caregiving attachments that  prevent her from achieving manstyle success.  In cinema the latter typically means blowing the villains' brains out something Margaret Hall might consider doing if she weren't so busy taking care of her kids and aging fatherinlaw.Throughout the film Margaret tries but is unable to reach her husband a Navy officer on an aircraft carrier somewhere in the midAtlantic. His unavailability is more than an inconvenience. Attempting to negotiate with the blackmailers Margaret finds herself hamstrung when the bank refuses a critical withdrawal without her husband's sayso. Mr. Hall's conspicuous absence and his infirm father's burdensome presence amplify Margaret's predicament showing how hollow the conventions of marriage and machismo can be. The fact that both men are soldiers society's designated heroes is no accident. They defend motherhood in the abstract while remaining blind to a real mother's needs.Margaret Hall is Ms. Swinton's most reluctant feminist character to date a woman whose maternal ferocity the family setting renders moot and who must ultimately rely on the kindness of strangers. Her performance transforms THE DEEP END from a good summer thriller to a dramatic critique of the politics of caregiving.".

And in such cases decisions made quickly in the shadows of the subjective are often revealed as unconscionable in the cold light of objectivity a scenario examined by writersdirectors Scott McGehee and David Siegel in their tension laced drama The Deep End' starring Tilda Swinton.Margaret Hall Swinton lives with her family in a picturesque lakeside home in Tahoe City Nevada but her life is about to become less than that offered by her distinctive surroundings.  Her husband is away at sea on an extended tour of duty and the care and responsibility of raising their three children has fallen to her.  And all is not well.  Her seventeenyearold son Beau Jonathan Tucker an aspiring musician who hopes to garner a scholarship to study music at college has become involved with a man Darby Reese Josh Lucas who owns a bar The Deep End and once she is aware of it it's a situation of no little concern for a mother. For her son's welfare Margaret knows that this relationship whatever the context must end and she goes to Reese insisting that he leave her son alone.  There is some question as to whether or not he agrees but regardless late that night he shows up at Margaret's home where he entices Beau to come outside with him.  Things go badly and by the next morning Margaret is embroiled in a situation beyond her wildest nightmares.  Blinded by fear and concern for Beau she does something out of character for any rational person yet within the parameters established by the unconditional love of a mother for her son.  It's an act that brings more bad news to her doorstep in the form of a man named Alek Spera Goran Visnjic.  And it's the beginning of a series of events that will take her into places darker than any she has ever known.McGehee and Siegel adapted their screenplay from the novel The Blank Wall' by Elisabeth Sanxay Holding and it's a taut thriller to be sure but it is so singular of purpose that it decidedly becomes more of a character study that focuses on Margaret and the effects of that natural bond between mother and son that provides the catalyst for her motivation and the impetus of her actions.  It's a story that clearly illustrates how even the most discerning individual and most especially a mother will abandon reason in the heat of the moment giving way to the most primitive and basic instincts for survival that are inherently a part of the human condition.  And though MeGehee and Siegel maintain the tension of the situation throughout the film it does wear a bit thin along the way and at least one pivotal element of the plot is questionable and strains the credibility of the overall story.  The real interest of the film however is the study of what the motherson relationship is really all about and how affecting it can be especially under extreme circumstances.What really makes the film work though and what maintains interest is the performance by Tilda Swinton as Margaret.  And it's quite a feat given the fact that the emotional boundaries she is given to explore are somewhat limited as the conflict begins even as the film begins and Margaret is driven on and presented in an emotional state that gives her very little latitude in which to operate.  To her credit however Swinton finds all of the variables one could expect in what is basically a lone emotion which encompasses concern and apprehension and she conveys them admirably it is in fact what keeps the film afloat.  Her portrayal of Margaret is subtle concise and introspective and most importantly comes across quite naturally all of which makes her character and her actions which on the surface and in the cold light of day may seem questionable convincing. As Alek Goran Visnjic gives a solid performance though it somewhat lacks the kind of emotional depth that could have made this character more than what it is.  Whether it is the way the character was written or the way it was acted there is an ambivalence to Alek that makes him less than believable.  He looks good on the surface and Visnjic does have some nice touches but he doesn't tap into the absolute credibility that he needs. And it makes one aspect of the film seem a little too pat as if the character is there merely as a means to an end to help the story along and tidy up the resolution.  It's a minor weakness not worthy of blame suffice to say that something apparently was missed in the translation of the material from page to screen.  In retrospect Visnjic does a good job with what he is given to work with.In a smaller but pivotal role Josh Lucas gives a good performance as Reese creating a character that is repugnantly smarmy a guy whose influence over one's son would be any mother's nightmare.  Lucas does exceptionally well in this regard and with comparatively little screen time he uses his time well however as it is the nature of his character more than anything else that gives credence to Margaret's actions.   The supporting cast includes Peter Donat Jack Raymond J. Barry Carlie Tamara Hope Paige and Jordan Dorrance Dylan.  As a thriller this one has merit but viewed as a character studydrama The Deep End' is even more engrossing.  It's flawed but it's still smart thought provoking entertainment the magic of the movies.  710.".

It's the relationship between the two that drives this movie as Visnjic's character begins to change because of the decency and honesty he encounters in Swinton's character.  I gave this 8 out of 10 instead of 9 out of 10 because the ending is somewhat predictable it's like something from a 1930's big Hollywood studio film.

Indeed as the film progressed and she acted wackier and wackier I was sure that it would come out that she is unwholesomely possessive of her son. Sonny boy sullen and closedmouthed is carrying on with a much older man and mom interferes in a way that even a 13 year old would find mortifying much less a 17 year old. She operates under the assumption that her gay son has been seduced and lured into contact with this man but from what we see he is just a young man who has fallen in with a bad crowd and is drawn to an older guy. A creepy guy albeit but when we later find out how absent the father is and would not understand his son's gayness no matter what then subtext kicks in and you start to imagine that Sonny boy is drawn to bad boys and inappropriate partners for a reason. Mom however is hearing none of this. Even when said son wrecks a car drunk driving with his lover the mom convinces herself that it is the sole fault of the 30 yearold man not her son who was actually behind the wheel. Her son seems troubled and she seems like a reactionary nut but is this what the film focuses on? No. The film has the creepy older gay guy accidentally die on their property and mom spends the entire film covering it up because she thinks in some way her son is involved. Since this family is severely screwed up to me that is the filmmakers seem to think this affluent family of noncommunicative isolated individuals is worth protecting from scary gamblin' screwin' and blackmailin' homosexuals she never actually asks the son what happened calls the police or even wonders how she could think her son capable of murder. The son mourns his ex lover for about ten minutes and never loses much sleep over the possibility that he may have been the last one to see him alive. No everything is a whirlwind of dance classes music lessons baseball games and laundry for this bunch. Who has time to talk?After a series of plot contrivances too ridiculous to recount among them an empathetic blackmailer who doesn't have the heart for the job...oh yeah there are lots of those around an alarming amount of people pay with their lives for the sole purpose of keeping Sonny boy's big dark secret from daddy and maintaining the privileged class status quo. Oh brother! Much of the stupidity that preceded it would have been forgivable if at the end there was perhaps an awareness on the mother's part that the distasteful acts she engaged in were not equal to what she thought she was protecting the problem was not that her son was gay nor that he rebelliously got mixed up with a guy almost twice his age the problem was that her son's father would not understand and that she raised her son in an environment where who he was was not as important as what he appeared to be to others. She was less concerned with his lying underage drinking and hanging out with guys with possible mob ties than she was with his being gay and outed. What are the biggest moral transgressions here?The Deep End is so woefully shallow and is content to sacrifice psychological depth for artificially earned suspense.I can't remember when I've been so put off by the unintended offensiveness of a film's premise. Loathed it.".

In the beginning his behavior was confusing to Margaret and he was not willing to talk about it and in the end Margaret's behavior was mysterious to her son and she was not willing to talk about it.It was only the contrived ending that bothered me.".

	schema:reviewBody "Contains Spoilers!!! The short version Poorly written poorly performed.I would like to say this movie is horrible. But it's not the kind of horrible where you get up thinking well they tried really hard to write a good script just too ambitious. It's the kind of horrible where you think man they really weren't trying.Tilda Swinton is poorly cast and not convincing at all as the mother. The film seems to need to overstate things to the audience such as when Swinton disposes of the body in broad daylight the screenplay felt the need to show a helicoptershot panoramic view of the area to quell the yeah right like she could do that in broad daylight feelings you're having. The film also insults your intelligence in other ways such as dressing Swinton in black and handing her a cigarette in the scene where you find out her sinister intentions. The story is decent but it seems like the cinematic devices used in the screenplay are straight out of the 1930's.The characters in the film behave in excessively stupid ways. For example why did she wait until the morning to dispose of the body? Why did she not question her son about the incident before disturbing the crime scene? Police are a nonfactor in fact no authority speaks to a member of the cast until 34 of the way through when the sheriff's officer asks Swinton about the anchor. She says their boat doesn't have an anchor and he simply accepts it and the police never enter the plot again apparently not having looked around the houses at the lake at all to discover the broken board as well as the blood the body would have certainly left in the boat.Earlier in the film after Swinton drives the dead man's Corvette to another location how did the keyless entry still work after the car keys had been submerged for some length of time? she wipes the steering wheel 'clean' of her prints  neglecting other obvious places like the door handle the shifter the radio buttons which she adjusts and other things she would have certainly touched on the interior of the vehicle.These are just a few examples there aren't really any gaping holes in the plot just a small number of examples where the characters behaved in excessively careless or irrational ways but frequently enough to interrupt your acceptance of the rest of the plot. The story itself is not awful the acting is serviceable but not at all above average but the script sank this one from the beginning.".

	onyx:emotionText "Contains Spoilers!!! The short version Poorly written poorly performed.I would like to say this movie is horrible. But it's not the kind of horrible where you get up thinking well they tried really hard to write a good script just too ambitious. It's the kind of horrible where you think man they really weren't trying.Tilda Swinton is poorly cast and not convincing at all as the mother. The film seems to need to overstate things to the audience such as when Swinton disposes of the body in broad daylight the screenplay felt the need to show a helicoptershot panoramic view of the area to quell the yeah right like she could do that in broad daylight feelings you're having. The film also insults your intelligence in other ways such as dressing Swinton in black and handing her a cigarette in the scene where you find out her sinister intentions. The story is decent but it seems like the cinematic devices used in the screenplay are straight out of the 1930's.The characters in the film behave in excessively stupid ways. For example why did she wait until the morning to dispose of the body? Why did she not question her son about the incident before disturbing the crime scene?

Isolated by snowcovered mountain tops ponderosa pines and upper class wood homes this is the perfect backdrop for The Deep End.The Deep End captures some of this harrowing atmosphere but I wanted even more. The photography by Giles Nuttgens won the coveted Best Cinematography Award at the Sundance Film Festival this year for its unflinching look at images of Lake Tahoe awash in moral tensions. The camera cuts through aquariums dripping water faucets bursting water bottles and of course across and beneath the lake's surface. On a photographic level this is one great movie.Writersdirectors Scott McGehee and David Siegel found their inspiration for The Deep End from the little known 1940's novel The Blank Wall by Elisabeth Sanxay Holding. The Ladies Home Journal first published an abridged version of the story. It became so popular that the writer eventually made it into a novel. According to the film's press notes even Alfred Hitchcook was impressed as evident when he chose the book for his classic anthology My Favorites in Suspense1959. Holding's novel was the only full length feature book of fiction included on that list. McGehee and Siegel previously worked on the independent film Suture. In their day stories like these were very subversive because they asked questions about the nature of families about the limits of communication and the loneliness of personal sacrifice says Siegel of Holding's story. We wanted to bring those same elements in a contemporary setting with characters that would be sympathetic and believable to people today.Holding certainly did have an innate understanding that true suspense emerges not just from violence and mystery but also from the fabric of everyday life. The Deep End examines a housewife named Margaret Tilda Swinton who protects her gay teenage son Jonathan Tucker by covering up the death of his lover Josh Lucas. Did her son kill this person? Someone might know the truth behind this act of violence but silence has a very high price tag. A very involving introduction and first act suffer after the diabolical murder plot takes a downhill spiral into a different set of events. Alek Spera Gordan Visnijc who needs money for his boss Raymond J. Berry creates a blackmail scheme. The film goes downhill from here but the overall product is far from boring. That's largely because of the beautiful performances. Tilda Swinton seen opposite Leonardo DiCaprio in 1999's The Beach leads the cast with a powerhouse performance. Swinton paints a vivid intriguing portrait of domestic serenity peaceful ordinariness and motherhood's merciful nature. She can move the audience with utter silence her eyes exclude intelligence instinct and compassion. She completes what the movie leaves unfinished including her character's adherence to routine and complete loss of moral compass. Gordon Visnjic Dr. Luka Kovac on ER. with his dark brooding physique creates a shadowy nature for his character. His motives remain a mystery we never know why he does what he does. It lets the audience guessbut we do not have much to guess with. The film does not complete his character. He's one of the most interesting characters here but Visnjic needs more to chew on. The filmmakers comment about the hidden romantic feelings between Margaret and Alek. It's the kind of romance I miss in movies. It's not explicit and it is not necessarily even realized but it is there in a haunting melancholic way says Visnjic. Where? We never really grasp these potentially fascinating plot points because the movie never examines these emotions. This is the kind of material that would have taken The Deep End to another level of interest.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Deep End is a psychological thriller about a kid Beau who apparently killed his boyfriend Reese and about his caring mother Margaret covering up the deed. Margaret who lives with his son and her other kids in a house on Tahoe lake wanted Reese to stay away from his son. After Margaret heard the boys fight earlier on she finds the dead body and without ever talking to Beau about it she disposes the body in broad daylight using her boat's anchor to weigh the body down in the water. She wants to protect her son. Many reviewers complained about the fact that she should have at least spoke to Beau about it but I find this not unrealistic and like this use of unconditional love. The movie takes a promising start.Back to the plot A few days later a guy Alek shows up at their house and blackmails Margaret. He wants her to pay 50.000 and threatens to hand a videotape to the police who have found Reese's body in the meantime. The tape shows Beau and Reese having sex. Maragret tries to somehow get the 50.000. Now comes the part of the movie that I found really annoying and stupid. She cannot tell her children anything about the blackmail so she has to keep doing her maternal duties while she desperately tries to get the money. Margaret explains to Alex why she does not have the money yet and their dialog is really laughable Margaret Hall We don't have the money. Alek 'Al' Spera You have to get the money. Is that not clear enough? MH It's 50000. It is not the kind of thing that everyone can just go out and get. Alek Have you spoken with your husband? M He can't be reached. He's on a carrier somewhere in the nor  This is truly none of your business. Alek What about the old man? Well you have to try harder. M Try harder? Alek I don't think you're really trying. M Really? Alek Yes. Margaret Hall Well maybe you should explain really trying to me Mr. Spera. Tell me  how would you be really trying if you were me? But you're not me are you? You don't have my petty concerns to clutter your life and keep you from trying. You don't have three kids to feed or worry about the future of a 17yearold boy who nearly got himself killed driving back from some kind of a nightclub with his 30yearold friend sitting drunk in the seat beside him. No these are not your concerns. I see that. But perhaps you're right Mr. Spera. Perhaps I could be trying a little harder. Maybe sometime tomorrow between dropping Dylan at baseball practice and picking up my fatherinlaw from the hospital I might find a way to try a little harder. Maybe I should take a page from your book go to the track find a card game. Maybe I should blackmail someone. Or maybe you have another idea. I mean maybe you have a better idea of how I might try a little harder to find this 50000 you've come here to steal from me. Alek You're right. I'm not you. I don't  This is only a business opportunity. That's all.Just the typical conversation between blackmailer and the person whom he blackmails. Happens all the time. But Alek turns out to actually be a really nice guy and the two fall in love. Alek does not want his part of the money anymore and tries to convince his boss to give Margaret more time to get the boss' 25.000. This turn is laughably ridiculous. Him falling for her is really unrealistic. There really is not a lot of tension and the police is underused. They never show up at her house again after they briefly asked if she knew anything about an anchor. She says their boat has no anchor the cops leave.In the end Alek sacrifices himself by driving off a cliff as he is driving with his boss. Magaret who was following the two takes the videotape out of the wrecked car and as she is reaching for it her lips touch Alek's lips. Alek and his boss die. It turns out that Beau did not know anything about Reese's death which turned out to have been an accident. Beau and Reese had an argument outside Beau's house. Beau told Reese to leave and went back inside before drunken Reese fell into an anchor and died. Seems like a missed opportunity as the story really has some potential. 5.010 ".

This lady totally went above and beyond everything to protect her son from the truth which he never found out.The only real problem I had with this movie was that the word Gay was never said.  Not once.  Unless my hearing left me when it was said.  It was referenced and even a little sex was shown but the word was never said.Other than that I enjoyed this movie completely.

Not once.  Unless my hearing left me when it was said.  It was referenced and even a little sex was shown but the word was never said.Other than that I enjoyed this movie completely.  Just Terrific!!!!!!!!";

But the realism is enough to hold your attention even without the surprises action and twists we've become so accustomed to from most Hollywood movies.  The acting in this movie is wonderful and so much of it is done without words.  I particularly liked the way it ended with so many misconceptions and unanswered questions for the characters.  It seemed much more real that the usual ending tying up all loose ends because in reality life is full of loose ends.".

Not that I consider it a true flaw but I would have liked for Margaret to tell Beau exactly why things had been so screwy and deadly for the past two days. The opportunity arises at the very end but she decides not. For me I certainly would have explained to a seventeenyearold boy that if he screws around with derelicts in seedy closets people die. It's sort of an important part of growing up. However directors McGehee and Siegel decide to omit that part. While the film is a must for thrillseekers I really felt that the boy should have been let in on the sticky lethal web his juvenile lust did spin. BUT TILDA ROCKS! Just like this movie.".

The scenes that were supposed to create tension fell completely flat.

The only people who will enjoy this movie are those who can derive sufficient pleasure from seeing beautiful shots of Lake Tahoe and lingering shots of Tilda Swinton and Goran Visnjic. The rest of us would be better entertained elsewhere. Most critics fell all over themselves to praise this movie.  I believe the only reason they did so was the fear of being labled homophobic if they panned it.  They need to look at movies with gay characters in them the same way they would look at movies with only heterosexual characters and make their judgments accordingly. Of course different sexual orientations could bring different elements to the movie but to rave about something simply because we're shown a gay relationship is ludicrous.".

Those who project less by annotation than projection. An ordinary actor works with just a few tricks and parts of their body. Tilda's approach is to inhabit a smaller self inside and project onto the back of her face. The concentration must be extraordinary  in some of her projects Orlando' Ada' she stares right at the camera and clearly right at us.A noir film could only be made in a small period which is now long gone so when one is remade it needs to have some distance  just the sort of thing Tilda can do. The original was smack in the middle of noir notions a grinding capricious fate that bobbles characters about. This one needed to have a different center one where a character can create her own fate to some extent.Its a risk and even in the best case bears little reward. But it is interesting to see that the people behind this project understood what Tilda could do and supported her in doing it.Ted's Evaluation  2 of 3 Has some interesting elements.".

The concentration must be extraordinary  in some of her projects Orlando' Ada' she stares right at the camera and clearly right at us.A noir film could only be made in a small period which is now long gone so when one is remade it needs to have some distance  just the sort of thing Tilda can do. The original was smack in the middle of noir notions a grinding capricious fate that bobbles characters about. This one needed to have a different center one where a character can create her own fate to some extent.Its a risk and even in the best case bears little reward. But it is interesting to see that the people behind this project understood what Tilda could do and supported her in doing it.Ted's Evaluation  2 of 3 Has some interesting elements.";

	schema:reviewBody "There are numerous films relating to WW2 but Mother Night is quite distinctive among them In this film we are introduced to Howard Campbell Nolte an American living in Berlin and married to a German Helga Noth Lee who decides to accept the role of a spy More specifically a CIA agent Major Wirtanen Goodman recruits Campbell who becomes a Nazi propagandist in order to enter the highest echelons of the Hitler regime. However the deal is that the US Government will never acknowledge Campbell's role in the war for national security reasons and so Campbell becomes a hated figure across the US. After the war he tries to conceal his identity but the past comes back and haunts him. His only friend is Wirtanen but even he cannot do much for the avalanche of events that fall upon poor Campbell...The story is deeply touching as we watch the tragedy of Campbell who although a great patriot is treated by disdain by everybody who surrounds him. Not only that but he also gradually realizes that even the persons who are most close to him have many secrets of their own. Vonnegut provides us with a moving atmosphere with Campbell's despair building up and almost choking the viewer.Nolte plays the role of his life in my opinion he is even better than in Affliction although in both roles he plays tragic figures who are destined to selfdestruction. Sheryl Lee is also excellent and the same can be said for the whole cast in general.I haven't read the book so I cannot appraise how the film compares to it. In any case this is something of no importance here My critique is upon the film per se and the film wholeheartedly deserves a 910.".

	schema:reviewBody "Although I like Kurt Vonnegut I'm not particularly interested in spy stories and I didn't know this one. The only reason I watched it was Nick Nolte who is one of my favorite actors since I saw Breakfast of Champions and Hotel Rwanda. But the film brought me a pleasant surprise. Of course Nolte was great but so was the plot. There was relatively little political intrigue and much more focus on the moral question by reading his antiSemitic radio commentaries with hidden secret messages to Americans he in fact contributed to the general attitude of Germans and as it later turns out Americans towards Jews or Hitler. Which carries more weight his service to his country or his unconscious contribution to antisemitism? The dilemma is even more prominent as these words are never spoken not even as narration. Howard Campbell Jr. Nolte is a person who learnt to hide his feelings so perfectly that he doesn't open up not even in his memoirs. The inner conflict of such a character is almost impossible to portray  but with the help of excellent acting and photography this film manages. There are other points to it such as the humor or the ironical use of romantic clichs like the song White Christmas that make it real different from average American movies. I recommend it to everyone who is bored with Hollywood spy movies.".

	schema:reviewBody "I haven't yet read Kurt Vonnegut's Mother Night though I've read other books of his all outstanding pieces of satire and gamechanging novel pieces. After seeing Keith Gordon's film adaptation of his book it will be an immediate mustread in the near future. It's the kind of material that I'm sure if it wasn't made in 199596 as a film it would be picked up right away today in the time period when many period postpresentHolocaustWW2 movies are quite popular. Except that this is much darker though even more resonant about the nature of playing roles and the real underlying horror of living with life after war than say The Reader. It's about the very real danger of pretending in wartime which is what being a spy in WW2 is really all about.It would be one thing if Mother Night had a script with a lot of emotional depth and complexity about the moral choice and constant role even after the war ends for Howard W. Cambpell Nick Nolte which is does. But it's also just a really strong feat of cinematic technique. Keith Gordon is not someone I usually think of as a director of really strong material moreso I think back to him as an actor oddly enough featured briefly with Vonnegut himself in Back to School but this is a revelation. He takes the story of Campbell as a story of a fractured life a German propaganda master the only American left in Berlin who is actually a spy for the Americans but can never have his identity revealed and was before a playwright who really belonged to a nation of two himself and his wife Sheryl Lee. It follows him from his prison cell awaiting trial in Israel in 1961 as he writes his memoir and tells of his disillusionment about being a 'pretend' Nazi and then in 1960 in semihiding in a New York apartment which is where the bulk of the film takes place.Mother Night can be quite heavy like on a level one might associate with the Pianist but on another more emotionalcerebral level than the stark poetry of that film. Gordon by way of Vonnegut is trying to give us a strong look at a man who has nothing except the memory and then later a weird transposition of his long lost love in a sister who has come back to him in NYC so he's left to his own devices when he befriends a painter Alan Arkin very very good here and then is found out as a Naziinhiding by a white supremacist newsletter leading wackos to his apartment. On the surface this should be just a straightforward spy story but not a thing is straightforward. The 'something' of this man's life is staggering but it's ultimately of his own choosing. Campbell is one of those characters that could be analyzed for hours on end but the same conclusions might be reached and in a way mirrors the line Goebbels said the bigger the lie the more people believe it. That is except for the select few who started the lie and know its secret and power.But oh it would be one thing if it were just a wonderful and tragiccomic tale or another if it were featuring some really fantastic performances which is does Nolte is at his very best here and Sheryl Lee who we might remember from Twin Peaks as Laura Palmer stuns in multiple roles especially in the scene when she reveals she's not 'really' Helga. It's also a gorgeously shot film with brilliant lighting and shots that reflect the state of mind of the character or just the starkness or sickening colors of the time watch the scene where an old Campbell watches a film of his younger self spouting out a rant the juxtaposition of faces is great. And the music selections rise the level of tragedy. It could be argued some of the music is too much but at other times it elevates the material past its own usual dramatic dimensions and makes it operatic solemn about human nature.It's not always an easy film to take emotionally and some of the twists do have that tinge of whoa as in any spy story. But it's the subversion from Vonnegut that sticks through the way of taking appearance and performance of life imitating art imitating life imitating death and making it into something worth remembering. I have no idea just yet if the book is better than the film or the other way around but at the moment it's hard for me not to recommend this to anyone looking for a masterpiece of post WW2holocaust storytelling.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have yet to see a film with Nolte in it that I did not like. However this being said he's made a lot of films and I've seen just a few. In my minds eye I am keeping the images of his performance here and the one in The Thin Red Line. Nolte has a a full range of acting talents. When it's necessary to shout he roars like a wounded lion. His best moments are the ones I treasure in actors when he just emotes through facial hand and body gestures without saying anything. Having come to the conclusion that our present generation of actors by and large have no appreciation of what an actor can do without speaking having no conscious appreciation of the mastery of Keaton and Chaplin this generation of actors relies far too much on the mechanical wizardry of computers. Of course it is also just a sign of the times we live in. Had Chaplin lived in our times....who knows he just might as well have become an aficionado of CGI tools.I have not read the Vonnegut novel from which this film comes to the screen. However the plot is not so far fetched or convoluted that we cannot follow the path laid even with all its surprises. Of course on the outset it appears preposterous. However it is also not impossible.Consider these for starters A Spy at the Heart of the Third Reich He Extraordinary Life of Fritz Kolbe America's Most Important Spy in World War II by Delattre and Prichard look at Amazon for more details. Consider History Undercover Piercing the Reich American Spies Inside Nazi Germany DVD I saw this here httpstore.aetv.comhtmlproductindex.jhtml?id75054 seems to be a History Channel production.So is the story ridiculous? Far fetched yes impossible no. Back to the plot. Nolte's character is recruited and accepts an impossibly dangerous mission and unfortunately the script does not give us an adequate reason why he accepts. Was it a type of passivity that he got sucked into this role as it says because it was the best story he had ever written and he got to play the part? That's a hard thing to imagine any of us would grasp. But it was an unusual time and people did extraordinary things.The acting throughout the film by the entire cast is excellent and as people have pointed out Alan Arkin always fantastic is very good in a small role.I was really shocked by the ending of the film no  I won't spoil it and it made me feel terrible about the choice. Did this person feel that the road was finally over and that he had spoken all that was necessary and that any more would be chapters added to a life already filled with many burnt pages? Hard to say but it really jolts.Nolte gives one of the finest performances you can expect....the premises of the film make you wonder about a lot of things. It's very entertaining and provoking. What great movies should be. A bit long but worth it. By the way the movie music has selections from one of the best living composers Arvo Part.".

	schema:headline " Did I miss something?";
	schema:reviewBody "I am amazed at the amount of praise that is heaped on this movie by other commentators. To me it was rather a disappointment especially the combination of historical facts fantasy and the main character's internal turmoil does not work at all in Vonnegut's book Slaughterhouse Five and even in George Roy Hill's adaptation for the screen it does. Credibility is often overstretched. Too many questions are left open. Did I miss some central points? Or did I fail to spot the lines that supposedly connect the dots? A boy called Campbell Jr. grows up in upstate New York. At home his father has many technical trade papers and one book. It has photographs of heaps of dead bodies in it. The boy leafs through the book his dad doesn't like his doing that. What should this tell me? The family moves away from upstate New York to Berlin. BANG. It is 1938 the boy is a married man in Berlin and a theater playwright. What kind of plays does he write? In what language? Is he successful? His wife is an actress and looks glamorous. The parents move back to the USA and invite their son to do the same. He does not. Why? Because having grown up in Germany he feels more German than American? Because he is successful? Because his wife is? Because he likes his life there? Because he likes the Nazis? Because he is just plain lazy and doesn't like change? Don't ask me.Possibly the man just does not care is not interested in politics is a kind of an existentialist. He states that he is deeply in love with his wife. He speaks of his Republic of Two meaning he and his wife. There is little to no evidence proving his love for his wife in the movie it much more seems a Republic of One.On the request of an American agent Campbell Jr. agrees to broadcast anti Semitic Nazi hate propaganda to American listeners as a device for transmitting encrypted messages to American authorities who read between the lines. The crucial meeting with the agent on a Berlin park bench is short unexciting and anti climactic the decision to play along comes pretty easily with no explanation the rise up to broadcaster seems to be uneventful and apparently fast.So now we have Campbell Jr. presenting himself over the air as the Last Free American. The scheme for transmitting secret messages is fairly realistic and exciting  although one wonders what happened when Campbell Jr. really and honestly had to cough hiccup etc. must have scrambled the messages terribly. Anyway the Nazis lose the wife dies touring in the Crimean for German troops  I never heard such tours really happened on German front lines in WW II Campbell Jr. says he goes to the Russian front but does not go is captured by an American soldier who recognizes his mug how come? is dragged to a sightseeing tour in Auschwitz is then released and resettled with the help of the Crucial Agent somewhere in the City of New York.AND THIS IS WHERE THE STORY REALLY STARTS BANG. From now on it is like a short story by Paul Auster. It is 1961 Campbell Jr. lives in New York tenement as a hasbeen and mourns the loss of his wife. Nobody really cares  or do they? Yes somehow they do and his neighbors offer some sort of distraction. Auschwitz survivors. A painter. Some American supremacists discover him and want him to be their figurehead. They even find his presumed dead wife for him or is she his wife? Anyway in the end Campbell Jr. calls in at the Israeli consulate and they obligingly give him the Big War Criminal treatment placing him in the cell adjacent to Adolf Eichmann's. He writes his life story and once this task finished hangs himself on the typewriter's ribbons without getting sooty the least bit.While I can see that there must be an issue of guilt and of loss I just had the impression that the main character is a person who at all times is pretty indifferent to everything and hardly capable of love for anyone. So I found it difficult to sympathize for this looser who mourns his loss. Amazingly many reviewers focus on his status as a potential war hero having put his reputation at stake for playing the Last Free American. I assume according to them this took a lot of courage. As a matter of fact however the movie suggests that by accepting the assignment Campbell created for himself a winwin situation as he would have been politically on the safe side no matter who had won the war. The danger of his being uncovered never comes up during the first part of the story.One might argue that the whole story is a dreamlike fantasy and that nobody should bother with historical accuracy or a logical development of the story which explains everything. But even then it fails to make a point primarily I suspect because the love affair in the Republic of Two falls completely flat. This is a pity especially if you consider that the wife was played by Sheryl Lee a talented versatile and sensuous actress. She has much too little screen time and is forced to use a ridiculous German accent. Another somehow neglected aspect are the different texts confession broadcast and hidden messages but I guess this is largely unfilmable. Maybe I should give the book a chance.".

	onyx:emotionText "I am amazed at the amount of praise that is heaped on this movie by other commentators. To me it was rather a disappointment especially the combination of historical facts fantasy and the main character's internal turmoil does not work at all in Vonnegut's book Slaughterhouse Five and even in George Roy Hill's adaptation for the screen it does. Credibility is often overstretched. Too many questions are left open. Did I miss some central points? Or did I fail to spot the lines that supposedly connect the dots? A boy called Campbell Jr. grows up in upstate New York. At home his father has many technical trade papers and one book. It has photographs of heaps of dead bodies in it. The boy leafs through the book his dad doesn't like his doing that. What should this tell me? The family moves away from upstate New York to Berlin. BANG. It is 1938 the boy is a married man in Berlin and a theater playwright. What kind of plays does he write? In what language? Is he successful? His wife is an actress and looks glamorous. The parents move back to the USA and invite their son to do the same. He does not. Why? Because having grown up in Germany he feels more German than American? Because he is successful? Because his wife is? Because he likes his life there? Because he likes the Nazis? Because he is just plain lazy and doesn't like change? Don't ask me.Possibly the man just does not care is not interested in politics is a kind of an existentialist. He states that he is deeply in love with his wife. He speaks of his Republic of Two meaning he and his wife. There is little to no evidence proving his love for his wife in the movie it much more seems a Republic of One.On the request of an American agent Campbell Jr. agrees to broadcast anti Semitic Nazi hate propaganda to American listeners as a device for transmitting encrypted messages to American authorities who read between the lines. The crucial meeting with the agent on a Berlin park bench is short unexciting and anti climactic the decision to play along comes pretty easily with no explanation the rise up to broadcaster seems to be uneventful and apparently fast.So now we have Campbell Jr. presenting himself over the air as the Last Free American. The scheme for transmitting secret messages is fairly realistic and exciting  although one wonders what happened when Campbell Jr. really and honestly had to cough hiccup etc. must have scrambled the messages terribly. Anyway the Nazis lose the wife dies touring in the Crimean for German troops  I never heard such tours really happened on German front lines in WW II Campbell Jr. says he goes to the Russian front but does not go is captured by an American soldier who recognizes his mug how come? is dragged to a sightseeing tour in Auschwitz is then released and resettled with the help of the Crucial Agent somewhere in the City of New York.AND THIS IS WHERE THE STORY REALLY STARTS BANG. From now on it is like a short story by Paul Auster. It is 1961 Campbell Jr. lives in New York tenement as a hasbeen and mourns the loss of his wife. Nobody really cares  or do they? Yes somehow they do and his neighbors offer some sort of distraction. Auschwitz survivors. A painter. Some American supremacists discover him and want him to be their figurehead. They even find his presumed dead wife for him or is she his wife? Anyway in the end Campbell Jr. calls in at the Israeli consulate and they obligingly give him the Big War Criminal treatment placing him in the cell adjacent to Adolf Eichmann's. He writes his life story and once this task finished hangs himself on the typewriter's ribbons without getting sooty the least bit.While I can see that there must be an issue of guilt and of loss I just had the impression that the main character is a person who at all times is pretty indifferent to everything and hardly capable of love for anyone.

He is in nearly every scene of this film and sustains his character through the passage of more than thirty years.The story begins in 1960 with Howard Campbell Jnr awaiting trial in an Israeli prison for antiJewish broadcasts he made during the war. The Israeli authorities order him to write his memoirs and through narration and flashback his story is revealed.An American who grew up in prewar Germany Howard Campbell Jnr is a successful playwright when the Nazis come to power. Married to a leading German actress played by Sheryl Lee he ignores the excesses of the Nazis by absorbing himself in work and love for his wife. Just before America enters the war an agent Frank Wirtanen played by John Goodman convinces him to ingratiate himself with the Nazis in order to relay coded information to the Allies via radio broadcasts even though he will be regarded as a traitor by America and the truth will never be revealed.As cover for his espionage work Campbell's broadcasts are vitriolic in their denunciation of the Jews and he becomes a hated figure among the Allies. At war's end he is given a false identity and disappears back into American society. The story takes a number of unpredictable turns and ends with Campbell burnt out and disillusioned by a life over which he has had little control. He sums up his life with the philosophy that runs through the film You must be careful what you pretend to be because in the end you are what you pretend to be.In his guise as a Nazi collaborator Campbell's tirades against the Jews have the power to shock even in the context of this movie. Not unexpectedly this was where a few critics felt the movie stepped over the line of acceptability. To dismiss Mother Night in this way is to miss its power as a cautionary tale that does not insult the audience by delivering easy answers or a predicable plot.The film comes close to falling apart in the New York scenes featuring the neoNazis. Treated as caricatures they almost capsize the story. However if the filmmakers had attempted a more serious approach with this material apart from missing the Vonnegut touch they may have produced a work of such oppressive gloom that the ironic tone that underpins the movie would have been lost.One scene in Mother Night stays in the memory. Crushed by the forces that have buffeted his life Howard Campbell Jnr stops walking and remains motionless for hours in a crowded New York street because as he says There did not seem to be any direction in which I needed to go.Unique and challenging Mother Night leaves an indelible impression and Nick Nolte's performance is simply unforgettable.".

His relationship with Helga is just one more aspect of this romantic attitude and Helga is not at the center of his universe for long. Too many humans still consider war a romantic ideal filled with action and heroes. Humans forever tell themselves that they are full of good intentions that we mean well and so does Campbell. He never truly understands how his part in the war the little devices created for him that somehow offer information to the allies fits in but most of all he fills a role a role of a lifetime on a huge international stage he is by career a actorplaywright and there is simply no bigger role he could take. Again fulfilling a romantic ideal. But by playing the role as antiSemitic propagandist he becomes so close to that role that he cant even separate himself from it he becomes the role. Another romantic ideal. But his being manipulated because of this romantic leanings leaves him empty inside and longs for real life. The contact with the secret John Goodman's role as the blue fairy godmother does appear and save him from himself a couple of times but ultimately cannot in the end save him.This is an excellent cast and Vonnegut's novel is entirely intact and he does have a walk on nonspeaking appearance toward the end.

	schema:reviewBody "It takes a little while to get used to Nick Nolte's Nebraskan locutions before we can easily accept him as a famous intercontinental playwright. Once you get past the bar it turns into a fascinating story of a man who loses everything while trying to do good.Nolte an American moves to Germany marries a famous actress and is a satisfied success in every respect until war is about to break out. He's visited by a jovial American John Goodman who persuades him to accept a post as an antiSemitic radio broadcaster for the Nazis. Nolte has no politics but thinks it's a challenge to write a role that's almost impossible and then play it himself. Another American secret agent will modify Nolte's radio scripts  inserting a cough here a sneeze there  that will serve as a code for the transmission of intelligence to the Allies. There's a catch though. Nobody will know about Nolte's real role as an American agent except Goodman Donovan and Roosevelt himself. If he's ever uncovered he'll be refused recognition by the Americans.Nolte plunges ahead and his vicious broadcasts are wildly popular in Germany. His adored wife Sheryl Lee knows nothing of what's going on nor does she care. Nolte and Lee live in what he repeatedly refers to as a nation of two. The war ends and the trouble begins. He's captured by Americans who are bitter because of his betrayal. They beat him and leave him in the mud. He's rescued by Goodman his fairy godmother who sends him to an anonymous existence in Greenwich Village and sends him a little cash now and then.By 1960 he manages to cultivate a friendship with his neighbor the painter Alan Arkin who has also lost his family and claims the two now belong to a secret brotherhood. But his location and his identity somehow leak out and he is more or less adopted by a group of ancient Aryan racists  led by a dentist and a priest. His house front and mailbox are painted with swastikas and accusations. He's beaten senseless by an exGI. But  miraculously  his beloved wife is returned to him by the ancient Aryans. Another catch it turns out later that it's not his wife but rather her younger sister who has loved him since adolescence.The ending has him typing his memoirs in an Israeli jail in 1967 before his trial for crimes against humanity. It's not a happy ending.Nolte can talk with but not see the occupant of the cell above his in jail. It's Adolf Eichmann. Eichmann seems pleasant enough. He advises Nolte that it's a bad habit to type for fifteen straight hours. It's important to relax. You must learn to relax. Nolte laughs out loud and shouts That's how I GOT here. The film is filled with such ironies. At one point in their relaxed conversations Arkin tells him that in spite of everything I still think people are good at heart. I don't know if the movie was a commercial success but if it wasn't that's the sort of thing that might have torpedoed it for a younger audience of theatergoers who may never have heard of Anne Frank let alone that supposedly final statement in her diary.The fact is that it's a movie for adults and patient adults at that. The story moves slowly there's very little violence no car chases no shootings and people don't seem subject to manic speech pressure. A lot of it will probably slip past viewers who don't open themselves to its deliberate approach. Nolte refers to the wartime relationship between him and his wife as a nation of two. This is a pretty compact phrase. No doubt anyone could come up with a glib definition but it takes a little concentration to grasp its emotional import.It's a story of a man who loses everything  his ability to write his identity his wife twice his sole friend his country his self respect. At one point he stops walking along a crowded New York street and simply stands there until after dark when he is moved along by a curious cop. The reason he stopped is that he simply has no place to go. What Vonnegut is describing is far more than depression. I don't mean to sound condescending but it's the sort of feeling that's hard to understand in your youth. Adolescents might like to THINK they know what's holding Nolte in that one spot but it really requires maturity and the quickened sense of finiteness that only maturity can bring.Remember Robert Frost's line about home being the place that when you go there they have to take you in? Well no place will take Nolte in.".

	schema:headline " A visual poem about an ancient game of competition and the pursuit of faith";
	schema:reviewBody "Wu Qingyuan was born in China but has lived most of his life in Japan. Perhaps the greatest twentiethcentury player of Go the chesslike but simpler and more ancient territorial game of lenticular black and white stones on the grid square of a big wooden board. Wu was a Go prodigy and his early victories led him to Japan at the age of fourteen. He dominated the game for over a quartercentury. This beautiful sedatelypaced film is based on his autobiography.Tian's film is very Zen. You will learn nothing about Go from it and little about Wu known as Go Seigen in Japan curiously as Gosait makes him sound like Mr. Go. What you will get is a meditative but at times noisy visual poem starring the young Taiwanese actor Chang Chen male lead of Hou Hsiauhsien's Three Times focused on a stoical restrained silent man who with quiet devotion pursued the game of Go and Faith those two goals of competition and the spiritual quest and little else all of his life among all the physical and mental challenges he faced and all the events of a turbulent century. The stern cleanfaced Chang's coolly intense performance which rivets our attention at the film's center at all times is a milestone in his career and shows him to be one of the strongest new Chinese film actors today. Chang knew a little Japanese prior to filming but for Tian this project imposed the discipline of shooting in a language of which he knew nothing. But Tian had Japanese assistant directors and production assistants he trusted and as he said in an interview Go players don't talk very much anyway. Nonetheless he acknowledges this was very hard similar to the problems faced by Hou in making Caf Lumiere in Japan. Tian contemplated this project for a long time and read Wu's autobiography shortly after returning to filmmaking following the nineyear break that followed The Blue Kite. Tian knows his own hardships. The realistic portrayal of the long period of the Cultural Revolution its prelude and aftermath in the richly detailed Kite led to his being barred from filmmaking for years by the Chinese authorities.Wu lived in Japan during the unstable and violent Thirties and Forties. He was playing a tournament on Hiroshima when it was bombed. According to the film the referee instructs the players to play on in the wrecked room. Wu suffered periodically from tuberculosis. Its residual effects exempted him from military service. He married a Japanese woman named Kazuko who's still with him we glimpse the ninetysomething still vigorous Wu himself briefly at the film's opening. Wu's alive and well now but in 1955 he was in a motor accident that caused him to stop playing. In his autobiography he wrote of this event that the God of competition abandoned him. Yet he still studies Go with passion.The film is punctuated with titles denoting major events in Wu's life along with a statement from his autobiography. Wu's pursuit of faith and search for relief from the intense mental stress of Go tournaments led him to join several religious cults which are depicted in the film.After Tian returned to filmmaking his first work was the relatively apolitical Ibsenesque Springtime in Another Town. The Go Master might be a safe way of returning to politics and history by approaching it through an apolitical man who lived in another country. But Tian never was never a stranger to controversy. His own vicissitudes and his growing maturity may simply have led him to respect a man devoted to the pursuit of inner goals.".

This biopic however seems to focus a lot more on Wu the man than Wu the go master. The titanic battles throughout his career are rarely depicted with more than one or two brief fast shots if at all. They are reflected in various points in the movie almost as if they were an afterthought. On the other hand we have detailed portrayals of him as a weak and gullible man sucked in by a sect reeking mysticism. That he was finally able to free himself of the hypnotic effect was due more to the determination of his sensible wife than his own wisdom. It is difficult to reconcile this persona with the godlike go master that we invariably perceive Wu as. But then the master by personally appearing at the beginning implicitly endorses this project.After being banned in China for 9 years since his The blue kite director Tian comes out of the deep freeze in 2002 with a remake of Springtime in a small town the original 1948 version of which has been considered by many as the best Chinese movie ever. It is understandable that against the biggerthanlife reputation of the original Tian version will have a hard time holding its own. Having watched both I would suggest that Tian's version does not suffer in comparison in any way. In the go master we see some of Tian's style in Springtime even though the subject matters are entirely different. There are the subtle tones and nuances that take communication beyond the dialogue of which we have few. The mood of the hue of the photography particularly what might have been blue filters are perceptible. One more thing and I'm done and it's about the game of go. It is misleading to characterize it as chesslike but simpler. The rules of the game are certainly simpler but if we follow the same logic of using the wrong criteria to assess certain things we may as well say that bridge is a simpler game compared with rockpapercissors because the latter requires making your move simultaneously with the opponent while in bridge you make it after your opponent or that the NFL playbooks are simpler than a guide to skipping ropes because a rope can be made into different shapes while a football cannot! Simple rules notwithstanding the permutations and combinations in a go game are astronomical.

	schema:headline " The go master of all times was illustrated as a person.";
	schema:reviewBody "The director Tian deliberately portrayed the human side of the all conquering master of all masters in the history of the game Wu Qingyuan. His victories and exploits were only briefly mentioned in the subtitles while his sufferings made up most parts of the film. His decision to apply for citizenship greatly tormented him. On the outbreak of the war he sought refuge in religion. He was shattered when it turned out to be nothing but a hoax. His winning streak ended after a traffic accident and he took it very badly. But by then he was almost 50 way past his prime. A delightful find was Sylvia Chang playing Wu's mother. The spirit of the game was most dramatically displayed not even the atom bomb at Hiroshima could stop a championship game played right there in the city.The greatness of Master Wu was subtly illustrated in the first and last game of go.

	onyx:emotionText "The director Tian deliberately portrayed the human side of the all conquering master of all masters in the history of the game Wu Qingyuan. His victories and exploits were only briefly mentioned in the subtitles while his sufferings made up most parts of the film. His decision to apply for citizenship greatly tormented him. On the outbreak of the war he sought refuge in religion. He was shattered when it turned out to be nothing but a hoax. His winning streak ended after a traffic accident and he took it very badly. But by then he was almost 50 way past his prime. A delightful find was Sylvia Chang playing Wu's mother. The spirit of the game was most dramatically displayed not even the atom bomb at Hiroshima could stop a championship game played right there in the city.The greatness of Master Wu was subtly illustrated in the first and last game of go. In a game of go the junior or lower ranking player always takes black and has the first move. In the first game Wu the young master played the first three stones in an unprecedented opening especially the third at the center of the board a taboo shunned by any player but firmed established himself as an innovator.

The main character appears very flat his life is dedicated entirely to the game of Go and to his religious faith. Since neither of these is presented in any detail it is hard for a viewer who is not familiar with them beforehand to understand what he's about. His interactions with the film's love interest whom he ends up marrying are as flat as the rest of it reading a note elicits some emotion from him but her presence does not. The film has a very episodic feel leaping from one scene and context to the next without much continuity. It sometimes feels like the historical political events of the period command more attention than the protagonist but they are not explained or narrated as they would be in a documentary. The film boasts good photography and a few scenes of interest but I found it consistently vapid on the whole.".

Don't get me wrong I am all for slow ponderous films Dolls by Takeshi Kitano is a superb example of such a film it's just a shame this was sooooo dull!".

He beat every single possible Go player and finished the famous Jubango in total twelve tournaments ten games per tournament. All these were condensed to one scene one passage one sentence in the movie. The last battle scene against the Honinbo Takagawa. It shows how the director arranged the movie and what he targeted on. Not win or lose but belief faith and Go which supported Wu along the life path and armed him for the inevitable turmoil.You will find the same setup again and again a shabby house.

And then the beautiful Japan seashore as in the painting.Wu's mentor said as a Go player you should die on the board. It is him who insisted the Honinbo tournament should be held during the war time.You will find the game in Hiroshima went on right after the bombing. In a sense a Go player is a samurai fighting on the board. He must obey the honor code.Yet a Go player has to retire or retreat once he is not able to win. A very cruel fact Wu had to accept. Then he became a mentor and eventually an ordinary man who lives peacefully. No more wars Wu reconciled with himself and the movie leads us back to the first scene philosophically.The drawback of the movie is that it IS fragmented. It introduces a lot of people without even telling you their names. I highly doubt that if you are not familiar with Wu you can recognize who is who for example Kita Fumiko in the beginning of the movie. Though it is not the main point at all since the director cut all the dramatic parts of Wu's achievements. The movie is centered around how to be stern and humble. It is universal the director used Go as an interface and Wu as an example.I as a mathematician want to remind you that the Go rules are simple yet there are no matching models. It is much harder a problem than Chess. Currently we only know the ending part.

It was a good decision to look at the events at Abu Gharib mainly through the eyes of the convicted military officers and of course the photographs speak for themselves. Apart from the depth of the material the filmmakers have done an outstanding job with the enactments the visuals and the brilliant music by Danny Elfman. Although the documentary does point out and emphasize that highranking officers were never imprisoned for the depicted crimes in my opinion the film does fail to ask many essential questions that I feel should have been included in this documentary. Such as Why do we insist seeing these events as more of an embarrassment on the part of the U.S. than an insult on the Iraqi prisoners? Since the soldiers frequently mention that they are just following orders who exactly are these orders coming from? Why will the U.S. Military not allow Charles Graner to be interviewed? What kind of a system is this that can categorize a completely naked detainee handcuffed backwards to his bed or another prisoner made to stand for a long time in a difficult position by the fear of being electrocuted as standard operating procedure? I am aware that the answers to these questions would stretch the format the director has chosen for this documentary but I still believe that Errol Morris should have looked more openly into these territories in order to have made an even bolder film and bold courageous and very well made this film certainly is.".

	schema:headline " Standard Operating Procedure";
	schema:reviewBody "In 2004 the media was full of accounts of the abuse torture and even murder of prisoners in the Abu Ghraib prison by Military Police. Photographs surfaced depicting prisoners naked and wearing cloth hoods and being forced to masturbate stand on boxes for fear of electrocution and forming human pyramids. Twelve soldiers were convicted and the commanding officer at the prison Brigadier General Janis Karpinski was demoted to the rank of Colonel. Errol Morris' documentary Standard Operating Procedure attempts to examine the atmosphere surrounding the abuse the people involved and whether it was all down to a few bad apples or if it was reflective of the American military as a whole.Morris keeps his authorial influence to a minimum instead allowing his subjects to speak for themselves. He has interviewed several of the soldiers involved including Lynndie England who can be seen in many of the photographs smiling pointing giving a thumbs up. She and the other soldiers interviewed describe with remarkable candour what it was like living in Abu Ghraib prison their relationships with each other and the prisoners and the events and tensions surrounding those incidents depicted in the photographs. It all paints a picture of the prison as a dark and stifling environment one just waiting to bring out the worst in people.The real centrepiece of the film though are the photographs. Even four years after they dominated every front page and bulletin they have lost none of their power to appal and disgust. Some like the picture of a man forced to stand arms outstretched on a box with a cloth bag on his head are surreal. Others like a photograph of Sabrina Harman giving a thumbs up over a dead prisoner are simply disturbing.And hovering above all of this are the OGA or Other Government Agencies an often used euphemism for the CIA. It was during the CIAled interrogations that the most heinous of human rights infractions were most likely carried out. But there are no photographs of these incidents. Standard Operating Procedure raises the point that it is these individuals who should have received the full brunt of the punishment but it was simpler to lay the blame on lower ranking officers like England and Harman.It is here that the main point of contention with Standard Operating Procedure arises. It is true that no one above the rank of Staff Sergeant was convicted. And it is true that this should not be the case that those higherranking officers who let this abuse play out under their noses should be held accountable. But Morris tries to divert too much of the blame away from those who were convicted. While England Harman and the others were just following orders and living in a deeply affecting environment they are also human beings endowed with free will. They could have said no at any time and just walked away.That Standard Operating Procedure raises these arguments means that it is worthy of our time. It presents the facts as perceived by those involved never itself commenting or judging. It leaves that to us so that we can make up our own minds. So that perhaps we can learn from the mistakes made by others and prevent them from happening again.".

She and the other soldiers interviewed describe with remarkable candour what it was like living in Abu Ghraib prison their relationships with each other and the prisoners and the events and tensions surrounding those incidents depicted in the photographs. It all paints a picture of the prison as a dark and stifling environment one just waiting to bring out the worst in people.The real centrepiece of the film though are the photographs. Even four years after they dominated every front page and bulletin they have lost none of their power to appal and disgust. Some like the picture of a man forced to stand arms outstretched on a box with a cloth bag on his head are surreal. Others like a photograph of Sabrina Harman giving a thumbs up over a dead prisoner are simply disturbing.And hovering above all of this are the OGA or Other Government Agencies an often used euphemism for the CIA. It was during the CIAled interrogations that the most heinous of human rights infractions were most likely carried out. But there are no photographs of these incidents. Standard Operating Procedure raises the point that it is these individuals who should have received the full brunt of the punishment but it was simpler to lay the blame on lower ranking officers like England and Harman.It is here that the main point of contention with Standard Operating Procedure arises. It is true that no one above the rank of Staff Sergeant was convicted. And it is true that this should not be the case that those higherranking officers who let this abuse play out under their noses should be held accountable. But Morris tries to divert too much of the blame away from those who were convicted. While England Harman and the others were just following orders and living in a deeply affecting environment they are also human beings endowed with free will. They could have said no at any time and just walked away.That Standard Operating Procedure raises these arguments means that it is worthy of our time. It presents the facts as perceived by those involved never itself commenting or judging. It leaves that to us so that we can make up our own minds. So that perhaps we can learn from the mistakes made by others and prevent them from happening again.";

	schema:headline " Too tight a focus on a familiar subject without the searing questions bigger picture or soulsearching that it required";
	schema:reviewBody "Errol Morris has covered some interesting and weird subjects and I found his last film Fog of War to be quite fascinating so I was looking forward to seeing where he went next. I was quite surprised that he chose to do a documentary on Iraq. Sure it is totally the subject of our time but it has become a very cluttered subject  not only in documentary films but also the amount of news coverage etc that is available. When I learnt that the film would be a tight focus on Abu Ghraib I hoped that Morris would explore the total human aspect of it and do a really good job of delivering this part of it.Unfortunately what Morris manages to produce is a film that is solid but not as remarkable as the subject deserves. Part of this it must be said is familiarity with the subject having seen many films that do it better. Taxi to the Dark Side comes to mind specifically because it uses the prison as its starting point before following the smell upwards and outwards to paint a much bigger picture of failure and things that are impacting beyond specific acts of torture. By remaining within the world of the prison Morris potentially could do enough to standout as being THE film on the subject. The early signs are good because I was surprised to see several of the main namesfaces that I knew from the news coverage of the scandal and thus this was going to be the story from those involved firsthand. This was a gamble in a way because the problem with the aftermath of Abu Ghraib was that it was only the little people that got the spotlight and nobody else and by focusing on them Morris needed to get a lot from them or else his film would end up the same way.He does this to a point as they discuss in detail what they did and what they saw and it does still have the power to shock and depress. In some regards the anger described makes the violence a little understandable but what I was shocked by was the sheer banality and boredominspired viciousness of it all. It helps this aspect that so many of the contributions are delivered in such matteroffact manners that it does jar that they don't seem shocked by what they are describing. The truth is probably that they aren't  partly because it was normal but also that they have discussed it many times. Everyone is a bit defensive and Morris doesn't ever manage to draw much emotion from them in the telling  factually the material is engaging but Morris never really gets beyond that. While Taxi to the Dark Side moved up the chain of command Morris needed to move into his interviewees' soul  something he doesn't manage to do.The second failing of the film is the overuse of recreated scenes and asides. In Thin Blue Line it cost him at very least an Oscar nomination but here it has a negative impact immediately as you are watching it. With so much shocking reality to discuss and so many real images some of the recreations are clunky in how out of place they are. I'm not talking about the creative sequences that Morris uses as a bed for dialogue eg a cellblock full of shredded paper the letters written back to a partner in the US but rather the recreations and stuff around the pictures. It was unnecessary and distracted from what as real and powerful enough.The film still works as a good summary of events within Abu Ghraib but it is hard to get excited about it since so much of it feels familiar. The tight focus itself is not an issue but it is when Morris cannot manage to produce searing questions a bigger picture or intimate soulsearching it doesn't ever do anything that makes it standout in a crowded marketplace.".

	schema:reviewBody "The wellknown documentary filmmaker Errol Morris who received an Oscar for his 2003 study of Robert McNamara and Vietnam 'The Fog of War' has put the Abu Ghraib scandal under a microscope but the result is too limited a picture of events.Morris' film describes and shows the humiliations the nude prisoners cuffed in stress positions or forced to masturbate or pile on top of each other with bags or women's underpants on their heads the man they called Gilligan in the fringed blanket with the conical hat standing on a box with fake electrical wiring to his fingers the howling dogs terrifying a squatting naked man and biting another's leg the corpse of a man beaten to death packed in bags of ice.The images both stills and some fragments of videotapes have a dramatic and quickly sickening effect. The circumstances of their taking is thoroughly explained. But the result is disappointingly narrow and obsessive because Morris has allowed the lowranking Americans implicated by the pictures the majority of them concerned only with their own fates and future to be the dominant voices of the film. The exceptions are a crude but more experienced interrogator a precise but morally numb military investigator and the angry general Janis Karpinski who was scapegoated because she was commander of the MPs.Rory Kennedy's 'The Ghosts of Abu Ghraib' produced for HBO last year has already presented all this information about the photo scandaltogether with the larger context Morris has left out. Alex Gibney's 'Taxi to the Dark Side' thoroughly explored the larger implicationsthe responsibilities that go all the way up the distribution of prison abuses throughout Afghanistan Iran and Guantnamo the violations of international law and the inadequacy of torture as an interrogation device. By specifically focusing on the beating and death of the taxi driver named Dilawar at the Bagram prison in Afghanistan Gibney showed much more detail than Morris about the specifics of one prisoner and the full extent of the physical brutality of US interrogators and guards. Anyone coming to Morris' film from Kennedy's and Gibney's will find it incomplete.'Standard Operating Procedure' doesn't follow up on any Iraqis. Perhaps because Morris' mostly unheard questions were aggressive his talking heads are always on the defensive repeating that they were only softening up the prisoners as instructed. Lynndie England protests that she was in love with her boss Charles Graner and just did what he said. They do admit their process included sleep deprivation hypothermia loud noises and also when they lost patience or just felt like it random physical abuse. We learn from the more experienced interrogator that his young associates were useless with high value prisoners. We also learn that no worthwhile information came out of interrogations at the prison. Karpinski explains how heavily overpopulated her prisons became any suspects once held hard to release.Morris commits several serious stylistic errors. He introduces fake basementtape video reenactments a device he has used before to augment the visuals of the Abu Ghraib abusescloseups of prisoners' bodies blood dripping on a uniform keys going into a lockso that after a while you aren't sure what is real and what is fake. The genuine images needed no enhancement and this confusion is a terrible mistake. The score by Danny Elfman with its heavyhanded drumbeat sounds introduces frantic melodrama also superfluous and in bad taste.In fact Morris' material which ought to have been allowed to speak for itself is permeated by the banality of evil. The words of the MPs including Megan Ambuhl Javal Davis and Jeremy Sivitz as well as most notably in this context the two women amateur photographers Lynndie England and Sabrina Harman are notable for their lack of affect. There is no drama about them. Apart for one or two shaky expressions of doubt awareness that all this wasn't right especially on the part of Sabrina Harmon writing to her wife Katie back home they tend to speak as people going about what they believed to be their jobs doing what others did and what everybody knew was being done at Abu Ghraib. Except it seems General Karpinski because she was traveling from one prison to another and says the ugliness was hidden from her. Perhaps it was. There's not much effort to question or puncture any of this testimony.The film's title refers to the army investigator's conclusion that the majority of the photographed humiliations and punishments were Standard Operating Procedure and only certain scenes of physical injury could be classified as documenting crimes. This indulgence is something Morris does not explore further however. 'Taxi to the Dark Side' goes much more thoroughly into the issue of torture. The distinction between torture and humiliation Morris alludes to seems less important than how the whole pattern of sordid conduct at the prisons get started a topic 'Standard Operating Procedure' doesn't investigate. We have just had President Bush's admission that he knew and approved highlevel meetings inside the White House on harsh interrogation tactics. Morris does not set the Abu Ghraib scandal within this larger framework.We do hear that children were imprisoned and that there were children raped by prisoners and the prisoners were beaten and injured for that. We're briefly told that methods were transferred to Abu Ghraib from Guantnamo. It's all prefaced by a description of what a disgusting place Abu Ghraib was when the MPs and other American staff came to live therewith constant bombardment because in violation of international law but we are not told that Abu Ghraib was not behind the lines. This is presented elsewhere by some as mitigating circumstance. The lowranking Abu Ghraib scandal scapegoats were not only just following orders or S.O.P. they were under stress. Stuff happens. Here again Morris doesn't connect the dots. Some will like that. The much admired often awarded Morris is a sacred cow. But this time his result seems more repulsive than effective.".

Here he demonstrates that he has no intellectual or critical filter with which to sift facts. So when one interviewee mentions the three cameras used to take the pictures at Abu G we get a special effects image of each camera model floating in space as if this were some revelatory moment. When it is revealed that during an amnesty period after the Abu G scandal was revealed many photos and other documents were handed in a shredded we get not just a slow mo of shredded paper falling through the air we get also get an entire cell block filled with bits of paper. In other words every moment is punctuated with Morris's subtext you're just too dumb to get what you just heard and I'm so enthralled with my movie making skills that I'm going to beat you over the head with this.

	schema:headline " Very flawed documentary";
	schema:reviewBody "Errol Morris's new documentary Standard Operating Procedure attempts to challenge the very medium of photography and bring to light the injustices at Abu Ghraib. The film somewhat succeeds in the first respect but fumbles its way through the second. Documentaries are inherently subjective and set out to portray a certain angle that being said what Director Errol Morris says are his intentions and what appears on the screen are two totally different things. The film stumbles through the events at Abu Ghraib but fails to retain any real emotion fluidity or energy throughout the work. Let's look at the good first. Errol Morris takes an interesting stance by constantly asking the viewers What's outside the frame? In a sense he's questioning the very medium he is using. This questioned is answered somewhat through testimonies but also quite literally by showing viewers photographs before they were cropped such as the infamous leach photograph. Errol using some interesting techniques most noticeably the use of the interotron. The interotron is a screen similar to a TelePrompTer that allows the interviewee to look directly into the camera allowing for a more genuine first person feel to the film.However for everything Errol Morris does right there are a myriad of things done wrong here. While the cinematography of the film interviews via the interotron is interesting the editing that pieces it together is awful. The film will cut different angles of the same person talking with gaps of black transition that last for almost two seconds. These pauses of black beg you to question Is the film over? which is always no. The film clocks in at 117 minutes but it might as well be four hours long because that's what it feels like. You can only watch people talk at you for so long. Morris attempts to spice up the picture by using grainy melodramatic slow motion sequences that serve little purpose other than to pad an already long film's running time and to flesh out images of his imagination in an attempt to sway the audience to his kind of thinking. Errol Morris has stated on several occasions that Standard Operating Procedure is not a political film. It sure feels like one. Morris paints himself as a detective similarly to the way he did in The Thin Blue Line attempting to bring those truly responsible to justice. Those in the picture are responsible but he wants to go after those higher up who ordered the interrogation techniques and knew what was going on. The film merely graces that aspect pointing a broad finger towards higher command and Bush administration. instead the film indulges in the American atrocities committed at Abu Ghraib while sympathizing with those who were jailed. Morris also blatantly hints towards the fact that every cell block in every prison in Iraq is performing this sort of torture to this degree. Why no photographs of any other cell block have not leaked you can decide. Standard Operating Procedure is a failed documentary in that it attempts to be investigative but is so subjective in it's material that it just comes off as a fumbling clump of information. Nothing is truly resolved and more questions are asked than answered. It does give slightly more insight to the happenings at Abu Ghraib but at almost two hours S.O.P. is self aggrandizing and indulgent. Morris's political beliefs cloud his objectivity the way he paints it President Bush and Rumsfeld were fully aware from the beginning and actively trying to cover it up. Why would Morris take this approach? Because large government conspiracies are a whole lot more interesting than isolated incidents. In the end there isn't a whole lot of reporting going on here as much as speculating.".

	schema:reviewBody "We're all familiar with the images that began flowing out of Abu Ghraib Prison in the spring of 2004  photos showing detainees some terrorists others undoubtedly not hooded and stripped forced to assume painful andor humiliating positions often for hours on end with American soldiers posing gleefully nearby smiling and flashing thumbsup signs for the camera. Once the pictures went viral they came to symbolize not only the botched operation that was the Iraq war but the fundamental failure of the U.S. military to win friends and influence people in a land the Bush administration claimed vehemently to be liberating. In Standard Operating Procedure famed documentary filmmaker Errol Morris The Thin Blue Line attempts to uncover the truth behind those photographs mainly by allowing those who were most closely involved with the scandal to tell the story in their own words including Private First Class Lynndie England who whether fairly or unfairly emerged as the one clearly identifiable face and household name from the scandal. Morris provides no voiceover narration to accompany the interviews just reenactments of the incidents done in a quasisurrealistic style using slow motion photography and artsy graphics.Through his discussions with the principal players in the drama Morris provides a probing study of the effects of war time stress on the human psyche. The film offers no easy answers as to exactly why the events at Abu Ghraib unfolded as they did yet while it doesn't turn the individuals involved into easytoblame villains it doesn't completely exonerate them either. In fact it is the seeming normalcy of these people as they attempt to make their case for the camera that renders their actions all the more unsettling. Morris also makes it clear that these low level individuals  many of whom have served time in prison for their crimes  were most certainly used as scapegoats for higherups in the military who managed to successfully deflect any personal culpability for the events that took place there.In a true journalistic coup Morris was able to obtain grainy home movies shot at the same time that the pictures were being taken. As a result we're able to witness the stepbystep process by which that infamous shot of the naked men stacked in a pyramid formation ultimately came about.Standard Operating Procedure doesn't successfully address all the questions it sets out to answer but that is hardly a weakness of the film since it is dealing with a complex messy situation involving complex messy people caught up in a complex messy war. One doesn't leave Standard Operating Procedure necessarily more enlightened that when one went in  just more wellinformed. And that's perhaps the best one could reasonably hope for under the circumstances.".

	schema:headline " Morris delivers another very good piece of nonfiction";
	schema:reviewBody "'Standard Operating Procedure' is a hardhitting doc made by famed nonfiction American filmmaker Errol Morris. Morris has been making documentaries since the late 70s and has since become synonymous with the form of filmmaking. His latest film covers events that occurred in 2003 in Abu Ghraib Iraq which saw American soldiers abusing Iraqi prisoners in a number of humiliating and torturous ways.Morris' authorial stamp is made very clear on the film from early on through the use of talking head interviews and reconstructed footage. One of his more famous films 'The Thin Blue Line' was actually rejected from consideration for the Oscar category of nonfiction film because it has too much reconstructed footage in it. The most important facet of the documentary though is the inclusion of a great number of photographs that depict all the heinous acts that took place in the prison  all taken by three of the soldiers in the prison of their own free will. In short the photographs depict naked Iraqi men in sexually humiliating circumstances with the American soldiers smiling with their thumbs up right next to them. Other photographs include a dead Iraqi man in a body bag a picture of a bloodied prisoner after being attacked by a dog and more.The photos not only exposed the whole scandal but they were hard evidence that it actually happened. This is something that's often spoken about in the documentary with people saying that the photographs are an objective representation of what happened and everything you need to know is in the frame. But this logic is then complicated when we discover that some photos have been cropped and manipulated. One interviewee even states that the photographs are taken out of context and you need more information to understand what the photo's representing. The whole idea of objectivity and representation seems to interestingly reflect the function of a documentary to represent 'reality' which is undoubtedly a subtext Morris was going for. The big question though is why did these people take these incredibly condemning photographs of themselves?To be clear this was a ridiculously stupid thing for the American soldiers to do  it's like a bank robber taking a picture of themselves robbing a bank. When you're actually watching the talking head interviews with the people that committed the acts you can't help but feel they're confused. They try to justify themselves saying that they were taking the pictures with the intent on exposing the mistreatment of these people but it certainly didn't pan out that way. And the limp excuses for the thumbs up and smiles were 'I never know what to do with my hands in pictures' and 'When someone takes a photo you smile it's normal'. It's as if they don't understand the grand severity of the ethical injustices they've just committed it's really incredible. Morris presents their shallow and ignorant defences on a plate letting the viewer independently judge these people.There's quite a spread of interviewees throughout the documentary and it doesn't take long before you're able to distinguish who's smart who's reliable who's experienced and so on. One that stands out is Brent Pack who was in charge of going through the hundreds of photos and creating a timeline out of them. He is a seasoned exDesert Storm field agent who from experience tells us that the ethics and rules during war time become 'fuzzy'. He explains that these soldiers were being shelled day in and day out whilst they witnessed fellow soldiers come back scarred from the horrors of war. The anxiety and frenzy of war clearly resulted in contempt towards anything Iraqi and Pack puts this forward as a sort of quasijustification.But the real shock of this documentary has yet to be revealed. It comes in a short sequence nearing the end when pictures are showed on screen and Pack labels all of them either 'Criminal Activity' or 'Standard Operating Procedure' or S.O.P.. Many of the pictures are identified as 'Criminal Activity' because they depict a soldier sexually humiliating a prisoner or something similar. However there was one scenario in particular covered in the film about a prisoner that was told to stand up straight or else the wires that were tied to him would electrocute him. Except the wires had no electric current running through them so this was deemed 'S.O.P.'  in other words 'legal' and 'just' because it was a means to extract information from a prisoner. This was just one instance of prisoner treatment that was deemed S.O.P. and it's a truly stunning revelation made by the film. It's further exacerbated by the fact that some of the prisoners weren't even terrorists they were bakers or welders taken from their homes.The unethical acts committed by these people is the focal point of this film but I feel that Morris wants the headline to be that some of these things are actually permitted by the U.S. military. I can't help but feel that's the takehome truth from this documentary. Overall this film really hits you in the jaw with some excruciatingly heavy subject matter but it's worth it by how wellcrafted expositional and informative it is.My Rating 7.910I have a bunch of other filmmusic reviews up here httpssomespiltmilk.wordpress.com".

	onyx:emotionText "'Standard Operating Procedure' is a hardhitting doc made by famed nonfiction American filmmaker Errol Morris. Morris has been making documentaries since the late 70s and has since become synonymous with the form of filmmaking. His latest film covers events that occurred in 2003 in Abu Ghraib Iraq which saw American soldiers abusing Iraqi prisoners in a number of humiliating and torturous ways.Morris' authorial stamp is made very clear on the film from early on through the use of talking head interviews and reconstructed footage. One of his more famous films 'The Thin Blue Line' was actually rejected from consideration for the Oscar category of nonfiction film because it has too much reconstructed footage in it. The most important facet of the documentary though is the inclusion of a great number of photographs that depict all the heinous acts that took place in the prison  all taken by three of the soldiers in the prison of their own free will. In short the photographs depict naked Iraqi men in sexually humiliating circumstances with the American soldiers smiling with their thumbs up right next to them. Other photographs include a dead Iraqi man in a body bag a picture of a bloodied prisoner after being attacked by a dog and more.The photos not only exposed the whole scandal but they were hard evidence that it actually happened.

	schema:headline " You may look at photographs in a different way after seeing this";
	schema:reviewBody "When looking at almost any photograph it is natural to wonder about the backstory about the context in which it was taken. I think that was the motivation for this documentary based on the infamous photos taken in the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq.While the investigations into the backstory of the photos out of Abu Ghraib reveal valuable insights into the horrors of that place it is seen that extrapolating a backstory from a picture can often be misleading. For example perhaps the most famous photo form Abu Ghraib of the guy standing on a box wearing a tattered shawl with wires dangling from his outstretched hands appears to have been staged primarily for the photo. He was provided the shawl since it was cold and shortly after the photos were taken the wires which were never connected to any power source were removed. Upon review by an investigator this procedure was viewed as Standard Operating Procedure. What does a photo of a bloodstained floor say? Is it evidence of some horrible torture having taken place or perhaps the blood of an insane man who was butting his head against a wall or maybe the blood of a U.S. soldier who was shot by a prisoner using a smuggled gun? Lynndie England the smiling young woman in so many of the photos like the one with her leading a prisoner on a leash points out that the leash was slack and she was not dragging the guy and she was doing this to satisfy the desires of her lover. After seeing this film you might be more hesitant to draw conclusions based on certain photos. Of course most of the photos such as the ones of the pyramids of nude prisoners or the sequence of photos of the corpse of alJamadi document atrocities that can hardly be explained away by any imaginable context and such practices were indeed judged as criminal. Prison sentences were meted out to many of the soldiers involved. But the documentary makes it quite clear that only lowlevel soldiers were ever sentenced while it was evident that their antics were known and passed over by higher level people.I think the film succeeds in its narrow focus of trying to understand how the photos came to be and who was involved in taking them. The bulk of the documentary consists of interviews with the people most directly involved. Of course each of those people tried to put the best light on their behavior with varying degrees of success. I felt the most successful person in this regard was Sabrina Harman whose letters home documented what she was experiencing at the time and indicated a sympathetic personality. The fact that she got sucked into this morass is disturbing. She said I don't know what else I could have done and expressed regret for ever having joined the military. Director Morris lets his interviewees just talk without interjecting comments or questions. I was struck by the fact that none of them expressed any great regret or terrible guilt about what they had done but maybe they were so traumatized by it that it was too soon for them to address that. Or maybe the environment they were operating in permitted them to rationalize that what they were doing was all right and they have carried that attitude forward? Or maybe they were indeed uncaring jerks. But the film tries to convince you and I think succeeds that they were not monsters. Some of the interviewees do give evidence of having been stuck in a hellbeing at the bottom of the food chain bucking the system was not an easy option and going along with the accepted procedures was.What you seem to have had there was a bunch of young people who were in no way trained or equipped to handle what was happening. The real culprits were the interrogators who were doing the tortures and those who were establishing the procedures and those people were not filmed. As was pointed out if the Abu Ghraib photos had never come to light nobody outside those involved would ever have known about this. Makes you nervous about how much we don't know.Most of the interviews are not continuous sequences but are pieced together from segments. This has he distracting effect of having the talking heads pop up at different locations on the screen during an interview. I am sure Morris could have minimized this so I am puzzled by this decision. I have some qualms about the reenactments but it is pretty clear what is real and what is staged. You may or may not find the ponderous musical score effective.This is a rare instance where I found the director's commentary track to be illuminating and well worth sitting through. Usually you just get things like It was cold the day when we shot this or We had to get up at 4 AM that day. Morris' commentary expands on the issues of the film and he tells what he was trying to accomplish in many of the scenes and what he wanted to accomplish with the film in general. Also he points out things that you may have missed on first viewing. If Morris is to be believed the tragedy of Abu Ghraib was that no valuable intelligence was extracted from any of the prisoners in this sorry affair. Saddam was apprehended by soldiers on the ground not by intelligence.I came away from this with a different outlook than what I went in with. What more can you ask of a film?".

Of course most of the photos such as the ones of the pyramids of nude prisoners or the sequence of photos of the corpse of alJamadi document atrocities that can hardly be explained away by any imaginable context and such practices were indeed judged as criminal. Prison sentences were meted out to many of the soldiers involved. But the documentary makes it quite clear that only lowlevel soldiers were ever sentenced while it was evident that their antics were known and passed over by higher level people.I think the film succeeds in its narrow focus of trying to understand how the photos came to be and who was involved in taking them. The bulk of the documentary consists of interviews with the people most directly involved. Of course each of those people tried to put the best light on their behavior with varying degrees of success. I felt the most successful person in this regard was Sabrina Harman whose letters home documented what she was experiencing at the time and indicated a sympathetic personality. The fact that she got sucked into this morass is disturbing. She said I don't know what else I could have done and expressed regret for ever having joined the military. Director Morris lets his interviewees just talk without interjecting comments or questions. I was struck by the fact that none of them expressed any great regret or terrible guilt about what they had done but maybe they were so traumatized by it that it was too soon for them to address that. Or maybe the environment they were operating in permitted them to rationalize that what they were doing was all right and they have carried that attitude forward? Or maybe they were indeed uncaring jerks. But the film tries to convince you and I think succeeds that they were not monsters. Some of the interviewees do give evidence of having been stuck in a hellbeing at the bottom of the food chain bucking the system was not an easy option and going along with the accepted procedures was.What you seem to have had there was a bunch of young people who were in no way trained or equipped to handle what was happening. The real culprits were the interrogators who were doing the tortures and those who were establishing the procedures and those people were not filmed. As was pointed out if the Abu Ghraib photos had never come to light nobody outside those involved would ever have known about this. Makes you nervous about how much we don't know.Most of the interviews are not continuous sequences but are pieced together from segments. This has he distracting effect of having the talking heads pop up at different locations on the screen during an interview. I am sure Morris could have minimized this so I am puzzled by this decision. I have some qualms about the reenactments but it is pretty clear what is real and what is staged. You may or may not find the ponderous musical score effective.This is a rare instance where I found the director's commentary track to be illuminating and well worth sitting through. Usually you just get things like It was cold the day when we shot this or We had to get up at 4 AM that day. Morris' commentary expands on the issues of the film and he tells what he was trying to accomplish in many of the scenes and what he wanted to accomplish with the film in general. Also he points out things that you may have missed on first viewing. If Morris is to be believed the tragedy of Abu Ghraib was that no valuable intelligence was extracted from any of the prisoners in this sorry affair. Saddam was apprehended by soldiers on the ground not by intelligence.I came away from this with a different outlook than what I went in with. What more can you ask of a film?";

I totally understand not to expect much out of brainless idiots who accept to go to war for NO REASON but this goes far beyond stupidity this is actual cruelty..This documentary does a great job of staying out of personal and emotional opinions or reactions no judgements are made on these knuckle dragging soldiers which does give everyone the chance to make up their own mind which some would say is a good thing others like myself would totally disagree. We have to educate these people not give them the possibility to take this documentary and turn it into something they can laugh about and enjoy. So following that logic I think the film makers should have voiced their disgust and shame towards these soldiers..All in all this is a very informative documentary that has much to show to the rest of the world. The biggest lesson these soldiers should take is IF YOU REALLY THOUGHT WHAT WAS GOING ON WAS WRONG THEN DON'T PUT YOURSELF IN THAT SITUATION...It's so simple... all these excuses of the little people got thrown under the bus etc.. just doesn't fly.. STOP with the pathetic excuses that you HAD to do it.. the biggest strength is in numbers.. and by the sounds of it they all thought these humiliating and torturous acts were wrong.. hummm... There seems to be an error in logic there.. Either they all thought it was wrong but not wrong enough to challenge each other on such a subject. Or...

I think Nazi Germany did it once  let's not copy them too much shall we? I realize that there are many good servicemen and servicewomen who have something more in their heads than pardon me spunk but they are outnumbered by idiots. Sorry. Intelligent well educated responsible sensitive critically thinking and open minded individuals don't make it to the army! Period. They just don't.

Feels good doesn't it? To be save knowing that your side is the one delivering the blows and not receiving them. I'm sure that Wehrmacht and the SS personnel would tell you with at most conviction they were fighting the good war and for all the right reasons.That is the responsibility I'm talking about. Social moral and human responsibility for one's actions. From the Government down to the least important private in the service. But that's the kind of thinking we're not ready for yet. Too forward. Army responsible for their actions ha ha! See if the military is a profession why don't they have unions? It is because they are slaves! Obeying orders is a domain of slaves...or animals. That's what I could never understand  how can you possibly as a sovereign individual act simply because someone tells you to? And that someone is not at all obliged to explain themselves to you or explain the reasons for using you to carry out their wishes.

	schema:headline " Rocket.....Yeah!";
	schema:reviewBody "This is one weird movie. I guess the best way to describe this would be sort of a Thai version of Robin Hood in which the hero Dan Chupong uses rockets instead of arrows. And boy does this guy have some rockets! He has a ton of little rockets that he shoots at the bad guys and then there's the bad boy that he can ride like a surfboard! I'm definitely going to Thailand for my fireworks this year. And apparently he has flint in his fingertips to light these rockets. That's probably good because you really don't want to be wasting time fumbling around with matches when you are single handedly taking out a large group of cattle rustlers. This is one really weird movie that also features a man who can change from a goofy guy with hair that resembles a tidal wave to an older warrior guy who can fight with the best of them. There is also a wizard at least I think that's what he was supposed to be a tractor talk of menstrual blood and guys who seem to be possessed by spirits of animals that run like monkeys and can jump about fifty feet. Did I mention the hero rides a rocket? As for the fight scenes since this is really what it's all about they are mostly average. Dan Chupong is good check out the much better Born To Fight but he doesn't have very many moves. He can do some Tony Jaalike kicks and flying knees but they don't have quite the same ring to them as Jaa's. And the director of this movie really loves to show guys getting hit and then spinning in the air about ten times before hitting the ground. That's all good once in awhile but it gets old after about the fifth time. There is a couple of good stunts in the movie as well but unlike Ong Bak this movie uses CGI and wirework for a lot of stunts. If you think a guy riding a big rocket would look ridiculous you are absolutely right. And judging by some of the extras I watched this was apparently supposed to be a comedy as well as an action movie. You will definitely laugh but not at the intended humor which doesn't translate well to the American audience. So in conclusion the fight scenes were nothing special and this was a very weird movie.".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Dynamite Warrior";
	schema:reviewBody "Dan Chupong probably got the role of his career so far when he got cast as the mysterious masked Crow Ghost in Ong Bak 2 and kicked Tony Jaa's rear in the film. It's a pity that he still doesn't get much recognition on his own accord given what's essentially his marquee films such as Born to Fight which I had watched some time back on the big screen and enjoyed and this one titled Dynamite Warrior.Which is one heck of a ride as well as far as an action movie is concerned. Chupong plays the titular character aptly named because of his arsenal containing rockets of all shapes and sizes which can be used as an offensive weapon such as projectiles with an explosive tip or defensively to provide a quick boost in a modified escape vehicle for the late 19th century. Alternatively some are large enough for him to ride on as well. Yes you read me right Chupong's Jone Bang Fai is the quintessential explosives man complete with Muay Thai elbow and knee moves to mop up and cripple opponents lucky enough to survive his shock andawe missile barrage.But of course you know the story can't be all too serious since it's a fusion of science and mythical elements with evil wizards and spells being part of the equation on the villainous end which our hero has to do combat with. In his quest to search for the killer of his parents Jone Bang Fai conducts raids on buffalo traders and soon come up against Lord Waeng Leo Putt an evil aristocrat with a cleft lip whose invention the Tractor gets no sales because the Thai farmers are still used to their buffaloes. So Waeng hatches a plan to eliminate the traditional competition and this sets him on a collision course with Jone.Part of the fun here is the sword and sorcery type of storyline and characters especially with Nai Hoi Sing Samart Thipthamai who proves to be quite the combatant since he's magical tattoo gives him superpowers and the ability to discharge blows from a distance making him quite untouchable. He also has the ability to ignite his followers Bak Paen Wichai Promchan and Bak Kaan Ampol Rattanawong into using fighting monkey and tiger moves which adds to the fun factor somewhat as they go up against the Black Wizard Panna Rittikrai who has a secret weapon through the use of a virgin's menstrual blood Yes you read this right too! and backed by Lord Waeng and his tough guy henchman with a voracious appetite played by Somdej Keawlue.The story contains its usual twists and turns and provides for some nice though expected development of the plot and the only time when it sagged was when it decided to focus on the romantic aspects between Jone and the Black Wizard's daughter Sao Kanyapak Suworakood in a shy guy meets outcast girl routine which took quite a while because well we the audience accompanies Jone in waiting for her next menstrual cycle. But everything was worth the wait as it was a precursor to one of the largest fight sequences to take place in a cop station before the finale all out assault on the baddies lair.Chupong dishes out plenty of of punishment as Jone Bang Fai and if you're a fan of Tony Jaa I don't see why you won't take to Dan Chupong and his brand of martial arts. The supporting cast especially that of Samart Thipthamai also makes many of the fight scenes in the film worthwhile and sequence after sequence just builds on what the previous had accomplished making it a more than satisfying finale battle between good and evil with plenty of bone crunching action to satisfy action fans anywhere. It's not a perfect film but it contains many elements that make this a fun movie to sit through being entertaining at its core. Dan Chupong really should have made a bigger impact and that remains to be seen with bated breath.".

For that reason alone you should see this movie just be prepared for a LOT of SILLINESS with bottle rockets the size of courier tubes and complete ignorance of gravity and physics and editing in some of the stunts.This is a great movie for teens into martial arts movies since it has a light handling of adult situations that if I were directing would probably result in this movie being banned in 18 countries. I think the roughest scene is when one guy takes a bite out of another guy and even that is handled pretty lightly.All that cartoonish mockery of a real film experience aside this a fun little movie about a dude that has stupid bottle rockets and killer Muay Thai skill and a score to settle with a Cattle thief in pre industrial revulsion some call it revolution Thailand.He pairs up with some unlikely allies that started off as dire enemies to fight the ghost of a wizard who is a ghost from his past using magical amulets to trap demons etc...I gave this movie an extra two points for being one of the only movies I know of to depict the Thai tradition of finding your animal spirit which is a ritual celebrated at Wai Kru festival where tattoos are made of a psychedelic ink that then creates a trance where the recipients become the animal the tattoo depicts  this is covered with two characters having tiger and monkey spirits respectively and a wizard activating their tattoos. Of course this is a Hollywood 7 second treatment of an all day ritual but it was still a fun nod to Thai history.Thai are a very proud people and this shows in their film making they make a few nods to American movie making but the script continually resounds with a centrism on the Thai probably because the story is in Thailand . This is directed by one of the camera men for Tom yum goong.The movie also mocks kung fu at the end which is a long held tradition apparently to make fun of the weaker kung fu compared to the monstrous brutality of Muay Thai and Krabi Krabong.".

And I sat down to watch it because I do like the Asian cinema quite a lot and with this being a martial arts movie then that was just all the better.Dynamite Warrior certainly has lots of actions throughout the course of the entire movie. And it is what keeps the movie afloat to be honest. This movie is rather fast paced.They had written in some rather interesting characters to fill out the movie. And the character gallery was working very well in favor of the movie.This was a good combination of action and comedy. The action and martial arts sequences were nicely choreographed.

And I sat down to watch it because I do like the Asian cinema quite a lot and with this being a martial arts movie then that was just all the better.Dynamite Warrior certainly has lots of actions throughout the course of the entire movie. And it is what keeps the movie afloat to be honest. This movie is rather fast paced.They had written in some rather interesting characters to fill out the movie. And the character gallery was working very well in favor of the movie.This was a good combination of action and comedy. The action and martial arts sequences were nicely choreographed.

First it starts off with some exciting action then degrades into a truly spectacular piece of crap with a giant a wizard and a monkey man.Yes I'm being serious.Once we met the wizard I turned it off. No action in the world was good enough to make me keep watching.This movie had some truly awful acting even for Thai movies this was bad. The action? boring with one or 2 memorable scenes which I already saw on the trailer. The hero? only uses his knees. watching him kick the crap out of people the same exact way for 20 minutes gets boring...fast.Special effects? My god they were bad...i mean we had the hero riding a rocket like a surfboard....Christ almighty can you believe that crap?! I feel stupider just having watched this movie I urge you to save some brain cells and skip it. Watch Ong Bak watch Tom Yum Goong heck watch em twice just don't watch this movie.Inferno".

After many Thai disappointments i decided to put this movie in the to watch at an ulterior date box. I finally decided to give it a go.So once again another Thai movie that do everything it can to make me uninterested in the protagonists. I am not hard to please a good old revenge flick is usually a winning formula for me. Yet this is exactly the case here a revenge plot yet its far from being in the winning category i am afraid.The martial arts are not bad at all some scenes are actually pretty cool but the problem is there is some downs in the movie where nothing happen in term of action and the story is just simply uninteresting mostly because of the characters. The whole rocket flying main dude was just ridiculous the wizard character and the other guy using magic consist mostly of making small explosion of sand and having the enemies jump around taking away the interest for me in the genuine action scenes And finally the 2 other bad guys the cannibal big dude and the guy trying to sell them tractor are just so cartoon... only the Thais can pull out that much cartoonish characters.All the non sense in the movie drive me away from what could had been a cool driven by revenge flick with spectacular martial arts. Yes Dan Chupong may not be Tony Jaa but he still pull out great choreography's.The problem with Thai movies for me is that there is always non sense that make me roll my eyes and kill any interest i may have in the movie. Maybe its because i am a westerner but i don't see to have that much problem with Chinese movies even the more traditional ones. If anything some like Ip Man with Donnie Yen are among my favourite movies.I do not recommend Dynamite Warrior unless you don't mind those Thai setups and are crazy for martial arts no matter the story. I hesitated to watch it for a long time over 1 year and still it was exactly what i tough it was. Back to the pawnshop...next.".

I could care less about seeing her naked but if you are playing a stripper you might have to at least imply nudity with well placed hands.Someone decided to inject humor into the movie into the most awkward places. The biggest problem was trying to figure out why people were laughing more during the serious parts than the funny parts.Characters come in spout some wisdom and disappear behind a rock like the Dungeon Master. I have a feeling that they are supposed to be angels maybe God himself? The twists in the movie are tough to swallow. I will not even come close to ruining them they are not even worth ruining. Someone thought they could write a M. Knight script but failed.Overall this movie would be worth a rental from the dollar kiosk at the grocery store as long as everything else is sold out.

It must be terrible for Lohan to realize what hideous people were controlling her career.";

I'm not opposed to a good clich thriller movie but at some point it becomes comical. The plot was extremely contrived and had enough holes to fill the Royal Albert Hall. Perhaps the scenes explaining the plot ended up on the cutting room floor in favor of some of the more grotesque and gratuitous gore scenes of which there were plenty. The film's twist one so ludicrous even the most diehard Lohan films will giggle is pulled directly from left field after a seemingly magical epiphany by the film's main character. The filmmakers thrown in a plethora of minor characters with undeveloped and unresolved story lines in an attempt to throw off the audience. Nevertheless not ten minutes into the film I along with the others I was with had successfully predicted the antagonist.The final thirty minutes of the film was a nonstop laugh riot. The packed theater of varying demographics was rolling in the aisles as clich after hackneyed clich flew off the screen in rapid succession to hilarious results. I joked to the person beside me that I hadn't laughed as hard since the first time I saw Borat.Stylistically the movie is a film school student's wet dream rife of artsy shots and recurring motifs. Unfortunately for the audience this does little to redeem from the film's most blaring flaw it's entire premise.It's difficult to fairly critique the film's actors given what they had to work with. I can say that Lohan's performance seemed rather bland and stale throughout as though in the back of her mind she knew the movie was trite and looked at it more as a paycheck than a serious mark on her resume.Aside from the occasional I almost died laughing when.... I heard scarcely a good comment in the lobby after the film. As a horrorcomedy this film might have actually been good but as a thriller it missed the mark entirely.".

Which would at least give this film ONE purpose. This is a pathetic attempt at an art film and what is perhaps even more pathetic than the film's overall effect is that Lindsay Lohan actually thought she'd win an Oscar for this film. The dialogue is insultingly bad. And what I mean by insultingly bad is that you as an audience member should feel offended that filmmakers and screenwriters like the ones who poured 4 months of their lives into this movie actually think you are too stupid to understand anything without being expressly told what to think and feel or that an art film by definition should have nothing open to interpretation. The movie looked like it was shot with my home video camera the characters are one dimensional and the acting is laughable. I Know Who Killed Me seemed to be perfectly content resting its alleged DEPTH upon the standard Independent Film standby elements Trippy  confusing film sequences violence sex and apparently a new addition AMPUTEES!!

This flick was supposed to put Ms Lohan's sexual antics to the top of the box office.Unfortunately the script was so bad and the plot was trying to be something out of an Alfred Hitchock movie. If Alfred Hitchcock was to write the script for this movie. There would be no sex scenes or anything in there.I am surprised about the movie winning the Razzies. It sucked so bad I had to switch halfway through.. I manage to see the rest of the film on my own PC just to find out what happened at the end. But still.. it was crap. I just felt that this movie was a complete waste of time.If people want to see a really good sex thriller try watching those late night movies on cable. You'll feel a lot more better watching that than watching Ms Lohan's crappy performance.Anyway it's a thumbs down for me..! 0 out of 10!".

The acting was so wooden and unbelievable it was like a high school production. The lines were some of the corniest I have ever heard this side of Stay Alive. The plot made absolutely no sense. I really didn't care who Dakota or the serial killer were or where the Aubrey had gone. This is Screen writing 101 You need to care about the characters! I guess the writer of this movie missed that class.So much of it was just disgusting too. Some scenes were so graphic I actually had to turn my head away. For example where Dakota sews on a bloody and gangrenous finger with a needle and thread or where the killer or whatever puts Aubrey's hands between dry ice and when he pulls them apart her rotting hand is pulled in half. Other repulsive scenes were the ones where Lindsay Lohan was pole dancing at a strip club. It's like the writer couldn't decide which avenue he wanted to take the movie down gory violent thriller or a dramasuspense movie and in the end compromised with a boring lifeless story with lots of blood and gore.And what was with all the blue items everywhere? Did the director think he was being artsy? The blue computer the blue curtains the blue roses even the knife the killer used was blue! It was not like The Sixth Sense with the color red where it was subtle and if you weren't looking for it you wouldn't notice. Every item was blue and the whole film looked tinted blue like the director was using a blue filter. That was one of the only things consistent throughout this movie. It was as if the director needed to make certain you couldn't forget which movie you were watching just in case you nod off for a few minutes or something.Another irritating thing were the police officers. Honestly I don't know if the writerdirector of this film figured that no one would have the slightest idea of how real cops work or if they just didn't want to put in the research to find out for themselves but every scene with the cops was so unbelievable and the actors portrayed them too like they'd never seen one before. Maybe it was the lines that were poorly written but they had no emotion! Turn on Law  Order or CSI once and a while and see how cops really talk and what terms they really use. And then they just suddenly inexplicably disappeared for the rest of the movie like so many other plot holes. Did they solve the case? Did they lose interest? Or was the writer just too lazy or disinterested to fix that particular plot hole? There are so many nonsensical parts to this movie it's just embarrassing.Towards the end of the movie the plot starts unraveling and the ending itself makes absolutely no sense and you really don't care to make sense of it you just want it over! I guess there's an alternate ending that might shed some more light on this but I haven't seen it and all I have to go off of was the movie I saw in theaters. I wasn't able to figure out if Dakota was just made up or if she was real and by the end all I cared about was leaving the theater.".

My example was Lindsey's cut off hand instead of making it look cool like a hook or some sort of incendiary device they put a glove over her hand and made it look like a prosthetic. Also she has a robot leg but it was just her real leg with some Christmas lights tapped on it. Anyways the ending was gay and i wasn't turned on at all when Lindsey was almost naked.

My example was Lindsey's cut off hand instead of making it look cool like a hook or some sort of incendiary device they put a glove over her hand and made it look like a prosthetic. Also she has a robot leg but it was just her real leg with some Christmas lights tapped on it. Anyways the ending was gay and i wasn't turned on at all when Lindsey was almost naked. Freckles are gross! And I hate gingers!";

I watched the video of 'After Hours' so many times it wore out and am happy it is now available on DVD. But I hesitate to buy said DVD. Why? This film is extremely disturbing and not really a comedy but a gruesome and pitch black snapshot of NYC culture that cuts very close to the bone for those of us who knew the nightlife of Sunset Boulevard on the other side of the country. The similarities between NYC and LA at that time were legion the only difference being the cavernous sinister streets of NY were not lined with palm trees. David Lynch's 'Mulholland Drive' best captures that aspect of danger and tragedy on the west coast that Scorsese has captured on the eastern seaboard. Griffin Dunne has to be the most underrated American comedian and it is a very good thing his gifts were captured so beautifully in 'After Hours'. His character seems to be the only sane person in Manhattan. He is mostly surrounded a bevy of beautiful and hopelessly neurotic and ruthless women.Rosanna Arquette a strange actress all on her own is cast in a very weird part in this film. Nothing she does makes sense which makes her behavior entirely plausible within the circumstances of her environment. Kafka the author Dunne's character is reading sets the tone for this dark and dangerous story. Arquette is perfect as the doomed suicide a sort of modern grand guignol character. She is also tremendously annoying and it's a relief when her whining person is dispatched in the creepy loft she inhabits with Linda Fiorentino. There is a fine performance from Linda Fiorentino whatever happened to her? as an sm style dominatrixartist in SoHo who leads Paul Dunne a merry dance through the darkest bowels of the nightclub scene during the punk heyday. Terri Garr a seemingly sweet and normal city girl a blonde allAmerican girl living in a sickeningly sweet and Dadaesquire little apartment. She is the most horrifying of all the women Paul encounters. She struck me as being a potential murderess should Paul have decided to linger longer with her. It was a great relief when he escaped her burgeoning hysteria and ran back into the streets. Verna Bloom's motherly artist caps off Paul's horrible journey by encasing him in plaster of Paris and leaving him in a basement flat fit for Frankenstein's monster.John Heard is entirely weird and menacing as a softspoken but highlystrung bartender another massmurderer waiting to blossom looms in the background of his personality.Scorsese has zeroed in on the familiar things in our lives in a most alarming manner. Cheap bathrooms in cheaply renovated lofts and cramped little apartments. The god awfulness of the lives of these people is deeply disturbing and now that I am19 years older than when I first watched this film so avidly I am not so sure I want to dive back into that vortex of neurasthenia and darkness again.But I probably will. One of Scorsese's best and definitely his most underrated film.Watch at your own risk.".

However it always seemed that I was the only one who felt that way. It was no sensation at the box office even by art film standards it was ignored by all the awards as far as I remember and no DVD release.Until now. First off I am happy to report that the new DVD release looks and sounds great. It feels like the film came out last year.Now years down the road you really appreciate how accomplished After Hours is in the wake of 100s of inferior indie releases that ape the urban paranoia and downtown sensibility that this seems to effortlessly catch. The film is pitch perfectyou sense a filmmaker in complete command but the film is always off balance as intended. The plot seems to flow randomly and the movie always defies your expectations yet it's as tightly assembled as a jigsaw puzzle.It's easy to catch the Scorsese style of shooting and editing really starting to roll here before taking off in The Color of Money and Goodfellas as the engine of the movie. You have to remind yourself that every other director was not trying to make movies this way at this point 1985 and that you are watching the inventor not just the best practitioner.But don't overlook the cast's contributions. Perfectly cast down to the smallest roles yes I mean you Dick Miller few things are more enjoyable than watching an able cast take the ball and run with it. Obviously having a blast they not only jump into their parts but they have no hesitation at being unlikable and annoying. Particularly Griffin Dunne the perfect Everyman who becomes more and more of a jerk as the night wears on.".

You have to remind yourself that every other director was not trying to make movies this way at this point 1985 and that you are watching the inventor not just the best practitioner.But don't overlook the cast's contributions. Perfectly cast down to the smallest roles yes I mean you Dick Miller few things are more enjoyable than watching an able cast take the ball and run with it. Obviously having a blast they not only jump into their parts but they have no hesitation at being unlikable and annoying. Particularly Griffin Dunne the perfect Everyman who becomes more and more of a jerk as the night wears on.";

	schema:reviewBody "N.B. Spoilers within.This is an underrated sublimely realized black comedy by the at the time struggling Scorcese. There is a perfect balance here between the big pictureuptown whitecollar insurance guy out of his league in nighttime bohemian SoHoand infinite numbers of details within. Scorcese has taken a great script by Joseph Minion and crafted a piece of comedy suspense selfexploration plenty of twists and interpersonal discovery. Our lead Paul Hackett the subtle and brilliant Griffin Dunne is the most hapless hero to grace the screen in a long time. Whatever can go wrong does go wrong. As Paul steps into the next venture there is no telling what will come of it. The script keeps the viewer constantly on edge and clueless as to what to expect next. Paranoia becomes rampant.The music that frames the picturea youthful symphony by Mozartdefines the outwardly tidy guidelines of Paul's world number crunching and computer interfacing. But even the small glimpse we get of that world says that all is not right. The trainee whom Paul is overseeing a small part for Bronson Pinchotsee True Romance hates the job and wants out of it. Then there is that telling moment where Paul looks around him and watches everything flow by in its idiosyncratic motion. The quick vision is both sexy and unsettling. He's having a momentary insight but exactly into what? Is his whole life here empty and pointless? Is he bored out of his mind? Scorcese never lets us know for sure. But then Paul meets Marcy in the diner and the fun begins.We can't know if Murphy's Law applies to Paul all the time but it certainly does on this fateful night. There is a flatout poetic shot of Paul's sole 20dollar bill floating from the cab into oblivion and this is just the beginning. This brings up my first observation though on Scorcese his stunning and beautiful camera work. It flows it jumps it's liquid now it interrupts jarringly. The whole effort contributes to the anxious nature of the story and of how Paul never feels completely grounded while he's out of his territory.The multitudes of characters that Paul meets are all convoluted stories unto themselves. Kiki a smokinghot Linda Fiorentinowhere has she gone? Marcy's artist roommate and the ultimate 80s bohemian her leatherbound friend Horst a menacing Will Patton the nice waitress Teri Garr with more baggage than Paul can handle Gail the hilarious Catherine O'Hara who will turn on Paul in a big way Tom the bartender John Heard himself a ticking timebomb Cheech and Chong industrious through the long night and the solution to who the bad SoHo burglars are but especially there's Marcy the luscious Rosanna Arquette. She is sweet goodhearted ditsy but full of dark secrets. A lot of these are spilled others only suggested. The rape story for example...hard to understand until you've seen it but it's full of comedy. Arquette plays Marcy just right a girl who is just short of being completely unhinged but who still stumbles ahead smoothly and confidently if not a good bit cluelessly. This is one unique character. Her suicide contributes much to Paul's emotional weighthow exactly did he contribute to it?and also to the comedy's being so black.After Hours occupies an era that is preATMs and cell phones but there are Checker cabs subway tokens gritty artists' lofts and rotary phones. Punk is king. The picture strikes me as being linear yes but also kaleidoscopic Paul meets and remeets the same characters throughout but each time this happens his circumstances have taken a new turn. The story is also full of strange details that help knit the whole together. An example the subject of burns and scars. There is this brief focus on burns and burn treatments. Marcy's cream her trip to the drugstore to get it the book of gruesome pictures that Paul can't keep himself from...then Marcy floats back in he slams the book shut and what is she holding? A candle with a huge flame! Ha! It's details like these that make the movie feel so integrated. Even Kiki tells Paul she has horrible ugly scars. Finally and this part is truly sick once Marcy is dead under the sheet Paul can't help but inspect her body for those suspected burn marks. Ugh I have to mention the last of Paul's meetings when there is absolutely nowhere else to turn June at the club Verna Bloom seems to be the only person who truly understands his predicament and who helps to finally rescue him but her means are highly suspicious. Is she also trying to kill him? What a stroke. One of the key themes of the flick is that everyone Paul encounters is for the moment his savior but who soon leads him into more trouble than he already has. It is PaulUpper East Sidetryinghisbest versus the nighttimelivingontheflyDowntown mentality and After Hours places the two mindsets at opposite ends of the universe.Scorcese temporarily abandoning the beleaguered Last Temptation hit the mark spoton with this wonderful comedy. In the process he proved his love for the medium not to mention loving all the memorable characters that inhabit the wacky unpredictable story. I also think this is Griffin Dunne's pinnacle he perfectly inhabits a role where everything is falling apart around him but where he hangs on and finds something inside that keeps plugging on until the sun rises again. Polished inspired funny and disturbing film making. Highly recommended.".

	schema:headline " A unique experience.";
	schema:reviewBody "To get an understanding of the caliber film we're dealing with you have to imagine some of the finest elements of other films being wound into a tight 95 minute package and directed by the incomparable Martin Scorsese. After Hours reminds this critic in many ways of Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut. But somehow it seems to be about the best elements of that film. Our film deals with a mildmannered Manhattan office worker taking a late night trip to the Soho district to meet up with a beautiful woman he first encountered earlier in the evening. So much like with Tom Cruise in EWS we have a protagonist searching for love in a world completely foreign to him. But instead of a never ending and overly talky film we get a tightly wound and much better paced film from Scorsese. When the film does slow down for conversations the ones we're treated to are comparable to the best Tarantino ever wrote for any of his films. Fortunately we don't get too many of them like we would in a Tarantino film however.Griffin Dunne plays Paul Hackett who is bound and determined to hook up with Marcy Rosanne Arquette whom he met in a restaurant earlier that evening. Once he makes it to Soho Paul quickly realizes this spurofthemoment rendezvous may have been a terrible idea. Apparently Soho is or was in 1985 a macabre place full of eccentric artists bondage enthusiasts and vigilante mobs made up of mostly gay people. Not only does Paul fail to score with Marcy he ends up being stranded in the neighborhood with no money to get home and being blamed for several apartment breakins by a crowd that wants his blood! Every place or person he turns to for help seems to get him deeper and deeper into danger. There are all kinds of famous or soon to be famous people popping up in little roles here and there. Will Patton as a leather clad bondage enthusiast may be the most odd. Also look for Scorsese in a nightclub sporting a beard and shining a spotlight down on the rowdy patrons.Unlike many Scorsese films this one does not rely much at all on violence to get the point of danger across. I believe there is only one violent death and the victim is not a main character. But in true Scorcese form the scene produces a laugh! More than anything else this film has a claustrophobic feeling. It's as if the world is crumbling all around Paul Hackett and the next door he walks through may be his last. By the final fifteen minutes he finds himself in the apartment of a gay man he picks on the street. To the man's obvious disappointment Hackett simply wants someone to tell his story to. Before the scene has any type of logical conclusion Hackett finds himself back on the street running for his life once again. His momentary attempt at finding compassion shattered in the blink of an eye. The whole film is kind of like that.After Hours may not be for all tastes but this critic first saw it back in junior high and never forgot what a treasure it is. 10 of 10 stars.The Hound.".

It's an interesting premise for a film  what goes on out there in the nocturnal world while the rest of us are fast asleep? But I couldn't help but feel that the film was trying too hard like its creators were intentionally setting out to make something that would eventually end up as a cult classic. That it did doesn't make the movie any better. The best cult classics are those that become so naturally not those that are manufactured to be so.Griffin Dunne is on screen nearly constantly and he does well with his role gradually working himself up to a nearly hysterical pitch of frustration in his failed attempts to get back to the safety of his home. The supporting cast is peopled with recognizable faces in cameos Teri Garr Catherine O'Hara Cheech Marin Rosanna Arquette. But no one is really playing a character and no one really gets much to work with. I wasn't bothered by the implausibility of the film implausibility is the film's point. But I did get somewhat bored by the arbitrary plot twists and the fact that I couldn't connect with anyone in the film not even Dunne whose character is vaguely unlikable.I did like the film's ending though. It nicely captures that feeling of waking from an unsettling dream into the familiar world that you know and recognize.Grade B".

It's easy and fast to understand that Griffin has a dull life thus he is open and not afraid of experiences. As soon as he meets Rosanna he is on the gate of an unexpected journey. It's funny because the same thing happened to me The first time with the single mother was to have a coffee at my studio. Then on the spot we decided to have dinner outside. Then I asked her to bring her back home in the suburbs. Finally with all this it was late and when I arrived to the train station it was too late to catch the last. So I was like Griffin in Soho alone lost in an unknown district late at night and faraway of my home. I found a night bus to reach back Paris and there strangely no taxi was roaming the streets. I hesitated to go to my job office as i was waited a few hours later and being in the middle from it and my studio. I took my luck for my studio and after a long walk i got to my studio and just fall on my bed! So Griffin's crazy night is well done It's really looks like Soho is another planet for him as the nightlife is indeed a bit particular there! His character is funny as it's easy to understand why he is single too much impatient selfcentered and too much anxious! The strong points of the movie are that it's written with intelligence Griffin is like a fly that has been caught in a web as with each steps his adventure goes more and more silly where everything is finally tied! With that the cast is excellent as his meetings are faces that we know Rosanna Forientino Dante's buddy the future parents of home alone. Ultimately the last ten minutes of the movie is great cinema It begun like a tragic parabola then it's surrealist sunrise and the credits are an amazing work of camera. So with a few good shots of Scorcese during the movie it's really an unusual funny production that offers an new look about NYC! In addition you can see that Rosanna was a terrific actress thus I really don't understand why she had the career she had later!".

Here Scorsese seems like he's built up his reputation strongly enough so he can just put out any old tosh and audiences will praise it to high heaven just because Scorsese directed it. The directing is lazy the plot at first glance seems interesting enough but Scorsese does his best to bring it down and ends up with a stretched repetitive sequence of encounters with various deadbeats and lowlife losers which we are apparently supposed to show some interest in. Griffin Dunne is just to waspy and bland for us to invest any time in caring for his character.

	schema:reviewBody "After Hours is a classic highly original and bizarre movie that reveals its greatness only through repeated viewings. It all takes place over one night and becomes a surreal unpredictable journey through the Manhattan underworld. If you like cleverly written unpredictable stories then this film is for you. There are great cameo performances from the likes of Rosanna Arquette Linda Fiorentino and Teri Garr among others. The film begins like a gentle romantic comedy but as soon as Paul gets into the taxi to go to Marcy's Manhattan loft apartment everything begins to go wrong and the film turns more sinister.Scorsese is a master at creating a sense of unease with scenes cleverly set up to make you fear the worst and share Paul's growing paranoia. This happens particularly with Marcy's character with the suggestion that things aren't quite right and why was she visiting the allnight drug store? It's under control says a guarded Kiki. The plot twists are often difficult to predict but the clues are there and by a bizarre sequence of events SPOILER Paul is unable to return home and ends up being persecuted by a vigilante mob with a Mr Softy truck.These scenes with actor Griffin Dunne running through the streets in the middle of the night are the highlights of the film  he witnesses a shooting while hiding up a fire escape and says almost to camera I'll probably get blamed for that. It's vintage comedy of the darkest kind and a journey into one man's soul on a search for love and acceptance. The sad thing is that most of the characters he meets are also just looking for a soul mate too but the yuppy world that Paul comes from makes him too prejudiced and unable to see through their apparent weirdness to the lonely person underneath.".

The film begins like a gentle romantic comedy but as soon as Paul gets into the taxi to go to Marcy's Manhattan loft apartment everything begins to go wrong and the film turns more sinister.Scorsese is a master at creating a sense of unease with scenes cleverly set up to make you fear the worst and share Paul's growing paranoia. This happens particularly with Marcy's character with the suggestion that things aren't quite right and why was she visiting the allnight drug store? It's under control says a guarded Kiki. The plot twists are often difficult to predict but the clues are there and by a bizarre sequence of events SPOILER Paul is unable to return home and ends up being persecuted by a vigilante mob with a Mr Softy truck.These scenes with actor Griffin Dunne running through the streets in the middle of the night are the highlights of the film  he witnesses a shooting while hiding up a fire escape and says almost to camera I'll probably get blamed for that. It's vintage comedy of the darkest kind and a journey into one man's soul on a search for love and acceptance. The sad thing is that most of the characters he meets are also just looking for a soul mate too but the yuppy world that Paul comes from makes him too prejudiced and unable to see through their apparent weirdness to the lonely person underneath.";

Can it succeed? This movie is fun fun fun as the Beach Boys say. There is so much to spoof about the rough and tumble western frontier that the humor is never forced and gives way to many a giggle. The scenery is quite beautiful and the film sports an authentic look. Most of the actors are fine but Candy who died during the filming and whose part was digitally completed never seems like himself. His usual goforbroke spirit is just not present. That said the film still works beautifully and is a great view for any Saturday night of fun.

This movie was a little under rated but it was still one of his lesser films. Sadly he passed away during filming you see he was in it until the end of the film his character was not just dropped I think they probably were going to do some more editing to the film to make it better but he passed away so they had to produce what they had a somewhat unfinished film. Towards the end of his career his comedies really started going downhill. Although I liked Canadian Bacon Harry Crumb Wagons East and films like these were just a bit well stupid. Like I said Wagons East wasn't all that bad but it's nothing compared to his bestplanes trains and automobiles or Uncle BuckI've commented on both of those as well. I just wish when planes and trains 20th anniversary finally comes up they'll rerelease it on DVD with forgotten scenes and a special dedication video to John Candy same with Uncle Buck. John Candy was a great and it's too bad this was dedicated to his memory because I think if he's watching down on us he's as sad as I am. Anyway the plot of the movie is After a town by the name of Prosperity decides the west isn't what it's cracked up to be they decide to move back east. They find a Wagon master named HarlowCandy to lead them back. They must survive Indians starvationno waterhired guns and moreas the comedy builds up to an okay climax. 2 and a half stars out of 5 it's a good movie to rent out but while you're at it rent out some of Candy's best films too. I also dedicate this commentto the memory of John Candy".

A good mix of puns and jokes from the Western genre are sprinkled with satirical jokes about life in common and some original jokes. I can't say it's pace is high but there is no slow parts and it is never dull. There is always something to laugh about. And that maybe one of its great strengths that might have been overlooked. There is much subtle humor small details that are just great. Or is it that it's just the humor that speaks to me.An impressive cast of comedians some that have proved their worth both before and after. The obvious lead is John Candy as the defamed wagon master from the real Donner Party the character is not though. Stated that he was unwilling to do this movie but had to because of contractual obligations it is still impressive that he can be so good in it. Not his best movie far from it but it is till really good. Unfortunately it was also to be his last movie as he died during filming Wagons East but some skilled editing and rewriting make that fact unnoticeable by watching the movie.He also has some strong support of actors and comedians. Most prominent to me is Richard Lewis who is too underrated but does a great role once again. And then there is John C McGinley. Now doing a great character in Scrubs he already here shows his comedian talent as the overly gay settler. Notable appearances also from Robert Picardo and Ethan Phillips both of later Star Trek fame Abraham Benrubi and Ed Lauter.All in all it is a great comedy. It sure helps to appreciate some wacky humor and parody of the Western genre. I've seen it several times and it never fails to deliver.810".

That's just what makes it so sad not simply that Candy suffered a fatal heart attack but that it was on the set of such a crummy movie. Seriously I don't know what they were thinking when they came up with this piece of crap but the flick has NO redeeming qualities. It's as if they took every unused script for stupid westerns and just mixed them together and filmed it. No wonder John Candy didn't want to make the movie maybe his contractual participation was what did him in.Anyway the point is that Candy did much better than this throughout his career. To be certain he had already completed Michael Moore's Canadian Bacon in which the United States declares war on Canada. Just stick with that one and you can say that Candy ended his career honorably. As for Richard Lewis  who previous had costarred with Candy in Eugene Levy's absurd but hilarious Once Upon a Crime  he made up for this piece of crap by frequently guest appearing on Countdown with Keith Olbermann in later years.".

	schema:headline " Three stars just for Candy.";
	schema:reviewBody "John Candy is on record as saying he feared something bad was going to happen if he went to Mexico to make this film. Well two bad things happened. John Candy died and this film was made. How's that for bad karma? Wagons East is a stupendously bad film on just about every level. A scarce chuckle or two in almost two hours is about all you can expect. Only a few scenes with Candy are rewarding mostly because they will remind you of how funny he had been in the past. With this film we see perhaps an interesting idea for an SNL sketch stretched into an insufferably long film. We see some decent character actors wasted while the wrong ones get most of the screen time. And worse than anything we see a John Candy that is painful to watch. He was heavier than ever and just looks like he'd rather be any place else. How in the world did they find a horse strong enough to carry him?The story deals with a handful of people ready to give up on life in the old west and start a wagon train heading back to St. Louis where they can give city life another try. There are a couple of cute early gags involving the oftrobbed town banker and a gay bookstore proprietor selling a cowboy a copy of Pride and Prejudice so he can use it for toilet paper. These are interesting observations but again they cannot be the basis for a feature length film. Once the train gets rolling east what little laugh well we had dries up rather quickly. How long did they milk the Donner Party angle? This might have been good as a throwaway gag later in the film but the fact that Candy's character was their wagon master too is brought up again and again and again. Any of the halfdozen subplots involving people on this journey could have been cut and actually would have improved the picture. We just don't care about these people. What has Richard Lewis ever done to be the star of a theoretically mainstream comedy? The guy isn't funny. At all. Never was. Too bad the last film Candy ever did turned out this bad. Its doubtful that Canadian Bacon would be much better so I just won't even watch that one. 3 of 10 stars.The Hound.".

So they quit and head home.It is wrong to think of the movie as a spoof and if you watch it expecting a Mel Brooks movie you will only be disappointed. Wagons East is a genuine western comedy with a wide variety of laughs from family trip clichs to road runner gags and seen as such it is a remarkably good western with clever though uncomplicated comedy and a good plot image. Although the greedy but paranoid Rail Mogul is a little weak most of the clichs fit in neatly and comically with the plot.Oh and don't watch Wagons East expecting a John Candy film. The main leads are Richard Lewis and Robert Picardo with strong input from Scrubs star John C. McGinley. Candy makes a good appearance but his comic performance is considerably muted compared to his more prominent films. This may be due to his unfortunate death towards the end of filming or it may be that he felt the role deserved a more quiet presentation due to the terrible secret in the characters past.I enjoyed this film immensely and heartily recommend it to anyone who enjoys a light laugh.".

	schema:reviewBody "Take a look into the sad eyes of this mountain of a man and you'll know that he was degenerating. This was a hilarious movie for all that with so many slaps and arrows darted at the traditional western. Ex Why do they circle the wagons? If you made a square the Indians would have to go wider to make the circle. I think this suggestion was made by an Indian that goes off with the Western dude who kills the bad guy. Was that a spoiler? I'm never sure.And those of you who love Scrubs will love this movie cause the tyrannical doc plays a homosexual cowboy!!!! Great number of site gags as well as Candy playing dual roles. Watching him play with his electric train as the train magnate was unforgettable. Then he calls out the U.S. Calvary as any patriot knows can be done by the corporate maggots who control our government today. Quite a few sly digs at our history and political figures. I confiscated the horses of the Donner Wagon Train which caused them to cannibalize themselves as they died. And only Candy his character knows I did it the general says to the aide. But I know says the aide. Then either you agree to be in my Cabinet when I'm president or if I have to kill you right now.....reminiscent of the present crackheadinchief and the deals he made to get into office.Check the movie out. Will remind you of a kinder gentler time both 10 years and 100 years ago.".

The product is compromised when the director lacks the courage to bring the film to a meaningful  in this case a disturbing  conclusion rather than one that's satisfying Tilly's editor spoke to this issue when he rejected his second novel saying that the reader doesn't want to think microcosm when she's sitting on the bus... In trying to please the mainstream reach a wider audience and improve the box office we lose opportunities to excel.So what else is new in Hollywood?".

The product is compromised when the director lacks the courage to bring the film to a meaningful  in this case a disturbing  conclusion rather than one that's satisfying Tilly's editor spoke to this issue when he rejected his second novel saying that the reader doesn't want to think microcosm when she's sitting on the bus... In trying to please the mainstream reach a wider audience and improve the box office we lose opportunities to excel.So what else is new in Hollywood?";

	schema:reviewBody "Among its myriad unique qualities The Man From Elysian Fields' portrays Southern California not as the traditional sundrenched paradise familiar to us from postcards and movies but rather as a dank drizzly depressing locale a perfect backdrop for the sad little tale the filmmakers are telling.And what a strange little tale it turns out to be.  Andy Garcia in one of his best screen performances to date stars as Byron Tiller a generally unsuccessful novelist who finds himself so low on funds that he is literally unable to support the wife and child he loves so dearly.  Driven by desperation Byron reluctantly agrees to sell his services as an escort' for lonely women.  His very first client turns out to be the lovely young wife of a dying novelist who exploits Byron not only for his sexual prowess but for his skills as a writer devising a scheme to get him to assist her husband in completing his final work given his incapacitated state the novelist and his wife have an arrangement that she is free to seek male companionship from an escort service.With its highly original and provocative storyline The Man From Elysian Fields' exerts an almost hypnotic pull on its audience seductively drawing us into the lives and the complex relationships of its numerous characters.  Even though we may question the credibility of Byron's decision after all were there NO other options for employment that he could come up with? the depth and richness of Garcia's performance brush all such quibbles aside. He makes Byron into such a sympathetic figure that we can't help but follow him along on his journey.  Garcia is aided immeasurably by the tone of elegiac sadness that permeates the film as well as by the superb performances from Julianna Margulies Olivia Williams and the late great James Coburn whose valedictory performance this turned out to be.  With his gnarled hands and grizzled face Coburn strikes right at the heart of what it means for a man of genius to be in the final throes of his life terrified of losing his creative powers at the end and desperate to leave behind an untarnished image when he's gone.  Watching the deceased Coburn delivering a speech about impending death carries with it an eerie prescience that only enriches the melancholic tone of the work. Williams gives a beautiful performance as his young wife genuinely in love with a man who can no longer return that love on any but the most spiritual level.  Margulies is poignant as Byron's devoted but nave spouse whose world comes crashing down around her the moment she discovers the man she married is not the man she thought he was.  Indeed of the performers only Mick Jagger as the head of the escort company Elysian Fields who starts Byron on his rode to personal disaster falls short of his potential. Though not bad as an actor Jagger doesn't seem to have the naturalness in front of the camera and the comfortability factor necessary for a truly firstrate performance.The Man From Elysian Fields' is in many ways a classic morality tale in the grand old Faustian tradition as Byron willing to sell his soul for temporal gain discovers that the compromising of one's principles is the first step toward ruination and a life spent regretting the loss of what one holds most dear.  Even though this Faust deludes himself into thinking he is sacrificing his honor and integrity to benefit those he loves rather than himself it turns out to be a fool's bargain anyway partly because what he is giving up is the very thing he wants most desperately to retain.Written by Philip Jayson Lasker and directed by George Hickenlooper The Man From Elysian Fields' is a lyrical beautifully modulated work that haunts the viewer with its insight and power long after the final credits have rolled by.".

His Byron Tiller is a loser.  We sense it the moment we see him in Rizzoli trying to recommend his book to an indecisive customer. His curiosity trying to find out what his office neighbor Luther Fox is up to proves to be his eventual downfall. At home life seems very normal with Dena his wife and son. Being broke makes him accept an offer he should have turned down from the very beginning.The encounter with the Allcotts Tobias a best selling author at the end of his life and Andrea his wife will be fatal. Are we to believe this was a chance encounter or was it planned before hand? Ultimately the viewer will have to arrive to his own conclusions.All the acting is first rate. Andy Garcia is very effective. So is the rest of the cast but Mick Jagger is superb portraying this lizard kind of a man who deals with very special situations and needs. Also notable Olivia Williams as the ice queen that doesn't even take off her undergarments for a tumble in the hay. James Coburn is a sly fox who knows what he's doing from the very beginning. Julianna Margulies is the only one that has very little to do as the suffering wife.The film has a glossy and sophisticated look. Viewing it will be satisfying because basically it's a good story well paced and acted.".

	schema:reviewBody "The road to hell is always paved with good intentions. It is the axiom pitfall that catches so many including Andy Garcia's character Byron Tiller in The Man from Elesian Fields'. Having thrown years into a failed novel Byron grows increasingly desperate to make ends meet for his family and find success. Compromising himself for what he needs he finds an easy answer in the employ of Elesian Fields a male escort service operated by Luther Fox Mik Jagger. It is a classically executed setup but because the script has so much to say before the final fade out it staggers like a buss boy who has picked up too many dishes from too many tables.After the proper cajoling and encouraging Luther sets Byron up on his first assignment with the beautiful wife of a renowned multiPulitzer writer. Byron doesn't go easily into this abyss. He won't escort Andrea Olivia Williams beyond her limo door after an opera the first night and is greatly relieved to return home to his wife Dena Juliana Margulies. The second date however progresses until the date and escort have their lovemaking interrupted by a visit from Andrea's elderly and approving husband Tobias James Coburn. Tobias extends an invitation for Byron to work with him on revising his last book. Byron soon finds himself leading the dizzying life of working for Luther Andrea and Tobias while never letting Dena know about his escort duties with Andrea.The first hour of the film is tightly written and gracefully proceeds with the steady and beautiful cinematography of Kramer Morgenthau. After the writers start exchanging ideas the pace of the film picks up considerably. Conversation becomes swept aside in montages and assumptions. Even the music subtle and appropriate in the first half draws unnecessary attention in the second half. The situation is familiar. Betrayed couples are as old as time. Struggling writers are found throughout cinema. The thing that separates them is the individual characters and interaction. Those and the heartfelt dialog get lost in bringing the story to where it is expected to end to make the author's statement. Far from poor but never really convincing Elesian Fields' is best noted for the acting it harbors. James Coburn plays a dying artist with dignity and is smart enough to let his poise crumble from time to time. Mik Jagger is wonderfully understated as the dispenser of temptation and his moments of disappointment with Anjelica Huston round out an awardworthy performance. Andy Garcia believably balances an quiet man whose temper gets the best of him now and again. Only Juliana Margulies  is underused. It's unfortunate that so much talent could not overcome the other more intrinsic weaknesses.".

There are a number of brilliant oneliners the best one is not shown in the trailer thank God. However these are not the oneliners that appear so often in a David Spade movie. Instead these are just very clever.The problems I had with the film is that when the film enters dark territory such as when it shows Byron at his most desperate it becomes unpleasant and it ruins the spell that the movie works so hard to cast. This is partly due to George Hickenlooper but mainly because the actors play their parts so well.This is a mustsee for any adult filmgoer who appreciates films with wit depth and rich characters.".

	schema:headline " An excellent movie";
	schema:reviewBody "An excellent movie scripted by Phillip Jayson Lasker with a very good performance from Mick Jagger. The film stars Jagger and Andy Garcia with James Coburn Anjelica Huston Olivia Williams and Julianna Margulies. Michael Des Barres deserves special mention for his performance as Nigel.Garcia plays a wouldbe author with the interesting name of Byron Tiller. Tiller has had a book published to some good reviews but it's in the remainder bin a 25 novel for only 3.99. With no sales he's off the list for his publisher. We see him with a wife who loves him unconditionally and a son who's a toddler that they both dote on. Unable to get an advance from his publisher a job a loan or any income at all Tiller is approached by the owner of an agency called Elysian Fields a dissolute man with his life written all over his face and named Luther Fox.I was very surprised that Jagger acquitted himself so well he channeled Noel Coward beautifully without overdoing it. His acting was subtle and understated  he inhabited the role of Luther Fox with no hint of Mick showing through. Fox corrupts Tiller with charm and savoir faire. Elysian Fields is an escort service for women. Fox reads Tiller like the book he is and sets Tiller up with the young wife of an aged Pulitzer Prize winning novelist. And then the twists begin. The aged novelist Alcott has lost it. He's written a novel but it's not good. As Tiller begins an affair with Andrea Alcott Alcott begins a literary partnership with Tiller. With the promise of coauthorship Tiller works with Alcott to rewrite Alcott's novel while Tiller continues his affair with Mrs. Alcott  with Alcott's beaming approval.

	onyx:emotionText "An excellent movie scripted by Phillip Jayson Lasker with a very good performance from Mick Jagger. The film stars Jagger and Andy Garcia with James Coburn Anjelica Huston Olivia Williams and Julianna Margulies. Michael Des Barres deserves special mention for his performance as Nigel.Garcia plays a wouldbe author with the interesting name of Byron Tiller. Tiller has had a book published to some good reviews but it's in the remainder bin a 25 novel for only 3.99. With no sales he's off the list for his publisher. We see him with a wife who loves him unconditionally and a son who's a toddler that they both dote on. Unable to get an advance from his publisher a job a loan or any income at all Tiller is approached by the owner of an agency called Elysian Fields a dissolute man with his life written all over his face and named Luther Fox.I was very surprised that Jagger acquitted himself so well he channeled Noel Coward beautifully without overdoing it. His acting was subtle and understated  he inhabited the role of Luther Fox with no hint of Mick showing through. Fox corrupts Tiller with charm and savoir faire. Elysian Fields is an escort service for women. Fox reads Tiller like the book he is and sets Tiller up with the young wife of an aged Pulitzer Prize winning novelist. And then the twists begin. The aged novelist Alcott has lost it. He's written a novel but it's not good. As Tiller begins an affair with Andrea Alcott Alcott begins a literary partnership with Tiller. With the promise of coauthorship Tiller works with Alcott to rewrite Alcott's novel while Tiller continues his affair with Mrs. Alcott  with Alcott's beaming approval. The real seduction is not Tiller's seduction by Andrea the real seduction is the promise of fame with the obvious wealth on display at the Alcott mansion. Tiller's real prostitution is to the husband not the wife because that's where he pours his soul.Tiller's wife notices. She's aware only that he is working as coauthor with Alcott and she sees Tiller draining himself leaving less for their son and for her.

Even though people may see this movie as a piece of crap I feel that they will be missing on a great movie one which actually makes us think and wander if we were to ever be in that position would we do the same thing or just let our self's drown in either way the risk of losing everything we know and love is high.So to all the people who hated it wait six months watch it again and then make up your mind about it. Cause this is a great movie to miss.over all i give an 815 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "We all know that you can feel lonely even though there are many people around you that you can feel absence of love even if you make love like crazy. So it's more important in life to establish a strong relationship than to settle to a thousand superficial ones. This is the main message of the movie. As evident as that message may be here it is delivered in superb style. The main difference is that Andy Garcia's character gets to confirm this truth because out of obligation he has to resort to work in the escort business but in the end he gets the chance to get back and get a hold on to what's really important. That may be a happy ending. But there's no happy ending for those who dedicated their life as simple pleasers who could never find the right time or the right person to start a life a family life. They are beyond redemption. That's why Mick Jagger's character moved me more than Andy Garcia's because you sense that he feels that his time is up that there will be no future chance. That's another ending of the story a sad one. In fact this movie has more than 2 characters so well developed and interesting that you have to recognize that it's no easy task to make a well balanced movie like this one is. There is balance also in the tone of the movie is funny in the right places and that never affect the overall sense of drama. The acting is very good Andy Garcia brings to life a loving husband but troubled and tormented Mick Jagger shows an elegant gentleman but that's more a faade to his real feelings which he expresses in the very poignant scene that he shares with Angelica Houston in which he confesses his love only to face the hurting truth and James Coburn is magnificent as the dying man so understanding that he lets other men satisfy his wife sexually the only part that he can't provide. Maybe the main message that we can find in the end is that if you conduct your relationships without love there's a price to pay. Either you endanger the people that you really love or simply never get to know love at all. In any case all is suffering. Come on we all know this. It's just that we need a little reminder every now and then.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm genuinely quite shocked to see the amount of positive comment about this movie.  I was also quite genuinely shocked at the movie itself witless absurd and ineptly directed and paced as it was.The entire movie screams vanity project from high heaven.  Andy Garcia gets to play a penniless struggling author Andy Garcia plus goatee beard and thick rimmed glasses natch who loves his family so much he becomes a prostitute.  Uhhuh. and Mick Jagger well Mick gets to be on screen and adopt an absolutely ridiculous accent.  As if his normal voice isn't bad enough.Spoilers though I feel no shame giving away this plotThe plot is frankly beyond incredible.  The Pulitzerprize winning author husband of Garcia's very first client wow! think of the chances! hands over the authorship of his final novel to the complete stranger who is sleeping with his wife.  Seemingly without having read a word of his writing.  When the resulting novel is released without Garcia's name readers around the world fail to detect that the genius's work has been replaced by that of a rank amateur.

Relatively few films ever avoid this trap  Ed Harris's Pollock being one of the few noteworthy exceptions. Generally it's just a bad film full of glib cliches and groaninducing plot twists.The final scene which I'll not spoil was so awfully predictable and terribly scripted I saw three people in the theater doubled up with laughter despite the attempt at an emotional climax.There are bright points  James Coburn play his part with charisma and dignity despite his shallowlywritten character.  And on behalf of the besotted women I saw this film with it does at least have Andy Garcia. A lot of Andy Garcia.".

I was also quite genuinely shocked at the movie itself witless absurd and ineptly directed and paced as it was.The entire movie screams vanity project from high heaven.  Andy Garcia gets to play a penniless struggling author Andy Garcia plus goatee beard and thick rimmed glasses natch who loves his family so much he becomes a prostitute.  Uhhuh. and Mick Jagger well Mick gets to be on screen and adopt an absolutely ridiculous accent.  As if his normal voice isn't bad enough.Spoilers though I feel no shame giving away this plotThe plot is frankly beyond incredible.  The Pulitzerprize winning author husband of Garcia's very first client wow! think of the chances! hands over the authorship of his final novel to the complete stranger who is sleeping with his wife.  Seemingly without having read a word of his writing.  When the resulting novel is released without Garcia's name readers around the world fail to detect that the genius's work has been replaced by that of a rank amateur.

	schema:reviewBody "No one ever accused director George Hickenlooper of being too upbeat. His films share a pessimistic worldview and a love for flawed antiheroes that has been out of vogue in mainstream Hollywood since the 1970's. While The Man from Elysian Fields is his first film as director that he didn't write or cowrite it shares the same sensibilities of his most personal films namely a struggling artist's middle American values being a casualty of life in contemporary Los Angeles. Andy Garcia is said artist Byron Tiller. After his first novel received rave reviews but little sales Byron is unable to get his second novel published. He can't afford to support his family and after suffering a series of indignities to try and make ends meet he strikes a Faustian bargain with a gentlemen pimp Luther Fox Mick Jagger the owner and operator of Elysian Fields escort service. Tiller uneasily accepts his new role as a male escort and low and behold his first client Andrea Alcott Olivia Williams of Rushmore is the wife of a dying Pulitzer Prize winning novelist who needs help writing one last book before he dies.From this rather novel premise one of Garcia's first lines is 'it's a premise it's allowed to be ridiculous' the plot proceeds much as you would expect it to. But hey in tragedy there aren't many places to go but down. What makes Elysian Fields worth watching are the performances. The late James Coburn is excellent as the crotchety old writer Tobias Alcott. His ruminations on death are made all the more poignant by the fact that this was one of his final performances. Top billed Jagger is wonderfully understated as Fox and Julianna Margulies does a good job of breathing life into the somewhat thankless role of Mrs. Tiller the stock movie wife who is basically there to constantly tell her workaholic husband that she wishes he were home more. What's really significant about Elysian Fields is the way that Garcia Hickenlooper and screenwriter Phillip Jayson Lasker have crafted the character of Byron Tiller. The indignities that Tiller suffers at the start of the film at the hands of the publisher who rejects his book his fatherinlaw who refuses to loan him any money and the former boss who refuses to hire him back could have been a set up for the 'emasculated man remasculated' plot. This popular revenge fantasy in which the white collar white male rages against the machine Fight Club American Beauty Office Space is rendered improbable when the hero is turning tricks. This is the emasculated man further emasculated. Garcia goes for broke giving a brave performance as the not always likable Tiller. When he makes a last ditch effort to assert his manhood against the deceptive Mrs. Alcott she coyly rebuffs his ranting and raving and his castration is complete. Jagger as Fox says it best when he reminds Tiller 'don't forget that they're paying you not as a writer but as a whore. I guarantee they haven't forgotten.'".

I liked this part which tells  a lot about the parallel relation  sexual and professional  between the couple and their hired lover and ghost writer. The problem with the script is that this bright and original idea is wrapped in a much more conventional Hollywood like melodrama or romantic movie as they like to call it. The wrapping is much weaker and what is worse is the offthescreen text read by the otherwise original character played by Mick Jagger. Acting is actually another good part of the movie with Mick Jagger James Coburn and Anjelica Houston giving good supporting acts. I am not a big fan of Andy Garcia but he is better than the usual here. The two main feminine characters are acted OK not more. Overall an interesting movie could have been better if the writer to writer theme was left unwrapped in melodrama. 7 out of 10 on my personal scale.".

	schema:reviewBody "You pretty much get what one would expect from this first theatrical film using the Munster characters going to England to claim an ancestral home. All the actors return except for Pat Priest  here replaced by Debbie Watson. Herman Munster and Grandpa ham it up in all sorts of quite ridiculous scenes in a quite ridiculous story. Yet throughout it all the film does capture the essence and heart of the original show as well as the humour. Fred Gwynne shows us that he was the heart of the Munsters with his amusing turn as the awkward Herman Munster with strange family in tow  living like a somewhat normal monster in a world he saw as the weird thing filled with people he felt were weird. Al Lewis is equally amusing and the whole cast does a good job aiding the antics. British character actors TerryThomas  always a treat to see  and the indefatigable Hermionne Ginglod as his mother trying to off Herman Munster and keep their title and lands both give pleasant comic turns. John Carradine is aboard as a very slowmoving butler. Bernard Fox plays the head of a rival family whose one goal is to win a car race every year. Naturally Herman must defend the House of Munster. Like the television show many of the laughs are a bit forced but there are some genuinely funny scenes  most of them between Gwynne and Lewis. Lewis turns into a wolf a couple times and the race itself is the centerpiece of the film. The ending is perhaps the most forced but overall I enjoyed the film  not because it was particularly good but rather because it allows one another chance to see Gwynne with the role he would forever be linked with in life. The film w as directed by Earl Bellamy who had directed at least one of the episodes from the series.".

	schema:reviewBody "Only the laugh track is missing from this movie version of the classic TV series. The absence of the canned laughter makes some of the sight gags seem like they go on a little too long but other than that I give the writer and director credit for doing the series justice. It's too bad that writers and directors of more recent times can't learn a few things from their predecessors about making movies out of TV shows.This movie was filmed around the time the series was still in production using writers and a director from the original. No doubt that is a major advantage when trying to capture the original flavor. Some might argue that the movie should have been done in black and white but the color is not overdone and actually adds a nice touch. With the exception of Marilyn the original cast is there. Marilyn's role changed hands in the series anyway. Debbie Watson does fine so it's not a significant distraction.This is good light fare for the family looking for some classic innocent fun. Fans of the series should like it as well. It is nothing more than it tries to be  a movie version of the series with a few extras color location and length. The movie delivers on that and I give it high marks.Fans of this movie should also try The Ghost and Mr. Chicken. It has nothing to do with the Munsters other than the house facade happens to be located next door to the Munster house on the Universal Studios backlot but it is more classic comedy with a spooky twist. It stars Don Knotts during his heyday.".

Debbie Watson was a cute and perky teenager. But casting her in a role that belonged to Pat Priest was a big mistake that angered Fred Gwynne and Al Lewis. This choice also left many in the audience either puzzled or downright angry. I would imagine that this role also played a part in Debbie Watson's movie career going the way it did she retired from acting in 1972.With all things considered Debbie Watson played her role well.The movie lived up to its claims.

This in particular is a fun adventure in which Herman inherits an English title and goes to the Sceptred Isle to claim it even in spite of the wishes of his greedy cousins who want the title for themselves. Naturally this movie has the same kind of rim shotbased gags that highlight the show I thought he was made in Germany but it also has a great deal of fun and some gags are really quite funny not to mention the drastic culture shock that takes place when the Munsters who aren't even normal Americans take Great Britain by storm.

	schema:headline " A Great FollowUp to the TV series";
	schema:reviewBody "Let me start off by saying that I am very biased about The Munsters having been a huge fan of the show since I was a little kid. That being said I think that Munster Go Home! is a very appropriate and enjoyable closing to the television show which had a run of two seasons before it was canceled by CBS. This film remains true to the spirit of the show with the same group of people who made the show possible producers original cast excepting Pat Priest as the creative force behind the scenes. As always Fred Gwynne Al Lewis Yvonne De Carlo and Butch Patrick make this movie extremely enjoyable with their familiar and endearing characters that made the television show such a favorite. The supporting cast for the film is likewise terrific headed by a scenestealing TerryThomas of It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World as the deliciously sleazy Freddie Munster. I'm not going to recite plot here as you can read the summary above but I will warn potential viewers that while this movie was very fun to watch and it kept in the spirit of the television show there is no laugh track so you really need a good feel of the show's humor in order to develop a rhythm so to speak. Also a lot of gags are rehashed here SPOILERS For instance Grandpa accidentally transforms himself into a wolf on board a ship and must be quarantined. Lily nags Herman into rescuing him. Herman twists the lock of Grandpa's cage apart and picks him up scaring the crew members who stumble into the room. Later they smuggle Grandpa off of the ship by having him pose as a dead fur stole around Lily's neck. This entire ordeal closely mirrors the episode of the show in which the Munster family goes camping. In this episode Grandpa turns himself into a wolf and is captured by park authorities. After much nagging from Lily Herman rescues Grandpa by twisting the lock off his cage and carries him out scaring the park rangers who stumble upon the scene. The family then smuggles Grandpa out of the park disguising him once again as Lily's fur stole. Another instance of rehashing television stories happens with the drag race a crucial plot point of the movie. After Herman wrecks his initial race car Grandpa uses spare parts and a coffin to build a drag racer he calls The Dragula. This is handled in the film as if it is an original idea and has never happened before but in actuality there was an entire episode in which Herman loses the family car in a drag race and Grandpa goes through the exact same process of building a drag racer from spare parts and a coffin in order to enter the next race and win back the family car. He calls his creation The Dragula and the cars in both situations are exactly identical. The difference is that the movie pretends the television episode never happened. However if you really like this kind of humor as I did and still do and take this rehashing for what it was probably meant to be homages to familiar moments from the shortlived but much beloved television show then I think you will really enjoy Munster Go Home! And hey it's much much better than The Munsters' Revenge!".

	schema:reviewBody "Munster Go Home! 1966 12 out of 4 Herman Munster Fred Gwynne inherits a large castle in England so he packs up Lily Yvonne De Carlo Grandpa Al Lewis and kids and heads off. Once there he learns that some other family members are staying at the castle and wants to keep it as their own. A year after the television show was canceled someone thought it was a good idea to put the Munsters on the big screen and since it ended up bombing at the box office the show was obviously canceled for a reason and the need for a movie wasn't needed by anyone. I think there are many many issues with this film but none of them really belong to the Munsters themselves. The first twentyfive minutes are actually fairly good as the family gets the news and then heads off on a long cruise. Needless to say this sequence could have been a TV episode and perhaps this is why it works. We get qutie a few good one liners and even some funny jokes including one where when on the boat a man sticks his arm out for a tip and Grandpa mistakenly thinks the guy is offering up his blood to suck on. There's another gag with Grandpa taking the wrong pill turning into a wolf and then being put in a cage. After they arrive in England is when the film completely falls apart and it only takes a matter of minutes to do so. The other family in the house is so annoying that they will quickly get on your nerves. Their entire story contains zero laughs nor does Marilyn's relationship with a man whose family hates the Munster family. The biggest death nail is that this sucker runs an extremely long 96minutes which is just crazy. Another major problem I personally feel is that the movie was shot in color and it just doesn't work well for the ghouls. Seeing them in BW makes the spoof of the Universal era work but in color they just look out of place and at times silly. The performances aren't bad and one does have to tip his cap to John Carradine almost hidden behind all that make up as the caretaker.".

Plus we have Debbie Watson perhaps best known for taking the movie series role of Tammy and bringing it to the small screen here takes the role of niece Marilyn played by Beverly Owen and Pat Priest on the show to the big screen.The plot is a stretch even for this 1960s comedy  Herman inherits a piece of property in Great Britain and tows the family from Mockingbird Lane across the pond to claim it. Of course the stiff upper lips that occupy said property are unamused and attempt to scare off the newcomers. But how does one scare a family of monsters?To me the most interesting thing about this film is seeing some long time actors and TV stars almost randomly turning up in this plot. Bernard Fox Samantha's Warlock physician Dr. Bombay from Bewitched is here. Richard Dawson who at the time was a star of Hogan's Heroes and eventually Rowan and Martin's LaughIn long before his Match Game and Family Feud days is in the mix. And Robert Pine who is best remembered as commanding officer to Ponch and Jon from CHiPs is a love interest for Marilyn!The film really feels like two films are going on our sitcom characters doing what they usually do and there is a cross country auto race with Herman driving the famed Dragula vehicle  while the Munster Koach also makes a cameo and then we have the locals just plotting how to rid themselves of these unwanted outsiders. Hermione Gingold TerryThomas and a completely unrecognizable John Carradine as a manservant populate that group.Tons of sight gags typical sitcom dialog and all the slapstick you could want from what is basically an extended and full color episode of the series.If you are a fan of the series this film is based on and most especially if you enjoyed that program more than the similarly themed series The Addams Family you should get a kick out of this film.".

My favorite TV show was now on the big screen and one of the major draws for my brother  I would we would get to see Herman Munster in Technicolor! What a treat that was. The film written by George Tibbles Joe Connelly  Bob Mosher Original writers for the Munsters sitcom give us a fun outing with Herman Lily Grampa Eddie and Marilyn Now played by an adorable Debbie Watson. The music score was by Jack Marshall Thank God they used the composer from the TV show!  The opening credits outside the Munster's home still gives me goosebumps  It's the now classic TV theme played at a slow tempo. Earl Bellamy does an outstanding job with the direction! You really have a hard time believing this was a back lot picture. Terry Thomas almost steals the film and Hermione GIGI A LITTLE NIGHT MUSIC Gingold is perfectly cast as his mother. John Carradine has a great character role as the butler Crookshank to Gingold  Thomas. Yvonne DeCarlo's Lily Al Lewis' Grampa  Butch Patrick's Eddie are all perfect bringing their characters to the BIG screen! All look Great in color too!. But the film belongs to my childhood hero Fred Gwynne! His Herman is priceless! I love his big kid outlook he brought to Mr. Munster and it's flawless in this film. God Bless you Mr. Gwynne  You are sorely missed. The DVD transfer is gorgeous! I think they even enhanced the Technicolor which makes the green Not gray like the TV show really stand out. This is one family film that should be in everyone's collection. Munster's fans it's a must! Shame on Universal for not turning this family of fright into a film series when the show went off the air in 1966  But I'm very grateful for this film for a lot of fond memories go with it.".

He shows another side of his comedic talent that is very different from what he did in 'Shaolin Soccer' and 'Kung Fu'. Carina Lau displays her versatility by playing a comic role as the devoted and loving wife Kar. The relationship of the two characters is very well portrayed and is one of the highlights of the film. There are also many funny characters as I mentioned in the summary that just make the movie experience more fun. The over the top fight scenes are both comical and well shot fitting well with the context. Yes a lot of the scenes are done in a cheesy way a lot of them are far fetched too but then again it just adds to the humour. There are several laugh out loud moments and very funny twists. I am pretty sure that one will be unstoppably laughing throughout the film. I find 'Daai laap mat taam 008' to be a very refreshing comedy but it's probably the kind one would either hate or like very much.".

	schema:headline " Incredibly funny gender bending martial arts comedy";
	schema:reviewBody "There's a special quality to the comedy in this film that's heightened immeasurably by the really warm and vital characters that stand at the center of this very goofy film. The story itself feels like it was cooked up in an evening of drinking but the way that it's executed by director Vincent Kok and uncredited collaboratorstar Stephen Chow makes it so that story is always a sideconsideration to character development rather than a necessary cause of changes. Zany and cartoonish like Chow's more famous 2000s film Kung Fu Hustle but anchored by the kind of convincing romantic relationship that made Shaolin Soccer a better film the film is nothing less than a joy to behold.Although the American title seems to imply that it's a cop story perhaps because of the 1990s popularity of Hong Kong police movies the film is actually more of a spoof of spy movies as its original title implies. There's a very clever title sequence that spoofs the Bond sequences and then Chow plays a hero named Ling Ling Fat who is an inventor of strange devices which he uses to defend the Emperor TatMing Cheung. He is a secret agent and has chosen gynecology as his cover. In furtherance of his cover and to protect the curious Emperor he travels to an important medical conference in the Gum province to see a flying fairy dissection. The leaders of Gum a brand of bizarre villains headed by No Face have set an obvious trap for the Emperor and it's up to agent Fat to save him.The most extraordinary aspect of the film is the wonderful chemistry between Chow and his wife played by Carina Lau. Lau is an incredible actress to judge from this film and Chow is a very good comedian so they create a unique coupling. I'll never be able to forget nor would I want to some of Lau's more interesting doubletakes and expressions. The scenes with these two actors or the real treasure of the film.However it has much more to offer besides. First of all there is some decent kung fu action although most of this is confined to the early and final sections of the film. Chow is no kung fu master and has no desire to pretend to be so the humorous devices he comes up with such as a pistol that he fires out of his mouth are a great substitute and provide plenty of action. More interesting still is the emphasis in this movie on what could only be called transgender themes the instances of which are almost too numerous to recount. First there is Fat's mysterious helper a man dressed as a woman whom he later inexplicably claims is his sister. There is also a scene where Chow himself crossdresses to get into a geisha house and is surprised and titillated by a masculinized geisha from Gum who he meets there. Although this is a zany comedy there are serious themes here concerning the nature of identity. The villains all have ambiguous identity and sexuality  No Face has no gender and his wife looks almost like a man. His son calls himself Two Face and travels around with an indescribably bizarre getup that allows himself to appear to his enemies as either a man or a woman. Ling Ling Fat as part of his job as gynecologist is called upon at one point to decide if the flying fairy who looks like a Roswell alien is a man or a woman. He decides the fairy must be a woman because of the lack of business down there but it turns out to be the Emperor in disguise. So much gender confusion I have never seen in any film much less in a martial arts comedy. The point of it seems to be on the one hand to provide a very different kind of humor and on the other hand to put doubt in the audience's mind about their own preconceptions on gender.This is a unique fascinating movie that has provided me with great insight into the style and philosophy of Stephen Chow. There are many hilarious scenes that I haven't even been able to hint at here particularly towards the end of the film. I'd say it's one of the most unusual and memorable comedies of the 1990s.".

No you could say the bigger picture is underdeveloped as well as the villain characters generally but frankly I was enjoying the comic bits too much to worry about it. Some scenesthe awards scene the dance scene with disco moves the scene of doctorpatient switching roles perhapsmostly borrow off other movies with reference to other times  places I always think of Mel Brooks and for that reason it was more a nod of acknowledgment than a laugh from me. But it was the little details throughout a line here or there that really were fresh and got me loving this movie. If you like your comedy a little out of the mainstream I think you'll see what I'm talking about. I'll resist quotes it's hardly funny out of context... And yeah I agree with others about his wifeit was surprisingly touching watching their relationship. Again I'd credit some nice details it pays off.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie started out with so much potential but like a lot of Stephen Chow movies the second half goes crazy and becomes TOO MUCH of a cartoon.Possible minor spoilersThe beginning of the movie is funny. We are introduced to Chow's character Fat who enjoys inventing things. Unfortunately his fellow Forbidden City Cops and the emperor  value martial arts more so it seems like he is not needed. We are then introduced to his wife who is very likable. Following this is a fight scene where all the Forbidden City Cops with the exception of Fat are ambushed and destroyed in the woods. This is a great scene full of action and humor. Up until THIS POINT the movie is great! It strikes a good balance between believability and random humor.Here's where the movie starts to SUCK. I'm not a professional movie critic so I probably cannot point out all the exact reasons why but it's obvious that the movie becomes TOO farfetched and random. The believability is thrown completely out the window and the whole show becomes too much like a bad cartoon. The emperor who was taken when the Forbidden City Cops were ambushed is dressed in an alien suit and almost gets an autopsy by Fat. It may sound a little funny but it's done in a very stupid and cheesy way and doesn't match the level of realism in the first half I know it's a comedy but I would think you have to maintain a stable level of realism and not just change halfway through the movie.Then Fat uses some of the inventions we were introduced to in the superior first half do defeat the enemies. All this is done in the most stupid and cheesy way possible. He uses staff shaped like a propeller to fly by spinning it around in his hands! Then he sticks a gun like object in his mouth to shoot down all the enemies! All this is done in that ugly blue light Hong Kong movies use so much. The scene is totally stupid and what more all the enemies seem destroyed! Shouldn't the movie finally be done?Nope. Seems only 56 or so minutes have passed to they need to add more movie. What follows is an idiotic storyline about how the emporer gets Fat to go look for a good looking prostitute because all his concubines are fat yes there is a scene with a lot of fat women running at the screen. It's just all totally stupid from here. I'm done with this review. The first half was so good too.".

This happy picture is shattered into a million pieces as on the day of Diya's birthday a psychotic postman under pretense of delivering a letter to the house breaks into the house savagely beats rapes and murders Sonia the most heartbreaking scene in the whole movie as Naina is on the other end of a cell phone conversation with her sister at the time of the murder and is forced to hear the desperate screams of her dying twin. When the justice systems lets this man off due to witness who changes their testimony Naina is driven mad with grief and with aid from an exarmy official played brilliantly by Sanjay Dutt arms herself to track this ruthless killer and serve justice where the courts can't. It isn't an easy feat however as the killer is all too aware of Naina stalking him and decides to finish her off in much the same manner as her sister.Though revenge plots are nothing new to Bollywood this one is different because it does not show a gunwielding hero stealing agun from somewhere and go on a mad killing spree to avenge his family. It shows a sister who first has to come to terms with the unbearable loss she has suffered and has to train herself adequately  so she has the means necessary to avenge her sister . Kajol IS Naina and Sonia! She plays the two separate personalities as effortlessly as she plays the tormented twin sister who can't look in the mirror anymore because of the reflection that stares back at her. I couldn't imagine a better choice for the role. Same does for Ashutosh Rana as Ghokul. I refused to believe that this was this man's debut venture! he is simply terrifying and i had to hide my face half the time he was on screen simply because of his overwhelming evil presence. The rest of the cast gives perfect support Tanvi Azmi as the mother impresses .A mustsee for Kajol fans if not for the plot than simply for her mindblowing performance. ".

	schema:headline " After Pran it's Ashutosh for you to hate";
	schema:reviewBody "This brilliant thriller starring Kajol Sanjay Dutt and debutant villain Ashutosh Rana has been directed by debutant lady director Tanuja Chandra who has borrowed the plot from the Hollywood movie Eye for an Eye the difference being here is that while in the Hollywood movie the mother inflicts revenge upon the rapist murderer here the job is done by the twin sister of the victim. Tanuja Chandra went ahead to direct movies like Sangharsh Yeh Zindagi Ka Safar Sur Zindagi Rocks and Filmstar later on. However this maiden venture of herself is considered as her best till date.The story belongs to the rape and murder of one of the twin sisters by a sexmaniac postman whose next victim is the other sister. How the surviving twinsister is able to kill her Dushman enemy is the remaining story. The director has given a highly admirable treatment to the plot making it thoroughly engrossing but for some songs which interrupt the flow of the story.During 50s and 60s Pran was the most deadly villain of bollywood who was hated so much by the audience that some years back he had announced a reward for a person named as Pran during that period because people had stopped naming their kids after his name. After him no bollywood villain could match his deadly baddiness perhaps with the exception of Amjad Khan as Gabbar Singh in Sholay till Ashutosh arrived on the scene with Dushman. He deservingly won all the best villain awards for 1998. His presence on the screen in this movie is nothing short of a spinechilling one. His contribution is the most in making this movie a memorable one.Kajol has excelled in her double role. Interestingly Karan Johar's blockbuster Kuchh Kuchh Hota Hai was also released in the same year 1998 but Kajol won the Screen award for the best actress for her performance in Dushman instead of KKHH. The scene in which one sister is being victimized by the villain whereas the other one is listening to her painful and panicked shrieks on the other side of the telephone is the best scene of the movie in which both Kajol and Ashutosh have taken their acting performance to the dizzy heights.Among others Jas Arora and Tanvi Aazmi have done well. The movie also stars Sanjay Dutt in the subdued role of a blind exarmyman who boosts the morale of the remaining twinsister and supports her when she does not get justice from the law for her victimized twin. He is neither excellent nor bad.The music by Uttam Singh is okay. However it would have been better to trim the movie by excluding some songs as the freeflow of the narrative is blocked by them and a kind of laxity emerges in the postinterval session.Technically the movie is very good. In fact it's a pity that such a superb movie flopped on the box office. In my view Dushman is one of the finest crimerevenge thrillers ever made in bollywood..".

I think you don't need a brain looks or acting skills to become a Bollywood actoractress. Back to the film produced by none other than hammy actress Pooja Bhatt daughter of Mahesh BhattButt. Incidentally the screenplay is written by Mahesh Bhatt so you know he has stolen from ideas from a Hollywood film. Combination of two hams father and daughter. Another Butt ugly filmThis film also stars Robin Bhatt. Its seems the whole family threw in the sack of beans making this flick.Also this film marked the Bollywood debut of a nerdy shrimp of a female director Tanuja Chandra.The most surprising thing to me is that Sanjay Dutt signed up for this film. It seems NO ONE WANTED TO PLAY THE PART SO.......you get the picture???Plotfor people who saw the film and didn't understand it. Written in simple English Sonia and Naina Sehgal both played by Kajol are twins. At the same time the police are hunting for a killer and rapist. The man Gokul Pandit Ashutosh Rana is a coldblooded animal and has chosen Naina for his next target. However tragedy strikes when Gokul brutally kills Sonia. Naina is distraught and vows to hunt down Gokul. Gokul soon goes after Naina and she realizes she needs help to overcome her fear of him. With that she meets Suraj Singh Rathod Sanjay Dutt a retired and blind major and he helps her physically and mentally to defeat her fear of Gokul. After an argument Suraj refuses to meet Naina and she decides to go after Gokul alone without the help of the police or Suraj.....Pros 1.Good music by legendary playback singers Asha Bhosle Shankar Mahadevan Lata Mangesjkar Udit Narayan Kumar Sanu Jagjit Singh. 2.Ashutosh Rana is awesome as usual. 3.Also stars Sanjay Dutt as a bonus.Cons 1.Poorly shot rape scenes full censorship as usual. This is a rape film and they don't show the rapes??? 2. This film stars Kajol in her most hysterical role. 3. Sanjay Dutt ISN'T nude for this flick sorry gals. 4. Kajol ISN'T nude for this flick sorry guys you can STOP the preparations for a good night's SHAG.In conclusion Better to buy the AUDIO CD rather than wasting your money on the VCDDVD.Score this isn't a cricket or football match....butt....410.".

He becomes his karate teacher but they develop a great friendship that makes the movie all the more enjoyable. The great thing is that the movie shows that the old man comes to need the kid as much as the kid needs him it is a touching relationship.

There are also a few scenes in which ethnic slurs are used by rednecks toward Miyagi.Taking this into light and taking the fact that Daniel has no father that we know of in this movie the name Danielsan sounds like DanielSON helps demonstrate a father son bond that is overlooked. Much of the conversation between Daniel and Miyagi is about Miyagi's great father in Okinawa because Miyagi has acquired all this knowledge and wants to share it. Daniel substitutes for the son Miyagi never had and Miyagi substitutes for the father Daniel doesn't have.".

	onyx:emotionText "A lot of posts focus on the 'coming of age' aspect of this movie but the very overlooked part is the role it played in helping to alleviate many of the stereotypes a very Asian phobic America was after WWII Korea and Vietnam.They make a point of showing Miyagi in a US Army Uniformand a War Hero and makes references to detention camps Miyagi's family was sent to a horribly dark period in American history...where Miyagi's wife was being sent pregnant and where she and his unborn child son ultimately die during childbirth. There are also a few scenes in which ethnic slurs are used by rednecks toward Miyagi.Taking this into light and taking the fact that Daniel has no father that we know of in this movie the name Danielsan sounds like DanielSON helps demonstrate a father son bond that is overlooked. Much of the conversation between Daniel and Miyagi is about Miyagi's great father in Okinawa because Miyagi has acquired all this knowledge and wants to share it. Daniel substitutes for the son Miyagi never had and Miyagi substitutes for the father Daniel doesn't have.";

	schema:reviewBody "My love of The Karate Kid is limited to the fact that this movie if it had been in the hands of a more fluorescent director could have turned out a lot differently from the movie we all know and love from 1984.Directed by John G. Avildsen who also did 1976's Rocky  another underdog story and written by Robert Mark Kamen who would later coauthor 2001's Kiss of the Dragon with Luc Besson which starred Jet Li  another example of martial arts in American cinema done right The Karate Kid is by far the best and frankly most realistic incorporation of martial arts into a mainstream American film.This movie came out the year before I was born and only through wordofmouth over the time I was growing up did I know that The Karate Kid even existed. I got to view the film my freshman year in high school as part of a class but the instructor watered down the experience so much that the movie lost its potency.Now a few years later I finally watch the movie without any intrusion from the outside world and I find a truly marvelous picture that's far better than its many stylized contemporaries i.e. The Matrix trilogy which is the best example of that trend.Ralph Macchio stars as Daniel LaRusso a new kid to a picturesque southern California community that looks a lot like something you'd see in a magazine advertisement. Daniel makes the mistake of hitting on Ali Elisabeth Shue who unknown to him is the exgirlfriend of Johnny Lawrence William Zabka and Daniel takes a pretty brutal beating from the martial artstrained Johnny that leaves him scarred but with his pride and dignity still in tact.The number of violent clashes with Johnny and his brutal Cobra Kai martial arts friends continue until Daniel is saved by Mr. Miyagi Pat Morita the karatetrained handyman of his apartment building. Daniel insists on Mr. Miyagi teaching him karate so that he can compete in an upcoming martial arts tournament this requires Daniel to undergo some pretty unconventional training  wax on wax off paint fence  side to side etc. And in return Daniel learns that there's a lot more to karate than just fighting and the Old One shows him that way.The Karate Kid is a true gem of a film that's shamefully underrated. I'm glad that on February 1st of this year this movie is finally getting the DVD treatment it deserves.Macchio is convincing as Daniel bringing a number of wideranging emotions to his role that at first may seem quite perfunctory as opposed to being dramatic. The real star of the show at least in the minds of a number of critics and the Academy is Morita as Mr. Miyagi. He brings grace almost rivaling Bruce Lee to a role that could have been quite stereotypical but is still very moving and dramatic.Of course what's a movie about karate without the fights? I should note that the action in this movie is very convincing but is not stylized in any fashion shape or form. It is very downtoearth and realistic and that may of course be a bit of a turnoff to some hardcore fanboys that may watch this movie thinking it'll be something like The Matrix 1999 or Enter the Dragon 1973.The fighting here is in its own style and mode of action. A number of the fights are quite brutal especially in the ones where John Kreese's Martin Kove Cobra Kai students are featured as he frequently trains them the brutal way of no mercy which Mr. Miyagi is quick to realize is not the way of karate.The Karate Kid gets a perfect 1010.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is a legend in my eyes. It has a great plot 2 brilliantly played leading actors and a great finish. It also has a great cast but the Cobra Kai weren't really successful in their movies?? They hardly featured in any. You could say it was a one hit wonder as the numbers 2 and 3 failed to live upto the hype of 1. Elisabeth Shue is gorgeous in this movie and she and Johnny from the Cobra Kai are very likable characters.I remember back in the day when me and my friends watched this over and over in our childhood ALONG with Home Alone!! I'm now 24 but still enjoy this flick 20 years after it was first released! Can you believe it? It should have had more ratings than 6. The story is about an underdog Daniel LaRusso and his efforts to defeat the wrongly taught 'bad' students. Teacher say Student do...Mr Miyagi  played by Pat Morita is  amazing. It should have won him the Oscar award but he must feel privileged to be the first AsianAmerican actor to be nominated for an Oscar award.Mr Miyagi and Daniel click from the very beginning. It's a superb movie and shivers run through my back every time I watch the ending  SPOILER  and the infamous 'crane finish'. Mostly because it reminds me of the olden days and the whole 'underdog spirit' thing. It really does motivate you. It has some very distinctive lines that were made popular by this movie. In the late 80's and early 90's you had all the kids doing karate and saying 'wax on wax off' they still do! It has some memorable quotes some which are on the IMDb kk1 page.IMO it's a legend and legends never die. This will be played over and over...and over again on my poor DVD player for another 10 years hopefully!.I really do recommend it to the younger generation....BRILLIANT MOVIE...910!!".

It illustrates how a lonely outofplace kid triumphs against the odds and the movie doesn't need computeranimation or special effects to get its story across.  But for me and anyone who loves '80s movies the The Karate Kid has to be appreciated for its nostalgia trip back to better times.  For that reason alone this movie is a classic.I've enjoyed few movies if any more than The Karate Kid.  I highly recommend this flick to anyone who loves a touching uplifting story or to anyone who simply can't get out of the '80s!!!".

Given half a chance.Macchio and Shue were competent the former had some momentum from Happy DaysLaverne and Shirley and the latter was beginning a short career as a type of brat pack teenage star but it was Morita who owned the film and kept your interest.Unfortunately the historical record even on the IMDb does not reflect any of this. Shue actually won an award for a completely forgettable part and Morita not only did not win anything for this film but the only nominations he received were in the supporting role category. This is clear color blindness on the part of Hollywood. He has almost as much screen time as Macchio I counted but because his career was merely bit parts before and after this was the prevailing mindset. The film would have failed without him.As a footnote I was not able to identify precisely why he was cast in the role but historically Okinawa has indeed been associated with its own unique brand of martial arts and in the martial arts world short stocky older men have long been acknowledged as champions even though in the films of our present era someone of Morita's age or bodytype would never even be considered for such a part.The two sequels were much weaker but the demand for them was great and when there is money on the table Hollywood will always oblige.".

Another thing that really impressed me was that I heard that Billy Zabka really took that kick to the face in the conclusion of the tournament. The characters really play off of each other and the result is astounding. One thing however I find almost unbelievable is that in this movie Ralph Macchio is almost 23 years old. With his ability to pull off such a young role and his performances in The Outsiders along with these Karate Kid movies I believe he is one of the best actors ever. All in all this movie is a must see and an extremely good classic.".

As if through divine intervention the role of Mr. Miyagi was created a natural and defining role for Pat Morita. Like the main character Danielsan who earned dignity and respect through karate so too did Pat Morita earn dignity and respect as an actor for his role as Mr. Miyagi. The Miyagi character is a humble softspoken respected Asian sensei teacher. He is humble not because he is weak and avoids being some bully's victim but because he knows he holds the fate of all who bullies him in his hands.

The feud between Lawrence and LaRusso is wellscripted and executed as is the feud between Miyagi and Cobra Kai Sensei Kreese. This is the definitely the best film out of the four Karate Kid movies. I grew up as a really big fan of these fans and I'm glad they finally released the DVD set. I've searched the internet looking for good articles about the films and there's a very funny article by humorist Rob Bloom about Johnny Lawrence and Daniel LaRusso on Rob Bloom's website.

	schema:reviewBody "Having a man teach you a valuable art such as that of Karate is invaluable especially if you are young inexperienced and in a battle with people who you have no hope against. However viewers of the 'Karate Kid' get to learn a valuable lesson for life out of this story that fighting is a waste of time and with time and patience anything can be achieved. In addition viewers get to hear the cute pronunciation of Danielsan' by the great teacher!Fatherless teenager Daniel is a new arrival in Los Angeles when he becomes the object of bullying by the Cobras a menacing group of Karate students. Daniel asks his handyman Miyagi whom is a martial arts master to teach him how to fight. Miyagi teaches Daniel that karate is mastery over the self  mind and body  and that violence is always the last answer to a problem. Under Miyagi's guidance Daniel learns the physical skills while gaining faith and the selfconfidence to compete against the odds as he faces the fight of his life in the exciting finale.I remember watching this film along time ago but boy was it a thrill. Sure it didn't have 'big stars' or big action in it. One thing it did have was 'heart'. The character of Daniel was one person that typifies this. At no stage does this teenage loner from New Jersey ever give up when at times that might have been the best thing for him to do. I feel that this story and character for that matter is how we need to approach our own lives because if you keep putting in the hard yards and standup for what you believe in things will soon turn around.The stars of this movie are not bad. Firstly main star Ralph Macchio was excellent as Daniel. I felt he brought the struggling teenage character to the screen perfectly. He is a very nave and inexperienced young man yet with time and patience he makes what was a terrible situation seem nothing big at all. I enjoyed Macchio in other movies including 'The three wishes of Billy Greer' a movie which again suited this tough actor about a young man who is dying from premature aging in addition to movies such as 'The last POW? The Bobby Garwood Story'. I cannot praise Macchio any higher.Other stars are just as worthy. Pat Morita was wonderful as the wise and what I feel was the humorous Miyagi'. His role was just as good as his counterpart Macchio yet it was also very different. Miyagi is one person that does not like the spotlight yet when his young friend is placed in a very precarious position in his new home town he steps in and shows what a great Karate man he really is. Then you have the other side of this story which of course has to have a girl in it with Daniel striking up a relationship with the popular Ali Mills. Actress Elizabeth Shue who has also had a somewhat 'celebrated' career played Ali. She has starred in films such as the controversial 'Leaving Los Vegas' 'Back to the future II' and 'III' and the 1988 hit 'Cocktail'. Though there are times that you expect Daniel to never make it with Ali in the end he does have a faithful person outside of Miyagi.The bad guys are not bad in this film either with that part of the cast including Martin Kove as the arrogant Karate Teacher John Kreese who will stop at nothing to see the end of the fairytale of LaRusso and Miyagi. His main student and the person who wants Daniel's blood the most is Johnny Lawrence played by William Zabka and although he has not go on to big and better roles his bad guy role was enjoyable in the Karate Kid. I did read in one review on IMDb where a person claimed that the bad guys were not given enough of their own treatment. However I disagree considering the bullying and beatings that Daniel receives I feel that Daniel and Miyagi teach the 'Cobras' a lesson. Sure we don't get to see Kreese get what he deserves but if you have not seen the second Karate Kid then you will get to see what awaits this cruel and relentless individual.The Karate lessons and fighting sequences in this film are incredible. I guess like Daniel most of the fans of this film would assume that Daniel is not learning anything yet being Miyagi's personal slave. However we get to see how intelligent this old Okinawa man is through all of his work for Daniel he teaches him some very basic and vital Karate moves. I love the attitude that this movie brings to everyone that fighting is the last option for any situation whether it is verbal or physical. I think this is so true as fighting gets people nowhere. It just makes life bad for both parties again this movie shows this to be so true.In conclusion the Karate Kid is a truly great film but perhaps I am showing what era that I grew up in? I cannot say that I totally agree with Karate as it is a very Chinese practice but if it is based around what Miyagi teaches that is for selfdefence and then it might be ok. I am sure many moviegoers will never forget the finale to this movie because I am sure I never will. The sequels which follow slowly start to lose there appeal with this story but not to matter if you are looking for a story which shows you that giving up is not really an option then see what is so special about this story of a courageous Karate student and his clever teacher!CMRS gives 'The Karate Kid' 5 Brilliant Film".

	schema:reviewBody "The Karate Kid is directed by John G. Avildsen and written by Robert Mark Kamen. It stars Ralph Macchio Pat Morita Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor and Elisabeth Shue. Daniel LaRusso Macchio moves with his mother Randee Heller from Newark New Jersey to Reseda a neighbourhood in the San Fernando Valley region of Los Angeles California. Pretty much from the off Daniel finds he doesn't belong and quickly incurs the wrath of Johnny Lawrence William Zabka who is the exboyfriend of the only person Daniel has connected with Ali Mills Shue. Not good since Johnny is an ace karate student from the Cobra Kai dojo a place where the students are taught winning is everything by tough exforces sensei John Kreese Martin Kove. But salvation and a stop to the beatings at the hands of Lawrence and his bully loving friends may come in the form of the quirky but kind handyman at the apartment complex Mr. Miyagi Morita. In 1976 John G. Avildsen had directed one of the most loved of all the underdog comes good movies Rocky. Fast forward to 1984 and we find Avildsen treading on the same turf only for a younger audience. What was to follow would be a monster hit movie it made over 90 million domestically alone that spawned three sequels a remake pop culture bonanza and more telling got karate back in the headlines some 11 years after the tragic death of Bruce Lee. Its appeal is not hard to fathom geeky young guy gets beat up on by some suspiciously Aryan bully types forms a wonderful and warm friendship with sage old Chinaman becomes a karate hero after being tutored in an unorthodox manner by kindly Chinaman then kicks Aryan dudes butt. What's not to like there? Hell us young men even had the all American cutie pie looks of Shue she was 21 at the time and Macchio 23 to admire as we joined Daniel in chopping kicking and falling on our asses as we tried the famous Crane Kick. Sure some of it looks creaky now but it's creakiness with an 80s charm that still engages today. So lets get waxing on and waxing off and relieve the moment when we all cheered at the climax of this simple yet utterly beguiling movie. 810".

	onyx:emotionText "The Karate Kid is directed by John G. Avildsen and written by Robert Mark Kamen. It stars Ralph Macchio Pat Morita Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor and Elisabeth Shue. Daniel LaRusso Macchio moves with his mother Randee Heller from Newark New Jersey to Reseda a neighbourhood in the San Fernando Valley region of Los Angeles California. Pretty much from the off Daniel finds he doesn't belong and quickly incurs the wrath of Johnny Lawrence William Zabka who is the exboyfriend of the only person Daniel has connected with Ali Mills Shue. Not good since Johnny is an ace karate student from the Cobra Kai dojo a place where the students are taught winning is everything by tough exforces sensei John Kreese Martin Kove. But salvation and a stop to the beatings at the hands of Lawrence and his bully loving friends may come in the form of the quirky but kind handyman at the apartment complex Mr. Miyagi Morita. In 1976 John G. Avildsen had directed one of the most loved of all the underdog comes good movies Rocky. Fast forward to 1984 and we find Avildsen treading on the same turf only for a younger audience. What was to follow would be a monster hit movie it made over 90 million domestically alone that spawned three sequels a remake pop culture bonanza and more telling got karate back in the headlines some 11 years after the tragic death of Bruce Lee.

Ralph Macchio stars as Daniel LaRusso who is forced to move to Reseda. He meets Ali Mills and makes an enemy with her exboyfriend Johnny. When Daniel is violently bullied the handyman named Mr. Miyagi agrees to teach him how to defend himself in the art of karate. At first Daniel thinks he's being treated like a slave because he has to wax the cars paint his house but he was really learning karate moves the whole time. Mr. Miyagi gets Daniel ready for an 'All Valley Karate Tournament' where he must confront his enemies and Johnny and see if he has what it takes to be the best and win the gold. I highly recommend THE KARATE KID!!!".

They just work so well together in this film. I love Mr. Miyagi he is such a lovely character who looks very stern at times but other times he comes across as very warm and funny who has some of the best scenes in the movie and had me in stitches.It doesn't matter that I know what happens at the end I still get gripped by the ending it is a very feel good movie where the bullies get their comeuppance and even respect Daniel at the end. Love the song that plays during the Karate Tournament You're the best just works well with the action.A childhood film I continue to have a lot of warmth for even today.".

The cinematography is gorgeous the acting is fantastic the dialogue is great the emotion is strong the characters are likable and the music is fantastic. I can't believe that this only has a 6.9 and that awful film Avatar has an 8.3. This is in my opinion the most underrated movie of all time. How could anyone not like it. There is one scene in the film that cinematography is so good that my flat screen couldn't even fully capture the moment. Ralph Macchio gives what is in my opinion one of the most underrated performances in film history. When people think of a fantastic child actor performance nobody ever thinks about Macchio in The Karate Kid. They think of Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense or Jodie Foster in Taxi Driver. Me personally I think that Macchio deserves to be mentioned in the conversation of great child acting. All others in the cast do a great job but the person who steals the show is Pat Morita as Mr. Miyagi. He deserved the Oscar he got nominated for. The music is great. Both the orchestrated score and the 80's pop songs are really good. The one that stands out though is Your the Best by Joe Esposito. It is one of the catchiest songs you'll ever hear. The strength of the emotion in this film is very strong like the director's other film Rocky. That's another thing I want to mention. I hate how this is underneath the shadow of Rocky. Rocky is excellent but so is this film. In fact this film may be even better. This film really needs more love. It is a great movie that even with all these years that have went by is still not truly given the credit it deserves.4 stars out of 4".

Here Bennett gives it a go in a story that was based on a 1909 stage play. She portrays the eldest of five children living with their parents in a squalid cramped New York tenement. The father resists working while the mother barely manages to wrangle the kids and put supper on the table. Bennett toils behind the tie counter at a department store until one day she gets the opportunity to pose as a model for advertising artists. She doesn't stop with this modest success and proceeds to hook up with the boss Menjou who fixes her up with a fancy apartment and all the jewels and furs she can handle. During this she aids her family as well though a few of them reject her for the way she earns her keep. On an extended visit to Colorado she happens upon handsome young writer Montgomery and quickly falls for him. She decides to give up her lavish kept lifestyle and return to work while he is away on assignment knowing he will be back for her to marry him. But can she take that step backwards? Bennett one of the highest paid and most popular stars of the era presents an appealing and attractive persona check out that waist! She knows that what she's doing is wrong yet circumstances seem to prevent her from doing otherwise unless she wants to exist in poverty. Menjou is assured and manipulative in his role. Montgomery is quite fresh and likable for the better part of his screen time. Page appears to great advantage as Bennett's far earthier sister who winds up wed to Gable in one of his very earliest roles. He's handsome though his character is a little selfrighteous. Rambeau makes an impression as one of Bennett's sidekicks in the modeling biz who also reaches for the top in the mistress game. Virtually all of the cast members give vivid performances. The opening sequences in the rundown apartment are quite fascinating in their snappy dialogue and depiction of the hard times. Today's audiences will be able to see through the predictable plotting but the film still holds interest. Though the Hays Office is sometimes blamed for tampering with the material the 1917 silent version had at least as downbeat an ending as this one does. In fact if the story were to end any other way than it does there'd be very little point to it all!".

Beautiful Constance Bennett makes her character of the dreamy and uncertain girl totally believable  With a restrained anxious attitude never totally at ease. In real life Bennett had a somewhat different character ! And Anita Page as her more earthy sister. Clark Gable has a small but important role one of his very first  and he looks quite natural. Robert Montgomery was not a great actor he's always the same in every movie. His character in this film is pretty annoying. Adolphe Menjou comes across as more sympathetic. The final scene is very unusual and beautiful. It's like a scene in a dream  It uplifts the whole film.Should be seen in a theater for maximum impact.".

I was expecting a showdown at the end but she was happy to try to sneak out with Jack and avoid a confrontation with Brockton who with a few subtle clues you'll find my handerchiefs in the top draw was able to fill Jack in. Whatever happened to Anita Page? She may have portrayed Clark Gable's first on screen love interest but it was pretty thankless being very much a supporting part and not very glamorous.

	schema:reviewBody "The initial sequences of this film and indeed a good portion of it otherwise are arranged in such a way that truly evokes the environment of the time period with the beginning shots capturing the squalorous destitution of the family home and the amusing shot in particular of the family eating breakfast while the camera remains idle focusing on their activity that's the type of stuff which I love. As others have stated as the year implies as I no doubt need to mention this is a PreCode film. Unlike films made later in this very same decade that have been rigorously codified and placed into the upper echelons of Golden Age fantasy and whimsy this is one of those films that truly captures the gritty reality of the Great Depression and which keeps all the trimmings in the process. What I find most interesting about this films is indeed the reality which they offer which is something that goes to foreshadow the development of the sitcom and indeed to watch a PreCode is exactly like to watch a modern sitcom or at least one of the more classic sitcoms before that genre itself became overdone. At any rate this film in particular really caused me to question the cultural in the given period of time Art after all is a habit which reflects the mindset and mores of a given place and therefore I'm brought to wonder concerning how much women of 1931 could relate to those in this film. To what extent is the normal woman living in destitution blessed perhaps with supreme feminine charm faced with such conflicts as are portrayed in this film I mean of course in 1931. Surely what the overwhelming majority of these PreCode films leads me to understand is that showbusiness and all other methods in which the female body can be exploited for a profit are things which women of this time are flocking to at the expense of what is held to be traditional morality. Though with Art being a lens into a period of time as above mentioned I continued throughout this film to wonder as to how widespread the moralityforriches tradeoff occurred actually. As far as a takeaway message goes this film in my opinion posits the existence of two classes one exuberantly rich and one exorbitantly poor conflict occurs the film says when people don't mind their class and by this I mean that if the poor and destitute remained poor and destitute yet endured their struggle they will find their due happiness in time. Similarly if the rich abide by their own class herein represented by Adolphe Menjou's character then they too will find their due pleasure in life. Menjou always in my viewings perpetuates the same character he is rich and sophisticated yet takes an interest in the exact type of woman that can never love him. Therefore to betray your own class is akin to masochism let the rich inhabit a romance with the rich and the poor with the poor for love cannot exist in any way befitting if these lines are crossed. I have not at all provided a synopsis of this film since it is well documented by others and on websites yet I have not rated its quality to that end to wit this is a wonderful PreCode film enshrouded in MGM's spectacular production films with a visual sheen and gloss that is pleasing to the eye. I encourage all with an interest for this period or any of the factors above mentioned to view it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Constance Bennett is a woman who gets a sugar daddy in The Easiest Way also starring Adolphe Menjou Robert Montgomery Anita Page and Clark Gable. Made in 1931 it's directed by Jack Conway and it's very well done.Bennett plays Laura who lives in a crowded tenement with her large family which includes her father who manages not to work. She gets an opportunity to model for an advertising agency. While there she catches the eye of the boss Menjou who offers her a life of luxury. She takes it. Her mother shuns her and her brotherinlaw Clark Gable has no use for her. While she and Menjou are in Colorado she meets a reporter Robert Montgomery and they fall in love. She promises to be faithful to him while he's in South America for three months. But it's pretty hard to make it on her own.This is an interesting film. Because the actors were getting used to sound the rhythm is occasionally off i.e. there are sometimes awkward pauses between lines. Everyone's acting is good with the exception of Marjorie Rambeau who has a very melodramatic role and does the tremulous voice thing in her big monologue. Rambeau however had been a Broadway star where her theatrics were more appropriate and it took actors time to learn the art of film acting. She was a fantastic actress and I particularly remember her as Joan Crawford's mother in Torch Song. Constance Bennett as usual was very beautiful. She is excellent in the part of a torn vulnerable woman. Gable is a tough guy sans mustache. He hadn't yet developed his screen persona but the gorgeous smile was there. Robert Montgomery is wonderful as a young reporter.There was a neat shot where the camera travels up a building zeroes in on a window and then zooms in. It was dizzying and exciting and it's the kind of detail that makes The Easiest Way a good watch. There are real outdoor scenes too no painted backdrops and opulent sets. If they weren't opulent they were realistic for instance the crummy apartment where Laura's family lives.There was another ending to this film that the Hays office vetoed. Apparently it was shown in some theaters but is no longer available. I'm a sap so I liked the ending that's in the movie.".

They're poor and the father is a genial drunk. Because of this background it's not at all surprising that when she is given a chance to become her boss' mistress she jumps at the chance. After all he's loaded and pampers her like she's never been pampered before! But folks who know her realize what sort of a woman she is particularly her brotherinlaw Nick. He's wise to the trampy sort of life she leads.A bit later when Laura is on vacation out west she meets a nice guy reporter Johnny Robert Montgomery. He's handsome sweet and you assume they'll soon marryand he knows what sort of woman she was. However this is only about halfway through the film so you know IF there's going to be a happily ever after it will have to come after a few plot twists!This film is a great example of the socalled 'PreCode' and its sensibilities. Although most folks today think all the movies made back in the good 'ol days were very prudish this was NOT the case before mid1934. In the early 30s studios made all sorts of very adult films with plots involving prostitutes abortion fornication and even occasionally nudity and cursing. While the films sometimes didn't always SAY that is what was going on it was always heavily implied and the adults in the audience know the score. Here in The Easiest Way words like 'mistress' 'prostitute' or even that she's sleeping with the suave boss Adolph Menjou...but it's clearly happening! On top of that he nogood dad doesn't mind...he LIKES the money she can send home! Welcome to the precode era folks!So the important question about all this is whether or not the film is any good. If you're watching it for Gable like I was don't expect too much from him. His role is very limited and he clearly is just a contract actor in this film. As for the film itself its quite good. The only negative and I actually liked this was that the ending is very vagueso if you're looking for a perfect formulaic sort of picture this ain't it!".

	schema:reviewBody "The Easiest Way is directed by Jack Conway and adapted to screenplay by Edith Ellis from the 1909 play of the same name written by Eugene Walter. It stars Contance Bennett Adolphe Menjou Robert Montgomery Clark Gable and Anita Page.Obviously tame by today's standards it's still not hard to see why The Easiest Way ruffled feathers back in the day. Essentially the plot finds Bennett as Laura Murdock a poor shop girl who grows so tired of sharing a cramped tenement home with her large family where three to a bed is the norm she lands herself a rich older man Menjou and becomes a kept mistress. This ostracises her greatly and stuck in a loveless relationship she's in a bad place emotionally. Hope comes in the form of Jack Madison Montgomery and the two hit it off right away and fall in love but can Laura leave behind the wealth for the sake of love? Just what is the easiest way?And so it is running at under 75 minutes pic gets away with what it can by ensuring the taboo nature of the story centre is cunningly evident. Conway and Mescall show some deft ambition with mobile camera work and nice framing shots out in the exteriors. Performances are all credible with Gable serving early notice of what was to come in his career and the ending one of many filmed as the makers searched for tonal closure works just fine to linger as a bittersweet aftertaste.Montgomery isn't in it nearly enough given that he is playing one of the key characters and the big issue of women striding out for their right to challenge society's stoneage ideals is inadequately unfurled.

	onyx:emotionText "The Easiest Way is directed by Jack Conway and adapted to screenplay by Edith Ellis from the 1909 play of the same name written by Eugene Walter. It stars Contance Bennett Adolphe Menjou Robert Montgomery Clark Gable and Anita Page.Obviously tame by today's standards it's still not hard to see why The Easiest Way ruffled feathers back in the day. Essentially the plot finds Bennett as Laura Murdock a poor shop girl who grows so tired of sharing a cramped tenement home with her large family where three to a bed is the norm she lands herself a rich older man Menjou and becomes a kept mistress. This ostracises her greatly and stuck in a loveless relationship she's in a bad place emotionally. Hope comes in the form of Jack Madison Montgomery and the two hit it off right away and fall in love but can Laura leave behind the wealth for the sake of love? Just what is the easiest way?And so it is running at under 75 minutes pic gets away with what it can by ensuring the taboo nature of the story centre is cunningly evident. Conway and Mescall show some deft ambition with mobile camera work and nice framing shots out in the exteriors. Performances are all credible with Gable serving early notice of what was to come in his career and the ending one of many filmed as the makers searched for tonal closure works just fine to linger as a bittersweet aftertaste.Montgomery isn't in it nearly enough given that he is playing one of the key characters and the big issue of women striding out for their right to challenge society's stoneage ideals is inadequately unfurled. Other than that this is a thoroughly enjoyable piece of of precode classic cinema. 710";

	schema:reviewBody "What is really remarkable about this precode drama from MGM is that it takes a typical depression era problem and shows the audience that issues are not always resolved that not all socalled bad girls are really bad and that survival sometimes means doing things that others will judge you ethically for paths that you had no other choice for chosing. This shows a typical large lower class family waking up at the start of their day and arguing over every little thing from no butter at the breakfast table to who will need to get into the bathroom first. The arguments are silly but then so is so much family interaction and this extended sequence with Clara Blandick and J. Farrell MacDonald as the gruff parents and Constance Bennett Anita Page and Jack Hanlon as their children is so real that it is almost like a camera was planted in some real family's kitchen and followed them around as they went about their day. Bennett goes to work is noticed by the boss Adolph Menjou becomes his kept woman then falls in love with the not yet successful Robert Montgomery. Even though Bennett sends her family money after moving out they pretty much disown her for what they consider immoral behavior.Meanwhile sister Page gets married to rough around the edges Clark Gable who sees Bennett outside the house at Christmas time and gives her the third degree for bringing shame to the family. Bennett attending social events and swank parties is torn between both true love with Montgomery and financial security with Menjou. Old acquaintance and veteran kept woman Marjorie Rambeau gives her hell for considering dumping Menjou for Montgomery. the script gives the audience the chance to see the conflict within Bennett's mind. She respects Menjou but doesn't love him and loves Montgomery but is afraid of being poor again. So what is a girl to do? That's where the script leaves the audience the choice to guide her fate after the MGM lion roars the end and it's an interesting way of presenting this situation. Bennett never seems like a girl from a poor family with her regal ways and fastidious way of making herself up but then again many early talkie female movie stars like Stanwyck and Crawford never looked like they came from poverty either. Menjou although using his power and position to make Bennett his mistress is not really a cad and that gives him some sympathy. Montgomery's character however is not really developed. At the bottom of the billing Clark Gable first got notice with his small part three scenes and it is obvious that he was being geared for stardom. The future Auntie Em Clara Blandick is nononsense and tough as the mother and J. Farrell MacDonald shines in a scene after Bennett has been rejected by her mother where he comes to her for financial help presumably for a visit to the bootlegger. Small elements like this makes this rise above the many similar women's dramas of the precode depression early talkie era and that makes this a must.".

Her fans wrote Griffith  Mayer believed she would get out of traps that would hold them fast. Surprisingly then in this film she's passive unambitious and defeated at the ripe old age of 20 something. Makes me wonder what her benefactor Menjou saw in her that kept him interested for several years.The beginning scene in the tenement apartment is terrific the crowded setting warm and cozy as the family members get ready to start the day. The entire cast is perfect. Gable is very watchable and it's easy to see he would soon be a star. Montgomery is charming and believable when he tells Bennett he knows about her and Menjou but he loves her and wants to marry her as long as there is no more dilly dallying with Menjou. Rambeau is especially good in the scene where she refuses to loan Bennett 100 a lot of money in 1931 telling her to get off her high horse and do what Rambeau does to support herself. And the generous but notthemarryingkind Menjou is likable and his suits are beautifully cut and fitted.And Anita Page is excellent. A commenter asks what happened to Page's career. In 1930 Page was a star. In 1931 she was a supporting player. In 1933 her MGM contract was not renewed and she retired. Studio politics is what happened to the star who was second in popularity to Garbo.So there was another ending filmed but not used. My guess is that a despairing Bennett jumped onto the RR tracks ala Anna Karenina or teamed up with Rambeau as a Ihatemen gold digger.".

	schema:headline " Fun Spaghetti Western With Great Actors";
	schema:reviewBody "Sono Sartana Il Vostro Becchino aka. Sartana The Gravedigger aka I Am Sartana Your Angel Of Death is a quite humorous Spaghetti Western with a Great Cast.Like in all the original Sartana movies he stars in Gianni Garko is once again very cool as Sartana the genre's most welldressed antihero. This time bounty hunter Sartana needs to clear his name after someone robbed a bank dressed up as Sartana and he is blamed and hunted by his fellow bounty hunters. Accompanied by a fellow bounty hunter the not so welldressed Buddy Ben Frank Wolff Sartana is out to seek those who dared to blame him for their crime.Sartana The Gravedigger is not exactly a 'Comedy' Spaghetti Western but it's certainly a very funny one. Hot Dead a bounty killer fast shot and very unlucky gambler played by the great Klaus Kinski is one of the ironical characters who make this film so funny. Another funny character is villainous and slightly insane bounty killer Deguejo played by BMovie star and regular Spaghetti Western actor Gordon Mitchell who is as most of the characters played by Mitchell very exaggerated but exaggerated in a good funny way. The great Frank Wolff is funny in his role and Gianni Garko is great and epitomizes coolness as in the other Sartana movies.The movie's score is pretty good although the composers actually just plagiarized the work of Ennio Morricone Kinski's theme in this movie is basically a lesser version of Cheyenne's theme in Once Upon A Time In The West and the rest of the film's soundtrack also resembles various Morricone compositions. It's okay to learn from the master however.All things considered Sartana the Gravedigger is a good Spaghetti Western with great actors especially Kinski Wolff and Garko. Highly recommended to every fan of Spaghetti Westerns. 710".

Sartana is falsely accused and is searching for the real bank robbers. The evolving story consists of many little entertaining episodes and whenever you think that the real bad guy is already revealed there is one more twist. In his quest Sartana is assisted only by Buddy Ben who is well played by Frank Wolff the rest of the characters is hunting the bounty put on his head. No problem for Sartana who kills them all most of them with his Derringer pistol. Kinski with more screen time than usual shines in his role as an addicted gambler. The lead characters are having their own and nice scores. Cinematography is above average but I've seen already better. The German budget DVD is OK and has even the original Italian soundtrack.7  10 12".

This Sartana movie perhaps is not a Spaghetti masterpiece  but a watchable and sometimes unusual movie nonetheless .This is definitely one of the best SartanaMovies  tough cynical and with a lot of humor seasoned with all herbs of a cool Spaghetti.

	schema:reviewBody "It's true that the spaghetti western genre isn't one to brag about originality. Movies from it often borrow thematic elements from one another and most of the time that results in one very unsuccessful imitation of the real thing. But sometimes a director is able to look past the genre's obvious limitations and instead of just trying to blindly emulate he focuses on creating something that stands good on it's own. Such is the case of Giuliano Carnimeo's Sartana the Gravedigger.The whole movie revolves around it's main star and character namely Gianni Garko as the crafty nearly legendary gunslinger Sartana. Whom soon after the opening scene finds himself framed for a bank robbery and chased by a neverending wave of bounty hunters. This of course prompts him to track down the people who were actually involved in the robbery and have wrongfully framed him for it. From then on this becomes a fast ride never slowing it's pace. It doesn't try to be anything more than entertainment and it works. Garko's character is an obvious Eastwood look alike both in physical looks and in terms of behavior but then again this has already become an accepted feature to most Spaghetti westerns and for all the good it does Garko has captured if only partially that mysterious man with no name persona that made Eastwood famous. The support cast is equally good in their respective roles with Klaus Kinsky playing a down on his luck bounty hunter and Frank Wolf as the comedic sidekick to Garko's Sartana.Giuliano Carnimeo directs with a strong emphasis on action rather than simply trying to copy Sergio Leone. Sartana the Gravedigger is indeed a fast moving picture. With a large bodycount and countless firefights it doesn't stop to entertain even for just a minute. Some of the action scenes are particularly well done with the battle in the church making the biggest impression. It is by far one of the most unique showdowns I've seen in an Italian western. There Carnimeo employs complete darkness with the only visible light coming from aimless fire of dozens of guns that are trying to hit Sartana while he himself silently kills them off one by one. The battle is accompanied with an atmospheric musical piece by composer Vasco Mancuso that further helps in establishing a claustrophobic no escape feel of the scene.The movie does have it's share of problems and it as a lot of others in the genre suffer from low production values. Typical example would be the not so good costume designs especially in the opening bank robbery where we saw guards wearing some very unwestern like clothing.All in all Sartana the Gravedigger is a very good spaghetti western that is sure to please fans of the genre with it's nonstop action good music and characters".

Such is the case of Giuliano Carnimeo's Sartana the Gravedigger.The whole movie revolves around it's main star and character namely Gianni Garko as the crafty nearly legendary gunslinger Sartana. Whom soon after the opening scene finds himself framed for a bank robbery and chased by a neverending wave of bounty hunters. This of course prompts him to track down the people who were actually involved in the robbery and have wrongfully framed him for it. From then on this becomes a fast ride never slowing it's pace. It doesn't try to be anything more than entertainment and it works. Garko's character is an obvious Eastwood look alike both in physical looks and in terms of behavior but then again this has already become an accepted feature to most Spaghetti westerns and for all the good it does Garko has captured if only partially that mysterious man with no name persona that made Eastwood famous. The support cast is equally good in their respective roles with Klaus Kinsky playing a down on his luck bounty hunter and Frank Wolf as the comedic sidekick to Garko's Sartana.Giuliano Carnimeo directs with a strong emphasis on action rather than simply trying to copy Sergio Leone. Sartana the Gravedigger is indeed a fast moving picture. With a large bodycount and countless firefights it doesn't stop to entertain even for just a minute. Some of the action scenes are particularly well done with the battle in the church making the biggest impression. It is by far one of the most unique showdowns I've seen in an Italian western. There Carnimeo employs complete darkness with the only visible light coming from aimless fire of dozens of guns that are trying to hit Sartana while he himself silently kills them off one by one. The battle is accompanied with an atmospheric musical piece by composer Vasco Mancuso that further helps in establishing a claustrophobic no escape feel of the scene.The movie does have it's share of problems and it as a lot of others in the genre suffer from low production values. Typical example would be the not so good costume designs especially in the opening bank robbery where we saw guards wearing some very unwestern like clothing.All in all Sartana the Gravedigger is a very good spaghetti western that is sure to please fans of the genre with it's nonstop action good music and characters";

Although this film borrows some plot elements from the first Sartana film the script acting and direction is far superior to the first film. The plot has Sartana framed for a bank robbery the price on his head results in countless bounty killers seeking to claim the reward while he strives to discover the true criminal.  Sartana supremely cool never loses his excellent sense of humor and is always in control of every situation. Klaus Kinski gives another of his deliciously weird characterizations as a bounty killer addicted to gambling.  The biggest action sequence in the film has Sartana taking on two dozen opponents in sequence and he doesn't use a gatling gun either.  And there is a nice musical theme.

Marsh he did a total of 15 films with Joan. First class production crew yields a first class film.Joan plays a shopgirl' character that could have had no heart Barbara Stanwyck would have excelled at such an interpretation but the writers gave her an innate goodness that warms Sadie McKee to her audience. Edward Arnold stands out as the drunken millionaire that must have served as a role model for Dudley Moore years later in Arthur.' His sock in the jaw to Joan is unexpected and looks very real. Gene Raymond does well as the love interest and if that was he singing  he did it well. His final scene is very good and somewhat unusual. Franchot Tone does not appear to have had the opportunity to develop his character sufficiently to make him more effective. It must have been good enough because he got Joan after the film was completed. A somewhat zaftig Esther Ralston still manages to demonstrate why she was The American Venus' and why Raymond spent so much of his time smiling. Why her character does not react to Raymond singing a love song to Joan in the Apollo Theater is beyond me. Leo G. Carroll does a superb job as the butler  his distain for the lower class Joan is great.Joan's character has many choices in this film and she generally comes out ahead with some short deviations into taking what she can get when she can get it. She gives great looks at Arnold when she realizes she must be his lover now that they are married and later to her friend when she exclaims So I've got everything huh?' and while reflecting what she has done after throwing Tone out of her house. Arnold also has choices and responds well to the outcome of the marriage. Although the two policemen in the film do not take the tip' offered by Joan they run out after the taxicab man who gets their share presumably to get their cut out outside the presence of Joan.This is excellent movie making and a must see for Joan Crawford fans or anyone else that wants to see a good movie. Highly recommended.".

A somewhat zaftig Esther Ralston still manages to demonstrate why she was The American Venus' and why Raymond spent so much of his time smiling. Why her character does not react to Raymond singing a love song to Joan in the Apollo Theater is beyond me. Leo G. Carroll does a superb job as the butler  his distain for the lower class Joan is great.Joan's character has many choices in this film and she generally comes out ahead with some short deviations into taking what she can get when she can get it. She gives great looks at Arnold when she realizes she must be his lover now that they are married and later to her friend when she exclaims So I've got everything huh?' and while reflecting what she has done after throwing Tone out of her house. Arnold also has choices and responds well to the outcome of the marriage. Although the two policemen in the film do not take the tip' offered by Joan they run out after the taxicab man who gets their share presumably to get their cut out outside the presence of Joan.This is excellent movie making and a must see for Joan Crawford fans or anyone else that wants to see a good movie. Highly recommended.";

	schema:reviewBody "I'd have to describe Sadie McKee as both the typical Joan Crawford vehicle and the typical Franchot Tone vehicle. The two of them who were husband and wife when the film was made are perfectly cast in roles that typified their images in the Thirties.Crawford is the daughter of a cook on the sumptuous palatial Long Island estate where Tone is the young heir and a lawyer by trade. To earn a few extra bucks Crawford occasionally helps mom out serving at formal meals.At one of those meals she hears Tone disparaging her sweetheart Gene Raymond who was caught in a petty theft. Tone makes a big point in saying we can't give people like these help because they're no good. Crawford throws a fit and runs to Raymond.She almost marries Raymond but he runs out on her for Esther Ralston. In New York working as a nightclub cigarette girl she runs into Edward Arnold who is a millionaire with a severe drinking problem. No doubt caused by drinking a lot of rotgut liquor during recently repealed Prohibition. And wouldn't you know it Tone is his lawyer.So Sadie has her three men give you one guess who she winds up with in the end. You'd probably guess right but let's say it's a character altering experience for all.Sadie McKee is probably a good example of the Joan Crawford shop girl before she became a hardened creature like Crystal Allen in The Women. As for Franchot Tone MGM just loved casting him as rich men in a tuxedo probably because he looked so darn good in them. The only way either of them escaped type casting was as they got older they varied their parts due to age. Crawford was ever the film star even in some of the horror flicks she did in the sixties. Tone went right into television and worked steady right up to his death.Sadie McKee however is a good opportunity to see them both young and at the height of their fame. Also note the Nacio Herb BrownArthur Freed ballad All I Do Is Dream Of You comes from Sadie McKee.".

As in many of her early films she begins at the bottom...the daughter of the cook for a wealthy family including Tone. She gets a hot scene right off the bat when she angrily defends her boyfriend who is being derided by the aristocrats at the table by telling them all off this moment actually brings to mind Emily Watson's similar yet much more subdued scene in Gosford Park. Soon she and lover Raymond are off to NYC. This section is fascinating as it portrays the way diners were in that era. There's an astonishing coffee dispenser that is shown in one scene and the Automat is quite interesting to behold not to mention the corned beef hash and 2 poached eggs for 0.35! Circumstances progress to where she is working in a dance hall and showing some positively scary legs! It amazing how times have changed in that today a similar dancer would have to have sticks for legs and breasts out to there etc.... Here she becomes associated with a drunken millionaire Arnold who takes a major shine to her. Fortunately for the viewer she sticks with him so she can wear an array of dazzling Adrien gowns and furs. Ultimately each of the men in her life Tone Raymond Arnold presents her with a variety of conflicts and decisions....all of which she handles with the utmost nobility and grace. She is photographed magnificently throughout with her amazing profile and luminescent eyes featured repeatedly. It's a good thing the film is in black and white because she'd be too much to deal with in color! Everyone knows that Hurrell retouched his amazing portraits of her but here she looks quite wonderful with just make up and good lighting. The plot is creaky and contrived and the film is just plain out of date but it's great to see Joan in action in her quintessential role and there's a decent performance from Arnold and nice work by several other supporting players including Hitchcock favorite Carroll. One fun thing to watch for As a precursor of the later more antagonistic Crawford Joan gets fed up with a nightclub singer barks at her to Shut up! and shoves her backwards into a trunk! Fun stuff.".

	schema:reviewBody "This boxoffice hit from 1934 is a joy to behold for its lack of dripping syrup or treacle as is often the case with these female melodramas even the best of them. Joan Crawford plays a role she basically had a patent on in the late twenties through the thirties.  Note Joan Crawford when photographed rightly looks like the most beautiful woman in the world. The role is that of a servant girl who is in love with one of her fellow workers. He gets fired by the family for something they know he did not do but to make an example of him still let him go. This obviously gets Joan riled up and she quits to the chagrain of the master's son Franchot Tone who loves her. They move together take the hard knocks together and I'll never forget a scene where a guy puts a cigarette into a hardly eaten cream cake the look on SadieJoan's face is priceless. Will Joan keep her man? Will she survive and escape the claws of poverty? We all know what will happen and Joan to her credit gives one of her best and enduring performances.

	onyx:emotionText "This boxoffice hit from 1934 is a joy to behold for its lack of dripping syrup or treacle as is often the case with these female melodramas even the best of them. Joan Crawford plays a role she basically had a patent on in the late twenties through the thirties.  Note Joan Crawford when photographed rightly looks like the most beautiful woman in the world. The role is that of a servant girl who is in love with one of her fellow workers. He gets fired by the family for something they know he did not do but to make an example of him still let him go. This obviously gets Joan riled up and she quits to the chagrain of the master's son Franchot Tone who loves her. They move together take the hard knocks together and I'll never forget a scene where a guy puts a cigarette into a hardly eaten cream cake the look on SadieJoan's face is priceless. Will Joan keep her man? Will she survive and escape the claws of poverty? We all know what will happen and Joan to her credit gives one of her best and enduring performances.

I think of 1934 as the start of the code period but this is clearly preCode material. Not realistic in the modern sense but more complex and human than I expected.The real revelation to me was Franchot Tone as Michael in whose aristocratic home Sadie grew up as the daughter of the cook. I have seen Tone in a number of other films  Mutiny on the Bounty and Lives of a Bengal Lancer come to mind  but I think I need to seek out some more of his films. In Sadie McKee he displayed more emotional range and acting technique than I had ever before seen from him. I understand that he and Crawford were married for awhile after this film was completed. It's easy to imagine the attraction.".

She runs off to the city with Tommy presumably to get married but Tommy abandons her. Instead of finally believing Tommy is a rat Sadie still blames it all on Michael. Seeing a chance to get back at him and to become wealthy herself Sadie marries Michael's friend Jack Brennan Edward Arnold. Jack is an alcoholic and Michael comes to despise Sadie for marrying him even thinking she's trying to drive him into his grave so she and Tommy can collect his money. But his mind changes when he sees Sadie help Jack overcome his alcoholism. There's a lot more plot to go from here. Sadie will take more twists and turns before the movie is through.On the surface it looks like yet another of Joan's forgettable soapers from the '30s. Franchot Tone's in the cast as he usually was. But surprisingly it's actually better than those films. The thing that makes it better is that it has a different tone to it. It's treated as a serious dramatic film not a melodramatic soap opera. Even though it deals as most of Joan's films from this period with characters of moral complexity I didn't find myself hating everybody. I was pretty frustrated with Joan's character here mainly because she kept loving dirtbag Raymond despite the movie never showing us one good thing about him. But her performance was sincere enough I didn't find myself hating her even though I didn't like her always. Tone gives a great performance. One of the best of any of his films with Joan. Arnold is very good in an atypical role for him. Gene Raymond is bland as ever but inoffensive. He gets to sing the song All I Do Is Dream of You  repeatedly in the movie. I'm not a big fan of Raymond's but he sings the song well. Anyway it's a good movie let down some by a contrived ending and Sadie's fanatical devotion to the undeserving Tommy.".

	schema:headline " Joan Crawford goes from rags to riches in this engrossing but flawed melodrama that features some good popular songs.";
	schema:reviewBody "I liked this fine melodrama despite Joan Crawford and Gene Raymond not being among my favorite actors.  Crawford's mother Helen Ware is a servant in Franchot Tone's household and she is also a maid but has to leave after she berates Tone in front of all the dinner guests for bad mouthing Raymond who was caught stealing.  She leaves with Raymond for New York City where they hope to start a new life together intending to marry the next day. Love apparently has no boundaries. They find a cheap rooming house after befriending showgirl Jean Dixon and get a room where she lives. This film was released less than two months before the Production Code was strictly enforced after which you would never see an unmarried couple sharing the same room.  The scene fades to black after they kiss passionately. Of course while Crawford is looking for a job Raymond is enticed by singer Esther Ralston to join her act so he never meets her at the marriage license bureau as planned.  Eventually Crawford meets and marries multimillionaire Edward Arnold an alcoholic to end all alcoholics. In a 1948 interview Arnold said this was his favorite role to that date.  I can't fault his acting but his character was very irritating.  Even alcoholics have periods where they are not so pieeyed they can't walk without staggering.  Meanwhile Tone who is Arnold's lawyer thinks Crawford married Arnold for his money and knows she still carries the torch for Raymond and Tone despises her for it.  She admits she didn't love Arnold and it was a marriage of convenience.  But when she cures Arnold of his alcoholism Tone has a newfound respect for her.  So when Crawford learns Raymond was dumped by Ralston and she tells Arnold of her love for Raymond and asks him for a divorce presumably without a settlement she asks Tone to help her find Raymond which he does.  He's ill with tuberculosis so Tone pays to get the best doctors to try to cure him.The film is entertaining despite little of it ringing true. The way Crawford behaved at times I expected to see a halo over her head so Crawford fans should love the film.  It also helps to know that Crawford and Tone were married in reallife the year after this film was released. There is some pleasure from the music on the soundtrack including the very popular songs All I Do is Dream of You and After You've Gone the latter performed in a jazzy version by Candy Candido and Gene Austin.

	onyx:emotionText "I liked this fine melodrama despite Joan Crawford and Gene Raymond not being among my favorite actors.  Crawford's mother Helen Ware is a servant in Franchot Tone's household and she is also a maid but has to leave after she berates Tone in front of all the dinner guests for bad mouthing Raymond who was caught stealing.  She leaves with Raymond for New York City where they hope to start a new life together intending to marry the next day. Love apparently has no boundaries. They find a cheap rooming house after befriending showgirl Jean Dixon and get a room where she lives. This film was released less than two months before the Production Code was strictly enforced after which you would never see an unmarried couple sharing the same room.  The scene fades to black after they kiss passionately. Of course while Crawford is looking for a job Raymond is enticed by singer Esther Ralston to join her act so he never meets her at the marriage license bureau as planned.  Eventually Crawford meets and marries multimillionaire Edward Arnold an alcoholic to end all alcoholics. In a 1948 interview Arnold said this was his favorite role to that date.  I can't fault his acting but his character was very irritating.  Even alcoholics have periods where they are not so pieeyed they can't walk without staggering.  Meanwhile Tone who is Arnold's lawyer thinks Crawford married Arnold for his money and knows she still carries the torch for Raymond and Tone despises her for it.  She admits she didn't love Arnold and it was a marriage of convenience.  But when she cures Arnold of his alcoholism Tone has a newfound respect for her.  So when Crawford learns Raymond was dumped by Ralston and she tells Arnold of her love for Raymond and asks him for a divorce presumably without a settlement she asks Tone to help her find Raymond which he does.  He's ill with tuberculosis so Tone pays to get the best doctors to try to cure him.The film is entertaining despite little of it ringing true. The way Crawford behaved at times I expected to see a halo over her head so Crawford fans should love the film.  It also helps to know that Crawford and Tone were married in reallife the year after this film was released. There is some pleasure from the music on the soundtrack including the very popular songs All I Do is Dream of You and After You've Gone the latter performed in a jazzy version by Candy Candido and Gene Austin.  I would have liked more comedy relief since I didn't think Arnold's actions were particularly funny.  The one scene that made me laugh involved two motorcycle cops and a taxi driver and a tip that Crawford tries to give the cops for bringing the passedout Arnold home. Otherwise I never even cracked a smile.";

Once you get used to the stilted acting and production and grotty print condition it's an engrossing tale littered with beautiful images and earnest poetic ghazals and qawalis but! It's nowhere near as good or as important for that matter as Roy's 1955 take on the subject. And it didn't have the wonderful music of S. D. Burman and Lata either! I can't be totally sure of course but I'd guess that the ladies would prefer Dilip Kumar to Kundun Lal Saigal too. Favourite bits the scene when Devdas hit Paro just because even the beauty of the Moon is scarred was a little contrived but the whole meeting was beautiful to watch alcoholic Devdas coughing blood and the dramatic next minute expertly portrayed the startling last few minutes of the film will be hard to forget.

I'm not much of a Joan Crawford fan but she did a very good job in this story of patriotism during German occupation of France. The lead actor was very handsome and hard to figure out until later in the movie. Wayne was not the star of the movie and did a very good acting job as the RAF American volunteer downed pilot. While the story seems implausible most war films do. Of course there were a lot of heroic people in WW II on all sides and in the 'occupied' countries such as France. The fact that the Germans were not completely one dimensional gave some depth to the movie. As any German from that time will tell you not all the German people were in lock step with the regime but they had to stay alive. Many fought on several levels many of those we will never hear of. I do think the caricature of the Gestapo was perhaps a little cartoon like in the movie and John Carradine epitomizes that caricature. From what I have read over the years the Gestapo was a very dangerous organization and usually left nothing to chance. I love the twists and turns in the movie and will not spoil it for others. Suffice it to say I recommend this movie for its storyline and its acting. A great wartime film in my book.".

It does not compare in most ways with the drama the humor the writing the music the velocity and the legendary actors of the more famous movie. But it is a very good movie with an interesting early proAmerican proFrench message. Joan Crawford crackles as much as she can in a topsy turvy role going from spoiled and frivolous rich woman Michele de la Becque to briefly a refugee to finally an ordinary woman fighting with all her heart for France. There are two male actors with important roles and they couldn't be more different. One is Michele's lover and fianc played with a cultured perfection by Philip Dorn a Dutch actor who pulls off the panEuro mostly French aristocrat and businessman well. Opposite him in every way is the homey tough humble American who shows up halfway through the film John Wayne. I don't know if this really makes sense in the film but I can see it on paper since Wayne played a noncowboy merchant seaman in the terrific John Ford film which prefigures this one in some ways The Long Voyage Home. He doesn't seem as wily and smart as a fugitive from the Nazis would have to be behind the lines in occupied Paris but he at least plays the role of an ordinary American ready to help the French and this is the political message throughout.In fact the movie borders on a brilliant propaganda device putting message ahead of plot now and then just perceptibly. Crawford is so good even her speeches make a convincing case and I'm assuming American audiences cheered her on by December of 1942 when it was released on Christmas day. The scenes of the Germans taking over Paris are always horrifying and they are again here. There is even a deliberate homage to Soviet director Eisenstein when a baby carriage runs off after the mother is killed by gunfire.But back to Casablanca. It's an interesting problem to solve feeding the American audience worried about the war and about U.S. involvement. Because Hollywood was both a symptom of public opinion and a shaper of it and these are two rather different kinds of films with very similar messages. Director Jules Dassin who is not French but American had just started making films in 1941 and there is a sense of expertise at the expense of intuitive magic. Reunion in France is strong smart and convincing. But it doesn't sizzle or build the aura of the time like it could. And yet in its defense it has no perspective at all on the events since it was made while they were unfolding even before they were unfolding since it has to anticipate to some extent how the film will settle six months after being written and shot. Watch it. It's really good.".

	schema:reviewBody "Reunion in France finds Joan Crawford as an upper class French woman happily engaged to industrialist Philip Dorn and confident that the French army will defend the Maginot Line and the Germans will be defeated once they make a move west. Of course history and the film both tell us it didn't work out that way.When she arrives back in Paris because she's away in the country when the surrender happens she finds that the Germans have taken over her house to use as office space but they've permitted her to occupy one room on the ground level with its own entrance to the street. That's a minor inconvenience compared to when she learns that her fianc is collaborating with the Nazis. Around that time a young flier with the RAF Eagle Squadron John Wayne accosts her in the street and gets her to take him in. He's escaped from Nazi custody and looking to get back to Great Britain.This is a minor film in the credits of both John Wayne and Joan Crawford in there one and only film together. Crawford was being slowly eased out at MGM and she knew it. Still she was a professional if nothing else and gives the role her best. The part called for her to look chic and those Adrian gowns were in play again.John Wayne doesn't even get into the film until almost 40 minutes into the story. When he does get in even though he makes a play for Crawford the Duke has some real problems as Crawford in order to help him has to play up to Dorn and his Nazi friends. It's not the John Wayne we're used to because it really isn't his film.There's been some criticism by other reviewers that Crawford doesn't sound French. Then again neither does anyone else in the film. The rest of the cast. The cast in fact has a variety of European and American accents Frenchmen weren't in good supply at that point in Hollywood either that or they were otherwise committed. Surely Crawford was no more French sounding than Humphrey Bogart in Passage to Marseille.Albert Basserman is the commanding general in Paris and the fellow who Dorn cultivates. John Carradine may be the best one in the film as the Gestapo agent who knows there's something fishy with Crawford but can't quite prove it. Both the Duke and Joan Crawford had better days ahead of them. Still the film is a curiosity and worth a look.".

Of course history and the film both tell us it didn't work out that way.When she arrives back in Paris because she's away in the country when the surrender happens she finds that the Germans have taken over her house to use as office space but they've permitted her to occupy one room on the ground level with its own entrance to the street. That's a minor inconvenience compared to when she learns that her fianc is collaborating with the Nazis. Around that time a young flier with the RAF Eagle Squadron John Wayne accosts her in the street and gets her to take him in. He's escaped from Nazi custody and looking to get back to Great Britain.This is a minor film in the credits of both John Wayne and Joan Crawford in there one and only film together. Crawford was being slowly eased out at MGM and she knew it. Still she was a professional if nothing else and gives the role her best. The part called for her to look chic and those Adrian gowns were in play again.John Wayne doesn't even get into the film until almost 40 minutes into the story. When he does get in even though he makes a play for Crawford the Duke has some real problems as Crawford in order to help him has to play up to Dorn and his Nazi friends. It's not the John Wayne we're used to because it really isn't his film.There's been some criticism by other reviewers that Crawford doesn't sound French. Then again neither does anyone else in the film. The rest of the cast. The cast in fact has a variety of European and American accents Frenchmen weren't in good supply at that point in Hollywood either that or they were otherwise committed. Surely Crawford was no more French sounding than Humphrey Bogart in Passage to Marseille.Albert Basserman is the commanding general in Paris and the fellow who Dorn cultivates. John Carradine may be the best one in the film as the Gestapo agent who knows there's something fishy with Crawford but can't quite prove it. Both the Duke and Joan Crawford had better days ahead of them. Still the film is a curiosity and worth a look.";

The heroine played by Joan Crawford is convincing in her portrayal of a spoiled pompous rich woman who becomes a patriot when her France is occupied by Nazi Germany. She is allowed to live in a one room ground floor apartment of her mansion taken over by the Nazi military. She is the fianc of a supposed Nazi sympathizer who used to be a French patriot. She takes in an American flier John Wayne and houses him in her one room apartment. She joins the underground efforts to get the American flier back to his base in England. This movie is typical of cinemas of that era and is as believable as most and better than some others. The heroine reminds me of the Ingrid Bergman character in Casablanca. She also has to make hard choices. Will she stay and fight for her France? Will she go to England with the flier she has saved from capture? Will she be loyal to the man she loves even though he appears to have radically changed from patriot to Nazi collaborator? The choices she makes are inspiring and patriotic. You of course want her to stay and fight or do you want her to leave with her new found love the American flier? The end is very satisfying. After the movie is over you will want to join with others in saying. Viva la France!".

	schema:reviewBody "World War II story about a spoiled Frenchwoman Joan Crawford whose patriotism is stirred by Nazi invasion. She's married to industrialist Philip Dorn who she comes to believe is a Nazi collaborator. She meets downed American pilot John Wayne and helps him. Sparks inevitably fly. Joan gives it her best but she's a little miscast. For starters there are repeated references to her beauty throughout the film but those days were way past Joan by 1942. She was 37 and looks older. Wayne is miscast as well and has no chemistry with Joan. The Nazis are wellrepresented here with some fine actors playing heavies Ernst Deutsch Howard Da Silva and John Carradine. J. Edward Bromberg has a small but amusing role as French policeman.This is not a bad movie. Just that it could have been so much better with different leads. Mainly of note today as the only film Joan and Duke made together. It's definitely a Joan movie more than a John Wayne one.

	onyx:emotionText "World War II story about a spoiled Frenchwoman Joan Crawford whose patriotism is stirred by Nazi invasion. She's married to industrialist Philip Dorn who she comes to believe is a Nazi collaborator. She meets downed American pilot John Wayne and helps him. Sparks inevitably fly. Joan gives it her best but she's a little miscast. For starters there are repeated references to her beauty throughout the film but those days were way past Joan by 1942. She was 37 and looks older. Wayne is miscast as well and has no chemistry with Joan. The Nazis are wellrepresented here with some fine actors playing heavies Ernst Deutsch Howard Da Silva and John Carradine. J. Edward Bromberg has a small but amusing role as French policeman.This is not a bad movie. Just that it could have been so much better with different leads. Mainly of note today as the only film Joan and Duke made together. It's definitely a Joan movie more than a John Wayne one. Though the movie has the expected polish of an MGM film of the time it's not one of director Jules Dassin's best. Ava Gardner has an uncredited tiny part as a shopgirl. Fans of John Wayne and Joan Crawford will definitely want to check it out.";

	schema:reviewBody "Though he's second billed in the credits John Wayne doesn't make his appearance in the picture until about the forty two minute mark. I kept wondering how his character Pat Talbot managed to evade arrest and detainment in the story seeing as how he just showed up with no credentials to show for it in case the Nazis started asking questions. Maybe that's the problem Talbot was never really put on the spot as he squired Michele de la Becque Joan Crawford after she learned that her fianc was a Nazi collaborator.Or was he? Seems Philip Dorn's character Robert Tortot was assuming a dual role sort of a double agent as it were without getting into the espionage racket. Even though this picture preceded Casablanca by a scant month or so the parallels are obvious enough to make it look like this lesser known film might have been pulling off a cheap imitation. You had the French Resistance angle personified by Crawford's character complete with 'exit papers' signed by the military governor of Paris much like Ingrid Bergman's 'letters of transit'. Wayne is no Bogey of course nor is Philip Dorn though John Carradine takes a pretty good stab at Conrad Veidt's Major Strasser. And if you want to make a stretch of it J. Edward Bromberg resembles a poor man's Claude Rains as a French policeman.I didn't have too much problem with all of this except for Crawford's seesawing relationship between her two leading men. At one point she excoriates Tortot with that quote above in my summary line but still sidles up to him when it's to her advantage. For his part Wayne managed to call her 'Mike' more than a couple times with no one raising an objection. I don't know how the French or Germans would have understood the translation.With Talbot whisked away aboard a rescue plane the film closes on a firm patriotic note though I highly doubt that the pilot would have had the time or resources to sky write the word 'COURAGE' in the air above Paris. It ends the picture on a high note but it seems to me a more likely outcome would have had a German plane knock it out of the sky.".

	schema:reviewBody "Reunion in France 1942 out of 4Bland and rather boring film from MGM has Joan Crawford playing Parisian Michele de la Becque who doesn't realize that the man Philip Dorn she loves has connection to the Nazi party. When an American pilot John Wayne asks for her to hide him she does so even though it puts her own life in danger. REUNION IN France was just one of dozens of films that were made during WWII by Hollywood to try and support the war and of course send off various messages. Many of these messages would be considered propaganda today but it's important to remember what was going on in the country when this was released. With that said no matter what was going on at the time that doesn't make up for the fact that this is a pretty bland and forgettable film. The biggest problem is actually the thing you'd expect to be the best and that's the cast. There are so many problems with the lead including the fact that Crawford is playing a woman from France yet she keeps her American accent. From interviews later in her life it's clear that she was embarrassed by this performance and it's easy to see why. Then we've got Wayne who is so out of touch with his character you can't help but wonder how his career managed to go on and he became a legend. Yes he's pretty bad here but what's worst are the two of them together. The chemistry between the stars is absolutely zero and their entire romance isn't a bit believable. The supporting cast does somewhat better with Reginald Owen Albert Bassermann Henry Daniell and John Carradine all doing fine work. Look fast for a young Ava Gardner. REUNION IN France is a curiosity at best due to the fact that you've got two legends together in one film but the thing just doesn't work.".

When I tried to rationalize why Val Kilmer would stoop to the level of this ostensibly lost ATeam episode script directed by appointed directors like Marcus all I could come up with would be his contempt for the real world equivalent to the radical rightwing Minutemenlike goons littering this pseudoentertaining steaming pile of straighttovid. As it turns out I was at least partially right Kilmer did this movie for personalpolitical reasons according to the related trivia.I would write a summary except I'm loath to spending more than the 90 minutes I already wasted watching it. You've seen it before except this time it isn't Steven Seagal fighting for the rights of Native Americans or Billy Jack fighting for the hippie commune it's Val Kilmer fighting against a shoestring budget and implied Halliburton employees as laughably stereotypical rednecks for the sake of immigrant rights and liberal ideology.

But having said that let me say this ... it's no classic and Val Kilmer needn't dust off his dinner jacket for award ceremonies.I'm prepared to add a little balance to the scathing comments that precede me and to say this is not as bad as many people are saying.Kilmer's performance is precisely what he would have been aiming for and that was a reasonable choice. The supporting actors were sufficient unless you're looking for an academy nominee and you won't get any guarantees of that anyway. The plot is predictable but this is Hollywood after all and most moviegoers aren't looking for 90 minutes of cerebral exercise.Almost all of the comments have cited the obvious shortcomings. It appears to be a relatively lowbudget production and if that is the case it's a pretty reasonable effort in my opinion. I can overlook the shallow performances of many of the supporting cast and the disorganized and disoriented extras.Some comments are quite unfair in my opinion and only show that key plot points have been missed. This is quite a few years after Iraq 1. I suspect that some of the viewers think it's Iraq 2. Kilmer's weight and age for example are not a simple error of judgment by the Director and casting agent rather it's a simple error in the viewing of the movie.I'm surprised that few people have noticed the very obvious Halliburton message. This is my major gripe. I have no interest in defending the indefensible but the message delivery is quite infantile. It reached it's zenith with the overlylong speech by the main female character. She outlines how Halliburton ... sorry Hallicorp or Halco or whatever it's called ... profits from supplying the weaponry to blow up foreign countries then wins the contracts to build them again ultimately never spending their illgotten gain in America which is a curious extension of a moral point ... and on and on it went. It was one of the most tedious and embarrassing 'worthy' speeches I've heard in a movie and I support the basic concerns in the message. It was a parody of itself and I watched it three times to see if there was a glimmer of embarrassment in the actor's eyes. How do they do it? Method I guess.Aspects of the plot are quite a stretch. I can't see Dastardly Dick Cheney retiring to a dusty little town in the middle of nowhere to build an oldwest replica as a base from which to live out his powercrazed fantasies. He already has a much better and more comfortable location for that.".

The setting is just as unconvincing Supposedly this is a new town being built in the middle of nowhere using cheap Mexican labor. Yet many of the buildings are wild west era in style. Its obviously a generic western movie set possibly located on Kilmer's own ranch. A 19th century Dance Hall is reached by a dirt street with a speed limit sign stuck in the earth yet its flat as an airport runway. And its not a revitalized ghost town either. Everything is new as though they just finished shooting an episode of Bonanza. Only the horse trough is missing. The small cast is comprised of stock characters a young snotty cop who seems to be the entire police department a beautiful girl running a dollar store with a precious little daughter naturally terrified of telling the truth. She runs a lending library...with books! No vcrs no dvds in this town although they have cable TV. Who thinks this stuff up? You are expected to suspend disbelief for dramas but when one anachronism is piled upon another goof on top of a plot hole its difficult to take the story seriously. And the predictable story grinds on and on like a celluloid glacier. Go to the loo or make coffee you wont miss anything. I hope this isn't an indication of the direction Kilmers career is taking as he is capable of much better. If you like daffy plots watch a Steven Segal movie at least they are entertaining.".

We actually rented the film because we thought it would be good stupid fun like a Segal film with lots of Saturday night 'whizzbangpoppery' but there is a lot more to it than that  I was starting to say that it reminded me a fair bit of a classic Clint Eastwood spaghetti Western when lo and behold!  turns out the name of the town is Lago  the same name as in High Plains Drifter!! Someone with enough intelligence and respect writer or Director? to sneakily name check a reference has got much more going on than the people who have dismissed the film cos they don't like the politics.So my advice is definitely worth renting  if you are a fan of thoughtful action films and like those classic Clint westerns cos this is a modern cousin of them.

We actually rented the film because we thought it would be good stupid fun like a Segal film with lots of Saturday night 'whizzbangpoppery' but there is a lot more to it than that  I was starting to say that it reminded me a fair bit of a classic Clint Eastwood spaghetti Western when lo and behold!  turns out the name of the town is Lago  the same name as in High Plains Drifter!! Someone with enough intelligence and respect writer or Director? to sneakily name check a reference has got much more going on than the people who have dismissed the film cos they don't like the politics.So my advice is definitely worth renting  if you are a fan of thoughtful action films and like those classic Clint westerns cos this is a modern cousin of them.

	schema:reviewBody "This film is a pale imitation of the Spencer Tracy classic. It lacks the injustice irony and clarity of the original. The film also lacks the menace and stifling tension of the Spencer Tracy version. Tracy was tougher though more vulnerable than Kilmer. The original contained startling precise violence against realistic bad guys. Tracy remains fearful but steadfast. Kilmer is fearless but on his journey fights against cartoon characters and takes too many beatings.Having said all that the film is quite entertaining. Val Kilmer portrays a tough marine well and the film builds up nicely to the final crisis. The end itself is a bit soppy. The original Bad Day at Black Rock is probably one of the finest films ever made. It made important political and civil rights points about freedom and justice. This remake is not in the same league and is unnecessary. watch.".

If you were to remove everything that was lifted directly from Bad Day at Black Rock as well as the stuff borrowed from First Blood you would have a movie that only runs about 13 minutes. To make matters worse this film is subpar mediocrity at best.

	schema:reviewBody "Low expectations are seldom met for films that go straight to video. This is an exception for me.Kilmer McPhearson plays a troubled marine who is sought out by a war buddy and travels to Arizona to reunite. When McPhearson arrives he realizes that the town and its people are acting very strange. He meets Rhodes Cole who basically runs the town and gets less than welcomed. The suspense thickens as the movie goes adding a clever character twist at the end.Kilmer does a good job with the role but maybe I'm bias because I've liked his movies for a while. His delivery is solid from interaction with Esposito to rugged oneliners with the bad guys. I even didn't mind him looking a little bloated because he was playing the washed up war vet.The only trouble I had was the way he tried to sell the excessively used close up blank stare meant to show McPhearson suffering from his past. It simply came off bored.The pacing is spot on. You dive right in with a shocking opening scene and build up accordingly into the meat of the story. It is pleasantly predictable at the right times yet your left guessing when you want to be.The ending is where this one will lose some. It starts to do what that string of films that destroyed Steven Segal's career did. Movies often step out of themselves at the end and beat you over the head with a message.

	onyx:emotionText "Low expectations are seldom met for films that go straight to video. This is an exception for me.Kilmer McPhearson plays a troubled marine who is sought out by a war buddy and travels to Arizona to reunite. When McPhearson arrives he realizes that the town and its people are acting very strange. He meets Rhodes Cole who basically runs the town and gets less than welcomed. The suspense thickens as the movie goes adding a clever character twist at the end.Kilmer does a good job with the role but maybe I'm bias because I've liked his movies for a while. His delivery is solid from interaction with Esposito to rugged oneliners with the bad guys. I even didn't mind him looking a little bloated because he was playing the washed up war vet.The only trouble I had was the way he tried to sell the excessively used close up blank stare meant to show McPhearson suffering from his past. It simply came off bored.The pacing is spot on. You dive right in with a shocking opening scene and build up accordingly into the meat of the story. It is pleasantly predictable at the right times yet your left guessing when you want to be.The ending is where this one will lose some. It starts to do what that string of films that destroyed Steven Segal's career did. Movies often step out of themselves at the end and beat you over the head with a message. This one gets a little self righteous but not to where I thought it brought things down.It's not Rambo or Die Hard but if you're in the mood for a rental with solid action and suspense its worth the four or five bucks.";

I thought the betrayal of the police officer was stupid and I could see it coming a mile away. The villains were over the top and were not slightly sympathetic. Plotwise this was a pure propaganda piece for the Hollywood Left and the leftists out there. If you don't support illegals in America and hate American business you are a bigoted murderer. Such a simple plot should be seen through by everyone but I noticed a number of reviewers were taken in by the propaganda. It is not the fact that this movie would have been produced by Goebbels himself that makes it bad it is the fact that Goebbels would be embarrassed to put his name to it as an example of ametueristic propaganda. Following these black marks any objective person would reject the message of the movie itself. It clearly was made to change people over to the addled liberal viewpoint and in keeping with their only method of conversion doesn't use facts or dicta to do so. Their opponents are shown to be wholly reprehensible people and the poor man's Eva Menedes Jennifer Esposito explains that America is horrible and its greatest soldier must bring it down. Utter rubbish and a purely emotional plea. The ONLY redeemed quality occurs in the first five minutes of the movie. Alesia Riabenkova's breasts are quite stunning and she is a very beautiful woman. Her body is the only reason this movie deserves a positive star rating and the fact that IMDb doesn't let you put them up there.".

Gary Cole and lackeys have a great time playing their own grownup version of cowboys and indians with deathly consequences. Cole's turn as an avaricious warmonger with designs for a pure America is effectively disturbing while being simultaneously hilarious he's building his own Wild West Town where he gets to call all the shots literally. And Bob Rumnock is wildly funny as the cowardly Sheriff Bock.What's a shame is that you can see real moments of inspiration interspersed between some very unfortunate cuts. The hat exchange in the diner was hilarious but the threeminute bus trip at the top was useless. The scene at the hotel desk with the copier was really welltimed and very funny. But then there's twenty seconds of Val staring down the road at a departing truck. Why? Maybe the editor needed to make time the producer had a vendetta against a dayplayer or the studio wanted more blood and less talking. Maybe all three. A friend slipped me some footage of the director's cut and lemme say Sony released the wrong version. Kilmer even managed to look good in a few of those scenes. Same footage same Kilmer better pace better storytelling.As released though Conspiracy is still a sweet little fable classic in plot with modern relevance combining action  daringdo with subtle humor and a few genuine surprises.

Curtis wins her by foul means though when Scott is shot down on a mission. He's all right but he's shipped to hospital in Manila. Curtis intercepts the telegram saying so and tells Lisi he died. So she marries him possibly on the rebound.14 years go by and Curtis is now a LieutenantColonel stationed in Europe and Scott gets stationed there. Of course he has to fake surprise that his old buddy is alive and actually has a higher rank. When Scott learns of the deception the old games resume with a vengeance. In his memoirs Curtis says that Scott was an actor of great intensity who really could over power other players. He had to really be on his toes to make sure he didn't steal the whole film. I suspect there was a little bit of professional jealousy in his words. Now that Curtis Scott and Lisi are all gone they can argue it out in the next world.Fans of the three stars should like it.

It was not something that was intended initially but actually it has proven to be a generally worthwhile experience even with a couple of missteps. While there were and are better actors about and he didn't always look comfortable in his early films Curtis was always immensely likeable and had a charming charisma with many good and more performances under his belt. The cover was also appetising George C Scott was one fine actor and the story while unoriginal seemed really interesting. So there were all the ingredients here for it to work and really wanted to like it.Unfortunately 'Not With My Wife You Don't!' didn't do anything for me. A few good things but what had the potential to fly high doesn't properly leave the ground. As said Curtis had missteps in his career 'Not With My Wife You Don't!' is one of them. 'Not With My Wife You Don't!' as aforementioned has good points. It's a greatlooking film and beautifully filmed in quite ravishing but never too glossy Technicolor. There are a few good scenes with a colourful opening sequence the temporarily gone blind one and especially the Italian film spoof do agree that it is the highlight of the film.Virna Lisi sensuous and charming gives the best performance. The music score is pleasant enough if not exactly memorable. However was disappointed in the big names. Curtis is in a role that on paper was in his comfort zone and one he should have been perfect for his performance here felt stale with a surprising lack of zest in his comic timing and the charm being missing and like he was struggling to properly keep up. Was more let down by Scott here cast in an atypical role and badly out of his depth with him trying far too hard and being too intense. Have absolutely nothing against actors being cast against type there have been some great examples but Scott's very vast experience in intense heavyweight roles feels illsuited for a lightweight film. The chemistry between the actors lacks sparkle.The lack of sparkle is also present in the script. apart from the odd amusing line there is a lack of zest and wit and what might have been racy at the time comes over as tame and bland. It may not be as fluffy and smutty as one would fear but it's nowhere near saucy enough and gets silly and limp. The direction is hardly inept but it's not particularly distinguished or inspired almost too safe. The story can be sluggish and contentwise it's far too slight it needed a much lighter touch in a film that should be lightweight fluff but played and taken too seriously and it's pretty contrived.In conclusion lacklustre and a disappointment while with its moments. 410 Bethany Cox".

Noise is everything here wind and water cars and carriages pigs cats and moles human activities like preparing food in the kitchen or the beat of sewing machines in a workshop are all equally important in the well composed symphony of noises. As a consequence human actors do not speak more precisely they occasionally do but we cannot hear what they say and their speech is just part of the noise. As the wonderfully photographed scenes advance in a slow pace a dark and sad human ballad unfolds. The seemingly idyllic pictures hide a sick and hopeless local society where men are mostly useless and unemployed where wives poison their husband and accidentally others and where all this is accepted as a fact of life. The story ends with the desperate expression of the local policeman who  although he is aware of all this  cannot decide what to do as practically all women including his mother is involved in the murders.This is indeed a very strong movie especially if you consider that it is the debut of a young director. The style the visual and musical language is innovative and captures the viewer. I am not sure that the extreme story the series of the murders is really in place perhaps a simpler more downtoearth story would have been a better choice although I accept that the contrast of the dark and shocking story and the idyllic pictures adds extra and needed spice to the film.In summary this is in the must category.

I watched this with my girlfriend the redhaired queen of late night cinema and we had a terrific argument over our differing opinions on what exactly had transpired in the movie. During the argument she seized a burning stick from the fireplace and commenced beating me with it to emphasize her point thereby proving the supremacy of a piece of wood over wellconstructed film criticism.This film should be seen by anyone who enjoys experimental film in any way or simply wants to see something different but not boring. It is not overrepetitive nor is it slow moving in any way. I applaud the director who can not only conceive of such a movie but execute it in an interesting and watchable way.".

This film features many such shots...and in its speechless stroke of genius the story itself is presented that way as well.Let me state that this movie is clearly not for everyone at first it reminded me of the beloved Ann Arbor Film Festival which hosts many fine but often fiercely independent short films. But Hukkle while succeeding in its artful attack moves beyond that.But it does so slowly...The film moves almost at the pace of the tiny Hungarian village where it was mostly shot. Indeed from the DVD extras I get the sense that Gyorgy Palfi wanted to have the film linger even longer in spots. The human actors are all nonprofessional while I believe the pig cat snake mole and frog were all professional. The frog also was apparently delicious at least according to the famished catfish.I really want to resist saying more I'm just trying to figure out a way to direct the people who would enjoy this film toward it. I suspect that if you ever entertained notions of attending film school you would enjoy this. Rambunctious creativity is on display as it was in Daisies which I recently watched and reviewed. Similarly just seeing a village might appeal to some folks like myself living in the United Sprawl of America.In that village we see some folks living with plastic sheets as part of their homes. I don't think this could have been made anywhere ...nor by anyone else. Palfi's approach on screen is gentle but I don't know proudly peculiar?? Or maybe peculiarly proud? He likely was a city mouse out in the country but he was welcomed in to their wine caves their apiaries and those plastic thatched houses but more importantly the lives of the sturdier folks occupying them.With the DVD you get a couple of bonus tracks the subtitled commentary by Palfi and his cinematographer was very insightful on several levels. It almost seemed at times like the film was not only a riddle from Palfi to us the audience but a puzzling challenge to Gergely Poharnok and the rest of the crew!Additionally Palfi's voice it's genuinely genial tone but never mawkishly so while I don't speak Hungarian I was curious to see him interact with the villages...and that is also in the Extras!I eagerly look forward to more of his work the Taxidermist is not readily available yet...but hopefully soon. Oh and here is a plug for having Palfi film an adaptation of The Thought Gang  a fine book by Tibor Fischer!This film has grown from a 6 to a 7.510 for me...still rising!!Thurston HungerTwo more comments...1 Would love to track down the music and field recordings to this.2 Funniest scene in the film...the very unHollywood police chase!!".

	schema:reviewBody "A day in the life of a Hungarian town told by incredible cinematography and acute sound. At the age of 28 in 2002 Gyrgy Plfi has put together one of the most unique movie experiences out there. This dark yet funny film at first glance seems to be just a series of random events linked together by smooth camera transitions. But there is an underlying story here a caper if you will. Hukkle is an onomatopoeia that is supposed to imitate the sound of a hiccup. The opening scene of the film features an old man who cannot stop hiccuping I believe the director was relating the pace of the film to a hiccup hence the name.During the opening credits the first name featured was that of the sound engineer Tams Znyi. A fitting honor since there is no dialog in this film the story is told entirely through sound. Everything from a growing leaf of grass to a F16 Fighter jet is represented in precise detail. It truly is amazing to watch and listen to a movie like this. It grabs a hold of you and even though the events are seemingly random you just can't wait to see what will happen next. It's like watching a Hungarian reality show.Once you realize that there is a story underneath all of this it makes it even better. I won't ruin it by explaining the plot just know by the end you should understand it. If not there is a nice song at the end with the only subtitles in the film to help explain everything. Although one would benefit from a second viewing to pick it all out.Visually this film is wonderful. Cinematographer Gergely Pohrnok was brilliant. Moving smoothly from one scene to the next going through doors windows and even bodies. He used CGI or computer generated imaging for some of the scenes which seemed out of place for me. I think it was to showcase more of the sound as in the growing leaf but I thought it was unnecessary. There were only a few quick cuts thankfully although one in particular might make you a little uncomfortable or comfortable if your into that sort of thing.This film is not for everyone. Some may feel bored with this as the plot is barely there. But if you view this on its technical merits you will be highly impressed.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of the several movies that Joan Crawford made with Clark Gable and fortunately quite a few of them maybe all have made it to at least DVDR via the Warner Archive. This is one of the best the two did together. It's a romantic comedy in which Joan plays socialite Mary Clay who is about to marry lifelong acquaintance Dillon Todd Robert Montgomery. Clark Gable plays another of Mary's lifelong friends Jeff Williams. Jeff has been long away from home and decides to come back just to ask Mary to marry him unaware that Mary is about to marry Dillon. When he learns about their upcoming marriage he decides to keep his feelings to himself although the look he has as if having been punched in the stomach when he hears the news says it all. Robert Montgomery is playing the usual harmless playboy character here that he did so much of in the early 1930's. It looks like Mary and Dillon's marriage is about to go off without a hitch until one of Dillon's old girlfriends appears on the scene.This film was released about six months after the precode era ended so there is nothing really racey going on here. About the most extreme thing you will see is Robert Montgomery in a dress. However W.S. Van Dyke is the director of this film and he knew how to combine sexual tension and comedy in an age of aggressive censorship and this is a fine example of his work. I highly recommend it to fans of films of the 1930's.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have to imagine that in order for MGM to justify using two of their top leading men with Joan Crawford their parts in Forsaking All Others would have to have been built up considerably. The original Broadway production of this comedy that ran 110 performances in 1933 starred Tallulah Bankhead and it was strictly her show. As if it would have been any other way.I have to give Joan Crawford credit on this one. Unlike her later film Susan and God where she tries to imitate Gertrude Lawrence with accent and all she wisely does not try to do a Tallulah impersonation. She creates her own character here and it's a good one. She's got both Robert Montgomery and Clark Gable after her but she chooses early on and in the end she finds out she chooses wrong. In fact the only impersonation Crawford does is one of her Grand Hotel costar Greta Garbo.Both Clark Gable and Robert Montgomery settle into familiar stereotypes for them. Gable is another reporter character like he is It Happened One Night and Montgomery is an irresponsible playboy like he was in a gazillion films. Montgomery and Crawford are set to be married but Montgomery leaves her at the altar and runs off with his demanding mistress Frances Drake. But Crawford has Gable's shoulder to cry on for most of the rest of the film. By the way Drake gives a performance that's a case study in canine feminus. She makes Joan Collins in Dynasty look like Maria Von Trapp. Drake dominates in whatever scene she's in. No way that Tallulah Bankhead would have let that happen on stage.Charles Butterworth and Billie Burke are also on hand and young Rosalind Russell on her way up has a small part as one of Crawford's friends. Nothing new in Forsaking All Others but the ground is familiar enough.".

The type of film that helped make living in the depression fun acting like the depression didn't exist that millionaires never lost their fortune that everybody dressed in silks ermine white tie  tails. Everybody was gay when gay meant giddy....It's no wonder that Joan Crawford was the biggest female star of the mid 1930's not a female impersonator who actually happened to be a woman Mae West or a snappy little girl with curls Shirley Temple. She was glamorous full of life and someone who rose from poverty to be a beautiful movie star. And here she is a bride left at the alter by her childhood pal Robert Montgomery who nevertheless continues to see her socially on the side unaware that their other best pal Clark Gable is madly in love with her himself. Montgomery is instantly unhappy in his new marriage to venomous Frances Drake and longs to rekindle his romance with Crawford.People forget that Joan was adept in both comedies and musicals not just the women's picture so this film based upon a Broadway play that starred Tallulah Bankhead is overlooked in the history of great screwball comedies. Toss in flighty Billie Burke droll Charles Butterworth and wisecracking Rosalind Russell in one of her first films and you end up with a practically perfect crowdpleaser that shows us how Mommie Dearest was as once as hot as today's A list stars and got to the top in a style that can't be copied today.The fun opening credits instantly got my attention with music that made me think that the three stars were going rollerskating. My favorite scene was the one in which Crawford and Montgomery stop by a roadside hamburger stand and Montgomery takes over while the cook is out back. It is a witty moment of rhythmic dialog that is sadly a thing of the past. This scene flows nicely to another great scene with Montgomery riding a bicycle with a nervous Crawford on the handlebars that ends up with a nice pratfall. Here's mud in your eye!".

In addition the plot really needed a rewrite and Gable's character just seems really needy and weak. Here's the plotyou decide if Gable is poorly used Joan Crawford is left waiting at the alter by Robert Montgomery who runs off with another woman. She spends most of the movie STILL trying to get Montgomery why she would still want this schmuck I have absolutely no idea. Gable is friends to both but secretly loves Crawford. However he doesn't tell her because he really wants her to be happyeven if it means chasing after married Montgomery! Get a spine man and tell her you think she's one hot tamale you wimpy dolt!! Well being a predictable film this eventually happens. However if he'd just said that he loved her in the first 10 minutes we could have been spared! I hate movies that avoid such an obvious and simple resolution.Fortunately despite this HUGE plot problem the ride is enjoyable so if you just turn off your brain and watch you will enjoy the film.

Their friend Jeff a miscast Clark Gable loves Mary but won't say so because she loves Dill even after the humiliation and despite him being married to another woman. Why either Mary or Jeff would even want to be around this guy is beyond me but I guess they had to fill time with something.Crawford looks great but her character has little selfrespect. I hated seeing her pursue Bob Montgomery's character despite his dumping her to marry another woman. I know times change and all but it taints the enjoyment of the movie for me when most of it is based around Joan wanting that creep back. Montgomery is fine I guess but the character of Dill is a royal class jerk. Gable as I said before is miscast. It's just very hard to buy him as the wimpy sort of guy he comes across as here.

	onyx:emotionText "Mary Joan Crawford loves Dill Robert Montgomery but he leaves her waiting at the altar and elopes with another woman. Their friend Jeff a miscast Clark Gable loves Mary but won't say so because she loves Dill even after the humiliation and despite him being married to another woman. Why either Mary or Jeff would even want to be around this guy is beyond me but I guess they had to fill time with something.Crawford looks great but her character has little selfrespect. I hated seeing her pursue Bob Montgomery's character despite his dumping her to marry another woman. I know times change and all but it taints the enjoyment of the movie for me when most of it is based around Joan wanting that creep back. Montgomery is fine I guess but the character of Dill is a royal class jerk. Gable as I said before is miscast. It's just very hard to buy him as the wimpy sort of guy he comes across as here. Rosalind Russell is wasted in a minor role. Charles Butterworth the vocal inspiration for Cap'N Crunch is OK as Gable's sidekick. Billie Burke is annoying. It's a weak effort overall but at least it ends right. Sort of.";

Australian release 15 May 1935. 84 minutes.SYNOPSIS Jeff Williams Clark Gable returns from abroad just in time to act as Best Man at the wedding of his friends Mary Clay Joan Crawford and Dill Todd Robert Montgomery. To everyone's surprise Dill leaves Mary at the altar. He marries his mistress Connie Frances Drake instead. As it happens Jeff has always loved Mary himself. Mary however has never taken Jeff seriously. Her heart has always been set on Dill. Even his marriage to Connie does not deter her. Dill asks Connie for a divorce and makes a fresh proposal to Mary. She accepts him. This development leaves Jeff out in the cold. He tries to convince Mary she is making a mistake. NOTES The stage play opened on Broadway at the Times Square on 1st March 1933 and ran 101 performances. This was insufficient to put the play into the black. Its star and principal backer Tallulah Bankhead ended up with a 40000 loss. The play was directed by Thomas Mitchell yes our Thomas Mitchell.

The film went before the cameras on 25th September 1934 winding up on 22md October 1934. COMMENT The play didn't exactly pull in the crowds on Broadway so it seems to have been a good idea to assign the screenplay to witty Joe Mankiewicz. Unfortunately Mankiewicz is not equal to the task. True he begins promisingly enough with our returning hero Gable loading Butterworth down with balloons and peanuts but Mankiewicz's notion of humor degenerates later on into a lot of irritating gibberish from Butterworth and a frilly nightgown for Montgomery. Director Van Dyke does his level best to keep the movie moving but eventually Mankiewicz's tired and tiresome script defeats him. Forsaking All Others actually ends up as little more than an Adrian fashion show led by exquisitely photographed Joan Crawford. Fortunately Joan can do no wrong in my book even in an inferior vehicle like Forsaking All Others.OTHER VIEWS Here's an oldfashioned newfashioned play. Or is it the other way around? About fifty years ago you could say with justification they don't make movies like this any more. But not today! Steamy risqu Forsaking All Others is firmly back in fashion a favorite on local TV. I'll take bets however that noone is game to revive the original stage play by Frank Morgan Cavett and Edward Barry Roberts. For a starter we have noone in the Tallulah Bankhead class to play the main role. Or do we?".

	schema:reviewBody "Forsaking All Others 1934  12 out of 4 MGM fluff has Jeff Clark Gable returning from Spain with plans of proposing to Mary Joan Crawford but once home he learns that she's about to marry Dillon Robert Montgomery. Jeff decides to take it like a man and step to the side but when Dillon runs off and marries another woman he must try and figure out the best way to get to Mary. Only thing is that she's not too bright and goes running back to the married Dillon. There's quite a bit of plot in this 84minutes but none of it is overly original. This isn't a bad movie but considering the cast and director one can't help but be a little disappointed that it's not better. I don't think it's any secret that the main reason to watch this is because of the terrific cast. Gable is in topform here as he's very believable in the role and you can't help but feel for the guy and enjoy the class that the actor brings. The more I see from Gable preIT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT films the more impressed I am. Crawford doesn't get any added benefits from the screenplay which pretty much just writes her as a dumbchick who makes one dumb move after another but the actress does what she can. She's certainly charming enough in the role. Montgomery isn't too bad as the romantic slime but for some reason the screenplay seems to forget this is a drama when he's on screen. There are countless scenes with him falling tripping or hurting himself in other ways that gives one the impression that this was some sort of slapstick film at some point. Charles Butterworth steals the film in each of his scenes and we also get Billie Burke as a real bad girl. The opening credits here are extremely bizarre as the film opens with the three stars marching arm to arm down a row towards the camera with the biggest smiles on their face as if this was some sort of musical. I'm not sure what the point of this was but I doubt the studio had much of an idea on what they were wanting to do outside making a lot of cash with the three leads. If you're a fan of the stars then this is a must see but at the same time it's a shame more wasn't done to try and make it better.".

TIm curry was underutilized but with the exception of his last scene his acting was GREAT. i was very surprised by this film. it is not a typical tales of the crypt film but don't hold that against it. i thought the locale was great. the cinematography was top notch. not everyone gave a stellar performance but overall most of the actors were believable in their roles. no one seemed to be sleepwalking through their act. i recommend this for fans of horror and thrillers.".

I was surprised that it didn't feature the all out action of Demon Knight or trashy fun of Bordello of Blood. Instead it was a smartly written and even somewhat classy by Tales standards as it never goes for the over the top gore or even sex for that matter. It does have the TFTC feel and any fan most likely won't disappoint. It is truly a fitting end if the series has to go. I just wish the TFTC feel was more prevalent in the CryptKeeper scenes. If you are a fan buy this and we can hope to see more from the Cyypt in the future.".

Demon Knight was one of the best horror films on the 90's and Bordello of Blood was a laugh riot. Ritual is neither of these things. It's basically a retelling of I Walked With a Zombie. It has no surprises and it's rather straightforward in it's direction. I'm also not big on voodoo movies. There's just something about them and they all tell pretty much the same story. So not much stands out and the film is a bit boring. The pace could have been tightened up a bit. It's a shame too because the acting is quite good. Jennifer Gray leads the cast and is up to the task. The new nose must be working out for her because she looks to be in the best shape of her life. Daniel Lapaine and Kristen Wilson both of whom I'm not familiar with also are admirable. And Tim Curry and Craig I need to fire my agent Sheffer show up to lend their credentials. Seriously Sheffer is a way better actor than his filmography would have you believe. Another plus is the effects. What little gore there is is done expertly.

No sight of Him.I can only wonder why the hell these guys Gilbert Zemekis Silver Donner etc etc would have the audacity to release this movie without The Crypt Keeper? Surely they know that they are cheating the audience. What is the point of calling it a 'Tales' movie when there is no obvious connection?With that massive qualm aside this is a good movie. It seems to me that they may not have had much of a budget and if that is the case... then they pulled it off excellently. It is not entirely gory or gruesome but it is still packed with the typical comic relief that makes a 'Crypt' movie so fun to watch.So come on guys.... make us some MORE Tales From the Crypt movies!!

However as it goes on the attempts at creating emotions between the characters is so inept that it really turns the horror off and is an insult to serious viewers. The story this is based on I walked with a zombie is probably much better although unfortunately I haven't seen it yet. Ritual looks so exciting and could have been a great movie about zombies and voodoo but in reality it has turned out very poorly which is a shame. It's hard to say what is wrong with it. I guess there are just too many inept scenes and it is hard to believe for example in the lovestory between Alice who is called Alice Dodgson like the girl who supposedly inspired Lewis Carrol to call his heroine Alice and the younger brother. Absolutely nothing has been built up between them and then in the end they get married. Anyway this looks great and it was worth a look  but the movie is just so poorly performed. 310.".

One of the best parts of this one is that it builds up an incredible atmosphere in here through the effective use of it's supernatural overtones. This is one of the few films that manages to really use the mystery and magic of voodoo and does this spectacularly making it appear to be quite dangerous and something to be feared. Due to this the first half is incredibly suspenseful with the mysterious actions around them which are done through a series of rather freaky ideas. The set of hallucinations that occur here are marvelous with the jungle coming alive and attempt to destroy the car the two are traveling alongside being one of them and a later scene where a hallucination of the collapsing roof falling onto them despite being the only one to see it is a fantastic scene as well. As these grow in stature throughout the film there's plenty to like here with the way these cause an enhancement of the supernatural threat that constantly runs in the film. That starts with the opening with the wedding ceremony giving way to the confrontation in the lab which is a nice way of getting this going the increasingly strong supernatural attacks that are used to build a strong mystery in the meantime and the freakouts done by the possessed victim are just plain fun. The ending confrontation in the fields during the voodoo ceremony is really good as well using more voodoo charms a tense buried alive sequence and a suspenseful standoff that is pretty intense. The last big part of the film is the gore which here works quite well for the film. These here are all that work for the film as this one didn't have many flaws and there really is only one which does affect the film somewhat. This is that the film is slightly overlong and somewhat dull at times. This one really shouldn't have been that much over an hour and a half at all and really should've been trimmed in certain areas as there's several scenes which go on for much longer than they should. The middle section of this is the most apparent featuring several scenes that aren't that important. The trip to the beach to frolic in the surf and the family visits to the shack for no reason being the main exceptions and the exposition in the beginning to get the story involved could've been done a little quicker as it really could've had the same impact it does now with a little time removed. Since there's no titular connection to the series including the Crypt Keeper wraparounds are unnecessary as well and since there's hardly any dark comedy or humor to come from it it's just pointless. All of these make the film feel longer than it should and give the film it's one true flaw.Rated R Graphic Violence Graphic Language Brief Nudity and a mild sex scene.".

Curry who is a marvellous character actor has nothing to do here in any way complete waste whilst Grey looks cute but doesn't quite seem comfortable in this genre.The plot is pretty damn near dull as hell actually its all about voodoo and creating zombies naturally what else seeing as its set in Jamaica. The thing is nothing much happens in this lots of flashbacksdreams with Grey walking around looking all serious trying to find out what's causing an illness that drives people loopy zombies. I really was quite bored during the entire film no action no gore no monsters or mutants etc...It is also played as a semi serious thriller with no laughs or comic horror like the previous two films.

It's a movie about a nurse who travels to Jamaica to watch a patient and all kinds of weird voodooy gross stuff happens. It had some OK effects but the camera work really isn't very good. It might amuse you as it did me. The DVD includes a pretty stupid Crytpkeeper opening and outtakes with the Cryptkeeper. See it if you enjoy Crypt but it really has nothing to do with it.My rating 2 out of 4 stars. 107 mins. R for Violence.".

This time she made that clear being one of the hottest girls I've ever seen in a movie. I can't forget her in that rosy short skirt she was dazzling like a rare gem. Or answering her house's door all naked.. This is matchless giving Ritual the quality of unforgettable apart! I was amazed how she perfected her accent too. It makes you ask where is such a queen in Hollywood socalled blockbusters ? Here's another mystery else the movie's one for you! The longtime absentee Jennifer Grey wasn't bad herself. The Dirty Dancing's heroine has turned with not many movies after into a memory from the 1980s. Here with the serenely colored clothes the plain outfits the curly hair the short coiffure and her presence which didn't differ much she looked really like a memory from the 1980s! Grey delivered convincing performance with slight sexy moments. Obviously the makers wanted to exploit their movie's babies well since there was no budget so let's put the 2 female leads one blond and one brunet in skimpy clothes for most of the time. However when it comes to acting and being too hot simply Kristen Wilson wins.The movie was moving as the same as sexy. It managed to be mysterious a bit scary and most of all unpredictable. I loved the exciting unexplained events the end's twist so the last shot. The directing tried to be as exotic as the story. You might see that the movements of the camera were idiot the using of the lenses was cheap but anyway.. it worked. The landscapes seemed beautiful and wild. All in all it managed to be a journey into seductive and dangerous world. And despite the low budget I didn't feel any TVish moments. Very few times when I put entertaining right before horror in one sentence so how about a V movie too! But this time it deserves that. And surprisingly not for Kristen Wilson only.

Just how in the world could anyone be so cruel? ....money might have something to do with it. There is two main stars. Both are hot babes. One is Jennifer Grey who plays the Doctor seeking answers the other is a Jamaican Playboy bunny who may as well remain nameless .....although it's questionable as to whether or not she's really Jamaican. Since it is Jamaica the blazing heat demands the least amount of clothing as humanly possible from both chicks.I personally thought Jennifer was the hottest of the two since the biggest spoiler in the whole movie is that unlike her Jamaican costar she proudly teases every male viewer with just panties and a tight shirt.Now back to the horror. There's lots 'n' lots of voodoo stuff going on that are all hallucinations like Jennifer being tied up and tortured by spiders crawling on her. A bunch of tree branches attacking some dude in a car. A ceiling caving in on a guy. Definitely sure fire acts of voodoo .....or they're smokin' too much dope. Oh yeah I almost forgot every Jamaican carries a machete and stares at Jennifer with clearly the intent to KILL. All of them carrying a machete is verbally mentioned so of course you get the idea that it will be difficult to figure out who's responsible for the voodoo zombies.The shocking elements that will be testing your courage as a horror movie fan so boldly displayed here climaxes sweetly with Jennifer getting married to the American guy that the film centered around that was voodooed.My favorite scene that made me feel more relaxed because I was so scared was when Jennifer did her voodoo dance.".

The only problem with the movie is that it moves too slowly and there is not enough VoodooHoodoo action.";

	schema:headline " Utterly diabolical except for some neat action.";
	schema:reviewBody "Wesley Snipes latest straight to video film is a convoluted mess horribly reminiscent of Steven Seagal's latest works. The script is horribly written and makes no account for the low budget it is and tries to be too clever for its own good. Sadly too Snipes has fallen into the trap of having an ADR voice double doing much of his dialogue and an entire narration that comes every now and again through points in the movie. It's sad to see a guy of Wesley Snipes talent doing garbage like this film and producing a tired and clearly bored performance barely bothered to produce his own dialogue. It's become somewhat of a joke with Steven Seagal the fact he doesn't perform his own dialogue but it's not something I'd have expected from Snipes. Perhaps it's due to the producer Andrew Stevens who has worked with Seagal previously or the director PoChi Leong responsible for Seagal's epically bad Out Of Reach.The plot involves shady government officials terrorists who coach soccer teams disks with incriminating evidence on and a hefty chuck of missing money. Oh and biological weapons. Now how they are connected I don't know but what I can tell you is the diabolical script is pretty hard to fathom and like many of these DTV movies this likes to include one twist too many. The plot is also uninterestingly told playing out it's cards with people having shady one to ones in offices and dark alleys etc. It's all kind of lets have a sit down and dish out some plot points for the sad bastards watching this film! The pace of the movie as such suffers because despite the dullness of the performances and the storyline the film does have some nice action scenes. As an example of how a DTV film has successfully put across a storyline of a twisting nature I give you Dolph Lundgren's directorial debut the Defender. That movie had it's share of twists and over complexity but the movie has a last hour of almost entirely action with Dolph under siege form terrorists. The plot points are told in the context of action on the move while avoiding death. The movie doesn't stop to tell us what's happening it doesn't break up the pace. As such although the plot was a little convoluted it was more forgivable cause the action never let up. The Detonator like too many of these films stops everything to give us a convoluted walk through of who's bad and who isn't before inevitably shifting that round in the pulled from the rear end twist at the end. These movies can often suffer with pacing issues.Snipes himself as I mentioned is pretty bland here. At the beginning he's putting on a camp persona as he's undercover with some arms dealers. Initially it seemed as if he was enjoying himself but unfortunately the rest of the movie sees him and his occasional voice double sleepwalking through the role. Snipes only comes alive when he's called upon to kick ass. There's some nice action here though with some swift and crunching martial arts and some nicely punchy shootouts. The film also features a decent car chase. Silvia Colloca costar and she's not much of an actress but she is gorgeous with a costume that screams look at my cleavage! The rest of the cast flit in and out with clichd and uninteresting roles.Snipes thankfully has better projects lined up from now. He has another team up with Mario Van Peebles called Hard Luck then he will do Chasing The Dragon from the director Chris Nahon who did Jet Li's Kiss Of The Dragon. Finally Snipes is apparently doing Toussaint a biographical drama directed by Danny Glover. The future is suddenly looking brighter for Snipes but lets remember he was getting extremely well paid for his DTV films around 7million a movie possibly more. It's also funny to consider that of all these DTV god's Dolph Lundgren is doing the better films directing himself with the enjoyable Defender and the supremely violent and nicely done The Russian Specialist and what's more he's doing them on a fraction of the budgets of these diabolical offerings from Wesley and Steven Seagal are producing. 12".

Not Oscar material true but much better than it was.I thought the plot had a good hook and through line. Granted this movie was badly written. And TERRIBLY directed and produced. I mean how many irrelevant flashbacks can you have? Why were we there? What exactly is the point of the opening sequence? It seems like the producers watched American Beauty a few too many times and thought 'I'll use that in an action movie!' I thought the movie wasn't that badly acted. Wesley Snipes did a credible job he just ran afoul of some bad direction. And once this movie hit the production room things just got worse. The main actress I think had the same problems. Some of the other acting was suspect yes but it was a lowbudget flick. Again I would say it is the director's job to pick that up and correct it.As an overall recommendation I would agree with the first review I read that this movie is not worth seeing. Or maybe it is worth seeing if you are a film student and want to see what NOT to do.310 and that's giving it praise.".

	schema:reviewBody "I rented this movie last week and after watching Snipes' 7 Seconds movie this one was definitely a significant improvement.One of the things that bothered me was there were numerous areas where I could not understand what was being said and I even hit the remote to go back again and again and still remained stumped. There was no English closedcaptionssubtitles option on the DVD so I was stuck with moving on. One comment from numerous Asians I know whom have come to live in the USA and have learned to speak our language is I try to watch AfricanAmerican movies but can't understand what they are saying. I had a few areas of trouble with understanding some English spoken in Van Damme's movie Second in Command and that DVD didn't offer English subtitlesclosed captions option either.The second main thing that bothered me was with the sound affects. If you close your eyes and listen to the gunfire and explosions ... they all sounded the same like someone banging a bat against a piece of thick glass. I appreciated the sound in one scene near a swimming pool and could hear the pool's water but then poof the sound of this just disappeared ... but was nicely replaced with the sound of a light breeze through the trees. At least in this movie the irritating same old clapping boom boom sound was absent for the background action scenes. But do all car engines racing around in streets and different guns being fired and numerous explosions have the same sounds? This movie like 7 Seconds contains pretty much the same visual candies and the car chases really could get lessened and shortened. They reek of filler padding to add length to what would probably be a TV length show if cut out. We have come to expect action films to have loads of visual candy but the combination of lackluster sound affects and padding took this movie down more notches than it deserved. The visuals were good but my ears were insultingly assaulted. LOUD can go only so far before I'm mentally handicapped.Once again the script was very good and so was the acting. There was not as much of Snipes' bopping heads as other movies. Snipes has a tough guy image that perhaps he should shed and consider calmerquieter scripts. This movie would have done better if it had less padding and a better sound crew plus add subtitles!. I wasn't disappointed in watching this movie and would recommend it for at least a one time viewing. I wouldn't buy the DVD.".

After a big shootout most of Dimitru's men have been killed by Sonni which the local Romanian police force are unhappy about top man Flint Michael Brandon decides to send Sonni back to the US  at the same time protect a woman named Nadia Cominski Silvia Colloca who is also being sent back to the US. However it turns out that Nadia is wanted by Dimitru  his football club owning boss Jozef Tim Dutton who need her in order to complete a deal for a nerve gas bomb which they intend to set off in Washington killing millions of people...This American  Romanian coproduction was directed by PoChih Leong  The Detonator confirms beyond any shadow of a doubt that Wesely Snipes has joined the washed up action film stars club who are relegated to making generic action films in Eastern European locations yep Snipes has joined such luminaries as JeanClaude Van Damme Steven Seagal Dolph Lundgren Rutger Hauer  Chuck Norris. I give Snipes a bit of credit since he held on a little longer than the rest with the excellent Blade Trinity 2004 still fresh in a lot of cinema goers minds every film he has made since has gone straighttoDVD but it had to happen sooner or later like a lot of the names I've mentioned Snipes has lived off the reputation of a few great films  if you look at his career he's been in more bad films that good ones. Like the recent films of JCVD  Seagal The Detonator is pretty awful. The script by Martin Wheeler is as predictable boring  bythenumbers as anything out there. The Detonator is the sort of film you expect to see on an obscure cable TV channel playing at 2 O'clock in the morning. The Detonator is chock full of clichs Snipes is forced into a situation where he has to protect a woman  at first they dislike each other but by the end they are in love his closest friend at the CIA turns out to be a traitor while the obnoxious by the book boss noone likes actually turns out to be a pretty decent guy Snipes character is allowed to run around Bucharest shooting killing  blowing people up like it doesn't matter  he never gets arrested the action is dull  forgettable the bad guy own a football club so there are lots of annoying football terminology  there aren't even any funny oneliners.Director Leong doesn't do anything anything to liven things up The Detonator looks cheap with a car chase in which the two cars never seem to get over the 30mph mark. OK the action scenes are relatively well staged but they are few  far between  utterly forgettable in a 'bad guy shoots at Snipes  misses in return Snipes shoots at bad guy  kills him' sort of way. There's a half decent car crash  explosion but very little else. It seems some of The Detonator was shot in a Romanian football stadium I think I'd rather have watched the game for 90 minutes rather than this film.With a supposed budget of about 15000000 The Detonator is reasonably well made but not that much really happens. Set  filmed in Bucharest in Romania. The acting isn't that great Snipes just doesn't seem interested  feels like he is just there for the money which I don't blame him for at all.The Detonator is yet another poor clichd action film starring a has been actor  set in Eastern Europe. Why do Sony keep making these things? Not recommend there are much better action fare out there.".

	schema:headline " Oh Wesley...what happened to you!! Drab mishmashed TV movie";
	schema:reviewBody "There was a time when Wesley Snipes WAS action. Blade Passenger 57 Boiling Point Demolition Man...now he seems to be the king of straight to DVD and I hadn't seen him in action in awhile so I decided to go with The Detonator. In all fairness Snipes is not the problem. He stills kicks some serious ass and he can actually act which is a plus for an action star but the story was just bogged down with nonsensical and confusing plot and characters. The film falls victim to a common error committed by writer Martin Wheeler who is probably just an action film fan boy who thinks he can write his own. He's slapped together a film completely neglected plot holes sense of style or even fitting together and just let it fly. Action films don't have to be realistic but they have to have a basis in reality so that the audience will ignore the lack of realism ie Transporter 2 Wesley Snipes plays scorned Government agent Sonni Griffith who is wanted back in the U.S. for murdered a mobster and yet apparently is allowed to roam Europe on assignment...yeeeah. He is after a big gun runner until his cover is blown by a mysterious phone caller. Now he has to escort a protected witness back to the U.S. Snipes is good there is nothing wrong with his performance. His martial arts is wicked and his gun play is superb the man could still be an action superstar but the plot and story stinks. Italian actress Silvia Colloca plays the protected witness Nadia Cominski who despite a rather poorly slapped together Russian accent does a decent job. She's tough and her and Snipes have great chemistry although the I hate you I love you routine is a little forced at times. Matthew Leitch gives a stand out performance as head bad guy Dimitru misspelled Dimitri on IMDb. For some reason I wanted his name to be Dimitri because that's the common name but no it was u. Anyways Leitch gives a really great performance as a blood thirsty angry vicious killerhitman for a much larger mobster. Although Leitch and Snipes don't actually go head to head that often they are great adversaries and in a weak story such as this it would have easy for the bad guy to be a real pansy but instead he gives a terrific performance. William Hope plays brutally vicious mobster Michael Shepard. Seeing him in the same shot playing with children and then threatening and murdering other people is disturbing and he is a great mobster. He's mostly a straight to video kind of guy but he is a great actor and does a good job playing the bad guy. Warren Derosa plays fellow cop Mitchel who never quite fits in with the cast especially Snipes. He doesn't have the acting chops to fit in and he really just always looks like a schmuck. Deciding whether he is the one working against them never enters the mind because his character is boring and mostly useless.With a much MUCH stronger screenwriter The Detonator might have been able to fly but because of the completely lost script the film is pretty much ruined. There are a few neat action sequences and the story is watchable but there is just far too many plot holes things that are completely not necessary and characters that don't fit in. Maybe there are fans of Wesley Snipes that still hold it out for a triumphant return to theater but I can tell you this won't help. Wait for this one to show where it belongs...on cable...510".

But it did't fail to keep me entertained. The on screen chemistry between Snipes and the lead actress Silvia Colloca brings a bit of fun and wit in the story. I have to say the scenes between those two are my favourites. The girl has a real attitude and it's quite cool to her confronting Snipes's cool temper. In fact Silvia Colloca graduates from a bit role In Van Helsing and shows she can act and she has the asset of a good leading lady. And she looks stunning by the way... Snipes is fun to watch as usual and his action sequences show of his talent. I struggled a bit with the supporting cast and their accents. Most of them sounded Russian to me as opposed to Romanian. But maybe I'am being picky.610 rent it if you want some nonintellectual entertainment.".

The plot is reasonably twistyturny and Silvia Colloca adds welcome grace and emotion to the film she even gets her own angelic music theme this may sound like a corny idea but she has the angelic beauty to justify it.

I give this film credit because I saw it for free on USA cable network which loves this sort of content. Anyway this movie starts out talking about terrorists and how they love to steal nuclear devices. The character development is almost nexttonone therefore making a regular Bmovie to set it apart from the other DVDs on your videostore. You get a good stunts that look realistic a guy who you know is goingto betray Snipes but yet the moviemakers act like it is still a creative twist. There is promise in Snipes making a creative comeback but that hope demises when you start hearing a voice that sounds nothing like him come out of his mouth. His costar Slivia Collaca one of the brides in the dreadful Van Helsing has little to work with and gets a little annoying because she yells a lot and can't defend herself really well. The director also directed another common DTV star's movie that starred none other then Steven Seagal if it makes you feel any better about this flick. Anyway Snipes topples the bad guys's plan only to result in getting killed as well thus leaving a very disappointed viewer.".

This film however does little to enhance his reputation it's not exactly unwatchable  but I am not in any hurry to watch it again either. In fact if I never saw it again it wouldn't bother me  there are just loads of better films out there to waste my on! It's a pity because with a bit of imagination and and some subtle changes this could have been a worthwhile film. Instead the director has chosen to almost try and bludgeon his audience into submission with too much overthetop violence and very little characterisation.The biggest problem I have is with Snipes' costar Silvia Colloca. It baffles me that the producers of this film went to all the bother of hiring a stunning beautiful for my money anyway and talented actress like Miss Colloca and then give her such a pathetic onedimensional character to play with. If she was hired to simply add a bit of glamour to the movie she doesn't even do that very well there's no nudity in the film and also no sex scene worth mentioning. Strange really. Given the amount of violence in this film it baffles me why the producers have taken such a conservative attitude to sex and nudity. Are we living in 2007 or in 1957? What the producers of this rubbish and probably the actors as well have forgotten is that films are meant to be fantasies. Like most of the inhabitants of this planet my real life is very boring. I would love to be chasing terrorists be able to handle myself like Mr Snipes and hook up with a beautiful young thing like Miss Colloca. This film satisfies none of those fantasies very well. Which is precisely why I am giving it such a bad review!".

Do you actually have to TRY to do that? no real characters etc. Just dull. Snipes is a gifted actor and physical performer but none of this has come to the surface in ANY of his DTV work when the opportunity is there to give the audience a much more superior product than they are used to. Imagine a decent script with a few solid characters that you care about and some damn explosive action fights shootouts etc. How can it be that hard to handle? My personal opinion is that the primary players in the productions simply do not care. There is no evidence of enthusiasm for what they are doing. Look at Snipes in the first 2 Blades Passenger 57 Rising Sun New Jack City Demolition Man etc? Awesome intense performances complemented by decent if not always outstanding scripts good supporting casts and wicked action.None of that is evident in any of these releases so far which is a tremendous shame. The distributors slap Wesley's face on the cover knowing the audience will lap them up as they haven't realised yet that they haven't seen him in theatres for nearly 2 years.I'd love to see Snipes work with somebody like Isaac Florentine who really knows how to make the most out of a DTV production and work with Alpha Stunts who are simply some of the best action guys out there. Together they would all make an awesome team and a Snipes action vehicle we would all be proud of seeing.Detonator sucks. It's not as bad as The Marksman which chews but it still really sucks.".

The distributors slap Wesley's face on the cover knowing the audience will lap them up as they haven't realised yet that they haven't seen him in theatres for nearly 2 years.I'd love to see Snipes work with somebody like Isaac Florentine who really knows how to make the most out of a DTV production and work with Alpha Stunts who are simply some of the best action guys out there. Together they would all make an awesome team and a Snipes action vehicle we would all be proud of seeing.Detonator sucks. It's not as bad as The Marksman which chews but it still really sucks.";

I always liked Wesley Snipes's movies but this one is terrible. I regret that I spent over 3 hours downloading this film. There are a lot mistakes in the film. For example the stadium in the film is not Lia Manoliu. The name of the stadium is Ghencea. The name of the soccer team is called Steaua Bucuresti not Uli.The scoreboard of the stadium is not capable of showing graphical images video replays live images etc. It's a simple scoreboard that can only display letters and numbers. The UliSeaua team's opponents are displayed on the scoreboard as Din  probably from Dinamo Bucuresti  who are Steaua's main rivals in the Romanian soccer championship. The images from the soccer match are from a match between Steaua Bucuresti and Poli Timisoara my favorite team and my only love  look it up on the internet and you will see why. The police cars in the movie are not properly made. There isn't a single darkblue police car in Romania! They are all white! The mistake list can go on and on and on ... but i will stop here! In short terms this movie is horrible. It does not worth renting it it does not worth buying a cinema ticket for it it does not worth downloading it! I honestly feel sorry that Wesley snipes played in this movie. A previous movie of his ... 7 seconds ... also filmed in Romania ... was OK but this is terrible!".

Nevertheless it's always good to see Wesley Snipes kick and punch and shoot the bad guys. When it comes to action flicks he's a reliable hero and a natural. But if that's why you wanna watch this movie don't. Chances are solid that you won't even last the full length of this movie in your seat.This is a lowbudget straighttovideo affair that does barely enough to be considered a movie. 'Could've been good' can be said about lots of movies but let's not go there with this one because nearly everything would need to be redone from the scratch to make something good out of the plot. Acting is meh while everything else is just plain trash. CGI used in simulating action scenes is lowclass and pathetic. Tim Dutton impresses with his persona I wouldn't mind seeing him as a villain in other serious projects. Pretty Italian actress Silvia Colloca is mostly irritating trying to pass off her flat chest as a wellendowed bosom with the help of a pushup bra. Eeek! William Hope is one of those actors who can't perform badly even if he wanted to.VERDICT Avoid unless you have nothing to do in your life like I do.SIMILAR  BETTER movies Matt Damon's BOURNE series Spy Game Ronin Casino Royale".

In fact Yvonne Lime was dating Elvis pictures of Elvis and Yvonne together were in movie magazines back then when this film was made and from what I understand he even visited the set.  Too bad they couldn't have had him sing a song in it!  There is an amazing backstory AMC could make about the senate hearings on juvenile delinquency and this film the senators mentioned the bad effects this film had on teenagers even though none of them had seen it!   Anyway Gene Fowler Jr who had edited Academy Award films like LAURA was chosen to direct this his first film and although he at first had second thoughts about doing it his wife convinced him no one would see it anyway.  Boy was she wrong!  His background as an editor helped him be a better firsttime director than most and helped make this picture made on a shoestring budget in only 7 days better than all the other teen horror films back then.  The camera angles on the fight at the beginning Dawn Richard's gymnist seeing the werewolf  upside down at first and therefore the audience too showed that he had good ideas in setting up shots.   Michael Landon contrary to what some believe never downplayed his connection to this film for it gave him his start in show business.  He may at first have had doubts about being connected with it with the initial uproar which is why he turned down the chance to play the werewolf a second time but after that he never badmouthed the film.  In fact he paid homage to it on a Halloween episode of Highway to Heaven.  Anyway the acting is good all around with standout performances by Landon and Whit Bissell.  The science used to turn Tony into the monster may be silly today but in the 1950's there were a lot of talk and film plots about pastlife regression following the Bridey Murphy newspaper accounts also used in THE SHECREATURE.  Again you had to live in the 1950's to understand all this. Philip Scheer's werewolf makeup is one of the better preHowlingAmerican Werewolf ones in movie history and while the transformation scene isn't as good as in THE WOLF MAN or THE WEREWOLF the director did not have a lot of money or time to work with and did a good job considering.    A film has to be pretty good even with a low budget to be as successful as this one was...and to remain a cult favorite 45 years later.  It has stood the test of time and deserves to be considered a classic of its kind.".

	schema:headline " A classic werewolf movie";
	schema:reviewBody "Tony Rivers is a teenager who has a real problem with anger. He's always ready for a fight and explodes at even the slightest provocation. A sequence of unfortunate events lead him to seek help with a psychotherapist who turns out to be a mad scientist obsessed with the possibilities of reverting man to his animal state. After a few sessions which seem to be helping brutal animallike killings begin to occur in the town and Tony fears that he has become ... a werewolf! Although it was made for an extremely low budget by a brandnew production company called American International Pictures this movie became very successful very quickly. Whether or not somebody actually sat down and figured out that teenagers should be the target audience for movie theatres now that the older folk stayed at home to watch TV is uncertain but it was definitely a winning formula. Of course the authority figures at the time were quick to damn the movie saying it was psychologically damaging the kids who watched it. What a bunch of squares.The werewolf aspect here is a metaphor for common teenage mood swings with the anger of Tony being eventually channelled into the beast. There are hints of a darker subtext particularly in a scene where he watches an attractive partiallyclad female gymnast doing her moves right before changing into the wolf and attacking her. Overall the movie fails to notice the other similarities between the werewolf myth and adolescence at least not to the same extent as Ginger Snaps or even Teen Wolf. It tries very hard to be hip to the teenagers of that time with fifties slang and a completely outofplace extended music number and dance sequence thrown in. Unfortunately it isn't really as thrilling or as fun as it really should be in places ... it's quite slow moving takes a long time to get started and a lot of the scenes in the second half of the movie seem thrown together and lacking in narrative flow. Obviously it isn't perfect it was given the Mystery Science Theatre treatment but hey  it's a Bmovie.Michael Landon is a real star in this movie giving a performance that is both intense and convincing. Rather than setting his sights on movies from here he went on to become a popular face on television with major roles in series such as Bonanza for over a decade Highway to Heaven and later starring in Little House on the Prairie. Nobody else on the cast really stands out although everyone is competent. Tony's girlfriend is played by Yvonne Lime who was actually dating Elvis while this movie was being made how cool can you get?.The notable writing team here although originally credited as Ralph Thornton were in fact Herman Cohen and Aben Kandel who also wrote the sequels I Was A Teenage Frankenstein and How To Make A Monster then credited as Kenneth Langtry. Aben Kandel also did some earlier uncredited work on the Werewolf Of London screenplay. Unfortunately none of these movies were particularly strong in terms of story or dialogue but nevertheless they did contribute a great deal to werewolf movie history. Director Gene Fowler Jr made his career in Bmovie horrors and westerns with this being his most wellknown work although I Married A Monster from Outer Space has to rank highly.Werewolf movie fans really have to see this movie not only because it was so popular and so influential but because it was one of the most interesting werewolf movies of it's time.".

	onyx:emotionText "Tony Rivers is a teenager who has a real problem with anger. He's always ready for a fight and explodes at even the slightest provocation. A sequence of unfortunate events lead him to seek help with a psychotherapist who turns out to be a mad scientist obsessed with the possibilities of reverting man to his animal state. After a few sessions which seem to be helping brutal animallike killings begin to occur in the town and Tony fears that he has become ... a werewolf! Although it was made for an extremely low budget by a brandnew production company called American International Pictures this movie became very successful very quickly. Whether or not somebody actually sat down and figured out that teenagers should be the target audience for movie theatres now that the older folk stayed at home to watch TV is uncertain but it was definitely a winning formula. Of course the authority figures at the time were quick to damn the movie saying it was psychologically damaging the kids who watched it. What a bunch of squares.The werewolf aspect here is a metaphor for common teenage mood swings with the anger of Tony being eventually channelled into the beast. There are hints of a darker subtext particularly in a scene where he watches an attractive partiallyclad female gymnast doing her moves right before changing into the wolf and attacking her. Overall the movie fails to notice the other similarities between the werewolf myth and adolescence at least not to the same extent as Ginger Snaps or even Teen Wolf.

	schema:reviewBody "A group of us guys were discussing the scariest films we'd seen as kids. I was 10 in 1957 when I saw this film while spending a week on Catalina Island. The theater was at the landmark Casino which was about a half mile walk from the small port village of Avalon. I was heavily absorbed in war scifi and western action films with a special appreciation for stunts and special effects but unfamiliar with the horror genre in general and werewolf lore in particular. I was also the runt tagging along with a trio of cool eleven year old friends. It could've been a scene out of Stand By Me. Four smartass kids walking at night down a dirt road to see I Was a Teenage Werewolf for my first and only time. As an aspiring artist I remember being fascinated by the opening titles where a makeup artist sketched the monster's face but when the actual transformation took place in the film it freaked me out to say the least. Maybe it was the collective scream of a hundred other kids but I covered my eyes until brave enough to slowly glimpse the monster. The scenes shot in Griffith Park looked too much like the dark tree lined path we had walked to the theater. That half mile walk back to town was the longest creepiest walk of my childhood.A few months later I saw A Man of a Thousand Faces and became completely fascinated by the art of makeup and dove into everything I could find on Lon Chaney Sr. Later I finally saw Chaney Jr. in The Wolf Man. By then I was too cool to be scared but still reading anything I could find on werewolf and vampire lore and probably first in line to see I Was a Teenage Frankenstein.".

	schema:headline " The 'Citizen Kane' of Teen Horror Films";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie is a lot better than the title would lead you to think and it is in fact a lot better than many of the other monster movies produced in 1957.At the time this film was made everybody in the industry knew teenagers liked monster flicks. But this is the first film to actually feature a teen as fullfledged murderous monster. It seems obvious today 53 years later but when the creators of this film had the insight that the adolescent audience actually tended to identify with the monsters as persecuted misunderstood misfits this was a revolutionary moment in cinema.The screenplay actually does a pretty good job of setting up a plausible troubled teen hero Michael Landon with angermanagement problems who is justifiably afraid of his own passions. He is sent to see psychiatrist Whit Bissell who at first seems to understand our hero but later turns out to be using him for his own purposes. This fact alone is striking as psychiatrists and guidance counselors tended to be universally depicted as virtuous advocates of teens in 1950's movies. Within this context Whit Bissell's character is truly subversive.The idea of hypnotic regression as means to monsterhood is used here to good effect anticipating William Hurt in 'Altered States.' Besides the monster reflecting teenage anger there are also indications that it personifies his sexual energies as well.This movie was a big hit when 1st released and it was followed by a wave of teen horrorscifi cinema Teenage Frankenstein Teenagers from Outer Space and Teenage Caveman to name but a few. Even after the genre quickly eschewed the inclusion of the word 'teenage' from titles it has continued uninterrupted alternately waxing and waning to this very date. Notable entries in recent years include Buffy the Vampire Slayer the series the Craft Sabrina the Teenage Witch the Vampire Diaries and of course the Twilight Movies. But while the latter entries are clearly popular among the younger set they make most adults roll their eyes at the excesses.Not so for 'Teenage Werewolf.' This is a tight fastmoving and unpretentious little movie that does the job quickly and efficiently and doesn't stare back at you wearing a ton of eye shadow and a stupid blank expression. I recommend this to any fan of old school horror andor Bmovies.".

He sees Tony as the perfect specimen to test his theories on hypnotic regression. But his experiments have a dramatic and horrific effect on Tony turning him into a snarling werewolf.Despite what I consider to be a ridiculous name I Was a Teenage Werewolf is quite an enjoyable movie. In fact it's much better than I ever expected for a Teen Angst  Horror movie starring Michael Landon. While a lot of the film is terribly predictable with some very obvious foreshadowing it's still a lot of fun  much more fun than its 3.9 IMDb rating would indicate. There are some surprisingly effective scenes in the woods once the werewolf makes his appearance including one vicious attack on a dog. And I Was a Teenage Werewolf is easily my favorite thing I've seen Michael Landon appear in. I've never been much of a fan but he gives a nice performance. In fact everyone involved gives a good accounting of themselves. So despite the incredibly awful song Eeny Meenie Minie Moe someone should be flogged for that abomination I'm giving I Was a Teenage Werewolf a slightly better than average rating of 610.".

It is an enjoyable way to spend 80 minutes but suffers from a slower than average monster debut the title creature isn't actually seen until 50 minutes in.One of the most interesting aspects of I WAS A TEENAGE WEREWOLF is that the script completely abandons the standard werewolf mythology. Instead of being bitten Rivers is transformed through hypnosis and a drug called Scopalomine. To thumb their nose even more the screenwriter Aben Kandal under a pseudonym has Dr. Brandon laugh off the lore as fantasy when being interviewed by the cops and only includes a glimpse of the old country via a foreign janitor named Pepe who has seen dis sorta ding before. Given the film's dismissal of the standard lore it should come as no surprise that Rivers is gunned down by a pair of cops sporting standard issued revolvers with more important standard issued bullets.The use of hypnosisregression is pretty topical for the film's time period. In 1952 hypnotist Morey Bernstein hypnotized Virginia Tighe. During these sessions Tighe allegedly regressed to her past life as one Bridey Murphy an Irish woman who lived in the late 18th and early 19th century. Bernstein published his findings in 1956 in a book titled The Search for Bridey Murphy. Of course producers jumped on the idea and a film version appeared the same year. It is nice to see exploitation producers were hip to the idea and even threw a werewolf into the mix. Somehow I WAS A TEENAGE IRISH GIRL doesn't sound as scary.Whit Bissell is the real star of the show as the pompous Dr. Brandon. Brandon comes off as the condescending blue print for cinematic ancestors such as REANIMATOR's Dr. Herbert West or DR. BUTCHER MD. Landon is fine as the young lead and provides plenty of the raw anger Tony Rivers needs. This is one angry kid and Landon seems to be having fun both as Rivers and his drooling regressed half. A lot of people speculated that Landon wasn't particularly proud of this work but he did pay homage to it in his 80s television series HIGHWAY TO HEAVEN. For the Halloween episode Landon directed I Was a Middle Aged Werewolf that featured both clips from the original film and Landon donning the werewolf make up once again. Barney Phillips who appeared in DRAGNET as Jack Webb's partner plays concerned Det. Sgt. Donovan who gives the films final moral of It's not for man to interfere in the ways of God.".

Michael Landon is a troubled teenager with an attitude who finds the wrong help in psychiatrist Whit Bissell who uses his private experiments to help Landon get revenge on those he believed have wronged him. Mysterious injections take the anger that is already there and make it beast like turning the future Pa Ingalls into a distant cousin of Lon Chaney Jr.'s. Girlfriend Yvonne Lime notices strange changes in his personality and so do her stuffy parents and Landon's father Malcolm Atterbury realizes in horror perhaps remembering what Claude Rains did in The Wolf Man what he must do.This is a decent if predictable update of that 1941 Universal horror classic and a few scenes seem like they've been taken from that film verbatum. There are some extremely tense moments particularly the attack of a girl doing gymnastics who sees wolfie approaching her while her head faces him upside down. Another scene shows one of Landon's teen rivals walking through the countryside hearing strange voices and calling out in panic demanding to know who's there. The music is creepy and the atmosphere affecting but sadly there's little detail about Landon's character of Tony Rivers that explains why he's so troubled beyond getting into fights at school and seemingly being the schoolyard bully. Those who know Landon only from his heroic TV parts will be surprised to see him playing a basically unsympathetic kid. A rock musical number entitled Eeny Meeny Miney Mo is enjoyably campy. For a cofeature I recommend American International's How to Make a Monster which parodied the making of this film by including a poster of it but having another actor stand in for Landon.".

Michael Landon plays the title character as Tony Rivers who is rebellious because...well just because as it takes a while before some kind of explanation is provided. Yvonne Lime is his girlfriend and Whit Bissell is the shrink who provides the solution that causes his changes. Among the people who crosses the werewolf's path is one Dawn Richard who would become a Playboy Playmate a few months before this movie's release. I'll just now say while there were some exciting scenes some of the tone was uneven as we go from Tony's frustrations to his being more joyful during a party scene to his being more behaved after his visits to his shrink. And you have to wonder if the shrink really thought his experiments straight through. Still this was quite a thrilling ride despite the obvious lowbudget and short filming schedule. Only seven days! And Michael Landon seemed never to have been shamed by his appearance in this movie as he's spoofed himself over this part of his past on shows like The Donny and Marie Show and his own Highway to Heaven. So on that note I'm glad to have finally seen I Was a Teenage Werewolf and recommend it with no reservation!".

I'll just now say while there were some exciting scenes some of the tone was uneven as we go from Tony's frustrations to his being more joyful during a party scene to his being more behaved after his visits to his shrink. And you have to wonder if the shrink really thought his experiments straight through. Still this was quite a thrilling ride despite the obvious lowbudget and short filming schedule. Only seven days! And Michael Landon seemed never to have been shamed by his appearance in this movie as he's spoofed himself over this part of his past on shows like The Donny and Marie Show and his own Highway to Heaven. So on that note I'm glad to have finally seen I Was a Teenage Werewolf and recommend it with no reservation!";

He finally seeks help when he beats up a guy at a party the guy just startled him with a trumpet. Unfortunately of all the counselor he could have gone to he picks a nut who wants to send people back to their primitive selves to release the id so so speak. Of course Landon becomes a werewolf and the rest is pretty clichd. The special effects are right out of all the Universal wolf man movies. He is a sad victim who only wanted to change.

	schema:reviewBody "Herman Cohen's essential slice of '50s exploitation boasts a title that renders it a nearclassic in the horror genre. The film is short and extremely fast paced and there is hardly any of the expository dialogue we're used to getting in these films. The film has also dated badly which makes it a lot of fun and the teenage cast uses words like crazy and hip. One bongobashing guy even sings a song called 'eeny meeny miny mo'!The fight scene which opens the film is wellchoreographed and lots of other brief action scenes help to pad out the film. The cast all do their jobs well from Michael Landon as the frankly unlikeable antihero to Whit Bissell as the cold calm scientist. When his assistant baulks at the events they have set in motion Bissell remarks and you call yourself a scientist! The film works because it is so short and sweet. The classic werewolf story of THE WOLFMAN is updated for a younger audience and includes themes of alienation to appeal to teenage viewers which is why it was a big hit with the young audience. Girls scream the werewolf snarls. The werewolf makeup in this film is memorably funny but not in the least bit scary the first effective werewolf makeup was in Hammer's CURSE OF THE WEREWOLF in this viewer's honest opinion. The werewolf drools toothpaste and has a big bushy face with slickedback looking hair. However the hilarious dated dialogue the action scenes and the basic plot mean that this film is very easy to swallow you can just sit back and enjoy which is why it works so well.It was successful enough to spawn two sequels I WAS A TEENAGE FRANKENSTEIN and HOW TO MAKE A MONSTER. Thirty years later Michael J. Fox starred in the remake titled TEEN WOLF. Arkoff and Nicholson present this AIP product which while not an excellent intelligent film succeeds in entertaining the viewer which is why the film still boasts a lot of appeal even 40 years later when the music and trends all look alien to the modern viewer. It does it's job and it does it reasonably well.".

	schema:reviewBody "Stafano Nardini Valerio Mastandrea is nearly 36 and he's playing with a young punk group in Rome. Classically trained he used to be on the covers of magazines but the audience makes him feel old his career seems to have stagnated. It's been four years that he's been working to bring out a record. He doesn't have a girlfriend or a real bed to sleep in it's time to reconnect with the family he hasn't seen in a good long while.When the lead singer gets injured at a concert Stefano packs up his guitar in his battered car and drives back to Fellini's home town Rimini where the Nardinis run a substantial fruitpacking factory. It's a surprise to his parents and his brother and sister who're all happy to see him. Soon he's deeply involved in all sorts of revelations and problems. All of a sudden he seems to be indispensable which is pretty funny considering that as a rock musician Stefano has long been the odd man out in his industrial family.Things have changed at home since Stefano was last there. His father Teco Celio a cherubic little man having had a heart attack some time back now only plays golf. His mother spends lots of time with a trendy guru seeking peace in a sciamanic journey course. The running of the factory has fallen to brother Alberto Giuseppe Battiston of 'Bread and Tulips' and last year's Open Roads selection Eugenio Cappuccio's 'One Out of Two'. A former star athlete who's now overweight Alberto survives on manic energy and a variety of antidepressants. He's clearly at the end of his tether in more ways then one. As factory manager Alberto has not been doing such a good job of it apparently. The business is showing huge losses everything is in hock and the workers are owed three months' pay. Since their father isn't usually reporting to the factory any more Alberto is doing everything he can to hide these facts from him. Meanwhile Alberto's also currently separated from his wife and sees his two little children only on weekends. Later some of Stefano's and Alberto's male school friends decide they know the solution to Alberto's problemsand her work name is Nadine.It's more than obvious that if Stefano thought he was returning to simpler more idyllic life than he was living in Rome he was pretty far off.Stefano immediately shows himself to be a goofup himself since he goes joyriding with Alberto's two kids one afternoon in a parking lot and gets stopped by the cops. And this only underlines the family's and their friends' notion that Sefano's a misfit. In fact Stefano has had his wild druglaced years. But nonetheless at this point he gives every evidence of being more stable and perhaps more alert than his other family members except maybe Michela Anita Caprioli his sister.Trying to jolt his parents awake Stefano impulsively tells them that Michela is a lesbian. She has given up on university studies and now focuses completely on her job caring for performing dolphins. She has a roommate Laura.A lot of Alberto's assumptions are wrong. During his stay in Rimini he reconnects with old friends some of whom can help one of whom has had a nervous breakdown. He and Alberto work to resolve the factory's credit problems. This involves making nice with a young politician that they know who seems to have a special friendship with Michela. In the end the solution is going to come from perhaps the least expected quarter.'Don't Think About It''Non pensarci' is a film made up of mildly manic and often amusing set pieces that move us around among its multiple locations with a steady rhythm focusing alternately on one family member or another. Of course there is a sense of urgency especially in the life of Alberto whose identity crisis Stefano can totally relate to. There's no essential logic to the narrative but that's an important part of its charm. All the main characters are very simpatico and Mastrandrea and Battiston's are nicely delineated in this warm film whose appeal lies in the way it sees life as a work in progress. A musical sound track that ranges from Chopin to rock links sound to character. After the emotional repression of the Open Roads noir 'The Girl by the Lake' 'Don't Think About It' wit its openended but celebratory ending felt very appealing for its loose structure and humanity. Zanasi keeps things consistently light and amusing without descending into frivolity or silliness. I guess if 'Non pensarci' has a motto it's this You can't give up your family especially if you're Italian but you don't have to take on all its problems.Shown at the Open Roads New Italian Cinema series at Lincoln Center June 2008 this is Zanasi's fourth feature.".

How wrong I was! Mastandrea delivers one of the most refreshing performances I have witnessed in a long time. The whole movie is interpreted by extremely credible actors. The result is impressive.What pushed me to go and see it were the news in one of the Festival's dailies that during a previous screening it had received 23 applauses open scene during the projection  a very rare feat. I did not count the bursts of clapping from the audience during my screening but the impression was that the number 23 was short of the quantity of exceptionally well crafted hilarious comic or ironic moments. Many more moments were worth a thought and special recognition to the scenario directing and acting in the movie.I simply could not believe that an Italian movie was so well accepted and notwithstanding my personal prejudice towards the main character's potential I went with my partner  whose knowledge of the Italian language definitely undermined the chances for her to enjoy the film's jokes fully  and I saw her laugh just as many times as I did. This movie's antics obviously transcend the lost in translation syndrome.I was so pleased that it was an Italian movie. Especially in comparison with the otherwise poor to appalling showing of other Italian productions.To me this is a very probable candidate for a Hollywood remake. Unfortunately I feel it will not be until then that Italians go see and finally enjoy this story. I really do not know why the team who produced it did not enter it into the competition. I definitely think the jury would have regarded it as worth a mention.Regarding Mastandrea I feel I must apologize for my trouncing prejudices. His performance is reminiscent of the best moments of a master actor whose art we prematurely lost  Massimo Troisi  but without the Neapolitan connotation which possibly made his genius less understood in the northern part of Italy or abroad. He moved me and the audience. He made us all laugh with a gesture a glance a detail. A laughter never directed at him or the other characters but with him at the things and situations that anyone would feel they can share  or indeed do share in our notsoextraordinary lives. He delivered the most credible prodigal son figure I have seen on screen and did it all with a flair and irony which is unfortunately lost in most of the current production  whether Italian or international.I loved all the bittersweet touches in the movie from the speed bumps in front of his house the speed radar in front of the ice cream parlour and its phenomenal use in the movie up to the suspended ending which leaves every spectator with a free choice in themselves about how this story should end.Maybe it is too early to call this genius but its simplicity and the directness with which this movie speaks to us is definitely very close to it. I hope that the serious critics do not oppose and that this movie can represent a bit of my country a bit of the life of a regular guy's life of the 21st century in that strange boot of a nation to other Film Festivals including Academy Awards.Go see this movie. It is good for your heart. It is good for your outlook on life. Just one day after seeing it someone stole my PC. Of course I was not pleased but Non pensarci Do not think about it even provided me with a bit of solace which I sorely needed. Thank you.PS  A disclaimer I do not work for the producers nor have any financial interest in the success of this movie. I just liked it intensely and immensely.".

	schema:reviewBody "The pain you are feeling inside is not real it just seems like thattake this place for example it just looks like an Irish pub... We are in Rimini Italy the NeverEver Land of the declining bourgeoisie where all things fall in place only when the elderly father waves the magic golfbat whilst anything that his or not entirely his middleaged offspring might try to do proves to be completely pointless and futile. Playing in a punkrock band nursing dolphins continuing the family business or running for Parliament are games for shouldbe adults still daydreaming of the things they will do when they grow up. Starting with the title if you  do not think about it  someone else will the movie is a wonderfully amusing funeral oration to responsibility. The lead character Stefano gets fed up with being a punk precisely in the moment of realizing what this means no fun loathing of the audience standing alone etc. and  of course  quits. He runs for cover to his rich parents and family that are however facing bankruptcy. Stefanos transformation into an unwilling coadministrator of the family business is fortunately only a minor part of the plot. The three siblings Stefano the rocker Alberto the manager and Michaela the dolphin trainer are all bruised by quitting and Stefanos influence within the family is based on the fact that no one really suspects he gave up as well. By contrast the three firm characters in the general mayhem are Nadine the hooker Francesco the banker and Walter the father. While Nadines episode is mostly a farcical bracket within the drama Francesco seemingly provides for the Italian context. In the bank meeting he accuses Alberto the managerbrother of not being attentive enough in constructing a network of social relations that could have saved him from failure.

How much is this elderly gentleman actually responsible for creating a mafialike environment among the local entrepreneurs the same environment that pushed his qualitysearching son Alberto to the brink of failure?Again fortunately Zanasi does not seem to be an explicitly engaged director. The true mastery of the movie lies in wrapping the critique of the Italian mafia gerontocracy in the bittersweet coat of family relationships communication problems and smalltown social dynamics.

	onyx:emotionText "The pain you are feeling inside is not real it just seems like thattake this place for example it just looks like an Irish pub... We are in Rimini Italy the NeverEver Land of the declining bourgeoisie where all things fall in place only when the elderly father waves the magic golfbat whilst anything that his or not entirely his middleaged offspring might try to do proves to be completely pointless and futile. Playing in a punkrock band nursing dolphins continuing the family business or running for Parliament are games for shouldbe adults still daydreaming of the things they will do when they grow up. Starting with the title if you  do not think about it  someone else will the movie is a wonderfully amusing funeral oration to responsibility. The lead character Stefano gets fed up with being a punk precisely in the moment of realizing what this means no fun loathing of the audience standing alone etc. and  of course  quits. He runs for cover to his rich parents and family that are however facing bankruptcy. Stefanos transformation into an unwilling coadministrator of the family business is fortunately only a minor part of the plot. The three siblings Stefano the rocker Alberto the manager and Michaela the dolphin trainer are all bruised by quitting and Stefanos influence within the family is based on the fact that no one really suspects he gave up as well. By contrast the three firm characters in the general mayhem are Nadine the hooker Francesco the banker and Walter the father.

	schema:reviewBody "After accidentally causing their friend to fall to his death a group of teenagers is stalked one year later by a fisherman with a hook who knows what they did last summer. Will the gang find out who is behind the fisherman's mask in time to save themselves or are they going to get what they deserve? As I say in my headline this film was watchable for a video sequel. While not of the standard that Final Destination 3 is it comes close  and didn't even push for a theatrical release. The story uses the same elements as the first movie without using any of the same characters though it does reference the first two movies. That's not really different from what FD3 did so for those people who bash this one but give FD3 a pass you're not really being fair.My only real complaint with the plot is that I don't see why the kids deserved to be stalked. In the original the kids are drunk driving hit a man on the road and then hide his body. So we have three crimes driving while intoxicated vehicular manslaughter and hiding a corpse. Serious stuff. This time the friend who died was in on the prank and fell to his own death on accident. No drinking no pushing him to death no hiding a body. A perfectly reasonable accident.Ignoring that the characters are decent although one  Colby  reminds me a bit too much of Jake Busey and the story is told at a good pace. The inclusion of the Zoe character was a good move as all horror films benefit from a punk or goth chick especially one in a band. I draw your attention to Trash Linnea Quigley from Return of the Living Dead and rest my case.The movie has its faults and I admit I found aspects of the climax to be unsatisfying but over all this was a good film. I have no strong urge to push for a fourth film and hopefully we will never see one. But for a movie with no big actors and a recycled plot this one is entirely adequate.".

I Know what You Did Last Summer and its overcriticised sequel certainly slotted into this category nicely.A sequel more or less in name only the plot sees a group of teenage friends deciding to keep the death of their friend in a backfired prank a secret... one year later in the days leading up to the tragedy's anniversary the four receive ominous 'I Know...' messages before being picked off one by one by a hooded character in the 'Fisherman' outfit from the first two movies. Who could possibly know what they did? Is it someone out for revenge? Or is the original fisherman back to wreak more havoc? From the box art and the seven year delay it was clear that this was never going to have the same high production values or quality acting as those late nineties slashers but I didn't quite expect as far a drop as this. White's direction while lacking any genuine drawnout suspense is at least edgy and 'hip' sadly acting from all but the pretty lead Brooke is decidedly wooden. Four or five minutes into the movie you can see why Sony decided to bypass a cinema release in favour of a straighttovideo one.That said if taken as a low budget teen slasher in the vein of 'The Pool' and 'Lover's Lane' it actually works quite well. The true identity of the fisherman is well hidden with various red herrings keeping the audience guessing. The special effects appear to have consumed a large chunk of the budget too  one gutting akin to the 'hook in the throat' from the first 'I Know...' movie is particularly gruesome.Ultimately I felt let down by the ending  but I would imagine everyone's opinion would really depend on their reaction to the killer's identity.

Isn't the money not dear to them or are they so full of it that they found out a way to waste it. I lost the interest from the very beginning of the movie. Basically there are two types of suspense thrillers. One that is very serious and the suspense is maintained till the end. You scream O my God at the end when the secret is out and you always go back and forth and analyse the events and know when to look for the clue. A fine example would be Final destination The second category is where its a total nonsense. There is no story but it has loads of humor. People watch such film without their brains so many enjoy them. I also like those. For eg Scary movie. This movie falls in neither of the categories. It was full of craps but still tries to be serious. And when the secret is let out in this movie you are left frustrated and irritated and angry. You develop a strong urge to kill the makers of this movie. You feel cheated. The mystical figure would come out from no where and then vanish into no where. It was more surprising that the figure uses modern gadgets like Cellphone SMSs to scare his targets. Every thing in the movie was hard to swallow and total rubbish. The director and writer aren't aware of the term Reality. This is a Humble request from me Please don't watch this movie. If you can do anything anything else then thats always better than watching this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "I had low expectations when renting this movie. I am a huge fan of the first film and of the book. The sequel I Still Know... was just okay and nothing life changing. I have learned the hard way  I didn't get my hopes up simply for the fact that whenever I get excited about a new horror movie The Grudge The Ring 2 and Audition come to mind I end up disappointed so sometimes it is better to not see the glass half full. Was I right to jump to this conclusion and go in halfhearted? Well yes and no. This review will contain spoilers.The negatives first. If you have seen the first movie in the series then you have practically seen this one too. The characters the storyline even some dialog it's very familiar. The most illogical difference is that instead of North Carolina we are now in Colorado. Just how does that work? This time around its more up to date. Instead of leaving notes this time The Fisherman leaves text messages. I found it odd how all of the messages came from a blocked ID I didn't know you could block your number while texting someone. Oh well.The death scenes while violent and gory for the most part are far too short. The best parts of horror movies are the chasekill scenes and they were all too rushed. Seeing as these people are almost carbon copies of the characters from the first film I expected Zoe who is a punkrock version of Helen Shivers to have a long chase scene. I was let down as I was with all of the death scenes. They were all over before they even finished and it didn't help that it was beyond seethrough to know who had Victim stamped on their forehead.The editing while neat at times quickly became annoying. Is this a music video or is this low budget horror? The quick cuts and fancy editing did nothing for me but get in the way. Also I'm not sure if my DVD was messed up or not but some of the shots looked blurry and fuzzy but it was not that big of a deal.Last but not least the ending. The revelation of the Killer in these types of movies ranks right up there on top with death scenes. This was a let down. Though interesting to resurrect Ben Willis as some crazy zombie back for revenge it explains his supernatural ways and that text messaging problem I was having earlier it really doesn't make any sense. Just why would he come back for revenge halfway across the country after people who really have nothing to do with him? Sure he wants to teach them a lesson but give the guy some rest in his hellish afterlife so every time something like this happens he is going to come back and do it all over again? I mean does he have to be like Jason Voorhees now? Argh. This means the ending of I Still Know... was a dream and Julie and Ray are alive because Ben Willis died on Tower Bay Island. So then what was with that newspaper headline stating that 4 teenagers were killed in the Bahama's? Hmm? Okay some good things. Torrey DeVitto is the best thing the movie has to offer. While she may be lip syncing during her song she still does a damn good job at it. She was very likable and I was saddened to see her go. The rest of the cast meh. They were okay and no one was particularly bad.There were some decent scares even though they lasted a few seconds and didn't hold up. And since I am such a fan of the first one it was kinda nice to see it all done again with new people even though they could never compare.Bottom Line If you have nothing better to do go out and rent it. I wouldn't buy it personally. If you haven't seen the others titles in the series I do not think you will have much of a problem following it. Just remember it is a straight to video release and those are rarely great.510".

	schema:reviewBody "I come into this straight to video sequel of a franchise I never have been enthusiastic about but with an open mind. I love to see new actors and actresses find their shine you never know what talent is waiting out there with something a little new and untainted by cockiness and arrogance still really feeling it and giving 100 to the craft.The movie begins at an amusement park and a discussion of the folklore killer known only as The Fisherman a character you might know from the prequels in the series. A group of kids bored with their urban lifestyle decide to shake things up with a prank but things go horribly wrong and once a cover up is schemed the folklore is awakened.You know what bothers me about the I know what you did last summer movies. The hook is just not a scary weapon.It does make you wonder the way the fisherman comes and goes. It's as if he is merely a psychological embodiment of revenge. Going back to the fears on the occult that what you resist persists when it comes to ghosts and black magic what you dwell on opens doors and beyond those doors lay our worst nightmares.The killer cannot be stopped by bullets or blades which is to be expected. Likewise running him over with a car does no good. When you cut he him cries out like a wounded velociraptor and bleeds black oil. Also let it be noted that any time he is cut he instantly vanishes using his super god mode powers of despawning. I think they eventually finish the movie by tossing him into a wood chipper.This movie is hilariously bad but the acting is decent by both male and female actors and the directing is decent... seems to be slightly influenced by Gore Verbinski which is fine I love Verbinski's work. If I could have asked for anything different it would be better kills and better editing especially in regard to scene transition which was far too choppy for me lacking a certain intelligence I like to see in films of the horror genre. Not enough time was spent creating atmosphere that's for sure.Rather unimpressive kills to be honest. Too quick and badly edited. Uninspired deaths. Definitely not as interesting as Urban Legend's kills but overall a somewhat light and enjoyable movie. I wouldn't say it scared me but it was nice to see some new talent. Brooke Nevin and Torrey DeVitto were great and Ben Easter did a good job as well. I'd definitely look them up again. And you gotta love the use of Don Shanks as The Fisherman. That guy has done it all from Urban legend III The Crow III and Halloween V's Michael Myers.Rating 610On a side note why is it every time I get a new cellphone the very next horror movie i watch has my cell phone in the film? First cell phone Motorola Startac  The Ring Naomi Watts' phone Second cell phone LG 1400  I'll Always Know Brooke Nevin's phone".

Unfortunately it was not as good as I expected...the way many people talked about it on here made it sound like a masterpiece.I found the movie however somewhat enjoyable. I do not regret buying it.There were many flaws though. One of the major ones being the camera angles. Some of them were fine but others were completely terrible For example the opening on Roger's chase scene and Amber's face in the cart thing. Not to mention most of Roger's chase scene was crap...Also I hated how they had put together Zoe's quick dream I found it quite unprofessional and I did not like how she looked when she was screaming which sucked being that Torrey DeVitto is a very good looking girl.Also the deaths were obviously rushed too quickly unlike how they were in the first two films. The chase scenes were short and the deaths were quick but painful and gory which I do give credit for.When Zoe was sitting in the mirror admiring herself it looked too staged. You know like one of those obviously fake smiles on a Crest commercial. It wasn't the actress it was how they had made her perform for her character which didn't work out well in my opinion.The rest of the movie was great the acting violence dialogue settings etc.I expected much more of it but it was one of the best teenflasher flicks I have seen in years which I admire.I hope that they do not make a sequel because it might mess up what they already have created which is a good franchise.".

What the rhyms with PUCK was the writer thinking when he pulled that out of his bottom?!? You don't build up a mystery for an hour and a half and have the killer be someone completely unrelated to the story you have presented to the audience. I'd give the film 12 of a star out of four. I was never really a fan of the I Know series but this was astonishingly bad. The big surprise reveal of the killer was mind numbingly stupid! I am ashamed to actually have seen this film. The first ones at least worked on the so bad they're fun level but this was just a mindless retread of the first up until the redic ending. What the holy hell were they thinking.

	schema:reviewBody "MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS Though I tried to avoid as much as possible I was utterly torn on the scoring of this film on one hand I wanted to give it a much higher score but on the other I also wanted to give it a much lower one. Allow me to explain I started watching this film quite dubiously thinking it was quite a boring rehash of the original film but about 20 minutes in I really started to enjoy it. The characters were colourful and very likable the dialogue was clever and interesting and the plot had me more than a little 'hooked.'  see what I did there? I was all out ready to praise this movie to high heaven already planning my IMDb review at the half way stage. It got to around 70 minutes into the film and I was thinking wow this film is excellent I REALLY can't figure out who the killer is...By this stage I had long dismissed the two main big suspects as Red Herrings. Then just at the climax of the film I thought Brilliant I get to find out who it is I love films I can't figure out like this...Then the killer was revealed and I was left thinking What....? I mean... WHAT?! What the hell is going on?! I spent the remaining 15 minutes scratching my head wondering why the hell it all suddenly changed from a really good 'whodunnit' slasher flick into a fairly cheesing and disappointing film.WARNING spoilers follow here I would like to know why exactly the director thought I know! Instead of making this so far very good and completely believable film into a fresh relaunch of the franchise I'm going to make the killer a zombiefied demonghostthing instead. Note to the director it's been done.Slasher films with supernatural killers just do not work see Urban Legends Bloody Mary if you don't believe me.In my mind I rewrote the ending into the killer being one of the other girls on the ferris wheel at the beginning because that would have been more believable than what happened. So I gave it a 6 because up until the last 15 minutes or so it really is a very good film just after that it turns into a what the hell did I just watch?  type of film.".

	onyx:emotionText "MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS Though I tried to avoid as much as possible I was utterly torn on the scoring of this film on one hand I wanted to give it a much higher score but on the other I also wanted to give it a much lower one. Allow me to explain I started watching this film quite dubiously thinking it was quite a boring rehash of the original film but about 20 minutes in I really started to enjoy it. The characters were colourful and very likable the dialogue was clever and interesting and the plot had me more than a little 'hooked.'  see what I did there? I was all out ready to praise this movie to high heaven already planning my IMDb review at the half way stage. It got to around 70 minutes into the film and I was thinking wow this film is excellent I REALLY can't figure out who the killer is...By this stage I had long dismissed the two main big suspects as Red Herrings. Then just at the climax of the film I thought Brilliant I get to find out who it is I love films I can't figure out like this...Then the killer was revealed and I was left thinking What....? I mean... WHAT?! What the hell is going on?! I spent the remaining 15 minutes scratching my head wondering why the hell it all suddenly changed from a really good 'whodunnit' slasher flick into a fairly cheesing and disappointing film.WARNING spoilers follow here I would like to know why exactly the director thought I know! Instead of making this so far very good and completely believable film into a fresh relaunch of the franchise I'm going to make the killer a zombiefied demonghostthing instead. Note to the director it's been done.Slasher films with supernatural killers just do not work see Urban Legends Bloody Mary if you don't believe me.In my mind I rewrote the ending into the killer being one of the other girls on the ferris wheel at the beginning because that would have been more believable than what happened. So I gave it a 6 because up until the last 15 minutes or so it really is a very good film just after that it turns into a what the hell did I just watch?  type of film.";

They follow the slasher formula very closely yet they are still entertaining. I was a little skeptical about a direct to video sequel with none of the original surviving characters since it wouldn't be as interesting and the production value would be a lot less. I still gave it a shot and it ended up being very disappointing. I'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer is a lame unscary boring and stupid slasher movie. It offered very little surprises and an awful ending that ruined almost every positive thing the series held.The director and screenwriters kept things simple and formulaic. It actually started off decently with the first thirty minutes being a little entertaining. The pacing was good and none of the characters were that annoying. During the second half things got very tedious and nothing really happened. The story developed slowly and there were a bunch of fake suspense scenes. The last twenty minutes were flat out disappointing. The death scenes were average and forgettable. The suspense was nearly non existent and the special twist was horrible. I hated the way they made the killer super natural since it killed the first two films completely. It was a pointless idea and hopefully there will be no more future sequels.The acting was awful which was expected. I know you shouldn't expect much from direct to video releases but there was no effort at all with the performances. The majority of the actors just sounded like they were reading their lines. Also it was hard to care about the characters since most of them were unlikable and just too underdeveloped to really know. I had trouble remembering all of their names since most of them were indistinguishable to one another. Overall this sequel and I use that word in the loosest sense possible is a messy bore and it's not worth watching. Rating 310".

So why I hear you ask was this third instalment made to make it a trilogy is the answer. The third film is all based around a July 4th prank that goes horribly wrong. four friends agree never to speak the truth about the actual happenings of that day but to cover up. And as predicted as a year passes by they start to die one by one. I liked the way the killer tormented each and everyone of the friends and not just a couple bar the main scream queen. It had suspense the directing was excellent and the acting wasn't second rate as is often associated with this type of horror.Watch it I promise you it is so much better than you think its going to be.".

It's also kind of nice when Brooke Nevin who's played the main character Amber is very resemblance to Sarah Michelle Gellar.In the horror segment there's also some nice gore if you like it. The killing's scenes are some kind brief but are quite effective and the FX is moderately good. As conclusion ILAKWYDLS is not really a bad piece of work.

I liked the story about the two architects who will act as if they are a gay couple just to get that important restoration job. When the businessman also asks Oscar to keep an eye on his mistress believing nothing can go wrong since Oscar is gay things start to go really wrong creating a lot of painful but often funny situations...I guess the fans of the sitcom Friends will love this movie. I know I did and the main reason for that is because Matthew Perry is playing the role he knows best the likable loser who doesn't do much right.

Neve Campbell is also in a role that seem to fit her perfectly playing a sweet while little wild woman.  Dylon McDermott and Oliver Platt are also great in their parts.

Neve Campbell is adorable the kind of spunky kooky girl you wish existed in real life  one of her better roles. If you're a fan of Matthew or Neve you'll love the movie.

Neve Campbell's Amy is vivacious charming sexy and funny. Dylan McDermott does alright as the arrogant boss. Oliver Platt is decent although he does go overboard at times. Unlike other more recent American comedies 'Three To Tango' has a more classy appeal. The background score is very likable. The film is set in the busy city which is beautifully shot. Though it does have its share of toilet humour and overthetop comedy I can safely say it's one of the better American comedies fun enough to watch on a rainy day accompanied by a great background score.".

These credits are James Bondish silhouettes but without tango music a very entertaining sequence in fact but they point to the bits and pieces nature of Three To Tango. It's a film in parts.But some of the parts are downright funny.Matthew Perry Friends plays Oscar an architect who with his gay partner Peter Oliver Platt  Funny Bones are after a contract to build some swank building for slime ball rich guy Charles Dylan McDermott.Charles is two timing his wife with Amy Neve Campbell Scream and thinking that Oscar is gay like Peter Charles asks Oscar to baby sit Amy because he's fearful of Amy running off with an old boyfriend of hers.Of course Oscar and Amy fall in love but Oscar has to pretend he's gay to Amy to keep the contract with Charles and this keeps the laughs rolling.For instance Amy gets to confide with Oscar about the sorts of girly things women apparently share with gay men. He also has to deal with the men now attracted to him because they think he's gay.Hollywood has an uneasy relationship with homosexuality. These days its common to have the comical gay friend or two mincing about in mainstream films As Good As It Gets Beverley Hills Cop and many others.These personalties are added almost strictly for laughs and they are sometimes genuinely amusing but a good dose of homophopia is necessary to really enjoy Three To Tango.Those not inclined to hate those batting for the other side will be a bit under awed by many of the scenes in this film but there's nothing new about that.Still these sorts of movies may well be seen to be an important step in the true coming out of this minority group on the big screen. Judging though by the ill tuned guffaws on air at the screening I attended there's a long way to go as yet.There are often two or three gags going on at once in any case. This film takes the bird shot approach to comedy. Let off a blast of jokes all at once and one or two might hit their target.But still the two central characters Amy and Oscar do develop some credibility which isn't surprising since they're the only ones who aren't vapid stereotypes.That might have been not so easy though. I was often still tempted to imagine death mask hooded Scream murderers lunging out on the shadows with big knives at Neve Campbell. But she has successfully transcended that sort of typecasting in this film.Her hair is cut shorter and she's determinably bubbly very different to the haunted hunted character she plays in the Scream films.Mathew Perry like Campbell is very likeable in what is sometimes an awkward comedy romance with a gay fear subplot.But overwhelmingly Three To Tango is often played strictly for fun. Oscar rushes through a market. Instead of knocking over a fruit cart standard fare for the movies about six live ducks are thrown at him. Huh! But that was different. And funny.".

Oscar doesn't realize why he's been chosen Charles thinks he's gay until it's too late. Of course it's only a matter of time before Oscar and Amy fall in love and chaos ensues.Perry essentially does a rehash of his Chandler persona from Friends which makes Oscar a charming neurotic klutz who makes little headway with women.  Campbell's Amy is energetic as the independent life loving bohemian and her omnipresent grin and boundless optimism light up the screen luckily there's no screaming.  Platt although uncharacteristically subdued is hilarious as always and has some of the best lines in the film. Unfortunately McDermott's portrayal of the selfabsorbed prettyboyDonaldTrumpwannabe is suprisingly lifeless and the only weak link in the film. Tango is not groundbreaking cinema the straightguypretendingtobegay and vices versa routine has surely been done in every medium known to man. Unlike many of its predecessor's however it manages to be amusing without being offensive Oscar doesn't try to act gay   he does not become a mincing effeminate fop with a lisp  rather he conducts himself as he always has. Although humor is the method of delivery the movie manages to honestly convey the difficulty people must face when for whatever reason they are forced to live a lie.  Oscar's coming out speech emphasizes this point and manages to be poignant and educational without being melodramatic. If you're looking for an entertaining date movie that doesn't require a box of Kleenex this movie amply fits the bill.".

Excuse me what were they thinking? It would have been one thing if the character or ANYBODY else in the film brought this mistress lifechoice up or asked her why but it passes unmentioned and accepted as a given to the story.Worse the big coming out speech that is the climax of the film  in which Perry announces that he must be honest come out of the closet and tell his secret...He's not gay! Surprise!  is delivered to an audience of gay professionals who have awarded this fraud with Gay Professional of the Year. Guess what all you people who have been fighting for acceptance and legal rights all your lives this guy's really a breeder a het and he has stolen this honor from you!  What does this audience of thousands of gay people do? Those softies those limpwristers those pansies  they applaud! They give him an ovation! Yeah right. In the real world this would not have been so pretty. And of course after the one token gay guy jumps up to applaud the camera only shows us the other heteros in the audience who are so relieved or disturbed by this news.As a gay woman I can usually step out of myself enough to enjoy any kind of wellmade film including romantic comedies about straight people.

And of course after the one token gay guy jumps up to applaud the camera only shows us the other heteros in the audience who are so relieved or disturbed by this news.As a gay woman I can usually step out of myself enough to enjoy any kind of wellmade film including romantic comedies about straight people.  But this film just annoyed the hell out of me  because it was clear no one really put any thought into it.";

Late in the movie he gets a little too Friendsschtickish for a while but most of his performance is fresh and it's all funny.  Neve Campbell?  I admit I don't really get her.  Sorry but there are dozens of actresses of her generation who could have carried this role off better.  But she's boxoffice so I'm probably wrong about her.It's too bad this film got panned because a lot of people have stayed away from it and missed one heck of a good time.I am going to go back and see it again.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a forgettable film that masquerades as a romantic comedy when it is really a satire on homophobia.  Actually the storyline is quite clever and there are a number of good sight gags but the dialogue is uniformly dreadful and lowbrow.  The writing is hack and sitcomesque which might explain why they loaded this cast with TV actors.We are presented with two architects who are vying for a contract that can revitalize their ailing business with a roguish developer named Charles Newman Dylan McDermot.  Charles is married and having an affair with Amy Neve Campbell but he is jealous and wants to keep tabs on her. Thinking Oscar Matthew Perry is gay and no threat he asks him to spy on her implying that it might help him to get the contract.  The rest is pretty predictable.  They fall in love but she thinks he's gay so there is no hope.  Eventually love prevails no spoiler here noone on the planet could watch this movie and think they wouldn't get together but not before numerous mistaken gender orientation gags run their course.This film was obviously presented from a gay perspective as a satire on homophobia.  All the gay characters are portrayed as respectable admirable and wise while all the straight men are portrayed as rogues misfits and buffoons.  You see skit after skit where homophobia is lampooned.  Women can't confide in a man unless they think he's gay because straight men are just too insensitive to understand.  Gays in the closet are bashed repeated with snide remarks.  This probably explains why this film was more well received by women than men since much the comedy really mocked straight men and their fear of homosexuality.Matthew Perry has made a career out of playing hapless losers with the appeal being that it's funny to see someone who is even more woefully inept than the average viewer.  While I don't find this particularly funny I will give him his due and say that he is a master of the art.  He gets high marks for being able to simultaneously evoke laughter and sympathy over his plight.  Also I found his chemistry good with Campbell and his longing for her was played with a good deal of sincerity and sensitivity.Neve Campbell is really just window dressing here.  Her role is to smile look cute and sexy and play the love interest.  This is not a real stretch for her since she can essential do all those things by just standing there.Dylan McDermot was pretty dreadful as the scoundrel.   In his defense he didn't have much to work with since the way his part was written he was portraying more of a caricature than a character.  It is difficult for an actor to slip into the skin of an absurdity and know exactly how to play it.The best acting in the film came from Oliver Platt who played Oscar Novak's business partner.  He was funny and played an excellent straight man to Perry's clown.  Platt is a veteran and a professional and always brings substance to his supporting roles.This film has its moments but not enough of them.  It is effective social satire and it is mildly successful as a romantic comedy but it bogs down frequently with too many variations on the same gay theme.  Though funny in parts it is generally just silliness.  I rated it a 510.".

His partner is played by the ubiquitous Oliver Platt A Time to Kill Indecent Proposal The Three Musketeers. To make a thin story short Perry and Platt really need the multimillion dollar project they are bidding on. The millionaire who will fund the contract played by Dermot Mulroney needs someone safe to keep an eye on his mistress. Due to a misunderstanding Mulroney thinks Perry is gay actually Platt is gay. Perry is commissioned to be the chaperone who must avoid falling in love with his charge Neve Campbell. He does. So does she. What a mess!And what a mess just about says it all. The only stroke of genius here is in the casting. The two main characters are onedimensional caricatures. Fortunately the casting director was able to find two actors who have become reallife onedimensional caricatures Perry and Campbell. The real tragedy here is that there are some great supporting actors relegated to mindless supporting roles. I usually divide movies into categories see it at the theater wait for the video or wait for it to come on television. This film deserves a whole new categorywait until you find someone that needs to be tortured.The good news is that there is another film playing that while a bit light and predictable is also charming and witty with some great performances. The Story of Us is directed by Rob Reiner When Harry Met Sally A Few Good Men Princess Bride. Bruce Willis and Michelle Pfeiffer play a middleaged couple who have lost that lovin' feeling and don't know what to do about it. The plot line is predictable but there are some great scenes along the way and some witty lines scattered throughout. Rita Wilson has one of the more memorable scenes as she skewers thoughtless males everywhere. There are some wonderful montage sequences with great accompaniment by Eric Clapton.The Story of Us is not great art but it is a timely story told with a wonderfully wry sense of humor and some excellent pacing throughout. Willis and Pfeiffer are at their charming best and it is worth sitting through the entire movie just to see Michelle Pfeiffer's speech at the end of the film. If you are trying to choose between these two films the choice is clear. Reiner's The Story of Us is a solid triple while Three to Tango strikes out with just three pitches.".

	schema:headline " A great familyfriendly sex comedy";
	schema:reviewBody "For some reason when I picked up this movie for 99c on ebay I assumed it would be one of those sexuallycharged mnagetrois genderbender flicks that populated the late 90s like Chasing Amy or even Neve Campbell's own Wild Things. I didn't watch it for that reason I watched it because it was 99c.Much to my surprise and delight Three to Tango is a charming familyfriendly comedy that deals with sexual roles tastefully much like Francis Weber's classic La Cage aux Folles 1978 remade in English as the equally classic Birdcage 1996. Or if you really want to get back to the roots of the mistakensexualidentity sex comedy Willilam Shakespeare's Twelfth Night 1602.It's best to know nothing about the plot that way the twists and turns are more of a hilarious surprise. But yes the story centers around a classic case of mistaken sexual identity and from there the hijinks ensue.What's exceptional about this movie is that it does a great job of reversing roles not just for the individual characters but for society as a whole. A lot like a surreal Franz Kafka story such as Metamorphosis where the main character wakes up to learn that he is a giant cockroach Three to Tango puts the main character into a different identity forcing us to see the world through a different perspective. And much like Kafka's story the comedy lies in the absurdity of people's reactions even though nothing has changed except for their perception of the main character.Yeah that's a lot of heady gobbledygook so let's just talk about the movie already. The overall vibe is a great throwback to those classic  classy Blake Edwards comedies like Breakfast at Tiffany's 1961 or even the Pink Panther flicks. What I mean is that this story is very prim  proper no crass potty humor or cheap shots and yet it's not afraid to sink to few good slapstick moments such as a couples barf scene that's both hilarious and oddly romantic. There are also 1 or 2 totally surreal moments again much like in a Blake Edwards flick such as Matthew Perry panicking and running through the streets of Chicago only to run into a flock of... what's the clich pigeons? Haha not in this case but I'll let you see it for yourself. It's a quick one so pay attention.Also like in a Blake Edwards flick the music is AWESOME. Some very cool old jazz swing and big band numbers are peppered throughout in a way that really punctuates the comedy similar to the great soundtrack of When Harry Met Sally.Let's talk briefly about the acting. Pay close attention to some brilliant nonverbal acting on the part of each character. I'm talking about their complex reactions without any script. As the story untwists each main character has a moment of realization and I felt they all pulled it off very well. Just by looking at their expressions change you know exactly what they are thinking and how the wheels in their minds are spinning. Applause for Neve Campbell Matthew Perry and Dylan McDermott and director Damon Santostefano for giving us these powerful yet subtle performances that aren't necessarily as thunderous as George C. Scott's monologue in Patton but they convey just as much information and emotion to an audience that's paying attention.The script itself is pretty well written not really full of zingers but very natural and believable. Of course with it being Matthew Perry from Friends fame a lot of his delivery is in that deadpan sarcastic Chandler vein with Neve Campbell being the perfect spunky counterpart. Also Oliver Platt and half a dozen other minor characters also did a great job.Definitely catch this movie if you get the chance whether or not you find it for 99c on eBay it's worth your time.".

	onyx:emotionText "For some reason when I picked up this movie for 99c on ebay I assumed it would be one of those sexuallycharged mnagetrois genderbender flicks that populated the late 90s like Chasing Amy or even Neve Campbell's own Wild Things. I didn't watch it for that reason I watched it because it was 99c.Much to my surprise and delight Three to Tango is a charming familyfriendly comedy that deals with sexual roles tastefully much like Francis Weber's classic La Cage aux Folles 1978 remade in English as the equally classic Birdcage 1996. Or if you really want to get back to the roots of the mistakensexualidentity sex comedy Willilam Shakespeare's Twelfth Night 1602.It's best to know nothing about the plot that way the twists and turns are more of a hilarious surprise. But yes the story centers around a classic case of mistaken sexual identity and from there the hijinks ensue.What's exceptional about this movie is that it does a great job of reversing roles not just for the individual characters but for society as a whole. A lot like a surreal Franz Kafka story such as Metamorphosis where the main character wakes up to learn that he is a giant cockroach Three to Tango puts the main character into a different identity forcing us to see the world through a different perspective. And much like Kafka's story the comedy lies in the absurdity of people's reactions even though nothing has changed except for their perception of the main character.Yeah that's a lot of heady gobbledygook so let's just talk about the movie already. The overall vibe is a great throwback to those classic  classy Blake Edwards comedies like Breakfast at Tiffany's 1961 or even the Pink Panther flicks. What I mean is that this story is very prim  proper no crass potty humor or cheap shots and yet it's not afraid to sink to few good slapstick moments such as a couples barf scene that's both hilarious and oddly romantic. There are also 1 or 2 totally surreal moments again much like in a Blake Edwards flick such as Matthew Perry panicking and running through the streets of Chicago only to run into a flock of... what's the clich pigeons? Haha not in this case but I'll let you see it for yourself. It's a quick one so pay attention.Also like in a Blake Edwards flick the music is AWESOME. Some very cool old jazz swing and big band numbers are peppered throughout in a way that really punctuates the comedy similar to the great soundtrack of When Harry Met Sally.Let's talk briefly about the acting. Pay close attention to some brilliant nonverbal acting on the part of each character. I'm talking about their complex reactions without any script. As the story untwists each main character has a moment of realization and I felt they all pulled it off very well. Just by looking at their expressions change you know exactly what they are thinking and how the wheels in their minds are spinning. Applause for Neve Campbell Matthew Perry and Dylan McDermott and director Damon Santostefano for giving us these powerful yet subtle performances that aren't necessarily as thunderous as George C. Scott's monologue in Patton but they convey just as much information and emotion to an audience that's paying attention.The script itself is pretty well written not really full of zingers but very natural and believable. Of course with it being Matthew Perry from Friends fame a lot of his delivery is in that deadpan sarcastic Chandler vein with Neve Campbell being the perfect spunky counterpart. Also Oliver Platt and half a dozen other minor characters also did a great job.Definitely catch this movie if you get the chance whether or not you find it for 99c on eBay it's worth your time.";

The movie comically mostly relies on cheap gay jokes. With handling gay subjects in American movies always feel 10 years behind in time. It doesn't make the story and movie feel like the most original or clever one. The movie does have its fun and humorous moments but its not ever anything too hilarious. Luckily the movie does work better on its romantic levels. In that regard this movie is a pretty enjoyable and sweet one.It's still a well made movie. Seems to me that Damon Santostefano really is not bad director. Things flow well and it makes this movie a rather enjoyable 98 minutes. The movie has the power to make you forget how incredibly formulaic it all is while you're watching it but in the end you'll realize that this movie really isn't the best or most original movie around in its genre. Also the standard bittersweet ending doesn't help much to this.Matthew Perry isn't good enough to carry this movie. It was just too much his Chandler role from Friends all over again. It was as if he wasn't even trying to play a totally different comedy character. A different haircut is simply just not enough. Dylan McDermott on the other hand was simply good in his role and so was Neve Campbell whose career unfortunately seems to go nowhere. But the supporting cast is perhaps even better and more impressive with high caliber actors such as Oliver Platt John C. McGinley Rick Gomez and Bob Balaban though they certainly aren't their best playing comical roles with the exception of John C. McGinley. who is great in basically every kind of role. Too bad his and other roles in the movie are too insignificant.Very well watchable despite being not the best or most original in its genre.610httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

It shows us that film real film that is does not need 100 million to look good rather the combination of a haunting setting in the middle of vastness and the equally haunting beauty of it's star Gong Li but at it's heart the house itself resembles a claustrophobic pot boiling over the surface.This is in my opinion Zhang Yimou's greatest film it is a triumph in film form and narrative. The haunting sounds of flutes a significant visual and audio element that has a mythical quality due to it's importance to Songlian and becomes an unattainable item of the gods when it is removed from existence when it is burned becoming a tragic reminder on the attempts to vanquish the personalities of not only Songlian but all of the concubines. It's slow burning nature may repel the masses but anyone who can get a copy do so without fail you will never regret it. I cannot stress the importance of this film we may see it as a study on the oppression of women in China but this is universal we westerners once did the same thing not too long ago.For me the cinematography is what sells the film it is the best I have ever seen and ever will.

	schema:reviewBody "Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote! Get it at Amazon.Raise the Red Lantern is one of the most extraordinarily beautiful movies I have ever seen. The sets are exquisite tableaux carefully arranged decorated and framed and then shot from an attractive angle. The scene as they drag the third mistress kicking and screaming to the tower of death with the snow falling so peacefully onto the rooftops was chilling in its effect. The startling blaze of color light and detail within the houses set against the drab simplicity of the courtyards continually provided a contrast between life within the protection and at the favor of the master and life without. This dichotomy is symbolized in the vibrant red lamps and the somber blue hue of the lamps when they are covered. In this manner the mistresses are controlled. I was also struck by the sonorous beauty of the accompanying Chinese music.But more compelling than the beauty of the film is the story Director Zhang Yimou tells a tale of paternity and imperious privilege set in early twentieth century China. He begins with the newly arrived fourth mistress 19yearold Songlian a university student who because of the death of her father is forced to quit school. She chooses to marry a man of wealth. She is warned by her stepmother that she will be a concubine. She replies isn't that our fate? Her cynicism and then her robust energy in seeking her ascendancy over the other sisters engages us and we identify with her struggle.What is extraordinary about Zhang's direction is how easily and naturally the personalities of the characters are revealed. The first mistress big sister is too old to be of any sexual interest to the master yet she is the mother of the eldest son. The second mistress who has given the master only a daughter still dreams of having a son. Her devious schemes and plots are hidden by smiles and fake good will toward her sisters. The third mistress an opera singer still vibrant and beautiful in a fascinating performance by the intriguing Caifei He uses her allure in vying for the master's attention. Songlian in spite of herself finds herself caught up in the competition with the others.Gong Li who plays Songlian is very beautiful with a strength of character that one quite naturally admires. She has the gift as does for example Julia Roberts of being able to express a wide range of emotion with just a glance of her very expressive face.Serving as a foil to the mistresses and perhaps as the most poignant victim of the concubine system is the servant girl Yan'er played with a compelling veracity by Kong Lin. She is occasionally how shall I say this for Amazon? touched to use Songlian's term by the master and so she dreamed of being the fourth mistress. But when the fourth mistress arrives her dreams are shattered and in her jealousy she hates Songlian and plots against her. One of the most memorable scenes in the movie is when Songlian thinking Yan'er has stolen her flute forces open the servant girl's room and finds it flooded with.... Well you should see.Note well that the master is only hazily observed. He is a personage a man of wealth. That is enough to know about him. He is as interchangeable as the harem masters on a beach of elephant seals. But because he has wealth he can engage concubines who must compete with one another through him to find their station in life. One gets a sense of what it might be like in the harem system practiced by gorillas and the sheiks and warlords of old. One pleases the master not because one loves the master although one does of course because humans tend to love their masters but because in pleasing the master one rises above the others. Thus the triumphant call Light the lanterns in the third house!Most people no doubt lament the life of the mistresses. Yet women in poor places may wish such a life upon themselves. But concubines are just prostitutes really one might say trapped by a system of male privilege. But I would remind those who see only that that for every wife the master has that is one wife another man will not have. The system does NOT favor males. It favors wealth and privilege. In such a system there are many men without wives fomenting unrest which is why modern states forbid polygamy.What does a man do with the capital he accumulates or inherits? If the system allows he spends it on women and the assurance of his paternity. And why is that possible? Because many womenSonglian is our examplewould rather be the fourth wife of a rich man than the first and only wife of a poor man. Many women would rather be used by a man of wealth than rule the household of a nerd. This is the way humans are and any sexist interpretation of this movie misses this truth.The real horror depicted here though is in the brutality used to maintain the system not in the polygamy itself. The women who follow the rules and beget the master's children especially if they are sons enjoy a pampered and secure existence Those who do not are dealt with severely branded as mad or even murdered. Note the similar experience of the wives of Henry VIII for example within the English system of serial monogamy. This is a great movie like a timeless novel fully realized directed by a visual genius from a script of great psychological power. Don't miss this one. It's one of the best ever made.".

	onyx:emotionText "Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote! Get it at Amazon.Raise the Red Lantern is one of the most extraordinarily beautiful movies I have ever seen. The sets are exquisite tableaux carefully arranged decorated and framed and then shot from an attractive angle. The scene as they drag the third mistress kicking and screaming to the tower of death with the snow falling so peacefully onto the rooftops was chilling in its effect. The startling blaze of color light and detail within the houses set against the drab simplicity of the courtyards continually provided a contrast between life within the protection and at the favor of the master and life without. This dichotomy is symbolized in the vibrant red lamps and the somber blue hue of the lamps when they are covered. In this manner the mistresses are controlled. I was also struck by the sonorous beauty of the accompanying Chinese music.But more compelling than the beauty of the film is the story Director Zhang Yimou tells a tale of paternity and imperious privilege set in early twentieth century China. He begins with the newly arrived fourth mistress 19yearold Songlian a university student who because of the death of her father is forced to quit school. She chooses to marry a man of wealth. She is warned by her stepmother that she will be a concubine. She replies isn't that our fate? Her cynicism and then her robust energy in seeking her ascendancy over the other sisters engages us and we identify with her struggle.What is extraordinary about Zhang's direction is how easily and naturally the personalities of the characters are revealed.

A headstrong woman her relationship with the lord's household especially the other three mistresses form the basis of the story. But it's telling is as important as the story itself.

Perhaps you are unaware that films and books of the period had to tread lightly on topics that were not merely taboo but could result in danger for all connected. Thus a slight symbolic representation often took place. Sort of poetic shorthand. Not unlike Chinese art that may seem to be about the season of autumn but is actually about death or change or loss. Nevertheless any film must stand on its own regardless of the background. This film includes acting scenes that are incredibly forceful and still so gentle. The photography costumes sound and music blend into a cinematic work of art. I found the character completely believable a woman bound in a tradition from which she found no escape except death or madness.

A lot of what makes this film work is Zhang Yimou's outstanding directorial style his use of color against bleak background is especially effective. It's his hypnotic visuals that keep you interested throughout the slow progression of the story. And the amazing acting by most of the performers doesn't hurt either everything feels completely real.I think of this as one of those movies that you aren't supposed to enjoy it shocks you and leaves you just as disturbed as considering the subject matter you should be. The miserable story of Yan'er the servant girl is especially painful to watch and the same goes for the unfolding of the last few scenes.

	schema:reviewBody "Raise the Red Lantern is a haunting study in oriental charm. The beautifully framed shots have a lingering almost hypnotic quality as the household travels through the seasons in an endless journey that is guided by ancestor worship protocol and doing the right thing even when it is bitterly disastrously wrong. The pathos is etched in stark reality upon the face and graceful movements of Li Gong who takes the lead as Songlian the 'Fourth Wife'. One of the most emotive faces upon the cinema screen she delivers an eggshellfine performance that is at the same time hardy robust and wise.The audience never gets to know the human face behind the husband. Maybe there is no face no humanity there. It matters little because this is indeed the only face his four wives and his carefully ordered household ever see. He is indeed their captor not suitor. The ageing male housekeeper maintains the order of the house and in his hands the raising lowering and covering of the red lanterns becomes a symbol that stains the entire film red.This picture needs to be understood to be appreciated. I can imagine that some will be frustrated by the apparent lack of action the apparent lack of characterisation. But this is indeed the film's strength. We share in the pain and frustration of everything always being as it has been yet nothing ever being really as it seems at all. The characters take on the masklike appearance of ghosts except that right in the middle of it all living and breathing human beings are caught stripped of their will and subjugated beautifully their sterile riches suffocating them.In the VHS version I saw the cover notes were very poorly written and misleading hinting at a particular love interest that fortunately I can say is not in the film yet ignoring the symphony of clashing hearts and minds that are central to the wonderfully woven plot. If you have the same 1995 PAL UK widescreen release version that I viewed my advice is read the IMDb summary on the film and don't take the sleeve notes too seriously.Everything about this picture is superb. It is a two hour poem of finely balanced regret and retribution. Be fortified and to really imbibe this at full strength let the narrative disturb and move you. Let the pathos of the images wash over you and be  just a little perhaps  changed forever.".

She drops out of school and becomes the concubine of Master Chen Jingwu Ma a wealthy merchant who welcomes her into his household lavishing her with treatment more luxurious than any she has known. Yet luxury as always comes with a price and the three other mistresses in the master's house Caifei He Cuifen Cao and Jin Shuyuan are less than enthusiastic about the sudden presence of an attractive young rival. To make matters worse Chen decides on a daily basis which of his four concubines will receive his nocturnal patronage. The woman he settles on receives all the services the house has to offer and the women who come up short are summarily forgotten. Consequently the women must jockey for position all vying for the privilege of the titular lanterns lit outside the house of whatever woman is lucky enough to receive the master's company.Raise the Red Lantern  a genuine masterpiece  bears the fruit of the planet's last threestrip Technicolor lab located in Shanghai and you can't so much as glance at the screen without noticing the difference. Lanterns dangle from the eves of the buildings and burn with lavish brilliance. The brightly clad protagonists leap from the backdrop of drabcolored stones. The lights of the houses glisten in the intermittent blizzards of oncoming winter. Every single frame in the entire movie is enough to make the mouth water yet for all its deliciousness it's never the beauty of what we're looking at that holds our attention so much as the ambiguity of that which remains offscreen. We never see the entrance to Master Chen's massive sprawling compound nor do we get a clear idea of its size its layout or its exact population. It appears to have no limits expanding outward to infinity encompassing all of China. Becoming China. Master Chen for his part is something of an enigma. At no point in the film do we get a clear look at his face. He's more concept than creature inseparable from the oppressive rules of his house from the dictums of tradition from Chinese society at large.For China the 1920s was a time of collision between ancient traditions and the rumbling of modernity between entrenched patriarchy and the almost teasing suggestion that women might begin taking stock in their fortunes. The protagonists of Lantern and Songlian in particular bear the brunt of this clash. Caught between the promise of freedom and the reality of servitude they can only find power in the privileges of the house and yet the more they exploit these privileges the more the privileges control them.Yimou goes to great lengths to remind us of this fact jerking us back and forth between long shots and closeups from beginning to end. Long shots create an almost Kubrickean sense of emptiness dwelling on vast impersonal spaces in which characters seem to vanish against their will. Closeups zero in on all the incidental details that make up the daily routine  the foot massages and the preparation of the afternoon meals  all facets of the unassailable dead weight of tradition. Editing the film in this way makes us feel like there's no relief from the prison regardless of our perspective regardless of where we're at in relation to the subject at hand. Even the sound effects begin to feel like wardens. The clack of the foot massage the eerie rush of the lanterns getting blown out in the morning the periodic voice of the compound crier announcing where the lanterns are to be lit and who will receive the privileges that go with it . . . all of it creates an incessant sense of continuum. An unbroken cycle. A pursuer that never gets tired.I could go on and on with my praise but doing so would be insult to the strength of Yimou's storytelling. Watch it love it and ask yourself why the devil they don't make movies like this all the time.".

This doesn't always produce great films but when the director is inherently cinematic it often evokes something deep in the viewer. There is nothing in the world like looking on the face  the person  you are centered on. A million subtle decisions are made in each scene summing to an effect that cannot be missed. If this had poor narrative qualities and some of their films did it would still have this quality of seeing into a soulmate deeply enough to be able to animate the skin.Its quite interesting when you consider the woman. If you see her outside of film or in films made by ordinary eyes she is quite ordinary. She has an atypical Chinese body busty and widehipped. She is poised but doesn't have the neck or cheekboned face of other Asian women. Only under this man's eye is she a goddess. You can see this in the very first shot.The second thing you can count on is the architectural anchoring of the thing. This man knows how to use space. He uses it in the cinematic narrative for example if you replay the shots where the house of death is shown and then the last encounter with it... And if you understand why the decisions about handling distance and surfaces were made they way they were you will have entered a zone where from now on you will not be able to reason without reasoning with place.But there are other handlings of space As with some of his other films the building is a character. Its the noir narrator who sets the rules  often arbitrary  under which all characters are bound to operate and which drives the narrative. Its a particularly western notion this and has gotten our hero in trouble even banned. This part is following Welles and Kubrick. But he goes further than either of them with this notion that the light both has agency of its own it selects which of the four wives gets a foot massage and sex and is a part of the fabric of the buildings. The redness changes the spaces it occupies bringing intrigue with the sex desire for several things. Its quite layered what is going on. These lanterns are the real master in fact the person who inhabits the master's body is hardly even there. We never see his face.Because of the extensive use of hard planes and selfish light there aren't many fabric effects here as we'll see elsewhere.I am tempted to designate this as one of my two allowed must see before you die films of 1991.

	schema:reviewBody "It's been days since I've watched the movie and it still seems as though I'm haunted by it. A movie is yet to make the same impression on me. Yes movies exist that cause frightening images every time you close your eyes but they're mainly either based on gruesome scenes of blood and torture or involve ghosts and other somewhat fictional characters. Well the director of Raise the Red Lantern required neither the work in my opinion of a great artist and scholar of humankind and the human mind. From what we mainly know only ghosts haunt the human world but what if we were to imagine that death is not necessary and that instead our own selves can haunt the present even alive. What if through human suffering rivalry jealousy and the imprisonment of the mind we can destroy our souls and spirits. And what if even worse it is not other ghosts or evil spirits that cause this but our fellow human beings. I believe this is the reason why Raise the Red Lantern finds a small place deep inside its' viewers it speaks of the horrifying effects of humankind that each one of us can be affected by  of death during life. Songlian only nineteen years of age used to attend a University in China in the 1920's all until her fate took a fatal turn leaving her in the mansion of a wealthy man never to know the outside world again. This mansion does bring its luxuries foot massages a private room your own faithful servant and somewhat of a husband  all until your servant becomes jealous of you you rival with the Master's three other mistresses and possibly countless others to come and best of all most of these luxuries are only provided so that you could better entertain and care for the Master including bearing children for him. Once the women's' dreams are lost what remains?  a need for passion and attention is something that each of the women rival for and which some would be willing to do anything for whether or not it be humane. Jealousy is strong and deception all the more so the characters' lives are all intertwined and every action can cause a chain reaction leading to the degradation of the human spirit and mind. What amazed me most about the director's work is the use of color to depict emotion and the techniques used to create tension fear struggle and a distinct message and point of view without ever having to show us the crime being committed. Every season throughout the story and every character personality and emotion is linked to color. The various use of color tinting demonstrating sunrise and sunset light emitted by the red lantern in its different shading and position the symbolism behind the red lantern and the women's condition within the mansion and the draping in black curtains of Songlian's lanterns when she has committed a crime against tradition are both visually stunning and extremely effective in creating the mood of the time. Each woman's room fits hand in hand with their personality the opera singers Meishan's elaborate and bright coloring as opposed to the First Mistress' dark old wood furniture and darker clothing. And lastly what I have seen few directors do Zhang Yimou shows us less to make us feel more scenes of torture and crimes in many instances we are not shown them or the faces instead we only view them from the perspective of one of the characters. The use of sound and long camera shots allows us to embody the characters and experience the story all the more and because each of the four actresses dove deeply into the character of the women this experience is truly amazing.".

	onyx:emotionText "It's been days since I've watched the movie and it still seems as though I'm haunted by it. A movie is yet to make the same impression on me. Yes movies exist that cause frightening images every time you close your eyes but they're mainly either based on gruesome scenes of blood and torture or involve ghosts and other somewhat fictional characters. Well the director of Raise the Red Lantern required neither the work in my opinion of a great artist and scholar of humankind and the human mind. From what we mainly know only ghosts haunt the human world but what if we were to imagine that death is not necessary and that instead our own selves can haunt the present even alive. What if through human suffering rivalry jealousy and the imprisonment of the mind we can destroy our souls and spirits. And what if even worse it is not other ghosts or evil spirits that cause this but our fellow human beings. I believe this is the reason why Raise the Red Lantern finds a small place deep inside its' viewers it speaks of the horrifying effects of humankind that each one of us can be affected by  of death during life.

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERSSet in 1920's China RTRL begins wa closeup of 19 yr old former student Songlian Gong Li as she tells her mother of her intention to marry a rich man. Songlian has had to quit college as her father has died and the family can no longer afford tuition. Her mother warns her that to marry into wealth is to become a concubine to which Songlian replies bitterly cynically Is that not our fate? Li has kept her face impassive during this scene then just before it closes a single tear slowly emerges from each eye dropping one after the other. It's a beautiful piece of extraordinarily controlled acting.This scene sets much of the style of the rest of the film as well as introducing the predominant theme of women's subservient almost invisible role in that society. The mother is never seen the camera stays static on Songlian just as she is at the center of rest of the movie. Li is in almost every scene everything happens from Songlian's pov and in those few sequences in which she is not on screen the action is influenced by her character and they almost might be occurring just as she would imagine them.The opening also sets the emotional tone of the movie. RTRL reminded me somewhat of Scorcese's The Age of Innocence in that both are about deeply repressed minisocieties built on social classes. The characters rarely express themselves directly or honestly everything is below the surface and tensions run deep. Periodically emotions and conflicts boil over to the surface and are quickly repressed again wo resolution. In this way the tension builds and builds wo any substantive release.I won't go into the plot much it's fairly simple Songlian lives in a bizarre world the fourth mistress the newest and youngest to the master of the household she joins. There are 3 other mistresses each progressively older each receiving less and less attention from the master as they age. The plot is essentially about how the mistresses vie for their master's attention while they attempt to outmanipulate each other for that precious recognition.RTRL has complex themes but I think the film is mainly about the emptiness and pointlessness of these women's lives in a society that sees them as having no worth and how they destroy themselves and each other because of their insecurities and lack of selfrespect in an attempt to achieve what they regard as some kind of selfworth. At one point Songlian refers to them all as living ghosts. The women scheme and play petty games to oneup one another they humiliate and degrade themselves and each other all in an effort to be the Queen of their little world a world no one cares anything about except themselves. The master couldn't care less he laments that the women can't get along but he plays them one against the other and they all go along wit even though they know they're being manipulated and degraded.The women do not see themselves as having any significance on their own it is only when the master lights the lantern in their house when he favors them as sexual partners that they become in any way of value in their own eyes and in the eyes of each other and the rest of the household. The master has an ongoing affair wthe servant Yan'er who had hoped to become the 4th mistress. When Songlian barges into Yan'er's room she finds it full of red lanterns a travesty that breaks the tradition of the household. Yan'er imagines herself a mistress and this gives her selfworth but of course it's false just a fantasy. Yet her fantasy is just as real and meaningful as the actual mistresses wthe actual red lanterns  which is to say it has no real meaning at all.In the microcosm that is the society of RTRL women are barely acknowledged as human beings they are sex toys and baby vessels. The mistress that has a son gains stature while the one who has a worthless girl is ashamed and humiliated by it. At the end of the film in a scene of chilling beauty set against the falling snow on the rooftops of the estate the 3rd mistress is taken away and murdered. Nothing comes of it no one seems to really notice or acknowledges it even happened. It's as if they had disposed of some garbage. Except to Songlian. In an act of rebellious despair Songlian lights the lanterns in the house of the 3rd mistress and plays a record of her singing opera. It is as if to say She was here. She was a person. She had worth. In a final great irony the rest of the household thinks it is the ghost of the 3rd mistress singing and lighting the lanterns. Such are the lives of women in the world of RTRL Ghosts in death as they are ghosts in life.In the end Songlian sinks into desperation and depression so deep that she is incapacitated regarded as mad by the rest of the household. In the final shot she wanders aimlessly among the red lanterns around her courtyard a trapped and helpless spirit in a world where she feels she might as well not even exist.Harold".

The story while not traditional to Western culture works well to keep the viewer guessing at what will come next in the story. Clearly Li Gong shines in her beauty her acting ability and her magnetic appeal on the silver screen. The cast is well assembled and each perform their character roles with perfection. The set and scenery is opulent in design and yet suggestive as to how a rich man of the 1920s might live during those times. You should try to rent this film from a video store or purchase a copy of a VCR or DVD if available.Folks who like foreign films must make this outstanding film a viewing priority. If you are just wanting to experience a foreign film of Asian vintage than this is one to consider. It is not your standard martial arts fantasy film. Raise the Red Lantern has a real story and real acting to match.I really like this film!".

	schema:reviewBody "RAISE THE RED LANTERN is a family drama about Songlian a 19yearold Chinese woman who chooses to become the fourth wife of a rich magnate.  The four wives then betray and backstab each other as each seeks to dominate the others.  The servants too become pawns in their game.Though undeniably well made this is a hard film to like.  An oppressive air of joylessness weighs it down from first to last.  Songlian enters her husband's mansion in the second scene and not a single shot thereafter strays from this prison masquerading as a home where there is no color except for the red lanterns that signify the master's choice of which wife he will sleep with tonight.  We hardly ever see sunlight only grayness. Full marks for the cinematic craftsmanship but the technical expertise doesn't make it any less depressing.  One feels that happiness in this place would be an offense punishable by death and eventually that proves to be true.  The wives compete with each other for a prize that is not worth the winning the attentions of a man whom they do not love and who does not love them.It is tough to like the characters who like neither themselves nor each other.  If Songlian were a sympathetic person the tragedy would be more powerful but she has a vicious streak a mile wide her goal is to climb above everybody else and then wipe her feet on them.  Much is made of the fact that Songlian has attended a university but her education has not helped her achieve any independence of mind nor has it even liberated her from superstition.  And what are we to make of her tearful rage when she discovers her husband groping the maid?  Songlian knew before she ever married the man that she was sharing him with three other women so this is not sexual jealousy she is showing but resentment of a social inferior trespassing on ground reserved for her betters.Of the four wives only Meishan the third appears capable of forming a real friendship but we see it only rarely and from afar toward the other wives she is as catty and nasty as the rest.  As for the master he is a nonentity a walking libido too shallow even to bother  hating.  The character I found myself rooting for the most was the servant girl Yan'er who is just as nasty as any of the others but is the only one to show any real defiance any willingness to fight against the restrictions the house places on her.The clearly redeeming feature of RAISE THE RED LANTERN is Gong Li's performance as Songlian she plays her character to the hilt with amazing verisimilitude.  The writing may not allow her to win much sympathy but you cannot avoid the feeling that this is woman however awful is a real person with real feelings.Oddly the subtitles constantly refer to the four wives as Mistress' and the IMDB credits them as concubines.'  However it appears that they are indeed wives each married to the master the Mandarin word used is taitai' which means wife.I think that Zhang Yimou meant this movie as a denunciation of polygamy.  It succeeds in this never have I seen polygamy look less attractive for everyone involved.  On the other hand with characters like these you could paint a pretty unappetizing picture of monogamy too.Rating  out of .Recommendation  Casual moviegoers should skip this one hardcore cinephiles should not miss Gong Li's amazing work.".

	schema:reviewBody "Think of this film as an old school Girls at the Playboy Mansion on crack.I love this movie so hard. Songlian played by Li Gong is my heroine. Not the I wannainjectyouandlistentojazz heroin but a sad and lonely victim of circumstance rebelling against her fate.The opening scene is Songlian's face worthy of any Miss China pageant as a single tear rolls down her cheek she coldly states Become a concubine  isn't that a woman's fate? Yeah it's gonna be bleak.Each night the elusive Master will choose 1 of 4 mistresses to bunk with and a flourish of red lanterns are lit outside mistress numero uno's house  enough lanterns to be seen from orbit. Why? As this is tradition. The chosen concubine is served her favourite dish that night. As is tradition. The mistress will receive a strange foot massage. As is tradition. She will be bed by the master and lavished with his attention. As is tradition. Surely as Songlian is Master's newest object of affection he should favour her yet there are petty forces working against her bitchier than your worst enemy from high school. Each mistress has manipulative ways in which they try to woo to the master. Because they love him? Not even. Akin to Stockholm Syndrome a phenomenon manifests and the isolation and loneliness drives them to jealously compete and be top dawg of the intimate hierarchy. One scene that struck me was when Songlian encountered a Pavlov's Dog effect  her feet ache and itch craving a foot massage when Master chooses to stay with another. Fate is a harsh mistress more harsh than the ones who inhabit the four houses of this movie. Born a woman our heroine has been dealt a bad Mahjong hand but will try to play it best she can. The film is one of contrast and ridicules archaic rituals and traditions yet depicts them with mesmerising aesthetic elegance. It's a masterful piece of work and will haunt you after the end credits have rolled. Moral of the film Trust no bitch.".

One scene that struck me was when Songlian encountered a Pavlov's Dog effect  her feet ache and itch craving a foot massage when Master chooses to stay with another. Fate is a harsh mistress more harsh than the ones who inhabit the four houses of this movie. Born a woman our heroine has been dealt a bad Mahjong hand but will try to play it best she can. The film is one of contrast and ridicules archaic rituals and traditions yet depicts them with mesmerising aesthetic elegance. It's a masterful piece of work and will haunt you after the end credits have rolled. Moral of the film Trust no bitch.";

	schema:reviewBody "I was dying to see this film after seeing many of Gong Li's works such as Ju Dou and recent films such as Curse of the Golden Flower and Memoirs.I was thinking to myself a movie about a guy who has four wives  how could this be interesting? Well quite simply it's interesting due to the battle you see between the wives who are subtly plotting against one another to gain the upper hand in status and also self respect for a guy whom they don't love but feel that he is the only one who can provide it for them.There is a sense of claustrophobia in the film as our main character Songlian Gong Li at first starts to think this new life as a concubine is quite glamorous until she starts to see the reality of the concubines situation. The shots of the complex they live in almost gives a sense of isolation from the rest of the world and that they are confined in their homes to serve their one and only master the husband they all share.The title refers to the fact that lanterns are raised at one of the concubines' houses if the master chooses to spend the night with the one with whom he chooses. You see the four concubines waiting to hear the daily announcement before they sleep as to whom will have the pleasure of spending the night with the master.Zhang Yimou's films often have a message which can be interpreted in different ways. Some see this film as a criticism of the Chinese Government in that it represents 'the master' 'loyal followers' and those who break the rules end up suffering for it. But if you see it differently it is more about the repression of women in China and how their only way to gain self worth in these situations is through their husband who has full control. In a sense the women in this film are treated like as Songlian says as a 'robe' that the Master can wear and take off anytime he likes. Songlian struggles to obey all the rules but also tries to play the political game in order to gain the master's attention.With its simple yet very well told story with a terrific performance by Gong Li and the rest of the cast it definitely is worth the watch. Highly recommended.".

	schema:headline " Psychological thriller about 1920's Concubine life in China.";
	schema:reviewBody "The film powerfully portrays the life of Songlian Gong Li as she becomes the Fourth Wife to Chen a wealthy landowner in 1920's China. The main plot focuses on the complex duties and privileges of the four wives in relation to each other and their master. Each wife lives in her own house adjacent to each other. Each night they are obliged to stand in front of their respective houses and wait for the arrival of the red lantern. It is a signal from their master with whom he will sleep that night. This scenario expectedly invites a constant and intriguing development of plots subplots and alliances among the wives in their attempt to gain their masters favor. In the end this dynamic escalates with the severest consequences for all. In this film Zhang Yimou visually introduced me to Concubine life in the household of a 1920's wealthy landowner. There I observed interior struggles of the Fourth Wife in ways comparable with the character development captured in films by Merchant  Ivory. From the opening scene to the very last frame I was mesmerized by the strong acting of all the cast but most especially with Gong Li. I was impressed by her abilities in Memoirs of a Geisha but Raise the Red Lantern offered her a bigger stage to present the wide range of her acting abilities.There Gong Li presented a character who at times commanded presence and selfassuredness as she struggled to untangle the complexities of the duties and customs of a concubine in their master's household. Yet in the end her fall from favor and her ultimate downfall was precipitated by her contrasting lack of selfcontrol.I am pleased to have spent the time viewing this film. I would like to encourage those who enjoy great acting and a powerful story to do the same.".

RAISE THE RED LANTERN is one of the latter for me.  It's one of the best foreign films I think I'll probably ever see.As an American with very little background in 1920s China I was immediately immersed in the totally new setting.  The devious characters and surprisingly slippery plot soon similarly captured my imagination.  Almost entirely a oneset production RAISE THE RED LANTERN's claustrophobia is appropriate to the similarly stifled life of the protagonist.  The characterizations of the four mistress rivals are all fascinating and disarming none of these women are quite what they appear to be but they are all consistent.  Fascinating to watch the strange camraderie between the four rivals for their master's affections is a testament to their isolation and loneliness which their master seems to rely on.  Obviously the social politics of marriage and the sexes aren't very different anywhere in the world though some of the Chinese customs might appear to be. I don't want to spoil any of the surprises so I'll close by saying that this film is accessible for anyone.  Although it does have the seeming liabilities of being a costumed period piece subtitled and ostensibly a chick flick given it's clearly femaleskewed POV this is still surprisingly mainstream especially if you have any interest in a culture outside your own.  Even if you're not interested in broadening your horizons I suspect it will be of value for the light it sheds on the way women think.  Deeply moving and thoughtprovoking RAISE THE RED LANTERN is an eyeopener.  It doesn't always make you feel warm inside but you will feel something and it will be real.  10  10.".

One of the most powerful elements is that you do feel pity for the protagonist even after her petulant and vindictive behavior. The title of the movie appeared very odd to me. Probably the most apt title of any film as the weary rituals of the ancient household form more and more meaning. The symbolism of raising the red lantern is the soul of the picture. It represents the total power of the polygamist over his harem. Spoiler One of the most interesting displays of this dichotomy between the power of the men and women that the man is having an affair. But when discovered nothing happens. He is already legitimately sleeping with 4 women. When wife number three is caught the penalty is death. I also loved the little power the women enjoyed whomever has the lantern may set the menu. Our protagonist decides that what is happening is beneath humanity and would rather die than be part of it.The film feels slow burning but the intensity builds and builds as layers are added to the plot and each character. For a fan of foreign cinema unmissable.".

'Road Warrior' 'Baron Munchausen'  and manages to flow smoothly as well.The story is too clever.  America is overrun and then largely abandoned by Russia 40 years ago.  The last outpost of the American dream is Lost Vegas where Elvis rules as king.  Upon his death a lone modernday samurai warrior with a guitar Falcon heads for Vegas to beat out other wannabes to the vacant throne.  He hacks slices punches and kicks his way through every insane nuclear holocaust survivor who stands in his way all the while with a feral orphan boy in tow.There is not a dull moment in 'SixString Samurai' thanks to the offthewall script and Jeffrey Falcon's acting and fighting.  I was very surprised to find out that he hasn't done anything else since.  This movie was incredible for an otherwise unknown martial arts bit actor who also wrote the script and coordinated all the fighting.It would be cool if there was a sequel or better yet a prequel to 'SixString'.  I for one would love to see a movie about King Elvis in Lost Vegas.910.  Very highly recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I saw this movie at in the rental section I assumed it would be a ripoff of EL MARIACHI or DESPERADO.  I rented it out of curiosity and found that I was mistaken.  This film is quite original and a little bizarre but it is definitely the kind of independent movie that is worth seeing.The budget is low the costumes and special effects are sparse and some of the sound is nonsynchronous.  But this is all made up for with a story and directorial style that lends itself to camp.  The stylization of this movie is definitely what makes it worth seeing.  It is kind of an overthetop martialarts rock and roll postapocolyptic odessyadventure.I enjoyed the flow of the story which breaks down like this  The hero is traveling across the desert to the postapocolyptic city of Lost Vegas to vai for his right as king.  Along the way he is tested by other wouldbekings with the same goal in mind.  This allows for constant samurai style actionfight scenes.  But the story is compounded by the jugernaught he must inevitably face which is manifested by his ultimate competition a Death Metal Band lead by Death himself.  The story is smart allowing each fight scene to develop the characters.  We see Buddy the hero to be a supreme loanwolf type fighter.  And Death stalking close behind is ruthless and hard to beat.  This sets the stage for their eventual conflict. The first conflict they have is ended permaturely by outside influence which furthers the story by creating a score to settle in the final fight scene.  I prefer when movies take the time to set up this kind of conflict. Rather than just throwing a good guy up against a bad guy and having one big fight scene we get learn about the characters and the story.  Business is left unfinished which allows the audience to anticipate the climax. This adds suspense to the story and draws the audience in to the movie.  The movie has a very good Second Act which throws the main characters in to great peril with the bad guy's having all the advantages.  This is then resolved with a great third act finding clever resolution.  Very good story telling.The movie is totally over the top and wierd but the story is fairly concise and exciting.  The circumstances are totally bizarre but the director creates a world that is enigmatic and yet consistent.  I would say this movie is kind of a Mad Max in Wonderland.  It is not your standard Hollywood tale which of course made me like it even more.  Not to mention the entire movie is action packed.I highly recommend this movie to anyone seeking an original action movie but on a critical level just to be fair I will list the few problems that I found  I think the fight scenes could have used a little more choreographing.  It looked like budget constraints were limiting the number of takes they could do and they were making up for actual precision work with simple slow motion and tricky camera angles.  Falcon appears to be fairly well trained in Wu Shu the standardized style of Chinese Kung Fu but he is no Jet Li...nor Zhuang Hui for that matter.  It looked like he could use just a little more practice I don't think he nailed that Butterfly Flat Spin in the sand dunes fight scene with the Death Archers. However he is good enough to be quite convincing and he was genuinely a lot of fun to watch.  The fight scenes still managed to be quite exciting and again I highly recomend this movie.  Especially to anyone looking for a good independent movie.  In my opinion there really are not that many independent action movies that are worth seeing.  The TROMA team tries to make action movies and they pretty much all stink.  Don't think that SIXSTRING SAMURAI is another MR. KABUKI MAN NYPD.  Buddy would kick the crap out of Mr. Kabukki Man!I rated this film a 7 out of 10 on the IMDB.  Go rent it and let your mind get a little bent.  Its really pretty clever.".

I loved the too short segment involving the windmill god himself.  But what was with that kid who kept saying Tag! You're It!  To get all the nuances of the film you probably have to be an anime hong kong mad max Sergio Leone junkie.  I liked the fact that the movie was bloodless.

The film also has a lot of heart.  It never compromises its integrity for trying to make a popcorn movie.  It's so fun fillled and free spirited which is rare in movies today.

Costumes and scenery are not that great either except for Death's and Buddy's. But as the movie goes along I discovered that the quality of camera movement and editing was high and that the story actually was full of references not present in a poor written story. So there is one conclusion to draw this is a low budget bmovie that tries to be just that and nothing else. And it succeeds brilliantly. The story and acting still peculiar is actually entertaining and Buddy is a great character. The kid is annoying sometimes unfortunately but I thought that it got better as the movie went along. In the end I was very happy I had rented and seen this movie...710".

So there is one conclusion to draw this is a low budget bmovie that tries to be just that and nothing else. And it succeeds brilliantly. The story and acting still peculiar is actually entertaining and Buddy is a great character. The kid is annoying sometimes unfortunately but I thought that it got better as the movie went along. In the end I was very happy I had rented and seen this movie...710";

'El Topo' 'Eraserhead' and 'Repo Man' for example. As profoundly odd as those movies are they feel natural to me not contrived attempts at making a cult movie ala Troma. I don't like Troma's output much and can think of very few of those kind of self consciously quirky movies that I actually like 'The Adventures Of Buckaroo Banzai' is one 'Killer Klowns From Outer Space' is another. 'SixString Samurai' for me is closer to the contrived Troma approach than the naturally strange Russ MeyerCoen brothers one. It's the kind of movie that is more fun to describe to someone else than to actually sit through yourself. Now it isn't a complete failure far from it. I did enjoy parts of it a lot but it kinda dragged on and for me just didn't live up to its potential. The initial premise was good but the script needed a lot more work. As it stands it would have made a neat 5060 minute short. Jeffrey Falcon plays Buddy a guitar slingin' samurai who is on a journey to Lost Vegas to become the new King of rock'n'roll. In this America you see  the Russians took over after they dropped the Bomb in the 50s. Buddy encounters lots of oddballs along the way reluctantly looks after The Kid Justin McGuire  and ends up having a showdown with Death Stephane Gauger. 'SixString Samurai' deliberately echoes 'El Mariachi' 'Mad Max 2' and the Lone Wolf and Cub series but never reaches the heights of its inspirations.  I always like to encourage low budget film makers trying to push the envelope. 'SixString Samurai' doesn't quite do it for me but I hope Lance Mungia and Jeffrey Falcon continue to make movies.

	schema:reviewBody "A postapocalyptic spaghetti western rocknroll Samurai film? Yep. That pretty much sums up SIX STRING SAMURAI. It's quirky. It's Bmovie all the way. It's wonderful.What we have here is a film shot on weekends on a minuscule budget in and around Death Valley California. It also pays homage to many films every Clint Eastwood spaghetti western ever made Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome Night of the Living Dead and of course The Wizard of Oz just to name a few.The movie was dubbed giving it a hokey spaghetti western feel that matched the production values perfectly very low. The Kid in the film was a complete carboncopy of the mangy little guy that follows Mel Gibson around in Beyond Thunderdome. There's a family of cannibals and The Windmillers who represent the slow brain functions from Night of the Living Dead. And then there are the multiple references to The Wizard of Oz Just follow the yellow brick road.The story's focus is on Buddy Jeffrey Falcon a six string carrying Samurai sword wielding bad ass who wants to be the new King of Lost Vegas. But first he has to get there. Traveling across the desert wasteland of the postapocalyptic world Buddy who looks remarkably like Buddy Holly has to slash punch and scratch his way toward The Emerald City another Wizard of Oz reference that we see Lost Vegas looking very much like the gateway to Oz's hometown. Along the way Buddy picks up The Kid a young boy who's mother was killed by humans resembling troglodytes. The Kid doesn't speak initially and only screamsmoans whenever he wants Buddy's attention. But The Kid is good with mechanical objects cars motorcycles bicycles and the two form a grudging relationship as they travel together. The only issue between them is Buddy's priceless guitar which he nurtures more than The Kid ...in the beginning. But Buddy can play his six string as potently as he can don his sword giving him a good shot at becoming the King of Lost Vegas.On Buddy and The Kids' tail however is Death represented as the four horseman of the apocalypse ...but without their horses. Death wants to beremain the King and kills anyone who gets in his way leaving a lot of rocknroll wannabes as corpses. And in front of Buddy and The Kid is the Russian Army Oh! Did I forget to mention that the USSR took over the U.S. after it nuked us in 1957? After much bloodletting Death and Buddy have their day on the sand. First comes a guitar duel Death wields a wickedly good six string himself! then the sword. But what will happen if Buddy wins? Can he be a true fatherfigure to The Kid? And what would happen to The Kid if Buddy died? Would Death take the little tike too? There are A LOT of well choreographed fight sequences perhaps one or two too many. The camera work was done with an eye toward professionalism never being herkyjerky or under over exposed. The acting was okay. And the story was so ridiculous that suspending disbelief was quite fun. The dialogue often set the tone for the entire production giving us some great bits like...Death You have failed me for the last...hey nice shoes. Then we watch Death kill the men wearing the shoes and walk away with new footwear.The musical score is also pulled off well. The Red Elvises leant their music and themselves for the production they are the ones with the nice shoes mentioned above. Their musical numbers reminded me very much of The Stray Cats a band I liked.If you don't mind low production standards but enjoy spoofs with a good if somewhat ridiculous script then slip this little Bflick into your DVD player and bask in its foolishness. You won't be disappointed.".

It's just absolutely indescribable there are two groups of people in this world those who have beheld the awesomeness of this movie and those who think the first group is just weird. If you don't think it's awesome then obviously you haven't beheld it and are therefore in the latter group. Buddy Holly is a samuraisword wielding kungfufighting guitarpicking hero making his way across a postapocalyptic desert in order to become the new King of Lost Vegas. He's pursued by Death who looks like a combination of Rob Zombie and Slash from Guns N' Roses. The fight scenes are awesome and have an amazing soundtrack to them and the dueling guitars scene near the end is one of the coolest confrontations ever. I can't gush about this movie enough. If I could give it a higher rating than a 10 I would.".

I would also like to add that the city was also an obvious back drop such as used by the big Hollywood studios of that era.

	schema:reviewBody "Simone Pascale Bussires is a young Canadian fashion model who is on the brink of a brilliant career. But this bright future could be thwarted due to a serious car accident of which she miraculously survives. In the aftermath she decides to put an end to her professional life and becomes obsessed with the idea to have a baby. So she persuades her best friend Philippe Alexis Martin to act with and for her and the latter accepts provided they do it in the desert. A few days later they are in this silent eerie place...Un 32 Aot Sur Terre is a curious work that will puzzle a good proportion of viewers. It reminded me a lot of Twentynine Palms 2003 by Bruno Dumont although this film is posterior to Denis Villeneuve's film. This was also a film set in an ominous desert place and in which evolved two tortured characters. They had wild sex there and they were surrounded by an unforgiving humanity. In a way humanity isn't also very gentle to Simone and Philippe in this film the taxi driver jettisons them in the desert Alexis is bludgeoned by a gang of ruffians.Simone's demeanor leaves the ground open for many interpretations is it because she came close to death that she wants to have a baby? Does she want to discover a new way of life? And if so where does it lead her? Apart from other many questions that will rise in the viewer's mind Villeneuve deftly uses the desert landscapes to create majestic entrancing images. It's even a sort of in camera that the director manages to create. A sensation that will come again later when the two friends are in the cramped hotel room. The sense of fantastic is palpable throughout the film from this car accident to these extra days in August that don't exist to this irrational sequence during which the gang beat Philippe to death. In the end Villeneuve shrouds his film with a philosophical dimension revolving around life and death.In Philippe's house there's a cover depicting Jean Seberg who saw her career taking off thanks to JeanLuc God Ard's A Bout De Souffl 1959. Godard's detractors blame him for his intellectual pretensions which clutter his works. Many viewers will also deem this work as highbrow and elusive for understandable reasons. Keep it for a day during which you are prone to reflection and thought as it's not a work for the mainstream. And for French viewers beware! As Quebec people speak with a very pronounced accent it's sometimes difficult to decipher their words".

I guess that's what they mean by atmospheric as used in describing a film.The cinematography was superb  the part where the two lead characters ended up in the Utah salt desert was just so awesome. The acting was seamless though I was handicapped by seeing it with English subtitles since I don't know French I fear that a good bit of the emotive force of the story as told through the dialogue was lost on me.Anyway I am so glad I taped this off of late night Canadian television I definitely plan to watch it again.

Fong Sai Yuk played by Hsiou Hou is the main character and occupies most of the screen time. Fong Sai Yuk is portrayed as a brash young super fighter who can't stop getting into fights. He's a bragging annoying character whose sole redeeming quality is that he can back up his boasts.One of the last Shaw films before they shut down the studio the film is set bound and looks like it could have been done ten years earlier. The plot is just decent with a back story that is slightly unexplained. The actors all do a good job. The music is very canned. The highlight is the fighting and there's plenty of it. A moderate amount of wirefu doesn't detract from some excellent choreography. Liu Chia Liang really got into mass fight scenes towards the end of his time at the Shaw Bros. The final scene at the governor's palace is a small masterpiece of mass fighting.A good kung fu film.".

I guess some of you will come to think of Jet Li now which is right this movie is about the same guy as Jet Li plays but with one major different thing. It isn't Jet Li that plays Fong Sai Yuk its the fantastic actor Hou Hsiao which I must say kick Jet Li's butt in most areas. Hou Hsiao would probably win the vote for best underrated martial artist of all time. You have to see this guy move to believe it! Amazing!This movie has everything a good martial arts movie shall have. Exciting fights good acting and its fun moments as well.I guess this film is one of the best Shaw brothers movies I've seen in my life. And as even Gordon Liu is in this movie its almost written success all over the title. And now when its digitally restored on DVD Deltamac or IVL release it is just even better.Fong Sai Yuk is the utterly incorrigible young troublemaker who is nearly invincible due to his martial arts abilities. His parents and teachers can't discipline him and he continually gets into trouble until one day he messes with the wrong people and the local rulers decree that he be decapitated. Devastated his parents secretly send him and his brothers to the 36th Chamber of Shaolin Temple to avoid the beheading and his mother selflessly agrees to face the consequences of her son's actions.Once in Shaolin Temple monk San Te works played but Gordon Liu to exhaust the young boy into submission. However Sai Yuk handles his training regimen easily and has plenty of energy to spare for his various dirty deeds. Sai Yuk gathers his fellow students in attempts to sneak out of the temple. On his night out he visits the governor's estate to witness the lantern festival where he gets into more trouble and earns the wrath of the governor himself. It's not long before the governor begins to plan an elaborate plot to bring down Sai Yuk and all of Shaolin's students with him!".

And Lily Li is always good. But I HATED the main character of Fang Shiyu. I get that a lot of these movies had that wild uncontrollable disobedient young hero but this one went too far and I was actively rooting for his death. I'm not going to say this was actor Hou Hsiao's fault. Good lord was he a great fighter. I just think it's hard for a character like that to be likable to me. You know who always did it just right for me? Alexander Fu Sheng. He mastered that kind of role. And I guess since I liked the two early 90s Fong SaiYuk movies with Jet Li I thought he did that particular character well. But I just wanted to rip my hair out here! AHHHHHHH!!!! But some super smooth action some great group fighting scenes towards the end and I always feel it's a treat when Liu ChiaLiang gets in front of the camera for one of his own movies. So I'd still recommend this for fans of the genreera.".

First he is very hotheaded and a trouble maker and here he has 2 brothers.Anyway Fong Sai Yuk gets into trouble and is sent to the Shaolin temple by his mother played by Li Li Li. Gordon Liu also returns as monk San Te. From here the movie goes from good to AWESOME. The choreography in this movie is nothing short of goodness. The end fights are always the best part not saying the fights in the middle were bad plus there is always one person to watch out for to see what they can do.That person would be the Governor his Eagles' Claw style was second to none. In the end this is a very highly recommended film especially if you are a kung fu movie fanatic like myself. Hsiao Hou is a damn good martial artist look for him in movies like Mad Monkey Kung Fu Legendary Weapons of China Dirty Ho Fist of the White Lotus small fight scene and My Young Auntie all very good classics. oh and this movie gets a 9.510 because the Governor didn't die.".

The film marks a notable move away from the blooddrenched vengeancefuelled Shaw classics like those directed by Chang Cheh and it's also the tamest Shaw film I've seen Gordon Liu appear in. Instead this is a lighthearted romp focusing on hijinks and characterbuilding throughout. It's also a film surprisingly tame both in the plotting and in the action sequences. I was watching this waiting for a nice fight scene to play out and I was kept waiting right up until the admittedly impressive climax.The usual Shaw Brothers staples are present here with no noticeable decline in quality sumptuous sets colourful costumes and a great supporting cast of notable faces like Lily Li and Chan Shen. My favourite character is Gordon Liu's noble monk Liu is a real scene stealer in this film and bags the best character too. It's also fun to see director Liu ChiaLiang in a small role as a Manchu villain. Jason Pai Piao bags the role of the chief villain and fills it with effortless ease.Hsiao Hou is something of a disappointment. He's playing the same legendary character Fong SaiYuk that Jet Li went on to play time and again in the 1990s but I didn't find myself warming to his portrayal as I did Li's. Sure Hou is exceptional in the athletic fighting scenes but I was expecting that seeing as how Shaw always got the best from their actors. I just kept waiting for Gordon Liu to appear back on screen. The plot I found overly predictable and repetitive and aside from the lavish climax the action scenes just didn't deliver as much as in the past although the climax at the spectacle helps to make up for earlier disappoints.".

The storyline wasn't that cheesy at all the action was not too special but overall good acting was OK so more than enough to satisfy my needs. But all got ruined because things happened that were over the top and it left me with a bad feeling. They should have put a little more effort in making everything credible and would have gotten a 7 in the no thinking just plain action category.

The storyline wasn't that cheesy at all the action was not too special but overall good acting was OK so more than enough to satisfy my needs. But all got ruined because things happened that were over the top and it left me with a bad feeling. They should have put a little more effort in making everything credible and would have gotten a 7 in the no thinking just plain action category. So in conclusion if you know you'll get irritated because things are happening that seem completely illogical don't watch! otherwise I'd say go ahead...";

The movie drags and the ending just thumps you down to a point that you get annoyed.Wonder what was the director thinking. Made no sense watsoever. The movie lacked in all aspects had no real storyline and it seemed very hollow even if Rambo was in it I don't think he could have helped the rating at all. There is simply no logic to the movie. A perfect way to waste your time and money. By far the most irritating movie i have ever seen and i am sure there will b others who'll have the same viewpoint after enduring it. Definitely not for people who have a little movie sense left in them.".

	schema:headline " Not too bad but had some corny especially the cinematography!";
	schema:reviewBody "I accepted that at first I thought this movie should be bad due to the cruel pictures of trailer and what's happened on Walking Tall The Payback. However after I watched Walking Tall Lone Justice. I thought it didn't too bad because this movie is not too cruel and it had an OK plot.Lone Justice I will use this name to refer to this movie had the spinup plot after they based The Payback on Buford Pusser's Walking Tall. However it had both of good and bad in this movie which I will describe next...I can't disagree that I hate this movie's cinematography. It made this movie very silly. I was not sure what the director thought about movie production but the pictures was shaken liked the horror movie for all time! for example the first and the last scene of the movie which showed the skyscrapers or the death scene of Octavio the pictures was shaken! This made the movie very interested? You thought wrong. The production crew should made the better cinematography because your cinematography's direction made this movie very corny!!!Even the cinematography was bad but I thought the movie was fun. Someone may think that it was very bad and unacceptable. But in my opinion Lone Justice had the good plot at the one level. Many viewers could set this movie in the type of typical action movie with mediocre action scene. So do I but not at all. The plot was acceptable and the action scene was not too bad. Nevertheless it has some plot hole. For example the scene which Agent Marcia Tunney was tortured and suffered the great pain. I thought it was a joke when Nick Prescott told her to help for herself. He didn't do anything for her! He only helped her by kill some henchmen and then Hey! Go for the telephone and call for help! and then exit without any help. Hey! Prescott! this woman suffered the great injury! Your torture was not better than her! She was cut out off her finger but why you didn't help anymore? Oh! It was also very interested in Prescott's tortured scene. I saw the comment of the IMDb fan that it was similar to the scene in Rambo II. Yes! it looked like that. Braddock Missing in Action III had the same scene which the protagonist was tortured by electrified. But this movie made the electrified scene liked a joke. I believed that if Sylvester Stallone and Chuck Norris watched this scene he would be laughed and thought Hey! You didn't get extreme like me Sorbo! I also stunned about the climax scene it was very easy and corny especially the death of Octavio and Maxwell. The ending scene was radically changed from The Payback which ended like the cowboy style. Maybe some viewer or anyone who try to watch Lone Justic could get stunned like me. However the ending scene made me a little disappointment.For the cast everyone got through the role. Kevin Sorbo still acted as the heroic character and very kind especially women. Except the scene with Agent Tunney at last Yvette Nipar had got her role as the Agent Kate Jensen same as The Payback. Err.... I was surprised about the role of Haley Ramm's Samantha Jensen. Samantha had only her mother meanwhile Nick Prescott was only the boyfriend of her mum. That was ridiculous many one should think that Prescott would be married with Jensen and had the family. No it wasn't she had her 12yearold daughter! Could be guess she was born from Jensen and her exhusband because the info about Samantha's father was unknown For the conclusion My mind was changed after I had really watched the movie. Lone Justice didn't bad as I thought before. The man assaulted woman was not seen in the movie. The plot was acceptable at one point. Even the action scene was mediocre and the cinematography was very bad this movie could made fun at the one level.".

	onyx:emotionText "I accepted that at first I thought this movie should be bad due to the cruel pictures of trailer and what's happened on Walking Tall The Payback. However after I watched Walking Tall Lone Justice. I thought it didn't too bad because this movie is not too cruel and it had an OK plot.Lone Justice I will use this name to refer to this movie had the spinup plot after they based The Payback on Buford Pusser's Walking Tall. However it had both of good and bad in this movie which I will describe next...I can't disagree that I hate this movie's cinematography. It made this movie very silly. I was not sure what the director thought about movie production but the pictures was shaken liked the horror movie for all time! for example the first and the last scene of the movie which showed the skyscrapers or the death scene of Octavio the pictures was shaken! This made the movie very interested? You thought wrong. The production crew should made the better cinematography because your cinematography's direction made this movie very corny!!!Even the cinematography was bad but I thought the movie was fun. Someone may think that it was very bad and unacceptable. But in my opinion Lone Justice had the good plot at the one level. Many viewers could set this movie in the type of typical action movie with mediocre action scene. So do I but not at all. The plot was acceptable and the action scene was not too bad. Nevertheless it has some plot hole. For example the scene which Agent Marcia Tunney was tortured and suffered the great pain. I thought it was a joke when Nick Prescott told her to help for herself. He didn't do anything for her! He only helped her by kill some henchmen and then Hey! Go for the telephone and call for help! and then exit without any help. Hey! Prescott! this woman suffered the great injury! Your torture was not better than her! She was cut out off her finger but why you didn't help anymore? Oh! It was also very interested in Prescott's tortured scene. I saw the comment of the IMDb fan that it was similar to the scene in Rambo II. Yes! it looked like that. Braddock Missing in Action III had the same scene which the protagonist was tortured by electrified. But this movie made the electrified scene liked a joke. I believed that if Sylvester Stallone and Chuck Norris watched this scene he would be laughed and thought Hey! You didn't get extreme like me Sorbo! I also stunned about the climax scene it was very easy and corny especially the death of Octavio and Maxwell. The ending scene was radically changed from The Payback which ended like the cowboy style. Maybe some viewer or anyone who try to watch Lone Justic could get stunned like me. However the ending scene made me a little disappointment.For the cast everyone got through the role. Kevin Sorbo still acted as the heroic character and very kind especially women.

	schema:reviewBody "No Walking Tall Lone Justice doesn't resume where Walking Tall The Payback ended. The major players in Dallas behind sleazy Howard MorrisTraxell Byrne Jerry Cotton of American Outlaws and his righthand henchman Lou Dowdy Todd Terry of The Anarchist Cookbookgot away scotfree. Whether this was a deliberate choice on the part of the filmmakers or a gaping hole is still debatable. Those two precipitated two of the most important events in Walking Tall The Payback. In a sense they served as plot puppeteers. They pulled strings and got the hero and the villain to dance to their tune. Instead the Lone Justice in this genuine sequel refers to a ruthless Hispanic druglord Octavio Perez newcomer Rodrigo De la Rosa who the Feds are prosecuting as a racketeer. Producer Andrew Stevens has a cameo as Octavio's defense attorney. Tenacious FBI agent Kate Jenson Yvette Nipar of Vampire Klan and her rebellious daughter Samantha Haley Ramm of XMen The Last Stand return and Nick is now Kate's boyfriend much to Samantha's chagrin. Nick's mother Emma Prescott Gail Cronauer of Boys Don't Cry is also back in this followup. The story takes place initially in Dallas and then the characters retreat to Nick's ranch in the sticks. When Nick isn't battling the villains Samantha and he bond and she considers him more of a friend than an enemy. FBI Agent Marcia Tunney Elizabeth Barondes of The Forsaken emerges as the most interesting character.Walking Tall Lone Justice surpasses Walking Tall The Payback. The Joe Halpin  Brian Strasmann screenplay is a hundred times better than their previous effort but it isn't without its flaws. Happily Walking Tall Lone Justice generated considerable suspense despite the clichs that clutter this familiar FBI versus the notorious drug felon narrative. This movie develops the theme of 'teamwork.' Furthermore it features at least one example of judiciously placed foreshadowing. Pay attention to Nick and Samantha's discussion about firearms in the barn. The villains pose a greater challenge to our heroes than the previous ones did and these villains are rather nefarious. They don't mind amputating one FBI agents thumbs when she refuses to answer their questions. Our hero Nick Prescott finds himself in a tight situation or two. At one point the villains have him tied up like Rambo was in Rambo First Blood Part 2 when he was attached to mattress box springs and received jolts of electricity. Unfortunately in spite of the superior script director Trip Reed relies on annoying concertina zooms and frenetic jump cuts to not only intensify but also accelerate the action. The concertina zooms look jarring and the jump cuts that are designed to break up mundane actions are equally annoying. Neither of these cinematic devices adds anything to the story. On the other hand they call attention to the lack of action.The action unfolds with Nick driving to Dallas to see his girlfriend. Nick stops off at a convenience store to pick up fresh flowers for Kate and ice cream for dessert. This scene contains its share of humor and drama. While Nick searches for the appropriate flavor of ice cream an AfricanAmerican gangsta and his Hispanic sidekick try to rob the cashier. They demand that the cashier open the safe. Nick throws a can that knocks the poor cashier out cold and then he singlehandedly thwarts the two robbers. The Hispanic robber tries to use marital arts moves on our hero and Nick routinely slings bags of potato chips at him before he takes him down. Although Nick kept the criminals from robbing the store he winds up in jail for hitting the cashier with a can. Nevertheless Kate comes down and gets him out of jail. Samantha who doesn't know Nick that well yet sees him as a distraction for her mother who is too distracted by the demands of her job to pay her daughter the attention that her daughter deems suitable. Initially tension mounts between Samantha and Nick. Meanwhile Kate is part of a prosecution case against Octavio. The Feds are protecting a witness against the druglord who can send him to jail for good. Unlike the Rrated Walking Tall The Payback with its objectionable rape scene that showed no nudity Walking Tall Lone Justice forefronts a nude scene with a Hispanic honey stripping and displaying her abundant breasts so that she can catch the eye of the witness. While he stands at the window in plain view against the wishes of his protector Perez's henchmen relieve a bellboy of his duties and masquerade so they can get into the motel room and kill the witness. The Feds cannot prosecute Perez on a major charge so they fall back to a money laundering charge and their witnesses are their own agents. Kate is one of them and she and her colleagues move to a safe house until they are to be called to testify. Somehow the Perez gang learns about their whereabouts and wipes out everybody killing Kate in the process too. This is the first of a couple of genuine surprises that elevates Walking Tall Lone Justice over its pathetic predecessor. The Perez gang watches Kate's funeral from a distance and they believe that their problems have been taken care of but they are wrong dead wrong.Saying anything else about this better than average sequel would ruin its impact. Kevin Sorbo looks comfortable in his role as Nick. The scene in the hospital when a fellow FBI agent and he try to avoid Perez's killers churns up considerable suspense. Nevertheless the hole that plagues this tense scene is the absence of any hospital security guards. That Perez's killersdisguised as EMTscould smuggle automatic weapons into the hospital is too much to ask. The last scene at Nick's ranch has problems too. The convention in both Walking Tall movies is the heroes cannot play hardball the way that the villains can and remain heroic.".

Kevin Sorbo had already appeared in a first sequel which I haven't seen but this one has a standalone storyline which is unconnected to the previous movies.In essence it's a typical low budget action movie very similar to the kind of stuff that Steven Seagal is making these days. Kevin Sorbo is the just upright hero who falls foul of a sinister drug lord and his gang of ruthless dealers. People are killed Sorbo kicks a little ass including during one of those ultrapredictable scenes in which he stumbles upon a convenience store robbery and it all builds to a showdown between the good guys and bad.In terms of quality it's very much par for the course. I like Sorbo have liked him since the days of HERCULES THE LEGENDARY JOURNEYS although it's not something I regularly watched. He seems like a genuinely nice guy and that counts for a lot in my book. Of the supporting players nobody really stands out but the pace is good and there are some setpieces that work like the lengthy hospital interlude or a surprisingly nasty bit of torture.A big detraction from the film is the direction which is absolutely horrible. Director Tripp Reed seems to equate style with shaking his camera all over the place doing frenzied editing at all stages to boot. It doesn't work it's an unnecessary detraction and really the only thing wrong with this movie I can overlook the clichd plot and characters but not that direction. I cringe just thinking about it!".

Uncle Kessler ErnstHugo Jregrd supplies Leopold with a job in the big Zentropa train corporation but soon Leopold falls in love with Katharina Hartmann Barbara Sukowa daughter of Zentropa owner Max Hartmann Jrgen Reenberg. Leopold soon finds himself caught in a web of corruption being taken advantage of losing his ideology and is forced to chose between pest or colera.Mysterious mesmerizing manipulative noirish haunting beautiful and ugly. These are some immediate grandiose descriptions that come to mind when thinking of Lars von Trier's 1991 masterpiece EUROPA the final chapter of the Europa trilogy. In USA it was retitled ZENTROPA so audiences wouldn't confuse it with Agnieszka Holland's EUROPA EUROPA from 1990 equally a WWII drama. The Europa trilogy also consists of FORBRYDELSENS ELEMENT from 1984 and EPIDEMIC from 1987 the infamous experiment that only sold 900 tickets in the Danish cinemas. The trilogy thematically deals with hypnotism and loss of idealism although the themes of this trilogy are not as essential as the visuals. In the openingshot of EUROPA we see a locomotive moving towards us while our unidentified narrator literally hypnotizes us On the mental count of ten you will be in Europa. Be there at ten. I say ten. A metaphor for movies' ability to transport us into a subconscious dreamreality.EUROPA utilizes a strange but extremely effective visual style  that famous Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky is Trier's maininfluence says it all. It's a blackandwhite movie occasionally intertwined with red in form of blood a red dress etc. According to rumors this inspired Steven Spielberg to use the similar effect in SHINDLER'S LIST from 1993 coincidentially another WWII drama. Furthermore Trier uses socalled Dutch angels and reinvents backgroundprojection by adding separately shot cooperating layers upon layers but unlike old Hollywood movies that incorporated it for economical reasons Trier uses it for artistic reasons. These carefully executed strangelooking visual techniques underline that we are in a dreamreality we are hypnotized the universe of EUROPA is not real! EUROPA is often criticized for weighing advanced technique such as multilayered backgroundprojection above plot and characters but hey that's what reviewers criticized Stanley Kubrick's 1968 visual masterpiece 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY for  nowadays it holds an obligatory place in all cinemahistory books.EUROPA also gets accused of historical incorrectness. Apparently Trier assigns the Nazis' Werewolf terroristgroup too much historical significance. According to various onlinesources that's correct a fascinating subject  try Googl'ing it yourself! yet Trier's purposes are neither educational nor portraying history accurately. EUROPA is a neverending nightmare. Leopold Kessler is hypnotized therefore the universe that the audience encounters is a distorted reality. Equally it shows how our memory deceives us  a 100 accurate reconstruction is a lie! Although young audiences who experience EUROPA are too young to have memories from WWII we have a collective memory of it from various BBC documentaries so these small inaccuracies actually serve a purpose they inform us us that we are not in postWWII Germany 1945 but in Leopolds memory of it.All three Europa trilogy chapters portray young ideologists with noble intentions forced into corruption and losing their ideological innocence. The ambiguous endings of FORBRYDELSENS ELEMENT and EUROPA show the ideologists getting forever caught in their hypnotized realities. Before during and after shooting EUROPA in 1990 in Poland Lars von Trier and cowriter Niels Vrsel were extremely interested in WWII. It shows. It's packed with extremely beautiful shots catching the atmosphere of the timeperiod spoton. A great example is the old Polish church EUROPA was shot in Poland primarily for economic reasons in the last act of EUROPA. As with 2001 SPACE ODYSSEY I think EUROPA will receive it's rightfully deserved place in cinemahistory. Its method of twisting old filmnoir loveaffair clichs and visual techniques is so unique strange and completely different from anything you will see from Hollywood nowadays or any other dreamfactory for that matter.EUROPA is an essential movie in the Lars von Trier catalog. Some write it off as pure commercial speculation but that would be catastrophic. It's right up there with other Trier classics and semiclassics such as FORBRYDELSENS ELEMENT from 1984 the TVseries RIGET from 1993 and DOGVILLE from 2003. It's a unique experience from before Trier cared for his actors and before the Dogme95 Manifesto. Watch it! On the count of ten... 910".

The American named Leo doesn't fully get what he's doing there. He has come to take part in fixing up the country since in his mind it's about time Germany was shown some charity. No matter how that sounds he is not a Nazi sympathizer or so much as especially proGerman merely mixed up. His uncle who works on the railroad gets Leo a job as a helmsman on a sleeping car and he is increasingly enmeshed in a vortex of 1945 Germany's horrors and enigmas.This progression starts when Leo played rather memorably by the calm yet restless actor JeanMarc Barr meets a sultry heiress on the train played by Barbara Sukowa an actress with gentility on the surface but internal vigor. She seduces him and then takes him home to meet her family which owns the company which manufactures the trains. These were the precise trains that took Jews to their deaths during the war but now they run a drab daytoday timetable and the woman's Uncle Kessler postures as another one of those good Germans who were just doing their jobs. There is also Udo Kier the tremendous actor who blew me away in Von Trier's shocking second film Epidemic though here he is mere scenery.Another guest at the house is Eddie Constantine an actor with a quiet strength playing a somber American intelligence man. He can confirm that Uncle Kessler was a war criminal though it is all completely baffling to Leo. Americans have been characterized as gullible rubes out of their element for decades but little have they been more blithely unconcerned than Leo who goes back to his job on what gradually looks like his own customized death train.The story is told in a purposely uncoordinated manner by the film's Danish director Lars Von Trier whose anchor is in the film's breathtaking editing and cinematography. He shoots in black and white and color he uses doubleexposures optical effects and trick photography having actors interact with rearprojected footage he places his characters inside a richly shaded visceral world so that they sometimes feel like insects caught between glass for our more precise survey.This Grand Jury Prizewinning surrealist work is allegorical but maybe in a distinct tone for every viewer. I interpret it as a film about the last legs of Nazism symbolized by the train and the ethical accountability of Americans and others who appeared too late to salvage the martyrs of these trains and the camps where they distributed their condemned shiploads. During the time frame of the movie and the Nazi state and such significance to the train are dead but like decapitated chickens they persist in jolting through their reflexes.The characters music dialogue and plot are deliberately hammy and almost satirically procured from film noir conventions. The most entrancing points in the movie are the entirely cinematographic ones. Two trains halting back and forth Barr on one and Sukowa on another. An underwater shot of proliferating blood. An uncommonly expressive sequence on what it must be like to drown. And most metaphysically affecting of all an anesthetic shot of train tracks as Max von Sydow's voice allures us to hark back to Europe with him and abandon our personal restraint.".

Von Trier brilliantly paints his vision on screen. You will feel like you are watching some lost espionage noir classic from the late 1940's with the perfectly lighted black and white scenes while at the same time feel you are on the brink of something beyond the cutting edge especially in scenes like the assassination aboard the train. Literally when you see this movie you are witnessing the evolution of an art form. For some reason Von Trier got caught up in his own Dogma movement shortly after this. And while his Breaking the Waves and Dancer in the Dark are classics in their own right it is with Zentropa that he truly lifted the art of film making to new and exciting heights. 1010 ages like a fine wine and begs for a DVD release.Postscript  Criterion released the film on DVD in 2009.

	schema:headline " Another utterly dazzling film from von Trier.";
	schema:reviewBody "Zentropa is another von Trier film that manages to tell an authentically interesting story revel in its own aesthetic beauty and engage us in questions of metaphysics.  The films narration as described above sets the gauntlet very high.  The often tired flashbackhypnotismrelapseetc structure poses a certain disaster to most of the films that dare to use it. However it is pulled off masterfully.With Zentropa we must first buy into the introduction.  We prepare ourselves to relive these moments and allow the film to justify its use of this down the tracks.  However we learn very quickly that what we have been sold is not the standard omniscient perspective.  It is distorted and fragmented emotion has been poured on too thick at parts while in others it is spread too thin. We must accept the story directly from a mind that we considerably mistrust.The rest of the film tirelessly reconstructs the scenes of this deranged mind.  We transition from bw film to color.

The films narration as described above sets the gauntlet very high.  The often tired flashbackhypnotismrelapseetc structure poses a certain disaster to most of the films that dare to use it. However it is pulled off masterfully.With Zentropa we must first buy into the introduction.  We prepare ourselves to relive these moments and allow the film to justify its use of this down the tracks.  However we learn very quickly that what we have been sold is not the standard omniscient perspective.  It is distorted and fragmented emotion has been poured on too thick at parts while in others it is spread too thin. We must accept the story directly from a mind that we considerably mistrust.The rest of the film tirelessly reconstructs the scenes of this deranged mind.  We transition from bw film to color.

	schema:reviewBody "This is the fifth von Trier film I have seen. I believe that he is the only director to whom I have given such a high score on all his movies. Four of them The Element of Crime Europa Breaking the Waves and Dancer in the Dark I have given a 10 and one The Idiots I have given a 9 and I have been reconsidering whether to give it a 10 since I first saw it although I'd like to see it once more before I do. He has been chided for calling himself one of the best working directors. I tend to agree with him. I cannot blame him for being arrogant when he has made such great films. In 50 years when von Trier retires he will be looked upon as the preeminent film artist from Europe perhaps from the planet and there will be classes taught in his name. He simply is the Bergman or Fellini of our time. It is too bad the critics are too intrigued with themselves to notice this.About Europa itself I'll admit that it was confusing and that its narrative did not seem strong. I think that's the point. This film was obviously meant to represent a nightmare or the subconscious at some level. This is absolutely clear from the framing of the film Max von Sydow's narration. We are hypnotized or von Trier is hypnotized and this is ourhis subconscious mind. I'm inclined to lean more towards his mind since the degradation of Europe concerns me an American very little. This framing is also clear if you have seen The Element of Crime an even more brilliant film than this although I am disputing that in my mind what Europa needs more than anything is a proper release on DVD hopefully Criterion again with theatrical aspect ratio and remastered sound and picture then I am fairly sure this film would seem as great as any of von Trier's other films. In The Element of Crime the film begins with a hypnotist whom we actually see on screen this time is hypnotizing Fisher a European detective who wants to get to the root of his mental anguish. The first words of that film are Fantasy is okay but my job is to keep you on track. And whenever Fisher the narrator gets off track the hypnotist does chastize him and tells him to get back on with the story. He even laughs when a character is given a really silly and trite line. Something along the lines of Do you understand the difference between good and evil? The hypnotist laughs and says Now Fisher she didn't really say that did she?So the key to interpreting Europa almost a sequel of sorts to The Element of Crime is that we are deep in ourvon Trier's subconscious and  the symbols there are to be interpreted within ourselves and will likely be different for everyone. What does the train itself symbolize? Consider it internally and only then discuss it externally. Europa is a great film a masterpiece. I was never bored by it even though I watched it at 3 am. The perfect time to watch actually since it works in dream logic.".

	schema:reviewBody "Concluding the trilogy of films that began almost a decade earlier with the dark industrial influenced filmnoir experiment The Element of Crime 1984 and continuing with the largely unseen experimental horrorsatire Epidemic 1987 this multilayered visually expressive postwar thriller finds precocious auteur Lars von Trier in his cinematic element creating a mind bending and deeply hallucinogenic filmnoir appropriation that references sources as diverse as Hitchcock Bergman Welles and Murnau to create a myriad of expressionistic images philosophies and moments of heartstopping tension.As with his later more widely seen work such as Breaking the Waves 1996 and The Idiots 1998 von Trier structures the film with a complete disregard for mainstream movie conventions  not just throwing out the cinematic rule book but proudly stampeding it  as he strings together scene after scene of ethereal beauty all backed by the haunting and distinctive narration of Max Von Sydow and the thrilling music of Joakim Holbek. The result is a film like no other revelling in pretension and cinematic excess Europa 1991 knows exactly what it is and raises a middle finger to anyone who refuses to buy into its central ideology. In keeping with the director's earlier works the plot of Europa is threadbare but never less than interesting as Jean Marc Barr's bookish American goes back to Germany in the wake of World War II to discover his roots and lend a hand in the rebuilding of the country. Barr's character Leopold Kessler is a brazenly idealistic young man peering out from behind his spectacles with wide eyes as he bravely suffers ridicule and contempt from all around him. Amongst this central narrative device we have the usual filmnoir conventions of shadowy businessmen the femmefatale etc. However the film always comes back to von Trier's central ideology. If we have learned anything from the director's work it is the ultimate image of the idealist being brought slowly to their knees and eventually destroyed. In both Breaking the Waves and Dancer in the Dark 2000 von Trier concludes that those who live in false hope will sooner or later be smashed by a manipulative and unloving system.His most successful realisation of this was with the aforementioned Dancer in the Dark in which he mixed elements of melodrama and musical theatre with socialrealist concerns to create a somewhat misguided indictment of the American judicial system within the context of a 1950's cinematic universe. His most controversial film Breaking the Waves again saw the destruction of a central martyr with the childlike Emily Watson sacrificing her body to Christ  and various lecherous old men  in order to cure her crippled husband. With Europa von Trier would lay the groundwork for these following films whilst once again condemning the American's shallow selfriotous image and animosity in the face of war though perhaps more multifaceted than that oneline assessment might suggest. The director also throws in ideas of fascism terrorism and a hearty helping of postmodern references though all in the name of cinematic experimentation high style and unashamed visual manipulation.Shot in a sort of off black and white  meaning that the images have been given a silvery blue tint with deeply rich shadows  and framed in anamorphic cinemascope Europa twists and turns with one jawdropping set piece after another. A simple assassination sequence is drawn out using forced perspectives colour juxtaposition and rear screen projection to dizzying effect and the way that the camera cranes and tracks constantly offering us layer upon layer of visual symbolism is truly amazing. The iconography is bold yet slightly clearcut in comparison to the courageous departures that von Trier made with his earlier film The Element of Crime. Here we have he an expressionistic vision of Europe in severe decline with Germany attempting to claw themselves out of the ashes and regain power as an important society leading up to the eventual economic miracle of the early 1950's. Some have criticized Barr's character for not being heroic enough missing the point of the film entirely. Kessler isn't supposed to be the hero but rather a patsy or a puppet. He's an American going back to a country that his own military helped destroy representing arrogant idealism pointing out Germany's own weaknesses and posturing to gain acceptance. This is a much bleaker film once we start dealing with the issues of subtext as the scene that prefigures a prominent funeral will attest. For me this is a stirring and imaginative film dealing with themes such as deception manipulation and eventually corruption.With Europa von Trier has structured a beautifully designed and thematically quite gripping thriller with both political and cinematic reference points in abundance. Most filmmakers would be terrified to put the viewer to sleep within the first five minutes but Europa takes up that challenge using Von Sydow's haunting voice to lull the viewer into a state of assumed hypnosis. Needless to say the film employs ideas of dreamlogic unfolding subjectively and expressionistically from the central character's point of view. The is a film that will linger long in the mind of anyone who experiences it as the closing moments leave the audience adrift at sea or as lost as Leopold Kessler. As Von Sydow observes in the film's closing narration we want to wake up to leave behind the images of Europa... but it is not possible.".

Now I'd be the first to hail Lars von Trier a genius just off the back of his films Breaking the Waves and Dancer in the Dark but this is stupid the fact that Europa has gone unnoticed by film experts for so long is a crime against cinema whilst overrated rubbish like Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and Life is Beautiful clean up at the academy awards but what do the know Europa has been hidden away absent form video stores and until recently any British TV channels. The visuals in Europa are not MTV gloss it's not a case of style over substance its more a case of substance dictating style.  Much like his first film The Element of Crime von Trier uses the perspective of the main character to draw us into his world and much like Element the film begins with the main character or in the case of Europa we the audience being hypnotized.  As we move down the tracks the voice of the Narrator Max von Sydow counts us down into a deep sleep until we awake in Europa.  This allows von Trier and his three cinematographers to pay with the conventions of time and imagery there are many scenes in Europa when a character in the background who is in black and white will interact with a person in the foreground who will be colour von Trier is trying to show us how much precedence the coloured item or person has over the plot for instance it's no surprise that the first shot of Leopold Kessler Jeanmarc Barr is in colour since he is the only character who's actions have superiority over the film.  The performances are good they may not be on par with performances in later von Trier films but that's just because the images are sometimes so distracting that you don't really pick up on them the first time round.  But I would like to point out the fantastic performance of JeanMarc Barr in the lead role whose blind idealism is slowly warn down by the two opposing sides until he erupts in the films final act.  Again muck like The Element of Crime the film ends with our hero unable to wake up from his nightmare state left in this terrible place with only the continuing narration of von Sydow to seal his fate.  Europa is a tremendous film and I cant help thinking what a shame that von Trier has abandoned this way of filming since he was clearly one of the most talented visual directors working at that time Europa much like the rest of his cinematic cannon is filled with a wealth of iconic scenes.  His dedication to composition and miseenscene is unrivalled not to mention his use of sound and production design.  But since his nofrills melodramas turned out to be Breaking the Waves and Dancer in the Dark then who can argue but it does seems like a waste of an imaginative talent.  1010".

This allows von Trier and his three cinematographers to pay with the conventions of time and imagery there are many scenes in Europa when a character in the background who is in black and white will interact with a person in the foreground who will be colour von Trier is trying to show us how much precedence the coloured item or person has over the plot for instance it's no surprise that the first shot of Leopold Kessler Jeanmarc Barr is in colour since he is the only character who's actions have superiority over the film.  The performances are good they may not be on par with performances in later von Trier films but that's just because the images are sometimes so distracting that you don't really pick up on them the first time round.  But I would like to point out the fantastic performance of JeanMarc Barr in the lead role whose blind idealism is slowly warn down by the two opposing sides until he erupts in the films final act.  Again muck like The Element of Crime the film ends with our hero unable to wake up from his nightmare state left in this terrible place with only the continuing narration of von Sydow to seal his fate.  Europa is a tremendous film and I cant help thinking what a shame that von Trier has abandoned this way of filming since he was clearly one of the most talented visual directors working at that time Europa much like the rest of his cinematic cannon is filled with a wealth of iconic scenes.  His dedication to composition and miseenscene is unrivalled not to mention his use of sound and production design.  But since his nofrills melodramas turned out to be Breaking the Waves and Dancer in the Dark then who can argue but it does seems like a waste of an imaginative talent.  1010";

	schema:reviewBody "Contains spoilers due to me having to describe some film techniques so read at your own risk!I loved this film.  The use of tinting in some of the scenes makes it seem like an old photograph come to life.  I also enjoyed the projection of people on a back screen. For instance in one scene Leopold calls his wife and she is projected behind him rather than in a typical split screen. Her face is huge in the back and Leo's is in the foreground.One of the best uses of this is when the young boys kill the Ravensteins on the train a scene shot in an almost political poster style with facial close ups.  It reminded me of Battleship Potemkin that intense constant style coupled with the spray of red to convey tons of horror without much gore. Same with the scene when Katharina finds her father dead in the bathtub...you can only see the red water on the side. It is one of the things I love about Von Trier his understatement of horror which ends up making it all the more creepy.The use of text in the film was unique like when Leo's character is pushed by the word Werewolf. I have never seen anything like that in a film.The use of black comedy in this film was well done. ErnstHugo Jregrd is great as Leo's uncle.  It brings up the snickers I got from his role in the Kingdom Riget.  This humor makes the plotline of absurd anal retentiveness of train conductors against the terrible backdrop of WW2 and all the chaos easier to take.  It reminds me of Riget in the way the hospital administrator is trying to maintain a normalcy at the end of part one when everything is going crazy.  It shows that some people are truly oblivious to the awful things happening around them. Yet some people like Leo are tuned in but do nothing positive about it.The voice over done expertly well by Max von Sydow is amusing too. It draws you into the story and makes you jump into Leo's head which at times is a scary place to be.The movie brings up the point that one is a coward if they don't choose a side. I see the same idea used in Dancer in the Dark where Bjork's character doesn't speak up for herself and ends up being her own destruction.  Actually at one time Von Trier seemed antiwoman to me by making Breaking the Waves and Dancer but now I know his male characters don't fare well either!  I found myself at the same place during the end of Dancer when you seriously want the main character to rethink their actions but of course they never do!".

I mention this because although Europa was made by von Trier the film does not at all adhere to these rulesas the film was made four years before this film movement was deliberately created. Von Trier's use of black  white film interposed throughout the film with muted color sets incidental music nonhand held camera the use of a crane for a few shots and setting the film in the past were all techniques he would eschew only four years later. I guess he was just getting it out of his system! The beginning of Europa is very very strange. You hear the voice of Max Von Sydow and he leads the audience in a hypnotic inductiontaking you back to the year 1945just after WWII. And later you will once again hear the voice of Von Sydow talking throughout the film like a hypnotherapista VERY unusual way to narrate this film.The film plot revolves around an odd and rather nonemotive American Leopold Kessler. It seems that he was a pacifist during the war and has moved to Germany to work for the railroad. This is odd I know but it gets a lot more unusual than that... I would try to explain the story but frankly it all becomes very surreal and a bit weird. Additionally while the film is supposed to be about a group of postwar terrorists named 'Werewolves' the film does NOT attempt to provide an actual history lesson or really discuss their actions. My advice is like all surreal films don't try to understand it or make sense out of why von Trier made itjust absorb it and make of it what you will or not.My feeling about the film is that I liked it because of its bizarreness and innovative cinematography. Sure there are a few sloppy portions such as the dubbing of the Colonel's voice but what's important is that this film was made in 1991. Using computers to make this sort of project would be pretty easy todaybut back in 1991 personal computers were still a bit rare and amazingly underpowered. Yet von Trier was able to use black  white mixed with occasional splashes of grainy colora difficult trick in its day. There are also very very beautiful camera shots throughout the film such as the bombed out church in the snow which are achieved through superimposing characters into scenes he shot previously. Totally weird confusing but visually arresting. This is NOT a film for the average personthey probably wouldn't have the patience or would demand a more coherent and traditional plot. But it's the sort of thing that is worth seeing onceit's that unusual and unique. The style the narration the cinematography and the music provide a once in a lifetime sort of experience.If you get the DVD be sure to see if it has the French documentary The Making of 'Europa' as it explains the various very innovative camera tricks that were used. Additionally just how complicated it all was to make is revealed...and it took two years to make!".

	schema:reviewBody "Lars von Trier is often chided for his ego. He believes he is the greatest director currently working and this arrogance pushes a lot of people's buttons. But anyone who can make a movie as utterly brilliant as 'Europa' deserves to have a big head! This movie is a masterpiece pure and simple. JeanMarc Barr 'The Big Blue' stars as a naive American who movies to Germany at the end of WW2 to help rebuild the nation. He becomes employed as a night porter on a train. He is trained by his demanding Uncle the wonderful ErnstHugo Jaregard who Von Trier later used to great effect in 'The Kingdom' and quickly finds himself caught between his duties and his affair with the daughter of the train company Barbara Sukowa  'M. Butterfly'. He becomes totally confused doesn't understand the complex political situation and has no idea who to trust or believe. I won't go into great detail about the plot itself as that would spoil the movie. 'Europa' works very well on the level of a thriller but is also a complex political allegory and as well as that it is a dazzling visual treat. This movie is interesting on so many levels it will appeal to all kinds of movie lovers. As an added bonus buffs will also get a buzz seeing cult heroes Eddie Constantine 'Alphaville' and Von Trier regular Udo Kier 'Shadow Of The Vampire' 'Flesh For Frankenstein' in the supporting cast. 'Europa' is one of the finest movies of the 1990s and should not be missed by any movie fan. If you haven't seen this you are in for a real treat!".

Most of the time the color is just used for one or two items in a scene such as someone's face or an object on screen.The narration is from a person who talks like a hypnotist and sounds stupid most of the time. It negates the fascinating visuals. The story is just so weak and confusing that after 45 minutes it's tough to stay interested. It's a depressing post WWIIGermany story. Note this is the third film in a trilogy by directorwriter Lars Von Trier. In fairness I should see this on DVD and the other two films.

	schema:reviewBody "I shall now count from 1 to 10. On the count of 10 we shall have reviewed Europa. I say 1. Lars Von Trier's finale to his Europa Trilogy focusing on crisis in Europe is aptly titled Europa. It's a more straight forward film than the director's usual fare being more of a take on classic cinema than his others. 2. That certainly doesn't stop it however from being quite an experiment in time space and even color within the medium and creating some hauntingly memorable scenes and shots.3. Europa is very Hitchcockian. It builds tension through story and character but is able to successfully mimic that tension visually. 4. Trust no one. Trust nothing. Anything could be as real as what's on the projection screen behind you. The movie hits a sort of lull early on while developing the story and characters and is seemingly nothing special apart from being an exceptional call back to older political espionage films. The filming and acting style as well as the general script is all more than evocative of the popular film noir movies of the 40s and 50s. The sets are lavish the romance is melodramatic and it's full of all of those old clichs. It is nostalgic for movies long since gone. Then ever so slightly every once in awhile it reminds you that this is no ordinary film. Your narrator gives you a new task and 5. counts you down again or an object will mysteriously pop up in color against this black and white film.6. The film feels old but is interestingly brought about by new methods. Lars Von Trier is playing with contradictions here keeping you on your toes about what's real and what's not. He's playing with the languages being spoken in the film moving from English to German and back again sometimes in the middle of sentences. He's playing with the black and white nature of the story with color that creeps in at odd moments. 7. He's playing with whether this is the real world or a dream not only visually but with the voice of God directing you as a viewer through this adventure as if a director is calling out your actions to you on a film set.8. He's definitely playing with expanding the small claustrophobic spaces within the tight corridors of the moving train inside which most of the film takes place into huge spaces by way of using a back projected screen. Acting in front of and interacting with an actual projection screen with moving images instead of standing in front of a green or blue screen and having items added later means that these masterful shots must be perfectly composed and surely rehearsed just to line up correctly or else fall completely apart. It's a rather fantastic effect.9. In a way and especially by the film's end Europa is a film for the senses with visual cues that turn in every direction stimulating story a often intense backing score and hypnotizing audio. As these elements move through the film and move you through the film it's like going in and out of consciousness. Europa is an incredible experience that manages to make something as serious as Nazi Germany a fun and intriguing ride. And within it all Von Trier even gives himself a small cameo in pure Hitchcock fashion. 10. Experience Europa.".

What he doesn't know is the war is still secretly going on with an underground terrorist group called the Werewolves who target American allies. Leopold is strongly against taking any sides but is drawn in and seduced by Katharina Hartmann Barbara Sukowa the femme fatale daughter of the owner of the railway company.

The colonel soon enlists or forces Leopold to be a spy without giving him a choice or chance to think about it to see if the Werewolves might carry out attacks on the trains.Soon Leopold is stuck in an adventure by being involved with both sides of the conflict in a mysterious and film noirish way where everyone and everything is not what it seems. Its amazing to watch the naive Leopold deal with everything his lover the terrorists the colonel annoying passengers his disgruntled uncle even the railway company's officials who come to examine his work ethic before he finally boils over and humorously and violently takes control. The film is endlessly unpredictable.The film stylishly shot it always takes place at night during the winter with lots of falling snow. Its shot in black and white with shots of color randomly appearing throughout. Also background screens displaying images that counter act with the images up front. Add Max von Sydow's hypnotic narration and Europa becomes a dreamlike place that's out of this world.This is now a personal favorite film of mine.".

Story lines fail and camera work is merely copied from the last film of similiar taste. But then I saw Zentropa Europa and my faith was renewed. Not only is the metaphorical storyline enthralling but the use of color and black and white is visually stimulating. The narrator Max Von Sydow takes you through a spellbounding journey every step of the way and engrosses you into Europa 1945. We have all seen death put on screen in a hundred thousand ways but the beauty of this film is how it takes you through every slowmoving moment that leads you to death. Unlike many films it doesn't cut after one second of showing for example a knife but forces you to watch the devastating yet sensuous beauty of a man's final moments. I think we can all take something different away from what this movie is trying to say but it is definitely worth taking the time to find out what it all really means. I would love to talk more in depth about the film for any one who wishes to send me an email. Enjoy it!".

	schema:reviewBody "While not as big and splashy as their pairing in Love Affair released the same year Irene Dunne and Charles Boyer star in what is rather a small film. When Tomorrow Comes is a tale of unrequited love between two people who because of the man being bound to a mentally ill wife can never be together. Irene Dunne convincingly plays an underemployed ordinary working gal one who aspires to be a singer but who is stuck toiling the days away as a waitress. Her character bonds with Boyer's character by disobeying her restaurant's no substitutions rule and fulfilling his request for French apple pie. This scene is endearing as she dares to simply place a piece of cheese on top of a slice of hot apple pie and cover the pie until the cheese meltsLOL it ain't nothing' but a thing as Dunne goes the extra step to please the customer. From then on the two are friends and go off together to explore Manhattan and go sailing together. Their would be love affair is derailed by nothing less than a hurricane and the reappearance of Boyer's wife played here by Barbara O'Neill. O'Neill steals the show as she portrays a woman who is mentally unbalanced but not for the reason everyone suspects. While her illness is attributed to the death of her infant son we soon discover that she is using this as an excuse to keep Boyer bound to her. In the scene where Dunne confronts her and pleads for her to release Boyer we are chilled by O'Neill's psychopathic threat to do harm to Boyer should he leave her for Dunne. O'Neill is scary as hell and Dunne understands as the audience does that she is promising to do Boyer harm not merely threatening to. Because of this Dunne knows that Boyer can never be hers and for this reason she must bid him farewell forever. The final scene where they part ways as she exits from the restaurant where they are having their last supper together is a tearjerker. No matter how many times she plays the poignant heroine who is called on to do the right thing Dunne nails it. Her pain is our pain. Boyer's pain in losing her is also our own. Their love is lost and the pain is unbearable.".

There are no raging spirits or escaped madmen here. Nor will you find that stock of today's second rate horror films  the creature that embodies evil and finds amazingly obscure ways in which to slaughter naughty teenagers. No this movie scars one's psyche with darkness and silence and possibility all mingled with its refusal to give the audience an easy answer at the end.Based on Henry James' novella The Turn Of The Screw the story is deceptively simple. An inexperienced governess is hired to care for two orphaned children in an isolated British manor and slowly comes to believe the ghosts of the previous governess and her brutish lover are trying to possess the children's souls. Being a decent woman who loves children she fights back the only way she can  by confronting the evil head on. But the question is does the evil truly exist...or is it all in her own mind?As told by James the novella is a startling ghost story without question. He adds his usual psychological insights to the characters but never do you doubt the ghosts exist. The defining moment comes when Miss Giddens sees Quint's face in a dark window then later finds a locket bearing his portrait and comes to her realization Oh he's a ghost! But in the movie Truman Capote and William Archibald reverse this sequence  she finds the locket first and THEN sees the man's face in the window  and all simple explanations go out the door.Is Miss Giddens imagining things? Has she become overwhelmed by the responsibility of raising two precocious children without any sort of support from their selfish uncle? Is she merely sexually repressed and immature enough to transfer her crush on the uncle to a boy not even into puberty yet? And what of Flora Miles' sister? If this is merely sexual repression on Miss Giddens' part then why does she drag a little girl into the morass? Throughout the film Miss Giddens offers evidence of her concerns  a letter received from Miles' schoolmaster that she cannot fully share with Mrs. Grose because the woman cannot read her awareness that the two innocents in her charge have a far more advanced knowledge of life than children that age normally would stories told by Mrs. Grose about Miss Jessel and Quint and how they treated the children. So could it be the spirits of two miserable adults have come back to reclaim life in the persons of Miles and Flora? It could go either way.There is not one wrong moment in this movie. Not one. The first time I saw it was in New York City on a double bill with The Haunting 1963 a things that go bump in the night kind of movie. The audience and I howled through that one it was so much silly fun. And we chuckled through the first ten minutes of The Innocents especially when Mrs. Grose tells Miss Giddens I'm SO glad you're here with a little quiver in her voice but by the end of that film and I use the word film deliberately the entire theater was dead silent. Any film that can shut up a room full of rowdy New Yorkers has got to be damned good.So...is The Innocents a ghost story or psychological study? Who can say? And to be honest who cares? It is at the very least a damned good movie...and at the very best a horror story that makes The Shining Rosemary's Baby The Others and even Psycho a movie I love look like the works of children. That this film is not available on DVD is a travesty.".

The two kids are both rather poised and charming as well as chilling the boy especially intriguing for his precociousness and preciousness.

Something is wrong and you wait to see what and how it will be revealed.If it ever is. One of the brilliant things about Henry James is how you finish one of his books the novels are better than the stories for this I think knowing what has happened but not knowing completely why. I mean it all makes sense and feels right but it feels suspended with an air of lingering needs. So you end up thinking about it later. As you will with this film.There are some moments of special effects that are very well done even if a kind of 1950s60s style of overlapping images and dreamerdreamed simultaneousness. And the ghosts not to give anything away are pretty matter of fact. This is more an appreciation than a complaint because the lack of gore of cheap surprise or of obvious scare tactics makes the movie a relief and a bit of cinematic magic.".

Instead the spooks in this movie are presented in a subtle way....yet the movie is quite scary. This is the type of horror movie that I like one in which every now and then you see a frightening image or a startling scene and that image or scene lingers in your mind.Everything about this movie is haunting. First there's the song at the beginning you hear a young girl's voice singing a beautiful yet somber song. Later you hear that song in several scenes in the movie.Second there's the setting this movie takes place in a large Victorian mansion with many rooms and passages while only about eight people live in it....what could be more eerie than that?Then there's the exceptional cinematography. The blackandwhite photography is perfect for this movie. This movie would not have been too creepy if it had been done in color. Further many of the shots were innovative and the lighting was used ingeniously in some of the scenes.Additionally I liked the way that the director chose to play around with the sound which brought more of an element of mystery to the movie. In one particular scene there was a lot of noise initially....and in a split second there was dead silence....then several seconds later it was noisy all over again all in the same scene.But what I think is the most interesting thing about this movie is the fantastic performance by Deborah Kerr. It's fascinating to watch her facial expressions in this movie. She demonstrates her character's fear quite well.I also think that the actor who plays Quint is very scarylooking! He has a very sinister look and it adds to the spookiness of this movie. If you really want to be spooked by this movie watch it late at night with all of the lights off....dare to watch it by yourself.".

Flora and Miles seem like thoroughly innocent and angelic children but soon whispers of corruption begin to materialize. Miles is expelled from school for reasons he is reluctant to discuss. Miss Giddens learns of the fate of the prior governess a masochistic young woman named Miss Jessel who was having an affair with a sadistic man named Quint. Soon Miss Giddens is seeing the ghosts of the arrogantly handsome Quint and the forlorn Miss Jessel everywhere and comes to believe that the children have been possessed. But is she only imagining these horrors? And will she destroy the children in her attempt to save them?This movie is creepy claustrophobic and totally paranoid. Filmed in moody black and white with an almost nonexistent musical score other than the chilling song Willow Waylee sung in a child's voice over the opening credits and throughout the film The Innocents is a flawless suspense drama. I hesitate to call it a ghost story as the presence of the ghosts is never confirmed or denied for that matter. Nor is the sanity of the main character. Is the prim English Governess played with classic elegance by Deborah Kerr simply an uptight prude having obscene fantasies or are the two children she's caring for really possessed by the evil and perverted spirits of the former governess and her sadistic lover? There's no gore no stupid incidental music no insufferably adorable children and no happy ending. Unspoken horrors dark secrets and things that decent people don't discuss fill this film with sick shadows and diseased memories. Whether or not the ghosts exist is a moot point by films end. This film is about corruption and perversion. Indeed there are no Innocents in this film...only the facade of innocence a flimsy backdrop of beauty drawn over the ugly festering truth. But what IS the truth? This film is a masterpiece of dread and still has the power to disturb even some forty years later. I would highly recommend it to ghost enthusiasts and psych majors alike!".

	schema:reviewBody "What makes a good chiller? Gore special effects? No as director Jack Clayton proves here it's atmosphere combined with the sounds of horror that makes the difference. Granted I've seen just about every Elm Street and Friday the 13th instalment but The Innocents proves that what you don't see can scare you the most. Deborah Kerr is in fine form as an English governess who is sent to a remote mansion in the country to look after two young orphans. Their uncle in London doesn't have time for them. Kerr slowly begins to realize there's something not quite right with the young boy and girl. Their thoughts and actions are not consistent with the behavior of preteens. There's a dark secret and Kerr sets out to discover it. We do see the ghosts but it's when Kerr searches the house for the sources of strange noises and voices that we really feel a chill. The Innocents also makes great use of its black and white photography. I can't imagine it working as well in color are you listening Gus Van Sant?. Shadows just seem creepier in black and white. The children are well played by Martin Stephens and Pamela Franklin. Franklin was 11 when she made this film and as an adult she would go on to star in another excellent haunted house movie The Legend of Hell House. It's a shame that Hollywood has stopped making movies like The Innocents. Perhaps audiences used to Halloweenstyle slashers Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer would be demanding blood and guts. Yes Scream was pardon the pun a cut above. It raised the slumping horror bar to new heights and then I Know... ran under that bar but that's another story. If you want genuine chills rather than cheap thrills you can't do much better than The Innocents.".

	schema:reviewBody "I titled this review with one of the most overly used clichs I could think of with a wink and a nod but recognizing that it fits this movie as closely as you can get. Indeed this film comes from a bygone era. The product of a short story which no one writes anymore written in a style that has long since gone out out of vogue and made into the sort of Gothic ghost movie that Hollywood never attempts to make anymore. Many critics and scary movie lists will tell you that this is one of the classics of the genre and they are not wrong but I am also willing to acknowledge right off the bat that the average 18 year old will despise this movie. This is a film lovers movie and is never going to be the sort of thing that appeals to a mass audience anymore. Indeed it didn't appeal to a mass audience at the time.At the turn of the 20th Century the public was becoming more literate and had more time on their hands creating a wave of magazines that specialized in short fiction. Some of the most popular of these magazines were selling horror fiction. Mind you this is a century ago and what we think of as horror was not yet developed. Most of these stories were Gothic pot boilers influenced heavily by Poe and Hawthorne that were more about mood suspense and atmosphere than any real spooks. Quite possibly the creme de la creme of this mingenre was THE TURN OF THE SCREW which this movie is based upon. It became the benchmark for this sort of fiction.By the time this movie was made in the 60s that genre was out of style. When the monster movie died in the 40s Val Lewton brought on a new focus on these sort of films culminating in gems like THE UNINVITED and THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE. By the 60s though we had Hammer Studios Maria Bava and PSYCHO all revolutionizing the horror genre. Even by then this sort of shadowy psychological ghost film was a risk but one that resulted in what just might be the pinnacle in this style. While many critics will point to THE HAUNTING for me this is the best of the Gothic ghost movies.DO NOT expect rattling chains ghostly apparitions and things that go bump in the night. This is not that kind of ghost story. In fact the sum total of ghostly scenes is probably a handful at most. Rather this is the kind of ambiguous ghost story that Hollywood almost intentionally killed off in the 70s. Richard Matheson in particular rallied against it when he created HELL HOUSE but I am digressing in my history lessons here. What I mean by ambiguous is that the viewer is left to wonder many things at the end. Where there actually ghosts? Is our heroine just mad?There are so many things that work so well in this movie that help it create that perfect tone. The direction and camerawork are spot on. The viewer sees many things from our heroine's perspective aiding in the illusion that we are seeing things as she does but left to wonder if anyone else sees them. The magnificent use of wide angle shots often creates a sensation of loneliness and isolation putting characters on far opposite ends of the frame. The astute viewer will take notice of the use of light and shadow. The movie begins on a brilliantly lit summer day but as the movie progresses we see less and less sun and more of the shadows. When we do get our glimpses of ghosts they are unsettling and tense. These aren't Scooby Doo goblins but stark imagery that sticks wit the viewer.Of course the best part of this movie might just be the acting of the two children who are excellent in their roles. Our governess is convinced that they've become possessed by their former caretaker and her lover destroying their innocence and corrupting them. The roles demanded an acting grace that is uncommon in children this young. The young boy may just be calculatingly evil or may just be an ordinary naughty boy while his sister shows off both playful and carefree then switching to a girl haunted by things out of her understanding starting into space. So many scenes can be seen in dual ways with these children. Are they ordinary children acting out in ordinary child like ways or are they corrupted and possessed and whispering secrets?The rock in all of it is Deborah Kerr as our main character. She seems to age before our eyes as the madness and terror overwhelm her. From scene to scene or even shot to shot she can switch from a caring loving woman to a frightened madwoman surrounded by forces beyond her control. This movie revolves around her in so many ways and could have been a boring disaster in lesser acting hands but Kerr is superb pulling empathetically on the viewer's strings drawing us into liking her and caring for her which becomes so vital as we need to see things from her eyes to see the madness unfold.You probably know if you are the right person for this movie. That's lazy reviewing but that's the truth. If you can appreciate an older style of film and a movie that focuses far more on its' acting and directing styles than any plotdriven action than you will appreciate this movie. It is oldfashioned and was old fashioned at the time but that does not mean that there isn't a lot to love about this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "All great films engage us to lesser or greater degree some emotionally some intellectually  a few equally.No film in history to my memory seduces the viewer into actively cocreating the piece as it unreels as does The Innocents. Immediately vividly and subtly it arrests then implicates the viewer in every frame.Its first image in fact is a blank black screen  and the haunting sound of a child's song. Instantly viewers unconsciously react emotionally as to all music to the beguiling yet offputting song and the voice. Emotional tension established immediately.Yet one's mind never stops producing thoughts and images. So without any visual cues from the screen the haunting song produces images in viewers' own minds  each no doubt different. Already then viewers are seduced into supplying their own mental images and whether they know it yet or not have been brilliantly and subliminally placed in the Deborah Kerr role. This before a single production credit has appeared. We are watching a shadow a nothing. And our minds demand we fill it with something.Thus does Jack Clayton's astonishing The Innocents begin. Certainly other films have used the same opening device. But none with The Innocents' payoff.For as it develops based on Henry James' The Turn of the Screw The Innocents' themes are What do you see? What do you believe is true? Is it? Who is 'innocent?' The children? The nanny? You? The emotional undertow is inescapable perhaps more so because twothirds of the trio of protagonists are children in peril always a surefire hook.But in peril from what exactly? Deborah Kerr's possible paranoia  schizophrenia? Ghosts? Or our own powerful perhaps lurid imaginings of what may or may not have happened to these children from their deceased and perhaps sexually perverse tutors? The children's memories or imaginings of what did or didn't happen? The film unfolds with some of the most beautiful cinematography in history Freddie Francis. The Innocents requires fullsize screening or at least letterboxing to fully appreciate the visual poetry supporting the suspense.Jack Clayton's production and direction rank among the finest in screen history.The miraculous work he pulls from his cast is uniformly jawdropping.Despite Deborah Kerr's ravishing natural beauty one never recalls even a single performance in which she was Deobrah Kerr she was always the character  whether a nun Heaven Knows Mr. Allison an adulterous sexpot From Here to Eternity a Tennessee Williams underdog Night of the Iguana a strongwilled sopranosinging teacher The King and I or a romantic comedienne An Affair to Remember.Contrast Kerr's beauty talent and career with Elizabeth Taylor say. Equally ravishing one was always aware of watching Miss Taylor act. Even in stunt casting like her Martha in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? or the debacle of Cleopatra. Miss Kerr is the real thing. So are Megs Jenkins Mrs. Grose Martin Stephens Miles and Pamela Franklin Flora.The story and filming progressively grow more audacious until the last heartbreaking sequence between Kerr and young Stephens.By then of course our hearts and minds are so thoroughly complicit in the goings on that the final cry heard on the soundtrack before we are left again in the blank black void of our own hearts and imaginings at all we've just lived through before credits begin to roll leaves us with perhaps the most haunting of all cinematic experiences.Why? Because we have made the film as it went along as fully involved as any character in it  our own minds contributing all that's unspoken and unseen.The Innocents is the Citizen Kane of its genre. And like Citizen Kane it transcends genres.This is an immortal achievement by a team of filmic artists at their peaks. A revelation of what film can be.".

This before a single production credit has appeared. We are watching a shadow a nothing. And our minds demand we fill it with something.Thus does Jack Clayton's astonishing The Innocents begin. Certainly other films have used the same opening device. But none with The Innocents' payoff.For as it develops based on Henry James' The Turn of the Screw The Innocents' themes are What do you see? What do you believe is true? Is it? Who is 'innocent?' The children? The nanny? You? The emotional undertow is inescapable perhaps more so because twothirds of the trio of protagonists are children in peril always a surefire hook.But in peril from what exactly? Deborah Kerr's possible paranoia  schizophrenia? Ghosts? Or our own powerful perhaps lurid imaginings of what may or may not have happened to these children from their deceased and perhaps sexually perverse tutors? The children's memories or imaginings of what did or didn't happen? The film unfolds with some of the most beautiful cinematography in history Freddie Francis. The Innocents requires fullsize screening or at least letterboxing to fully appreciate the visual poetry supporting the suspense.Jack Clayton's production and direction rank among the finest in screen history.The miraculous work he pulls from his cast is uniformly jawdropping.Despite Deborah Kerr's ravishing natural beauty one never recalls even a single performance in which she was Deobrah Kerr she was always the character  whether a nun Heaven Knows Mr. Allison an adulterous sexpot From Here to Eternity a Tennessee Williams underdog Night of the Iguana a strongwilled sopranosinging teacher The King and I or a romantic comedienne An Affair to Remember.Contrast Kerr's beauty talent and career with Elizabeth Taylor say. Equally ravishing one was always aware of watching Miss Taylor act. Even in stunt casting like her Martha in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? or the debacle of Cleopatra. Miss Kerr is the real thing. So are Megs Jenkins Mrs. Grose Martin Stephens Miles and Pamela Franklin Flora.The story and filming progressively grow more audacious until the last heartbreaking sequence between Kerr and young Stephens.By then of course our hearts and minds are so thoroughly complicit in the goings on that the final cry heard on the soundtrack before we are left again in the blank black void of our own hearts and imaginings at all we've just lived through before credits begin to roll leaves us with perhaps the most haunting of all cinematic experiences.Why? Because we have made the film as it went along as fully involved as any character in it  our own minds contributing all that's unspoken and unseen.The Innocents is the Citizen Kane of its genre. And like Citizen Kane it transcends genres.This is an immortal achievement by a team of filmic artists at their peaks. A revelation of what film can be.";

	schema:reviewBody "Miss Giddens Deborah Kerr a nineteenth century British governess is appointed to take care of two children Flora Pamela Franklin and Miles Martin Stephens. Upon arriving at the bleak mansion she meets the housekeeper Megs Jenkins and also Flora. Miles arrives a few days later from school. The children seem like little angels but following a series of bizarre events and examples of the children's wicked impulses Miss Giddens begins to suspect that all is not what it seems.This dark and atmospheric tale is a wonderful example of how to create an admirable horror movie that although has violent undertones features very little violence when all is said and done. The Innocents' is certainly a psychological horror movie which leaves in doubt how much of the inexplicable happenings are supernatural and how much is in the mind of the protagonist Miss Giddens. Director Jack Clayton uses some astonishing visual trickery and ghostly effects to create and maintain a very unsettling atmosphere almost from the very beginning. A number of effective ghostly apparitions are displayed on screen during the movie from varying distances which gives The Innocents' a constant foreboding atmosphere. The way some scene changes blend with the end of the previous scene are rather disconcerting and almost dream like as there are long lingering images once again wholly adding to the effect. Some of the dialogue may seem a little unrealistic but in general the movie is well scripted and features a few very dramatic scenes thanks to some delightfully written dialogue and strong acting performances. William Archibald and Truman Capote both won awards for their script writing.The only real fault with The Innocents' is how fast the film moves along. Miss Giddens seems to realise the truth of what is happening all too quickly. This does not make The Innocents' less enjoyable but it would have been nice to have had an extra ten minutes or so explaining the story to us a bit more. The Innocents' has a sustained tone of dread throughout the movie. It seems that Miss Giddens is unable to move without being confronted by some spectre or seeing some rather peculiar behaviour exhibited from the children. I'd compare the dark atmosphere with that of The Haunting' 1963 both movies are comparable in the way they are presented and are both aesthetically pleasing. The acting was of a high standard though one must forgive the two young performers if they occasionally seemed to overact. Martin Stephens was very good as Miles playing his sinister part with an awful power even though the character's superciliousness became somewhat of an annoyance. Megs Jenkins was also delightful as the anxious housekeeper Mrs. Grose. From the moment Mrs. Grose is first introduced the viewer can begin to suspect something. Jenkins came across as a friendly but scared woman who is desperate to maintain decorum in the house. A fine performance suited her character marvellously. One must also mention Deborah Kerr's fine performance as Miss Giddens as she played it with the right balance of inquisitiveness and fear. Deborah's dramatic performance certainly helped make this movie fantastic and one sympathises with her deeply as the film ends on the sombre and heartbreaking note that it does.The Innocents' is an elegant and stylish movie that is certainly worth watching. Fans of The Omen' and Village of the Damned' should enjoy this as well as any fan of dark atmospheric horror. A strong screenplay fine performances and breathtaking visual trickery make this movie a very pleasing addition to the horror genre and I highly recommend it to all. The Innocents' was able to scoop a BAFTA Award British Academy of Film and Television Awards for Best British Film as well as a BAFTA nomination for Jack Clayton which he thoroughly deserved. My rating for The Innocents'  810.".

	schema:headline " A superb psychological  supernatural horror film";
	schema:reviewBody "Based on the 1898 novella The Turn of the Screw by Henry James this is a superb psychological  supernatural horror film. I have not read the original story but I understand that it sticks quite closely to it. The film is imbued with a wonderful sense of tension caused not so much by the admittedly very effective and memorable visuals but by the ambiguity regarding the exact nature of the events being portrayed specifically whether they have a natural or a supernatural origin. It has a first rate script by William Archibald Truman Capote and John Mortimer and the excellent direction of Jack Clayton is certainly up to the task. Much of the credit for the film's atmosphere has to go to the beautiful black and white cinematography of Freddie Francis a master of his craft and a great director in his own right. I was particularly impressed the use of deep focus on numerous occasions and the interaction of light and shadow throughout the film.The film stars Deborah Kerr probably my favourite actress of her generation in an utterly fantastic performance as the fascinating character Miss Giddens. In spite of the fact that she has no previous experience she is hired to be the governess of the orphans Miles and Flora by their emotionally distant uncle who would rather spend his time cavorting in London and elsewhere than raise his charges. Miss Giddens loves children and looks forward to bonding with Miles and Flora over the course of many years but almost as soon as she arrives at the luxurious country estate Bly strange things start to happen. She hears voices and she sees figures that cannot possibly be there and which no one else seems to be able to see. The figures in question are a man and a woman which Miss Giddens believes to be the ghosts of her predecessor Miss Jessel and the uncle's valet Peter Quint. She learns from the housekeeper Mrs. Grose that the two of them were lovers and were not great believers in discretion since their behaviour left very little to the imagination of the other servants and possibly even Miles and Flora. After Quint's death Miss Jessel fell into a deep depression and committed suicide. Since Miles followed Quint around like a puppy and Miss Jessel was a mother figure to Flora Miss Giddens concludes that both their strange behaviour and her experiences are being caused by Quint and Jessel taking control of the children. However Mrs. Grose is rather less convinced.One of the major reasons why I found the film so effective is that I could never make up my mind as to whether Miss Giddens was entirely correct about Bly being haunted by the ghosts of dead servants or whether she is insane. There is ample evidence to support both scenarios but whenever I thought that I had decided on one of them something else happened to make me reconsider. For instance in the film's most frightening scene Miss Giddens sees Quint at the window and his cold piercing eyes make quite an impression on her. However she had discovered his photograph in the attic only minutes earlier so he was certainly on her mind. She thought that he was the man that she had seen on top of the tower earlier but his face was not clearly seen so her mind may have been filling in the blanks. On the other hand the children are very very odd and there are a few moments where I thought that the supernatural explanation was the more likely one. Miles in particular is a rather disturbing child who is far too mature for his age complimenting Miss Giddens in a very flirtatious manner and even giving her an inappropriate kiss on the lips at one point. As Miss Giddens thought he may be possessed by Quint's ghost. Then again it may be because he spent so much time with Quint when he was alive and he is imitating his inappropriate behaviour since he has no idea how to act around women. Flora is the more normal of the two children comparatively speaking but there are numerous moments in which it seems likely that she is in contact with or even possessed by Jessel's ghost. While the film most certainly belongs to Deborah Kerr it has a strong supporting cast. Martin Stephens presumably cast based on the strength of his performance as David Zellaby in Village of the Damned 1960 is incredibly creepy as Miles and it is easy to see why Miss Giddens suggests that there is something otherworldly about him. Pamela Franklin manages to be both sweet and a little offputting as Flora. Her innocent face may hide a mind that has been corrupted by either natural or supernatural forces. Peter Wyngarde does not have any dialogue but he makes an unforgettable impression as Quint in the aforementioned window scene. Megs Jenkins is excellent as Mrs. Grose who becomes increasingly concerned about Miss Giddens' mental health as the film progresses and perhaps with good reason. Michael Redgrave has a great cameo as the uncle who is mentioned throughout the film but only actually appears in the opening scene. I think that Mrs. Grose and the uncle are the only characters whose roles are entirely straightforward incidentally.Overall this is an engrossing thoughtprovoking and incredibly clever horror film which I have not been able to stop thinking about since I watched it. The title was very well chosen as it is unclear who exactly it refers to which is rather appropriate under the circumstances.".

	schema:reviewBody "The secret to mastering the horror genre is atmosphere. Modern directors can keep their unrealistic monsters their overuse of gore their sudden cheap scares  great horror is all about atmosphere. For this very reason Alejandro Amenbar's 'The Others 2001' is one of the finer chillers to have come our way in the last decade and it's not altogether unsurprising to discover that the film borrowed extensively from an earlier film Jack Clayton's masterful ghost story 'The Innocents 1961.' Adapted from Henry James' 1898 novella The Turn of the Screw the film's screenplay was cowritten by William Archibald and Truman Capote. Like James' original story which has been endlessly debated by literary critics for over a century Clayton's film has after all these decades retained its tone of ambiguity. Is it a ghost story? Is it a psychological exploration of a sexuallyrepressed woman? Whichever way you interpret it 'The Innocents' remains one of the horror genre's landmark achievements and the secrets of an old dark mansion have rarely been more sinister nor indeed more beautiful.The elegant Deborah Kerr stars as Miss Giddens the reserved daughter of a country parson who agrees to become governess to two orphaned children in the care of a wealthy indifferent businessman Michael Redgrave. After travelling to a remote country mansion Miss Giddens meets Flora Pamela Franklin a warm and vivacious young girl with a fondness for her pet tortoise. However when Flora's brother Miles Martin Stephens is mysteriously expelled from school and sent home early life at the house begins to take a sinister turn despite the boy's charming and seeminglyinnocent demeanour. Peculiar apparitions begin to appear supplemented by an unnerving selection of unidentifiable creaks voices and music. Large homes it seems breed large secrets and it doesn't take long before Bly House reveals its tragic past a scandal involving the former valet Peter Quint Peter Wyngarde and Miss Giddens' predecessor Miss Jessel Clytie Jessop who were romantically involved and who both died in bizarre circumstances. Could the mansion's past long thought forgotten be returning to haunt and corrupt its current residents?Placing Kerr in the main role was a very deliberate and effective casting decision. Few actresses are able to project such grace and reverence and consequently the audience is expected to treat her character's suppositions as sensible and wellfounded suspicions. But indeed is it sensible to suppose that two former lovers to allow their continued romance have inhabited the souls of two young children? Why has Miss Giddens alone witnessed these perplexing manifestations? The participation of author Truman Capote contributes elements of Southern Gothic literature and the perceived haunting might justifiably be approached as the metaphorical personification of Miss Giddens' repressed sexual desires. Having endured a confined childhood with a smothering religious father she has taught herself to suppress these desires and her feelings towards Michael Redgrave's prosperous businessman instead manifest themselves in the form of the ghost of Peter Quint a handsome rogue who represents everything from whom her parson father had shielded her Quint's former lover Miss Jessel could conceivably have been her in different circumstances.In the film's most shocking and unsettling twist Miss Giddens' illdirected sexual desires transfer themselves from the absent businessman to his roguishlycharming nephew Miles a prepubescent boy. Their frictional relationship which must have caused severe headaches for the censors culminates in a alarminglysensual kiss which Miss Giddens' feebly returns in the film's final moments. If we were to exclude for the moment the possibility of ghostly possession the perceived corruption of the two young children could be viewed as a result of their abuse by the nowdeceased lovers and it is strongly implied that the children may have been present when the pair performed sexual acts it is only when forced to confront these memories that the children finally deteriorate into hysterics and permanent emotional damage is done. Both children are excellent in difficult roles but Martin Stephens is the genuine sensation approaching the role with maturity and assuredness that suggests an actor twice his age. Stephens recognises perfectly that young Miles should not be an openly sinister character and yet every charming complement is undertoned by the subtlest hint of sardonic menace.At the end of the day whether one accepts 'The Innocents' as a psychological thriller or a traditional ghost story the unambiguous truth is that Jack Clayton's film is brilliant. The blackandwhite Cinemascope photography by Freddie Francis who also worked on 'The Elephant Man 1980' and has directed his own share of films is breathtaking to behold with many scenes seemingly lit only by the flickering flame of a single candle. The sound design particularly in a virtuoso sequence of things that go bump in the night employs bird and insect calls wind and faceless human voices to evoke the desired atmosphere and Georges Auric's musical score complements the tone beautifully. The film is similar in style to Robert Wise's hauntedhouse chiller 'The Haunting 1963' itself one of the horror genre's greatest entries. Surprisingly underseen in most circles 'The Innocents' deserves to be lauded among cinema's finest horror movies not just due to its extensive creepiness but because of the film's impeccable artistry and thematic depth. What a treat this would be on the cinema screen.".

	onyx:emotionText "The secret to mastering the horror genre is atmosphere. Modern directors can keep their unrealistic monsters their overuse of gore their sudden cheap scares  great horror is all about atmosphere. For this very reason Alejandro Amenbar's 'The Others 2001' is one of the finer chillers to have come our way in the last decade and it's not altogether unsurprising to discover that the film borrowed extensively from an earlier film Jack Clayton's masterful ghost story 'The Innocents 1961.' Adapted from Henry James' 1898 novella The Turn of the Screw the film's screenplay was cowritten by William Archibald and Truman Capote. Like James' original story which has been endlessly debated by literary critics for over a century Clayton's film has after all these decades retained its tone of ambiguity. Is it a ghost story? Is it a psychological exploration of a sexuallyrepressed woman? Whichever way you interpret it 'The Innocents' remains one of the horror genre's landmark achievements and the secrets of an old dark mansion have rarely been more sinister nor indeed more beautiful.The elegant Deborah Kerr stars as Miss Giddens the reserved daughter of a country parson who agrees to become governess to two orphaned children in the care of a wealthy indifferent businessman Michael Redgrave. After travelling to a remote country mansion Miss Giddens meets Flora Pamela Franklin a warm and vivacious young girl with a fondness for her pet tortoise. However when Flora's brother Miles Martin Stephens is mysteriously expelled from school and sent home early life at the house begins to take a sinister turn despite the boy's charming and seeminglyinnocent demeanour. Peculiar apparitions begin to appear supplemented by an unnerving selection of unidentifiable creaks voices and music. Large homes it seems breed large secrets and it doesn't take long before Bly House reveals its tragic past a scandal involving the former valet Peter Quint Peter Wyngarde and Miss Giddens' predecessor Miss Jessel Clytie Jessop who were romantically involved and who both died in bizarre circumstances. Could the mansion's past long thought forgotten be returning to haunt and corrupt its current residents?Placing Kerr in the main role was a very deliberate and effective casting decision. Few actresses are able to project such grace and reverence and consequently the audience is expected to treat her character's suppositions as sensible and wellfounded suspicions. But indeed is it sensible to suppose that two former lovers to allow their continued romance have inhabited the souls of two young children? Why has Miss Giddens alone witnessed these perplexing manifestations? The participation of author Truman Capote contributes elements of Southern Gothic literature and the perceived haunting might justifiably be approached as the metaphorical personification of Miss Giddens' repressed sexual desires. Having endured a confined childhood with a smothering religious father she has taught herself to suppress these desires and her feelings towards Michael Redgrave's prosperous businessman instead manifest themselves in the form of the ghost of Peter Quint a handsome rogue who represents everything from whom her parson father had shielded her Quint's former lover Miss Jessel could conceivably have been her in different circumstances.In the film's most shocking and unsettling twist Miss Giddens' illdirected sexual desires transfer themselves from the absent businessman to his roguishlycharming nephew Miles a prepubescent boy. Their frictional relationship which must have caused severe headaches for the censors culminates in a alarminglysensual kiss which Miss Giddens' feebly returns in the film's final moments. If we were to exclude for the moment the possibility of ghostly possession the perceived corruption of the two young children could be viewed as a result of their abuse by the nowdeceased lovers and it is strongly implied that the children may have been present when the pair performed sexual acts it is only when forced to confront these memories that the children finally deteriorate into hysterics and permanent emotional damage is done. Both children are excellent in difficult roles but Martin Stephens is the genuine sensation approaching the role with maturity and assuredness that suggests an actor twice his age. Stephens recognises perfectly that young Miles should not be an openly sinister character and yet every charming complement is undertoned by the subtlest hint of sardonic menace.At the end of the day whether one accepts 'The Innocents' as a psychological thriller or a traditional ghost story the unambiguous truth is that Jack Clayton's film is brilliant. The blackandwhite Cinemascope photography by Freddie Francis who also worked on 'The Elephant Man 1980' and has directed his own share of films is breathtaking to behold with many scenes seemingly lit only by the flickering flame of a single candle. The sound design particularly in a virtuoso sequence of things that go bump in the night employs bird and insect calls wind and faceless human voices to evoke the desired atmosphere and Georges Auric's musical score complements the tone beautifully.

	schema:reviewBody "In the 1960's people just didn't talk about child sexual abuse. They also didn't depict it outright in movies. The fact that this movie was cast in the setting of Victorian England further demonstrates its intent to highlight an era of extreme sexual repression when feelings and emotions that didn't fit with the social and cultural mores of the time were subjugated to evil thoughts and deeds.Miss Giddens was a perfect example of a woman who was raised in a highly religious and fundamentalist environment who could never admit that sexual longings and urges exist in herself. Nor could she ever conceptualize how young children could suffer abuse from observing violent and sexual acts committed by adults in their presence. Whether there was any direct abuse to the children is speculative but anyone who has had any training or education in the field of psychology knows that vicarious trauma can be transmitted to children who witness sexually deviant and violent acts.Miles exhibits classic sociopathic behaviors at school and we're given clues to this when we're told the other children are afraid of him and Miles himself starts to admit that he hurts things. There is also the scene where Miles hides a dove with a broken neck under his pillow and Miss Giddens assumes was killed by Quint's ghost but in actuality Miles is committing a classic behavior that many children of sexual abuse do at a young age which is to kill or maim animals.Individuals who have been sexually abused are often described as seductive which is more about lack of clarity around boundaries and intimacy. A child's ability to develop strong boundaries around their sexuality can be destroyed from sexual abuse and physical violence. We can see that Miss Giddens is drawn into the seductive nature of both children but especially Miles. As her own sexual repression and desires are projected onto Miles as she is pulled into a desire that causes her lose all her senses about the fact he is a child and not the sexually deviant yet desirous Quint. Her desire is so strong that she allows herself to be drawn into an inappropriate kiss from Miles further demonstrating that the child's sexual boundaries are lost and so too are hers.In the end Miss Giddens forces Miles to confront a memory which is aptly stated by Mrs. Gros when she attempts to point out to Miss Giddens that the little girl is overwrought not from witnessing the presence of a ghost but from a bad memory. Mrs. Gros knows that these children witnessed unspeakable horrors and seems to be often taken aback when discussing these issues with Miss Giddens. Miss Giddens immediately considers these events as evil abominations of ghostly presence rather Mrs. Gros' apparent sense of real incidents that are too taboo to discuss out loud.The fact that Miles dies from the knowledge that he forced to confront is more of a psychological death as many children of abuse suffer a death of the soul after such abuse. In its excellent dramatic and cinematic effects The Innocents documents events that are too unspeakable to present outright. The emotions and psychological impact of such events are brilliantly portrayed and touch the viewer somewhere deep in the psyche.".

Their characters are portrayed as nice young children but at the same time there is something sinister about them and that is where the tale draws a lot of it's suspense and mystery from. Deborah Kerr also shines as the watcher of the children. We know from the outset that her character loves children which makes her plight believable to the audience when she does all she can to save the children from the evil she believes is haunting them. We never really know what is happening in the movie the children's viewpoints contradict that of Miss Giddens and as there is evidence to support what both sides say along with evidence to support that of the contrary the mystery is able to build itself through this and that therefore along with the empathy we are able to feel for Mrs Giddens due to the nature of her character the film is able to remain interesting and suspenseful for it's running time.The thing that this film does best is in capturing a dark and foreboding atmosphere. Through the way the story is portrayed and the beautiful cinematography Jack Clayton is able to create scenes and sequences that are genuinely frightening and suspenseful less is more rarely works to a great effect but here it does. The 'ghosts' have very little screen time but the time they do have is powerful and memorable enough to make it seem like much more. The film's creepy and menacing atmosphere never delves into violence or gore and relies solely on the story itself and the Gothic atmospheric setting and that is much to the film's credit.If you liked the slightly later 60's paranoid horror films such as Carnival of Souls or The Haunting then this film is definitely one to check out.".

If you ever go for a trip to England go and see the wonderful location Sheffield Park Garden in Sussex. This is not only an intelligent and incredible atmospheric film it is a weird journey into a spiritual world.

Or it could be seen as something that's more psychological which is far more unsettling. THE INNOCENTS is one of the most intelligent horror movies I've seen. It's got the right spooky atmosphere and some downright chilling sequences the blackandwhite cinematography by Freddie Francis is just perfect but I'll remember it more for its psychological view of its characters. Are the ghosts real or are they figments of a fractured mind? The movie takes it as either and comes up with a far more intelligent effort than the usual assemblyline horror. The story is set in 19th Century England. A governess named Miss Giddens Deborah Kerr in an emotionally distressed performance who is employed in an the isolated Bly estate in the countryside. There she is tasked to look after two children Flora Pamela Franklin and Miles Martin Stephens who was originally in boarding school until Ms. Giddens receives an unexpected news that he was expelled for his behavior. This comes as a mystery to her because both children are mostly cheerful and wellbehaved... or so it may seem. And who are those two people a woman and man that Ms. Giddens seem to be seeing throughout the estate. THE INNOCENTS is a number of substantial creeps achieved by building up the suspense than simply outright scares. The appearances of the spectres themselves are more creepy than they are shocking and that's just as effective. This is also an example of the classic ghost movies where walking down a dark hallway accompanied only by a candelabra are more chilling than actual scares. But I guess the real treat for me about the film is how complex it is. The movie doesn't totally dismiss the supernatural in fact it deepens it. In the end the movie can be seen as both a chilling ghost story and a disturbing psychological analysis. Horror fans must see this!".

	schema:reviewBody "Based on Henry James' novel The Turn Of The Screw The Innocents is a thoroughly absorbing chiller that pot boils with almost unbearably knowing glee as to what it's doing to the viewer. Deborah Kerr stars as Miss Giddens the lady hired by Michael Redgrave to act as governess to his young niece and nephew. We find ourselves in Victorian England out on some country estate at Bly Mansion where the children are angelic and enchanting in equal measure. Yet there's an eeriness hanging over this place and it starts to seemingly play tricks on Miss Giddens' mind she thinks she sees and hears things. It's only when she talks to housekeeper Mrs Grose Megs Jenkins that she starts to piece things together but worryingly it's the children that appear to be at the root of the problems. Aren't they?Kerr is fabulous here carrying an elegant gait around with her she does a fine line in borderline hysteria caused by something unknown bubbling away under the surface. Filmed on location at Sheffield Park and Gardens and the Bluebell Railway in East Sussex this lovely Gothic chiller does justice to its literate source. Being coscripted by Truman Capote William Archibald and John Mortimer that's really not much of a surprise in truth though is it?! Choosing to play on the viewers imagination more than pandering to shocks director Jack Clayton superbly creates a sort of itchy like sense of dread. He's fully aware that here in and around the Gothic abode it's more often than not what you don't see  or think you see  that is more frightening.Ace cinematographer Freddie Francis does a marvellous job with the photography with deep focus and shadows the order of the day and with Clayton sharp cutting and dallying with angles and Georges Auric's sinister music floating around the estate like some spectral peeping tom the atmosphere created is akin to claustrophobic foreboding. In many ways it's actually an uncomfortable watch but for all the right reasons the themes that rumble away are grim in texture the question of malevolent evil or otherwise is a constant and fittingly the finale offers up a shocking denouement that is nigh on impossible to shake off. With great performances from the child actors Pamela FranklinMartin Stephens sealing the deal The Innocents is one of the smartest and most effective chillers to ever have come out of Britain. 910".

	schema:reviewBody "Jack Clayton's The Innocents is a wonderfully atmospheric film translation of Henry James' classic Victorian Era ghost story The Turn of the Screw. Highlighted by stunning blackandwhite cinematography from Freddie Francis who later worked on David Lynch's The Elephant Man and fabulous set designs The Innocents stays very close to James' text while adding a few cinematic elements like the music box highly suggestive visual symbolism and the reading of a macabre poem as it weaves its tale of a governess Deborah Kerr trying to unravel the mystery surrounding some strange apparitions on a lavish country estate where she cares for two young children displaying some odd behavior.The brilliance of the film and the original story is in the ambiguity. There are two logical interpretations the governess is slowly going mad or the estate is haunted. Regardless of which interpretation you take there is still plenty of room to intertwine the disturbing Freudian subtexts involving the governess' repressed emotions and what the children have actually seen heard known or experienced. I can't think of a more refined or subtle exploration of what happens when an adult transfers or projects their own psychological hangups onto children in their charge than James' quietly suspenseful potboiler.The performances are a bit melodramatic at times but note perfect in their proper context with Kerr prissy but sympathetic and the children expertly performing the sudden turns from innocent angels to sinister manipulators. The Innocents does feature some dated sound effects that come across as annoying rather than creepy but the visuals and the shrieking climax are what will stick with the viewer. Unlike recent and for the most part very worthy modern updates on the story like The Others and The Orphanage where a twist ending reveals the only true interpretation of the ghastly events The Innocents leaves it all to the imagination of the viewer. The imagination it seems can be a very dangerous thing with which to play.".

Truman Capote was central to the screenplay and he unequivocally asserted the reality of the ghosts. It has been fashionable for years to make the story a demented hallucination of the sexually repressed governess. 1 The expulsion of Miles from school is the linchpin of the whole sewer of corruption emanating from the ghosts. Both novel and film clearly insinuate that Miles has been corrupting his classmates in some unspeakable way. What else could be the source of this evil in the angelic Miles than the ghosts? 2 In both book and film the governess recognizes the ghosts  people she has never known or seen and who are dead as is affirmed by the housekeeper. Even if you narrow it down to incidents that are both in the book and film there are other examples as well of the reality of the ghosts. The susceptibility of the governess to being haunted is another question entirely. James has spoken how the real terror of ghosts is best evoked by showing the effects on those being haunted not a lot of overblown effects. Recent books and film both need to remember this.".

	schema:reviewBody "..to modify Clint Eastwood's time honored line. A film adaptation of The Turn of the Screw this is the story of a governess Miss Giddens Deborah Kerr hired to look after the orphaned niece and nephew of a wealthy man. He has had custody of them since infancy and simply can't be bothered to be a parent to them. He thus gives Miss Giddens complete authority over the children and the household of the country estate where they live. Soon though Miss Giddens realizes that there are ghosts in the house  two to be exact. The housekeeper tells her of Quint and Miss Giddens' predecessor Miss Jessel who had an indiscreet affair with Quint also an employee in the household. Quint died and Miss Jessel drowned herself in her grief. This film is in the same league as The Haunting in that you don't actually see that much. The suspense is in the music cinematography and atmosphere as a whole. There are a few reflections of the ghosts in windows and one very creepy scene by the lake the one scene that has stayed with me since I saw this one as a child. Giddens' interest is in protecting the children but she is a bit dithery a touch unbalanced and maybe not too bright. She makes up her mind that the ghosts are possessing the childrenseems to be making up what she has to do to rid the children of the ghosts and in fact she seems to be making up all of what has to be done as she goes along. She never stops to think what powers the ghosts might possess and her decision to charge full speed ahead at exorcising them leads to a bad outcome one in which she seems genuinely surprised.All of this I have just mentioned is why I truly think that The Innocents is Deborah Kerr's finest moment  she pulls off depicting this at times irritating and possibly daft and certainly hysterical and unhinged woman so well that I still liked her and I was touched at the end by her pain instead of being angry with her for causing the bad outcome of the exorcism. It's a standard Kerr role with touches of her various nuns governesses and stuffy Brits from earlier films so her seeming effortlessness in the part is an explainable plus but in The Innocents she really reaches inside and pulls out something deeper to show us that her every moment is genuine.The children were absolutely perfect in their roles which begs the question why was Pamela Frankin who played the female child here put in so many horror roles? Meg Jenkins plays it docile and down to earth as the housekeeper who befriends Giddens. You can tell she thinks the woman is daft even though she has heard and seen things that make her believe that Quint and Miss Jessel are still around in some way. She tries to give Giddens some of her wisdom from a lifetime of taking care of children but when her ideas are dismissed in the end she just follows orders like the servant she's always been.".

This is the movie which I see as a landmark for slow burner horror movies and the movie to which I always compare other slow burner movies.One of the surprising things about this movie are the performances of the children. I am never satisfied with performances of children in horror movies. What may be a creepy child seems often lame to me. But in this movie the children often seem possessed. And not in the over the top way of many other movie but in the sense that these children seem like they are not aware of what they are saying they seem controlled. That is not apparent in the beginning of course but later on it becomes clear that there is something wrong with the children. I know many people are divided on the exact interpretation of the ending and most of the movie. When I read the synopsis of the original story I understand one thing. Abuse. Abuse is supposedly hinted at in Turn of the screw. It is probable for abused children to develop split personalities talk and behave like their abusers. When you look at in that angle the possibility that it could all be real is available. Not that it has to be possession exactly. It could be mental illness for the children. I don't exactly buy that the governess was crazy that is too simplistic when you consider all that we see in the movie. Even if you think that what can explain the behaviour of the children? Personally I look at it as a straight forward creepy ghost story with the ghosts being able to control the minds of the people who they influenced while alive.The movie is incredibly atmospheric. Every scene near the lake are excellent for example. No over the top scenes or jump scares here. The music is mostly minimalist except in few key scenes. And that creepy song is played throughout. The performances of the children and Deborah Kerr are amazing. I have not seen other movies of hers but she totally floored me in this one. There is a stylish ending which again may be vague for most people but it is highly effective. Even for today's standards there are certain elements which people may find disturbing. But there are no scenes of violence or nudity. This has ended in my top 10 horror movies. 1010".

Production values are excellent even if the script strays a bit too much into fiction to tell its story.Languid  languorous Greta Garbo slinks across the screen like a large cat almost purring her dialogue rather than speaking it. Utterly fascinating it is easy to see why she dominated her generation  why her legend still endures. Finally coming fully alive during a penultimate murder scene Garbo exhibits the frenetic energy of which she was capable on screen. Fortunately she is only required to dance once leaving to the imagination the full impact of Mata Hari's original private performances.Ramon Novarro who receives coequal billing with Garbo had been an important movie celebrity far longer than she but her rising sun tended to obscure most other stars in her orbit and Novarro has to work hard to get much notice in their joint scenes .As always MGM's chameleon actor this time he plays a Russian gives a very competent performance but as a romantic pair they make a rather unusual couple  which simply means that Novarro's sexual ambiguity is perfectly mirrored by Garbo's intrinsic androgyny.Lewis Stone is quite effective as a sinister German spymaster. C. Henry Gordon gives some nice moments as a tough French policeman. Lionel Barrymore is also on hand flamboyantly overacting as a Russian general who delivers military secrets to Mata Hari in exchange for her favours he apparently decided Garbo wasn't going to steal the entire picture and he puts up an outrageous display of ham acting.Karen Morley  Frank Reicher appear as German agents who learn the price of becoming no longer useful to Berlin movie mavens will recognize an uncredited Mischa Auer in the opening scene as an unfortunate victim of Mata's wiles.Born to a prosperous hatter in The Netherlands on August 7 1876 Margeretha Geertruida Zelle was convent schooled and later attended a teacher's college. In 1895 she married Britishborn Campbell MacLeod a captain in the Dutch colonial army and lived with him in Java  Sumatra from 1897 until 1902.After their divorce Margeretha settled in Paris where she changed her name to the Malay 'Mata Hari' which means 'eye of the day.' Fabricating a mystique of exotic mysticism the beautiful Mata supported herself quite nicely as a courtesan and erotic dancer giving special performances around Europe to delighted clientele. Several military officers of various nations counted themselves among her lovers.The details of Mata's involvement in espionage still remain rather vague. It's possible she entered the German Secret Service as early as 1907 but she later is thought to have worked for the French Secret Service as well. As a citizen of neutral Holland she was still able to travel freely after the commencement of the War and it is alleged that she garnered secrets from Allied officers for her German employers. It was the British who tipped off the French as to Mata's supposed activities while in Belgium and she was arrested upon her return to France.At the court martial trial she could only be found guilty of giving outdated information to the Germans which she claimed was entirely innocent. However it was more than enough to imprison her for three months before her final rendezvous with a firing squad on October 15 1917.".

Lewis Stone also makes good use of his limited screen time and Karen Morley has some memorable moments as another spy.The story probably has little in common with the historical facts and while the historical character is an interesting one it seems certain that Garbo's character is more so combining her obvious appeal with a depth of feeling and a complicated set of priorities as few other actresses could have done.

One watches a film like this to enjoy the old stars in action including Lionel Barrymore hamming it up sans wheelchair. Though Garbo has never been one of my favorites I enjoyed her performance here she smiled quite a bit and never once said she wanted to be alone. Most of the time she just wanted to be with handsome Ramon Novarro and who could blame her? Funniest moment to me Ramon's character is obviously Catholic as Ramon was in real life and he has promised his mother to keep a candle lit before this Madonna icon and never let the flame go out because if it goes out then evil will descend upon him. So Mata Greta tells Alexi Ramon that his room is too brightly lit he goes around and turns off all the lights  except for the candle. So then she asks him to blow out the candle. If I am everything to you then you will blow it out. He asks her in shock But why would you ask me to? a perfectly reasonable question she doesn't answer. He ends up rejecting the sacred for the profane blowing the flame out and the room goes into darkness. The camera pulls away and we are supposed to know instinctively that they are making love all through the night. And of course evil descends on Ramon's character and he goes blind but what the heck this is Hollywood.Watch it for the stars not for history. If you want history read a book.".

The sad thing here is that Novarro and Garbo were never again paired.  A great and powerful film.";

It's Paris during WW I and there are spies all over the place and she's the most independent and fearless of them all cool and heartless using men easily as she does General Shubin Lionel Barrymore until she meets the handsome young Russian aviator Rosanoff Ramon Navarro who has excellent posture melty eyes and a Spanish accent. Navarro is all pleasing surfaces. In the course of being irresistible she steals secrets from him and accidentally falls in love. This causes problems she has to kill Shubin to protect Rosanoff and she has to part with the aviator. His plane crashes but she finds him when he is blinded in hospital and tells him sweet lies and she protects him in court and faces the firing squad. The movie is purely a Garbo vehicle and she is fine breezing through the clichs and the bad writing and acting cool and then passionate. She is of course compellingly lovely. When she is not dancing she moves sinuously mostly. She has an odd carriage when walking slowly through a room leading with her head bent forward her neck arched her shoulders one or two inches from a shrug. Otherwise she reclines langorously and gazes at other characters with a smile impossible to read.".

She turns him into an old fool.But she herself gets good and foolish when she meets up with young Russian aviator Ramon Novarro. When she herself falls in love it proves to be her undoing. There are a couple of really good performances here by a pair of ruthless adversaries. Lewis Stone is her spymaster and not a man to trifle with. See how he deals with another of his reluctant employees played by Karen Morley. He's far from the wise and good Judge Hardy in this role. His opposite number is C.

He did redeem himself as the number one lead in The Cat and the Fiddle 1934 in which he was billed above Jeanette MacDonald but alas his slow downward spiral from his seemingly secure position as Metro's number one lead began with Mata Hari. Novarro's role is not large and when you think back about the film it's Garbo herself plus Lionel Barrymore and to a lesser extent C. Henry Gordon who claim all our attention. Even in Novarro's brief scene with an unbilled Cecil Cunningham it's Miss Cunningham who not only gains all our attention but stays in our memory. If you've just seen the movie think back! It's Miss Cunningham who dominates the action not only by what she says but by the way director Fitzmaurice and photographer William Daniels have placed her centerframe. As you might expect Mata Hari is an exotic Garbo vehicle from start to finish! Incidentally Garbo herself dubs all her dialogue in the French version!".

Having already played a lady spy in the silent melodrama THE MYSTERIOUS LADY MGM 1928 this particular stature and situations that occurred are nothing new here. By contrast from fictional to actual character portrayed this is a somewhat improved story overall scripted by Benjamin Glazer and Leo Birinski and highlighted by interesting casting of Mexican actor Ramon Rovarro in support.Opening title In 1917 warridden France dealt summarily with traitors and spies. Traitors and spies are demonstrated in the opening scene as DuBois C. Henry Gordon chief of the spy bureau gives orders at the firing squad the execution of three traitors the third being a condemned man Mischa Auer refusing to reveal any information about a notorious woman Mata Hari who happens to be a great threat to France. Mata Hari a spy working under secret orders for Adriani Lewis Stone is known for hypnotizing and seducing military officials for secretive information and DuBois's mission is to gather enough evidence to have her arrested and executed. DuBois suspects General Serge Shubin Lionel Barrymore to be involved with Mata Hari but too is unsuccessful in gathering evidence against him as well. After getting together with his friend Lieutenant Alexis Romanoff Ramon Novarro of the Russian Interior Air Corps Serge invites him to come to the caf and watch an exotic dancer perform. The dancer is Mata Hari Greta Garbo. Although Serge is romantically involved with Mata Hari Alexis becomes interested and soon involved with her causing friction on their friendship after Alexis finds Mata Hari alone in Serge's apartment. Her seductive ways has Alexis falling under her spell again enough lose the important documents entrusted to him meant for the Prime Minister over to Mata Hari. After Alexis becomes blinded in an airplane accident Mata Hari realizing her love for Alexis puts herself in great danger for betraying Adriani committing murder and having DuBois hot on her trail.The screen version reportedly loosely based on Mata Hari herself is no doubt tailor made for Garbo's talents as well as MGM's answer to Marlene Dietrich's fictional World War seductive female spy of X27 in DISHONORED Paramount 1931. Faster paced than her previous early sound efforts 193031 Garbo appears much more relaxed in the role and very much accustomed to the new medium of talking pictures by this point. MGM reliables of Lionel Barrymore and Lewis Stone both of whom became standard players in many Garbo films over the years add to the amiable support along with the Mexicanborn Novarro playing a Russian pilot. Somehow Novarro does better than expected without making any attempt speaking with a Russian accent. Being the only pairing of Garbo and Novarro MATA HARI turns out to be the only Novarro film produced during his MGM sound years 19291934 to have any distinction. His mustache dark hair and fleecing eyes in one scene come as a reminder of another popular MGM leading man John Gilbert who might have tackled the role of Alexis had it not been for his lack of successful box office appeal he once earned in the mid twenties. Others in fine support are Karen Morley playing Carlotta the darkhaired spy working under orders of Adriani Alec B. Francis as Major Caron Blanche Frederici and Helen JeromeEddy briefly appearing as Nuns Frank Reicher as the CookSpy and Edmund Breese The Warden.Notable scenes worth mentioning include Mata Hari getting Alexis to make passionate love to her. Before he does she alluringly talks him into proving his love for her by turning out the continuous burning candle of the Holy Lamp of Madonna a patron saint to guard him from evil and the stalking of Mata Hari by Jacque a clubfooted giant face unseen. Of the many major MGM feature film releases of 1931 this and THE CHAMP starring Wallace Beery were once notable exceptions as those to have continued revivals on broadcast television in the New York City area through the mid to late 1980s before making its way to cable television notably Turner Network Television 198892 and Turner Classic Movies 1994present. Distributed on video cassette and later to DVD MATA HARI continues to become one of the most notable and worthwhile Greta Garbo films along with Queen Christina1933 Anna Karenina1935 Camille 1936 and Ninotchka 1939 all of which she was born to play. As much as the Novarro films from this period are virtually forgotten to today's generation his legend rests simply on his silent screen performances of both BENHUR 1925 and THE STUDENT PRINCE 1927 along with the one notable movie where he was just wild about Hari. 12".

And usually I say that derisively about modern cinema but frankly it would have actually helped this film.Oh yeah. We don't see her get shot.";

Now some of her films like Ninotchka and Queen Christina are STILL excellent films others like Camille and Mata Hari just seem WAY overacted. The performances are so overthetop and silly that I find myself very bored by them.In Mata Hari the best example of overdoing it are her dance numbers. The costume is one of the most outlandish I have ever seenwith billions of beads and sequins and the silliest Thaiinspired head dress. And during this dance Garbo shimmies back and forth and everyone in the house acts almost like males in a Tex Avery cartoon with rolling eyes wagging tongues etc. I just didn't get it. This was supposed to be supersexy but I just found it stupid and about as sexy as watching grandma dance. It's simply horribly overdoneperiod.The story itself doesn't get much better. Garbo doesn't particularly act sexy but all men become slaves to her alluresgimme a break!! This movie reminds me of some of Marlena Dietrich's and Mae West's movies. They too at times played these supervamp roles but I can honestly say that instead of sexy and desirable they just seemed campy and outdated. As for me give me REALISTIC acting and dialog or fun actingnot overblown tripe like this.UPDATE 92008I tried watching this again. That's because I had hated the movie so much and Garbo is such a godlike persona I thought maybe I was being too harsh. Well now that I've seen it twice I guess I was wrong....the movie is WORSE than my first review. Bad history silly dance numbers and laughably bad dialog this film is pure crap. Only the cultlike devotion that some of Garbo's fans have have resulted in this movie having a decent overall IMDb rating. I can only recommend the film for its camp value and to see just how awful it is. If you do watch it for a laugh look for Garbo's 100 unsexy and ridiculous dance number Ramon Novarro's ridiculous casting as a Russian and dialog that is howlingly bad.".

	schema:headline " Not Merely a Movie of its Day...";
	schema:reviewBody "When all other pictures fade from memory there will be in your mind and heart the unforgettable thrill of amours intrigues betrayals the original trailer of 1931 MATA HARI.And indeed at the time when WWI events were still fresh in people's memories there was hardly any theme so provocative so intriguing than bringing to screen the life of Margaretha Geertruida Zelle 18761917 a seductive female spy known as Mata Hari from Malay language 'the Eye of the Day'. Since the legend arose around her figure just after the firing squad in October 1917 she became a cinema heroine quickly. Consequently there were soon silent films made being for instance DIE SPIONIN 1921 with Asta Nielsen.However not to allow the enthusiasm to pass and in order to adapt her persona to the film industry for good there was nothing more challenging than find some very popular celebrity who would portray Mata. The talkies appeared and the producers in Hollywood studios faced this challenge to cast the lead to exalt a celebrity in the same manner as legends did exalt Mata. What woman may become a screen idol compared to dance idol of WWI? Was it to be a promiscuous flirtatious rising star Marlene Dietrich or cold Swedish beauty Greta Garbo? The results we all know... The MGM studio with the director George Fitzmaurice took lots of liberties with the life of the heroine and made a significant film where lust turns into feelings and espionage into genuine love...how touching how dramatic how Hollywoodlike for the absorbed viewers of the early 1930s... People flocked to see the film there were discussions about Mata Hari and Greta Garbo people looked for similarities that the two women had years later I heard about the film from my Grandma who saw it in Poland in the 1930s. However after all these years it seems that all that enthusiasm has naturally passed that MATA HARI has become dated no longer adequate for modern viewers uptodate expectations. Partly it is true since many performances as well as filming techniques occur to be outofdate. Yet in spite of some criticism and ironic smiles at classic cinema there are some aspects that still make the film memorable. What is it that makes MATA HARI interesting after almost 8 decades? To analyze this aspect more deeply we have to take into consideration Greta Garbo a screen persona that was capable of dominating her entire movies with genuineness frank eroticism and marvelous acting talent. People went to see movies where there was GARBO in the credits. For many that would suffice. They curiously waited for her entrance and her presence turned out to be a success for the movie. Today we could say that it was a more fanatic attitude than with modern film stars. Yes indeed! We no longer believe our celebrities to such extend with some exceptions. However those people though not so experienced in cinema as we are nowadays knew exactly what to expect from Garbo and knew that she would not disappoint them whatever role she had been given. And the same case is with this movie MATA HARI 1931 where Garbo does one of her very best jobs portrays a charming seductive delicious femme fatale from her intriguing dazzling dance to the modesty and upright heart before the execution. And again it is important to mention one fact don't see the story for the sake of history! See the story for the sake of Garbo! What powerful distortion there may be through the cinema and how convincing her vehicles occur.And other cast...? Ramon Novarro in the male lead as the Russian aviator Lt. Alexis Rosanoff memorably depicts an interesting idea of a young idealist man. His sincere love touches the enigmatic femme fatale with a cigarette and changes her life or more specifically life values for good... Lionel Barrymore is also very convincing as jealous furious General Shubin. In some scenes he does a truly artistic work within actor's flairs.

	onyx:emotionText "When all other pictures fade from memory there will be in your mind and heart the unforgettable thrill of amours intrigues betrayals the original trailer of 1931 MATA HARI.And indeed at the time when WWI events were still fresh in people's memories there was hardly any theme so provocative so intriguing than bringing to screen the life of Margaretha Geertruida Zelle 18761917 a seductive female spy known as Mata Hari from Malay language 'the Eye of the Day'. Since the legend arose around her figure just after the firing squad in October 1917 she became a cinema heroine quickly. Consequently there were soon silent films made being for instance DIE SPIONIN 1921 with Asta Nielsen.However not to allow the enthusiasm to pass and in order to adapt her persona to the film industry for good there was nothing more challenging than find some very popular celebrity who would portray Mata. The talkies appeared and the producers in Hollywood studios faced this challenge to cast the lead to exalt a celebrity in the same manner as legends did exalt Mata. What woman may become a screen idol compared to dance idol of WWI? Was it to be a promiscuous flirtatious rising star Marlene Dietrich or cold Swedish beauty Greta Garbo? The results we all know... The MGM studio with the director George Fitzmaurice took lots of liberties with the life of the heroine and made a significant film where lust turns into feelings and espionage into genuine love...how touching how dramatic how Hollywoodlike for the absorbed viewers of the early 1930s... People flocked to see the film there were discussions about Mata Hari and Greta Garbo people looked for similarities that the two women had years later I heard about the film from my Grandma who saw it in Poland in the 1930s. However after all these years it seems that all that enthusiasm has naturally passed that MATA HARI has become dated no longer adequate for modern viewers uptodate expectations. Partly it is true since many performances as well as filming techniques occur to be outofdate. Yet in spite of some criticism and ironic smiles at classic cinema there are some aspects that still make the film memorable. What is it that makes MATA HARI interesting after almost 8 decades? To analyze this aspect more deeply we have to take into consideration Greta Garbo a screen persona that was capable of dominating her entire movies with genuineness frank eroticism and marvelous acting talent. People went to see movies where there was GARBO in the credits. For many that would suffice. They curiously waited for her entrance and her presence turned out to be a success for the movie. Today we could say that it was a more fanatic attitude than with modern film stars. Yes indeed! We no longer believe our celebrities to such extend with some exceptions. However those people though not so experienced in cinema as we are nowadays knew exactly what to expect from Garbo and knew that she would not disappoint them whatever role she had been given. And the same case is with this movie MATA HARI 1931 where Garbo does one of her very best jobs portrays a charming seductive delicious femme fatale from her intriguing dazzling dance to the modesty and upright heart before the execution. And again it is important to mention one fact don't see the story for the sake of history! See the story for the sake of Garbo! What powerful distortion there may be through the cinema and how convincing her vehicles occur.And other cast...? Ramon Novarro in the male lead as the Russian aviator Lt. Alexis Rosanoff memorably depicts an interesting idea of a young idealist man. His sincere love touches the enigmatic femme fatale with a cigarette and changes her life or more specifically life values for good... Lionel Barrymore is also very convincing as jealous furious General Shubin. In some scenes he does a truly artistic work within actor's flairs. Besides there is a need to mention a mainstay of Garbo's movies Mr Lewis Stone who portrays cold unemotional Andriani for whom correct politics is superior to free will. Overall great elite of 1930s Hollywood but Garbo similarly to Mata Hari at the heights of senses.The visual aspect is also worth considering from wonderful wardrobe by Adriani through good cinematography big thrill to charming moments that never fade from memory.

It is a very dark story but survives becoming morbidly dreary by the sensitive direction from Baltasar Kormkur and a strong cast. Paul Stanton Dermot Mulroney is a successful attorney married to Diane Diane Kruger and they have one child Chloe Mia Stallard who suffers form a terminal pulmonary disease. The family's life is driven by love but also by the fact that Chloe needs frequent emergency trips to the hospital because of her tenuous hold on life. Paul and Diane are finally told Dr. Rubin Roseanna Arquette that the only choice they have for saving Chole is a lung transplant. Paul searches the methods for finding an entry into this overcrowded demand for organ transplant and when he discovers that a powerful man James Harrison Sam Shepard received an illegal heart transplant in Mexico Paul sets out to find the source. In Mexico he discovers just how crimeridden is this area of 'sales' and persists until he uncovers a doctor Navarro  a code name  in the person of Dr. Martinez Vincent Perez. The hideaway compound where the illegal transplants are performed is surrounded by poor people and gangs and the one person that helps the desperate Paul find the source of illegal organs is a kid who befriends him. When a 'donor' becomes available there is a decision that Paul must make one based on human kindness and compassion balancing with his won desires to deliver lungs to his daughter. Mulroney is particularly excellent in this tough role and the gamut of emotions is staggering. And the remainder of the cast including the gifted Jordi Moll in an important cameo is superb. The film is intense and disturbing but successfully explores the little known world of illegal organ transplantation. Another fine feather in the cap of Icelandic director Baltasar Kormkur!

The implausibilities pile up but somehow with the tense direction of Baltasar Kormkur and some fine bad ass acting from Dermot Mulroney what could have been a laugh fest turns out to be a very engaging edge of your seat thriller. Smart subtle touches like a few seconds of our man clipping the stitches on his forehead with toenail clippers gives Inhale the feel of a real big screen blockbuster. And an extremely disturbing moral debate develops as we have to wonder why this man's daughter's life is more important than those who are getting killed in his pursuit to save her. The moral of the story is be careful what you wish for because you just might get it. Will he do the right thing at the last moment? You'll have to watch to find out. This is a very gripping film.

To me that is where I see the true strength of this movie and I find it much more important than the particular road the story ends up taking and which seems to have made many viewers rather unhappy judging from the discussion boards.

Diagnosed with a rare degeneration condition Chloe is on a long list to receive a double lung transplant. As her health worsens Paul becomes desperate to save his young child so desperate that he'll risk everything to organize an operation. When Paul learns of a Dr. Novarro who performs illegal transplants in Juarez Mexico he heads south in a frantic search for the only man who may be able to save Chloe. But after arriving he realizes Dr. Novarro's medical ring runs deeper into a criminal underworld than he realized and people are not who they seem to be. With his career family and his daughter's life on the line Paul finds himself at a critical crossroads left to decide what is really right in this world. In my opinion it's a great movie. I spent days thinking about it... It depicts truthful scenarios in Juarez. It's a wake up call. More efforts should be spent in Mexico not only towards combating poverty and the extreme violence acts toward innocent men women and children caused especially by drug cartels but human organs' black market. People are abducted and killed everyday for their organs. It's horrifying. It seems that amongst all the other problems this huge issue's clouded. I'm not usually into violent movies but this one's got violence in the exact right amount mixed in with sufficient doses of suspense thriller and drama. The movie works. It strikes. The sweet tiny Camaronzito brought me to tears. I began imagining how many boys just like him have that awful destiny. Although there might not be much we can do we can start by signing up as organ donors. Who knows who we might help when the time comes.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is part of a series of movies Babel Man on fire comes to mind which portray the very difficult Mexican social and economic situation next to the American border and how delicate the balance between the two countries is. While North Americans in general have a complete ignorance of the culture and origins of Mexico they still see them as a source of trouble for their fatherland. As I speak more restrictive immigration laws are being enforced for Mexicans and South Americans in some states in the U.S. A part of the North American society believes drugs mobs and social violence is directly related to Mexicans. Again the turmoil in Mexico is in no small part caused by the necessities North Americans have to sustain their honest well intentioned way of life.This necessity is what moves a prosecutor played convincingly by Dermot Mulroney to go deep into cruel and dangerous Mexican territory mainly Juarez in search of an illegal lung donor and an illegal transplant in order to save his daughter's life. During the journey he'll encounter a dark life of crime and violence unknown to many Americans except when they have to resort to Mexicans for the dirty jobs they won't do themselves or for their convenience. The movie builds tension quite appropriately as we see a desperate father willing to risk his life in search of a mysterious doctor who is in charge of such operations. In his way he'll see children gangs prostitution corrupt policemen and all the colors of human misery when poverty reigns. But he will also discover kindness decency and the innocence of children even those carrying automatic guns. In the eyes of the character everyone is corrupt and dishonest and this concept although it may offend Mexicans or Latin Americans is exactly what the script aims to do. It tries to show us how ignorant rich societies are of the way poor ones live and that not everyone who lives humbly is a criminal as the main character will find out. He'll also find out that the most despicable characters in the movie are not even Mexicans. Surprise surprise they are fellow North Americans. This is a journey of awakening for someone who has to go down to hell because he needs to.In any case the characters are believable. The wife played by Diane Kruger is a strong and determining character. Chief of police Aguilar played by an impeccable Jordi Moya is everything you'd expect from a degenerated police officer and Sam Shepard is also convincing. The music also deserves special mentioning although Newton Howard is basically copying Santaolalla's concept as heard in Brokeback Mountain or Babel. The in crescendo and the very emotional ending add to a movie which is decent and leaves a very important message mostly Mexicans and South Americans as I understand. Rich societies play an important part in the state of poverty and its consequences which is undermining poor societies and they have the moral power to revert this situation. That is if they really wanted to.".

	schema:reviewBody "Inhale pits a father against the underbelly of Juarez Mexico in hopes of finding his daughter a new lung by any means necessary. It is one hell of a loaded plot and tries to be as thought provoking as possible but that turns out to be Inhale's biggest problem. It wants to be more thought provoking than it actually is. The only thing thought provoking about this film is the storytelling because most of the time you're left wondering what the hell is going on then we're given a kitty bitty piece of information that helps us get back on track and then it repeats itself for the entire final act. It is almost as if we're trying to keep up with all these characters without having a satisfying pay off. Despite this Dermot Mulroney is very good in this film as Paul Stanton a lawyer at a morally muddled cross road. He is by far the best thing about this film. While Diane Kruger and Sam Shepard give excellent performances they're woefully underused. Baltasar Kormkur demonstrates his ability to deliver gritty and grimy cinema but fails to prove he can direct dramatic heft as most of this film is so shaky and unbalanced it is hard to really be sucked in by what this film has going for it the performances. Overall Inhale delivers a good enough story based around great performances but fails to actually become as engaging and thought provoking as it thinks it is.".

After months of waiting on the national waiting list so their daughter could get a replacement Paul discovers a friend gubernatorial candidate James Harrison Sam Shepard has had an illegal heart transplant. Harrison agrees to tell Paul all he knows which sends Paul to Tijuana to find a mysterious Dr. Navarro the man behind the curtain of illegal organ transplants. Organ transplants are just as dangerous and just as illegal as human trafficking and can cause as much and more heartache. Inhale takes a regular family man and places him in wartorn Tijuana to try to save the life if his little girl using any means necessary which makes you question his moral authority. Good films do just that they make you think. Great films however leave you thinking. Dermot Mulroney doesn't usually play the leading character but gives a tourdeforce performance here. He is beaten and bruised on his journey but does not give up and held my attention throughout. The beautiful Diane Kruger is equally as good but underused as his frantic wife tending to be a sidelines character who never gets her due. Sam Shepard successfully plays a slick politician and the entire Hispanic cast including the equally slick Jordi Molla hold their own. The script has a few problems mostly with explanation. Shepard's character's relationship to Mulroney's character is never quite explained. It appears they work together and are close then suggests the opposite when Shepard is running for Governor. Kruger is underused which takes away from much of Inhale's potential. She is a fantastic actress but seeing her cry isn't enough. She's too good to be so one  dimensional which suggests some of the film never made it off the cutting room floor. James Newton Howard's soundtrack blends seamlessly into the background becoming a character in itself as it differentiates New Mexico and Mexico. The ending is perhaps the biggest fault of the film. The choices Paul makes throughout takes him to a surgical room where he is faced with an incredibly difficult choice. When we discover which choice he made we are made to think if it was right. If we never knew that would have left us thinking long after the screen went black. Inhale takes the organ trafficking debate head on which is admirable. Yet the film isn't as good as the message it gets across.".

If you are a man like Paul Stanton a district attorney from New Mexico you have to act immediately if he wants to save young Chloe's life.The Stantons see bureaucracy at work first hand.

Confronting Harrison proves to be right because it gives Paul the name of a doctor in Mexico responsible for the heart Harrison bought and received.Next Paul ventures into Juarez a Mexican border town notorious for the death capital of the world. Paul has no idea what he is getting into. He is robbed beaten and threaten with blackmail by unscrupulous individuals because he is getting too close to finding the mafia behind the organ commerce in that country.When he stumbles into Miguel and his gang Paul gets lucky for the boy in spite of his aggressive nature and attitude points him to a doctor who belongs to a criminal ring of trafficking the badly needed organs. Chloe whose condition deteriorates is taken to Mexico where this doctor is going to do the ultimate transplant at the expense of a young boy a member of Miguel's gang. Paul has no other alternative but to do the right thing.The film is a thriller told in almost documentary style. The action keeps moving backward and forward something that is a bit disorienting but the suspense never stops enhanced by the musical score James Newton Howard created for the film. Directed with style by Baltasar Kormakur the Icelandic director of The Sea Jar City and A Little Trip to Heaven he did not get a regular commercial run of his film. Instead it was shown in Europe in a different format which is probably the version that we watched on an international cable channel recently because the original running time of 100 minutes were reduced to a mere 83. Perhaps that is the reason we felt disoriented by the arrangement of the material. The film was based on a story by Christian Escario and the screenplay was written by Walter Doty and John Caflin.Dermot Mulroney makes a virile Paul Stanton. The love of his daughter makes him go against powerful enemy a criminal organized crime group that include a so called prestigious medical charity organization. Diane Kruger is relegated to an after thought as Paul's wife. Sam Shephard plays Jim Harrison. Jordi Molla is Aguilar the corrupt police chief. Vincent Perez appears as Dr. Martinez. A terrific Kristian Ferrer has some good moments as Miguel the young gang leader.".

The ending with Paul's firm face take a deep cut in viewer's memory after that.

	schema:reviewBody "In this new thriller from Icelandic director Baltasar Kormakur The Sea Santa Fe District Attorney Paul Chaney Dermot Mulroney and his wife Diane Diane Kruger has a daughter Chloe who is on a long list for a lung transplant due to a rare degenerative condition. As Chloe's health worsens Paul becomes desperate for a donor and forgoes the usual channels to seek out a mysterious surgeon named Dr. Novarro in Juarez Mexico who may be able to help her. Things get complex when he finds that Dr. Novarro may have connections to a criminal underworld.The film starts off with a text on the screen about the increasing needs in the world for organ donors similar in style of a documentary or a factbased drama. We are soon introduced to Chloe Paul and Diane's daughter with severe lung problems establishing the motivations of the parents. While I first expected something more akin to a medical drama majority of the film is actually closer to a thriller. It is a decent if conventional thriller.Majority of the film follows Paul Dermot Mulroney who goes off by himself to Mexico searching for a Dr. Novarro a surgeon who apparently has access in finding a donor for his daughter. Paul a white upperclass gentleman with graying hair sorely sticks out in this new and unfriendly environment. He is soon mugged by thugs and taken advantage of by street kids for snooping around in the wrong area. Many of the thugs are typically twodimensional. Paul eventually makes some headway by enlisting help from one of the kids. I found it surprising that a District Attorney couldn't hire a languagefriendly guide or bodyguards to get by in this type of environment but I suppose that would make it less edgeofyourseat. AdvertisementDermor Mulroney is competent as Paul who is constantly in the worst of places. Majority of the people he bumps into are unfriendly. Strange extreme situations follow this character aroundactually it's more like he throws himself into these situations. Beyond that his character is a fairly typical white collar character. Diane Kruger has a supporting role as Diane Paul's wife. After Inglourious Basterds Diane Kruger has become even more recognizable. She is underused here and is away from most of the action looking concerned in much of the film. Rosanna Arquette also has a small role as Dr. Rubin which isn't developed. Most of the street characters in Mexico aren't developed beyond the obvious.The cinematography is well done. The film makes good use of its unfriendly harsh environment with saturated colors and sharp contrasts emphasizing the gritty urban areas of Juarez Mexico. The streets are filled with sharp greens reds and yellows. The thugs the poor and the children in the streets complete the whole mood. They are often more part of the environment than individuals. Many of them aren't too friendly. I'm curious how Mexicans would view this film. The handheld camera shots edits and angles are all effectively donethe whole stylistic direction has a certain Tony Scott feel.As for the story it's nothing too new especially when it focuses on the events in Mexico. It works like a simple detective storyone clue leads to another. There are a good amount of violence and sexually explicit situations many of which seem to exist purely for shock value than to further the theme or the plot. While the film regains its focus down the line there are many things going on that seem sensationalshady politicians conspiracies and exploitation of the poor. Some parts were implausible if wellintended which took me away from the film. Overall I did appreciate the theme of this film which was driven home fairly effectively near the end. Still I don't think the film's message was helped by all the clutterclichs shocks and stylistic chases. You can also follow my movie reviews on twitter.comdart".

The music is orchestrated in a way that creates a beautiful sound and blend it also has great energy. As with all the entries of the How to...shorts How to be a Sailor's humour is also very winning and as with the best of them is a perfect match with the animation. The ending especially is hilariouswith the flags knots and sea legs parts being equally good though how Goofy acts is funny and endearing brings at least a big smile to the face. Goofy is an example of a character that grew with every short he starred in as well as being effortlessly funny in how he demonstrated skills in the wrong way and instantly appealing that's what makes his character so great. What's also great is how in multiple character roles he plays he plays each different but you can still tell it's him. How to Be a Sailor also feels like a How to...short the spirit of what makes the series so good Goofy's demonstrations the documentarylike narration and how it incorporates its messaging are all here and to great effect. The narration is sardonic and informative helped by thoughtful delivery from John McLeish. All in all another winner in a series that is still hugely entertaining and well made. 1010 Bethany Cox".
