The offer to Brian is to act like a customer and distract the guard. It's a tempting offer that if offered to many I question what they would do. Anyways Brian does it. When the Sheriff James Remar and his force surround the bank things go from bad to worse. It's a standoff with even the Feds moving in to kill the kids if they have a clean shot. The Sheriff must prevent this and try to end the standoff in a peaceful way. Unfortunately tensions rise and the teens inside turn on each other. Some are out of control.

The ending was clever and unlike other films which back away from severing body parts of likeable supporting characters this film goes for it!  I liked that it was not graphic blood and gore but left more to the viewer's imagination.  Bravo.  I literally had to wipe sweat from my forehead during this particular torture scene with a paper cutter.

	schema:reviewBody "No point in giving too many plot details here just take the basic premise of an all girls school being assigned to an all boys school by mistake add that on the same day the girl's headmistress has to show a group of visiting parents around while the boy's headmaster who is due to be promoted to a senior position at a new college has to show his new employers around and I think you'll get the picture.This fifty year old comedy wears well. The pace is frantic like a French farce with doors opening and closing and much dashing along corridors with split second timing as the two groups try to avoid each other. Magaret Rutherford and Alistair Sim ham it up superbly and there are many familiar faces in the supporting cast all of whom react with great professionalism. At ninety minutes the film doesn't out stay it's welcome and there's even time for a little romance that doesn't slow up the action one bit. Incidentally I had forgotten how sexy the gym outfits of English schoolgirls of that period were. It bought back memories.".

	onyx:emotionText "No point in giving too many plot details here just take the basic premise of an all girls school being assigned to an all boys school by mistake add that on the same day the girl's headmistress has to show a group of visiting parents around while the boy's headmaster who is due to be promoted to a senior position at a new college has to show his new employers around and I think you'll get the picture.This fifty year old comedy wears well. The pace is frantic like a French farce with doors opening and closing and much dashing along corridors with split second timing as the two groups try to avoid each other. Magaret Rutherford and Alistair Sim ham it up superbly and there are many familiar faces in the supporting cast all of whom react with great professionalism. At ninety minutes the film doesn't out stay it's welcome and there's even time for a little romance that doesn't slow up the action one bit. Incidentally I had forgotten how sexy the gym outfits of English schoolgirls of that period were. It bought back memories.";

What ever else this place may or may not be it's no place to bring carefully nurtured girls! Yes a terrible mistake has been made by the Ministry of Education. Nutbourne is a school for boys. St. Swithen's is a school for girls. And what makes this one of the best postWWII British comedies Nutbourne's head master is Wetherby Pond...played by Alastair Sim while St. Swithen's head mistress is Muriel Whitchurch...played by Margaret Rutherford. St. Swithen's? says Pond. You don't mean to say that yours is a school for boys and girls? he asks one of the early girls. Only girls she says cheerfully. Does this mean sir asks one of Nutbourne's teachers that we are to expect 100 young girls? It means that not only have the ministry made a mistake in sending a school here at all but that it is guilty of an appalling sexual aberration! Margaret Rutherford's Miss Whitchurch as positive and immovable as a battleship intends to make the best of it by briskly taking over Nutbourne if possible. Alastair Sim's Pond is exasperated up to his big bald head and is determined to salvage his school. In the meantime there are 100 young girls and 170 young boys to be fed and places found for them to sleep along with all their teachers. The cooks and caretakers totally put upon walk out. Miss Whitchurch and her girls however are up to the cooking tasks. Come now Angela she says to one girl who is trying to stir something in a big pot haven't you made porridge before? Yes but no one ever had to eat it. That's a defeatist attitude my dear. Stir it well and don't shilly shally. Things are hardly going well when Pond discovers four governors from a school he hopes to lead are arriving at any moment to see for themselves how well led Nutbourne is. And Miss Whitchurch learns that four wealthy and influential parents have just arrived to see how their daughters are doing in the new  boy free they were told  facilities. The only solution? Miss Whitchurch and Pond their teachers and their students concoct a splitsecond shifting of classes to give the allusion that Nutbourne has no girls and that St. Swithen's has no boys. After the parents inspect a dorm and leave for a class the girls in the beds duck under and the boys who'd been hidden under leap up into the beds just as the governors walk in. The boys are observed at rugby and as soon as the governors turn their backs the goal posts are taken down nets for lacrosse are put up and just then the parents walk over to observes the girls. One parent spots her daughter in a science class then moments later sees her in a choir practice then moments later.... There's Angela again she says to Miss Whitchurch. Why so it is she replies hustling the parents out to avoid the governors who are approaching just around the corner. The child's quite ubiquitous. When we leave Nutbourne everything has been discovered. The students are milling about. The teachers are dazed except for two who are kissing. The Education Ministry has just sent several more busloads of students. The parents are speechless but the governors are not. We're waiting for an explanation one says sharply. Pond holds his head and shudders. Can't you see I'm trying to think of one. The film moves from one complicated and ridiculous situation after another braced by a very funny script and two hugely comedic performances by Rutherford and Sim. Sim's droll exasperation and Rutherford's implacable determination are so well matched that's it's a shame this is the only movie they ever made together. Joyce Grenfell as Gossage St. Swithen's tall awkward loping sports teacher gives them some competition. If you keep your eyes open you'll also find some amusing references director Frank Launder works in including a gong at Nutbourne that looks just like a midget version of J. Arthur Rank's a faint echo of the zither theme from The Third Man and a shot stolen from David Lean's Oliver Twist except this time the little boy walks up holding his porridge bowl and says Please sir. I don't want anymore. Frank Launder and his partner Sidney Gilliat were responsible for some of the best films produced in Britain during the Thirties Forties and Fifties. They wrote produced and directed sometimes doing one sometimes the other. In one way or another they were responsible for such firstrate films as Green for Danger with a masterly droll performance by Sim I See a Dark Stranger The Lady Vanishes Night Train to Munich Wee Geordie The Belles of St. Trinian's The Rake's Progress and many others. With The Happiest Days of Your Life Launder wrote and directed while both produced. It's one of their best.".

	schema:reviewBody "Somehow in a lifetime in which I estimate having seen over 25000 films starting about 72 years back I had totally missed The Happiest Days of Your Life. I can be counted upon to rave about a film I like but rarely go off the deep end over such things. Not until now anyway. If this isn't the absolutely funniest movie I have ever seen in my life I can't recall what is. Of course there are different comedy genres from French Farce to British Droll from The Three Stooges and Abbott and Costello to Some Like It Hot and Tom Jones possibly ending up with Woody Allen and Mel Brooks. But of the kind which relies on sparkling witty and cutting dialog delivered by masters especially British masters this one has no equal. I live alone and do not laugh out loud all that often when viewing comedy of any kind but at 3am this morning my neighbors could probably have heard me a dozen times laughing right through the walls this film is just that funny. The slapstick elements that commence about threequarters of the way through are in themselves hilarious but the first quarter of the film given over to the male masters of an allboys school is like nothing I have ever seen or heard before and the actors delivering this scintillating portion of the dialog  Alastair Sim Richard Wattis Guy Middleon and Edward Rigby in particular  are irreplaceable in all of their individual splendor of delivery. When Margaret Rutherford Joyce Grenfell and others from the distaff side of the proceedings arrive to place their unwelcome mark on what had been a pretty much allmale environment the dialog and humor remain impeccably delightful and British God almighty it is all so wonderfully British! but increasing comedic physicality becomes the order of the day. Indeed the confrontation scenes between Sim and Rutherford  and there are many constituting the middle portion of the film  are so powerfully comedic that the lines and rejoinders attain an almost corporeal physicality. I've never seen anything of this type so perfectly done on the screen and the entire 75 or 80 minutes of verbal and physical mayhem are so overwhelmingly delightful that as one other commentator remarked I could easily have done with another halfhour of it incorporated into the glorious whole of the film. Anyway as far as my memory serves right now from a dialog and oneliner standpoint this is surely the funniest movie I can recall having seen. I will watch it again tonight and on many subsequent nights since I have 68 years of catching up to do".

But of the kind which relies on sparkling witty and cutting dialog delivered by masters especially British masters this one has no equal. I live alone and do not laugh out loud all that often when viewing comedy of any kind but at 3am this morning my neighbors could probably have heard me a dozen times laughing right through the walls this film is just that funny. The slapstick elements that commence about threequarters of the way through are in themselves hilarious but the first quarter of the film given over to the male masters of an allboys school is like nothing I have ever seen or heard before and the actors delivering this scintillating portion of the dialog  Alastair Sim Richard Wattis Guy Middleon and Edward Rigby in particular  are irreplaceable in all of their individual splendor of delivery. When Margaret Rutherford Joyce Grenfell and others from the distaff side of the proceedings arrive to place their unwelcome mark on what had been a pretty much allmale environment the dialog and humor remain impeccably delightful and British God almighty it is all so wonderfully British! but increasing comedic physicality becomes the order of the day. Indeed the confrontation scenes between Sim and Rutherford  and there are many constituting the middle portion of the film  are so powerfully comedic that the lines and rejoinders attain an almost corporeal physicality. I've never seen anything of this type so perfectly done on the screen and the entire 75 or 80 minutes of verbal and physical mayhem are so overwhelmingly delightful that as one other commentator remarked I could easily have done with another halfhour of it incorporated into the glorious whole of the film. Anyway as far as my memory serves right now from a dialog and oneliner standpoint this is surely the funniest movie I can recall having seen. I will watch it again tonight and on many subsequent nights since I have 68 years of catching up to do";

	schema:reviewBody "Based on a play by John Dighton this is a precursor to the St. Trinian's films and involves the staff and pupils of an allgirls school St Swithin's School being billeted at Nutbourne College an allboys school by mistake. It was also cowritten and directed by Frank Launder and features much the same cast most notably Alastair Sim Joyce Grenfell Richard Wattis and in a very small and uncredited role as a junior assistant caretaker George Cole. It's less anarchic than the St. Trinian's films  at least until the last few minutes  but it's still incredibly funny. It is more of a comedy of manners really of a kind which sadly isn't made anymore. The film's comic timing is exquisite.Sim is wonderful as Weatherby Pond the headmaster Nutbourne College as is Margaret Rutherford as his counterpart Miss Whitchurch a role written specifically for her. Their timing and chemistry is marvelous. Both are absolute perfect in the roles. Incidentally Rutherford was supposed to play Miss Fritton in The Belles of St. Trinian's but she could not do so because of other commitments and Sim was cast in the role in her absence. Their characters work so well because of the contrast between them while a kind headmaster Pond is extremely concerned with discipline and order and as such is not too happy with the arrival of 100 girls and the resulting disruption caused to his school  not least because he is up for another job!  while Miss Whitchurch is a nontraditionalist who takes over Nutbourne College with nary a thought about the inconvenience caused to Pond. She even takes over his office and bedroom. They do eventually warm to each other though! I've always loved his performances but I've become a huge fan of Alastair Sim after watching him in three films in quick succession. He's one of those fantastic actors who makes it all look so easy but probably worked harder than anyone at his craft. As is to be expected from a former elocution lecturer at the University of Edinburgh my alma mater! he has beautiful diction.While Sim and Rutherford certainly have the lion's share of the best scenes and lines it has a strong supporting cast including Grenfell who is excellent as the well meaning overgrown schoolgirl and games mistress Miss Gossage Wattis and Laurence Naismith. However I have to give special mention to Edward Rigby who is brilliant as Nutbourne's putupon 70yearold caretaker and general dogsbody Rainbow. It's a shame that he died in 1951 as he would have been a great asset to the St. Trinian's films.".

I last saw it ten years ago on television in the United States and was enjoying it despite long commercial breaks every few minutes until just before the end when the station chose to show a long preview of a forthcoming programme and in consequence simply cut the last ten minutes or so. Anyone seeing it for the first time would have been deprived of its conclusion. Sacrilege.However to me the plot of the film has always contained one enormous fault. Much as Pond and Miss Whitchurch dislike each other they become allies in the effectively impossible task of convincing his governors and her group of parents that only one school is occupying the premises. Why? The fault is not theirs it is that of the Ministry of Education for wrongly allotting a girls' school to a boys' school. Pond and Miss Whitchurch are the innocent victims of an incompetent bureaucracy and could simply have told their visitors as much. If anything there might well have been some kudos for both in dealing in as able a way as possible with a situation not of their making.Of course if they had done so there would not have been much of a film and despite the weakness of the McGuffin the beautifully filmed efforts to replace girls with boys and vice versa at exactly the right moment are a joy. As is the performance of Richard Wattis for once not playing a stuffy bank managercivil servant.As others have said if you've never seen this film please do so.

The soundtrack features a lesserknown 70's act named High Inergy whose song We are the future played a marquee role in the movie's Prom scene. I remember purchasing the group's album Steppin' Out as a kid mainly because of the look of the girls and not necessarily for their musical talents. The closing song is one of the best ballads I have ever heard and I can still hear it in my head.

	schema:reviewBody "Practically forgotten today this teen movie from my early teenage years is a sweet affectionate look at the importance of school spirit and a view of the early education of political wannabee's. Lee Purcell's Christine Alexander is the typical doitall teenage girl president of practically club she's in head cheerleader and extremely ambitious. She's running for Student Council President a seemingly shooin to win that is until the underdog steps up to the plate. That's Tim McIntire the kid you don't know but.... that is until fellow student and political organizer Bruno Kirby finds him checking in late for school and realizes that he's the perfect late entry candidate to toss Christine whom he once dated to the curb. Kirby's cute younger sister Didi Conn as adorable as she was in Grease has a huge crush on him and encourages McIntire all the way. Purcell who had ruthlessly exposed the previous candidate for falsifying school documentation has no ammo this time around so as they face the end of their junior year Purcell must campaign honestly. But that doesn't stop Kirby from doing all he can to get McIntire elected something that the honest young man will have to face as a moral dilemma in a moving finale.Never released on VHS or DVD this is one of those nice little surprises to find if you had not seen it. Having gone to the movies practically every weekend in the summer and fall of 1978 I had seen this one searched for it for years and could only find the enjoyable soundtrack album. Great opening credits over the title song featuring some clever lyrics and a Beach Boys style beat leads to the introduction of all the major characters reminding me of several people I knew back in those days. I had one quibble with realism showing Purcell and several other girls in their cheerleading outfits long after the sports seasons having cheerleaders had ended. While Purcell's character is overly ambitious and determined to be a leader everywhere she goes she's actually quite low key and not at all your stereotypical bitchy teenage girl possibly crafty underneath in getting what she wants but not somebody you'd find it easy to hate. Kirby seems slightly too old for his part but does well in allowing you to overlook that and McIntire is somebody whom everybody would be proud to call an older brother or best friend. Various other stereotypes are lowkey so there's nothing to quibble about in that area.A minor subplot has Kirby's black friend and school basketball hero Tom Carter romancing the pretty Petronia Paley who has singing ambitions and keeps him at a distance when mingling with those who can help her. Paley who would go onto major parts on Another World and Guiding Light was a decade older than her character but she manages to pull off being a teenager miraculously. She gets to perform a Supreme's type song while Purcell as part of her election promotion does a brief version of Frankie  Johnny that shows some pretty impressive dance moves. McIntire's domino followup is pretty cool and while it seems outlandish now made a big impression on me back when I was a teenager. This film is very similar to the more recent Election where Reese Witherspoon's over achiever character pulled way more scheming stunts to win her high school class presidency making Purcell practically a saint when compared to her.".

Her ex Bobby Bruno Kirby rushes to find an 11th hour replacement. He enlists Darryl John Friedrich an unknown but likable candidate. Dirty tricks ensue on both sides as the election nears.Almost Summer is almost completely forgotten for good reason. The premise is simply dull and while other teen movies from this era like Malibu Beach and Van Nuys Blvd are more lighthearted Almost Summer takes a more serious soapopera tone. Whoever said this was a comedy must have seen a different movie there isn't one laugh in it. There is a food fight scene but it seems perfunctory as if the producers were checking it off their list. The acting and dialogue is competent but the actors are almost all well into their twenties and play it all too serious. Bruno Kirby glares and shouts at everyone acting like a fixer for the mob while 30 year old Lee Purcell wears the dress and demeanor of a young attorney not a teenager.The main plot line is never resolved either. Darryl wins the election with his everyman approach but turns down the office after learning Bobby staged a drug bust earlier to boost his image. His integrity only makes the student body want him as president more. It's assumed by the final scene at the prom that he's accepted the job but it's never made explicitly clear. There are a few other subplots but they're not worth mentioning. All plot lines are ended abruptly and everyone gets a partner at the prom.Hard to recommend this unless your a diehard Kirby fan or are trying to watch every last 70s teen flick. Beach Boys fans should seek out the soundtrack composed mostly by Mike Love's side project group Celebration. The title track was written by Love Brian Wilson and Al Jardine making it nearly a lost Beach Boys song.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film wasn't bad nor good. For me it was pretty average. A lot of the film included Scary Movie laughs involving silly plot lines including spoofing Teen Wolf Sixteen Candles and Dirty Dancing among others.This movie revolves around Charlie a teen from another city who moves to a town in California where dancing is banned and the people are complete idiots. Adjusting to the change with him his sister Lori Dominique Swain falls in love with a janitor Chris Kattan who happened to be the dance instructor of the school until dancing was banned. Lori's relationship with the janitor gets more heated after going to Gabriel's dance studio which is a kept secret from the town. The ban on dancing makes angstfull Lori furious of the dancing ban and plans with Gabriel to do a show at a decathlon where Charlie with the help of his mentor the gay Mr. Yamagashi James Hong will hopefully win after he makes a blindsided deal with the school bully Kip Joey Kern that if he lost he would move out and that Kip could kick his butt as much as he wanted. Along for the wild ride is Charlie's platonic best friend Billie Nicki Clyne who has a secret crush on him but can't seem to tell him. Also Kip's girlfriend Kimberly Brittany Daniel who plays Charlie's love interest does a pretty good job at using Charlie when he's at his weakest.This movie i had to admit was quite funny. Okay hilarious! Although not as good as i thought it was going to be the cast does the best they can to make the plot and stories fun to watch. I recommend this to all of you guys that just like to have fun and like to see stupid people do stupid things.".

	schema:reviewBody "I watched the entire movie without stopping and deleting it from the DVR. That's about the best thing I can say about Totally Awesome.The thing about spoofs is that they only work if they consistently satirize their targets. They need to find humor in parts of the original films that weren't funny and find humor in them. This is the biggest flaw of Totally Awesome. The movie is just lame setups horrendous overacting and a few interesting ideas that never quite hit the mark. There is very little actual satire. Mr. Miyagi got more laughs in the original Karate Kid than his spoof counterpart did during this entire train wreck of a movie. Dominique Swain is another big offender here. I'm sure she was directed to completely overact but she completely blew past the line separating funny from downright annoying. With maybe one or two exceptions I found her performance almost unbearable.It's not all doom and gloom after all I did get through the whole thing without deleting it. I'm not normally a huge Tracy Morgan fan but he completely stole the show with the brief role he was given. Even by spoof standards Joey Kern might have been a bit too overthetop as the nemesis but he did get me to laugh more than once. There were also some laughs to be found in some of the dancing scenes and the lead actor looked eerily like C.Thomas Howell from Soul Man when in blackface.I guess it's not a complete waste of 100 minutes but it's not hard to realize why this script wound up as 'made for VH1' filler either. I have a sneaking suspicion that this was shot for theatrical release or possibly directtoDVD. The transfer is clearly cropped from some widescreen film format. It's pretty easy to see why it never made it that far. Altho from what I hear this is being released on DVD. Oh boy. Anyways this one misses far more than it hits. When you are constantly reminded how much superior the original 80's movies are instead of being inspired to laugh at their silliness the makers of the spoof have dropped the ball.Who thought the movie Soul Man was a good idea? Apparently the same folks that thought Totally Awesome was a good idea.".

The conceit of the film is that it was a lost film from the 1980s recently rediscovered in a vault in the Arizona desert and bought by VH1 because according to narrator Ben Stein VH1 didn't have enough 80's themed programming. Mikey Day plays Charlie a young man who moves into a new town where he is automatically dubbed the most unpopular senior at his high school. He falls for the prettiest and most popular girl at the school Kimberly Brittany Daniel whose boyfriend Kipp Joey Kern is a stereotypical jock and bully. At first Charlie attempts to woo Kimberly seeking the help of a black man named Darnell Tracy Morgan in attempts to be cooler. Darnell teaches him how to talk walk and act like a cool black man though this attempt ultimately backfires.Charlie also meets a girl named Billie Nicki Clyne the class loser who is poor and has very oily skin. She is the only one who understands Charlie and develops a crush on him. Charlie befriends Billie though at first insists their relationship is platonic.After an altercation with Kipp Charlie challenges Kipp to a Decathlon. To prepare Charlie seeks the help of Yamagashi James Hong a wise old gay Asian instructor and parody of Mr. Miyagi from the Karate Kid series of movies. Charlie is told to do odd chores that are supposed to help him in the Decathlon like Sweep My Deck for pole vault Jump For Apples for high jump and Toss the Rock for shot put. When Charlie points out that Yamagashi has only taught him how to do three events Yamagashi suggests killing Kipp to avoid the contest when Charlie rejects homicide as a solution Yamagashi tells him he must find a reason to drive him to succeed.In addition to Charlie's attempts to survive the new school and court the girl the movie follows Charlie's sister Lori Dominique Swain a dancer who is in love with school janitor Gabriel Chris Kattan. Gabriel was the dance teacher before dancing was outlawed in the town following an incident in which several dancing teenagers had their feet come loose a reference to the 1980s film Footloose.In the end Charlie wins the decathlon and falls in love with Billie Lori brings dance back to town and Gabriel gets his job back as the dance teacher and gets permission to have sex with teenage girls. Kipp the bully gets eaten by a werewolf.".

The guy is ranked bottom of his senior class in 'coolness' on his first day and makes some feeble attempts to rise against the cool people.There's the unattainable hot chick the jerky popular guy who makes no sense and the freaks. There's also Charlie's best 'freak friend' Billie Nicki Clyne who has a hopefully crush on him and can't admit it Sixteen Candles right there.The movie progresses with bad references to Dirty Dancing Teen Wolf and the like.I won't give away anymore but I wouldn't recommend this movie unless it's 3am and nothing else but infomercials are on.It's not nearly stupid enough to be considered so stupid it's funny and it's not interesting enough to have any sort of cult following.And then there's the creepy janitor who's an exdancer and the principal who doesn't give a hoot.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm making the bold prediction that this movie will in time become a cult classic for those who get it much like Office Space. Many reviewers professional and not dismiss this movie out of hand again like Office Space. They clearly don't fall into the getting it crowd. Those who enjoy twisted reference and a plethora of quotable lines will fall hard for this picture. I can't stress enough that you and whoever you watch this movie with will be trading lines via text messaging within minutes of the credits rolling. This is a tribute to primary writer Neal Brennan's Chappelle's Show Half Baked script. Brennan does a great job crafting a very clever homage not entirely a spoof to 80's flicks. Centering around the Gunderson family that moves from Pittsburgh to California Totally Awesome finds siblings Charlie Mikey Day and his sister Lori Dominque Swain trying to adapt to their new surroundings. The family is rounded out by genius younger brother Max Trevor Heins and optimistically clueless parents Greg Kean and Teryl Rothery. Immediately things go wrong for Charlie and Lori as their worlds are turned upside down. As the new kid Charlie finds himself dead last in the school coolness rankings and dance aficionado Lori can't practice her trade due to some dubious local legislation. What sets Totally Awesome apart from other 80's referencing films such as Not Another Teen Movie is that the main characters and many of the surrounding cast are composites rather than direct references to characters from classic 80's movies. Standouts include Joey Kern as smirking king of the High School Kipp Vanderhoff and Tracey Morgan in a role that relied heavily on his adlibbing abilities. Chris Kattan does a respectable job as the smarmy 35 year old school janitor Gabriel as does Lucie Guest as his scorned girlfriend Deb. Granted Guest's performance is facial expression heavy but the casting was perfect! A refreshing change to this film is the lack of grossout humor perhaps we are spared this due to its production for television that seems to the status quo for movies that fall into this genre think Wayans.The soundtrack is expectedly laden with 80's classics however the score is part of the fun here. The music for the dance numbers and the emotional synth filling the background of Billie and Charlie scenes perfectly set the mood. Occasionally the film does fall flat particularly it's thankfully brief and over the top Teen Wolf references however its positives more than outweigh these scenes.".

Most definitely. More than there were miss. The only things I didn't like about the movie was the character of Max. The movie would have held better without him as he wasn't needed at all and wasn't funny. The second thing was the soundtrack. They played awesome 80's songs but there were only like 7 80's songs in the film. I felt like they could have used a good 1520 songs from the 80's and it would have made a great Totally Awesome soundtrack to buy on cd. Other than that for the songs they did use it was awesome. The styles were also quite awesome. And the spoofs were just hilarious. The TV spots didn't do the movie justice as it was way funny. I bought the DVD on the day it came out which was today. And it's unrated and for a TV movie the DVD isn't vanilla at all. There looks to be some decent special features though I have yet to watch them. So be sure to at least rent and watch this movie if you haven't seen it on VH1 yet because you'll love it if you're a child of the 80's or before. Heck I'm sure you'll want to buy the DVD even.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's a sad sign of the times that many movies today pass themselves off as parodies when they are in fact just riding the coattails of the movies they are parodying. Remember Airplane? Guess what! It's still funny! But just presenting people in loud ugly clothes pointing out obvious clichs and using silly phrases from the 80's doesn't make this an 80's parody without those things it would just be a forgettable teen film about a nerd who wants to be a winner.

There were a handful of good ones that have achieved classic status for being good films the films of John Hughes a slew of bad ones that were so bad they're still remembered today Mannequin and the like then movies that were like this onesilly fluffy mindless pablum hastily thrown together and playing on cable endlessly because they were cheap to purchase. Perhaps that's a complimentthe makers of this movie have succeeded in creating something exactly as it would've been in the 80's with no wit or commentary added at all. Like those real 80's movies there are a few laughs here but it's not really worth the hassle.The end credits show that the actors are generally more funny and having more fun in real life than in this movie. It's not the worst thing ever committed to film but this makes Not Another Teen Movie look like genius comedy by comparison and that's remarkable in itself. Chris Kattan who can be a really funny guy isn't funny here and embarrasses himself pretty good in this as usual. And it's always a bad idea to have Ben Stein explaining the jokes along the way Ben stopped being funny the minute we realized he was in on the joke of his Ferris Bueller cameo.".

Remember Airplane? Guess what! It's still funny!

Like many people posting reviews I am an oldschool diehard fan of the original trilogy and I am also a fan of the old extended universe much of which is now being overshadowed by the cashgrab that is this new Disneydriven galaxy.However I must say that the negativity this film has received is undeserved. The story is solid if a bit predictable at times. The dialogue and acting are FAR better than in any of the other recent Star Wars films except perhaps Rogue One. Notably in comparison to Last Jedi the story has a logical flow there are no sidestories that make no sense nor any hamhanded attempts to milk humor out of an unrealistic scene. I can't say it enough this movie actually makes sense and has a believable story.If there is a problem it is that Star Wars is becoming another Marvel Universe where everything has already been done in one way or another. For nonstar wars fans this will be a perfectly serviceable actionscifi adventure with characters whose struggles most people should recognize from other stories in these genres. I was pleasantly surprised at how some characters were killed it actually made me worry that anyone could be in danger even knowing that this was impossible. It was emotionally real.For Star Wars fans there are heaps of references to the extended universe. These were done in a way that made sense and gave service to old Star Wars stories. Teras Kasi Aurra Sing Chewy being 200 years old among others. There are glimpses at what the every day life of an average citizen in the empire would experience spoiler not nice. Han as a character is played true to form a guy who has seen some bad things done some bad things but still deep down is good.I liked it. Don't listen to the fanatical homers whose own selfabsorption with Star Wars prevents them from enjoying anything that doesn't conform to their predetermined view.".

With Empire Strikes Back and Rogue One my favorite in the series.As for the movie itself my opinion is that it's a solid adventure movie in the style of the great Indiana Jones movies with lots of fun and intense action witty dialogues great humor and solid acting from all actors. Yes Han must meet a certain Wookie obtain a certain spaceship and meet a certain curly hair character to maintain coherence with past movies but the necessary scenes even if expected are still brilliantly developed. On top of these scenes there are several surprising scenes that run the gamut of the best of what the Star Wars universe offers chases spacecraft battles shootouts aliens galore and lots lots of anti laws of physics splitsecond solutions.Still my favorite take from this movie is that they finally managed to shoot an amazing movie that is far from the epic goodevil battles of previous Star Wars movies and this is completely in tune with the Han Solo character and btw I think Alden Ehrenreich is a perfect match for the role.In summary if you think the movie is unnecessary and not needed it will indeed disappoint you and I would advice you not to watch it but if you go to watch it with a noexpectations open mind I think you'll be greatly pleased and much entertained.and my excuses for any English mistakes my mother tongue is Spanish".

	schema:reviewBody "Solo A Star Wars Story boasts one of the more inventive plots I've seen lately. They play with Han's story and aren't afraid to take it some unexpected directions at least for those just familiar with the movies and haven't researched to extended continuity of the franchise. One of the small problems I had with Solo was while the movie does have some intriguing ideas and exciting sequences they reside in the middle of the movie. The bookends of this movie beginning and end are the weakest with all the best stuff in middle hour and a half. This isn't a major flaw but I had to be patient for it to get going and the finale felt a little rushed.After the news of Alden Ehrenreich needing some extra help to get the character of Han Solo I wasn't sure he could capably perform in the lead. He caught me completely off guard he was great as Han Solo. He's not Harrison Ford and no one could have matched him as Han but he has the charisma the toughness and the comic timing and I think he pulled it off. He bounces off Joonas Suotamo who plays Chewbacca well and I thought he also had good chemistry with Emilia Clarke who played his love interest Qi'ra. Clarke did well her performance as Daenerys is still better but this was a step in the right direction. She's had trouble getting off the ground when it comes to acting in movies and this will hopefully be that stepping stone for her. Donald Glover does a fine Lando impression there was a lot of praise for his version of this character and I largely share those sentiments. Woody Harrelson is solid as Beckett he's appropriately slimy but he invites you in enough that you want to believe in him. Thandie Newton is good for the limited time we get to spend with her. I also liked Paul Bettany but he was kneecapped by his character.I would put this in the heist movie genre but there are a couple of big action set pieces. Despite the troubled production they were actually pretty great. Between the fight on the train and the escapeheist from the spice mining planet are both excellent. I didn't have a problem with the ending fight for the action choreography and even that bit had its moments. They pack the thrills and there were some unexpected outcomes for that little extra payoff. If anything Solo proves you don't have to have a lightsabre duel to keep audiences on the edge of their seat.My problems with Solo A Star Wars Story boil down to 2 things. The first is that Bettany's character of Dryden Vos is a weak villain and although the ending boasts a couple of unique twists its undercut by the lack of a real threat. Bettany's a great actor and they gave him a decent backstory but a surprise betrayal comes in the 3rd act and instead of getting 2 sinister threats we end up with none. The second is that Solo feels somewhat clunky or as if the movie is being too obvious when it brings in iconic items for Han or connects to the larger Star Wars universe. Solo works best when it operates as its own story the seams only start to show when you really examine how it fits in the original timeline or when characters from other movies cameo.I expected very little from this movie. I already mentioned all the bad press the movie got and while I went into this movie openminded the negativity surrounding Solo did lower my expectations accordingly. While it's far from perfect I had a lot of fun with this movie. Between the taught pace the solid acting from the cast and the infectiously happy vibe the movie boasts I was swept up in it. It doesn't nail every aspect but it gets far more right than it doesn't and I'm not going to drop it down to a 4 or a 5 because of some nitpicks. My actual rating for Solo A Star Wars Story is somewhere between an 8910 but I'll go with an 810 to be safe.".

Solo is not the biggest and boldest SW feature by any stretch but it is true to the original trilogy material without resorting to overly complicated plots ropey CGI effects and forced comedy. It provides action  excitement great dialogue romance and a vast array of alien creatures that were lacking in Rogue 1 and genuinely feels like a SW film albeit with an interesting western inspired spin. Its Star Wars with everything we love about the saga. If you hate it.. perhaps its time you realised you might not be a SW fan after all.".

	schema:reviewBody "Gone is the time when an aloof and mysterious character like Han Solo can stand on his own. When the pure imagination of fans opened up countless debates on how the Kessel run really went down or how Hans eventually won the Millennium Falcon and eventually became a staple of his character. The hard truth is fans and casual viewers already knew these milestones in Han's story happened and will happen so the only thing that mattered about this movie was how was it going to happen? For awhile the magic of Star Wars was that of not knowing what to expect and getting to analyze an entire livedin universe by yourself or with your friends throughout the years. With Solo that magic is lost. You know you will be dealing with limited stakes since Solo and Chewie are pretty much okay and surely alive after this movie. You know that it will hit the basic story beats of how he becomes an outlaw a rebel and eventually the iconic smuggler with a secret heart of gold we all know and love. You know he'll get the Falcon you know he'll end up with Leia anyway. There's no mystery here everyone knows the answer and we're all left with awkward suspicions about how things will play out.  Alden Ehrenreich does a for the most part fantastic job as Han Solo and he makes the role his own probably one of the better parts of this movie. Lando Donald Glover and Chewie both get their moments and also stand out in their roles. Beckett Woody Harrelson and Qi'ra Emilia Clarke weirdly fall flat as the new additions for Solo aside from an obvious wisecracking droid to entertain us and give us some emotional moments the two side characters that are meant to be the people that influence the title character are bland and uninteresting. Beckett seems to be just a ticket for Han to go follow him wherever he goes only to just ride backseat in the mission in the end. While Qi'ra plays the love interest of Han who we never get to know much about aside from pointless and explicit exposition. She also has a vague and messy arc that makes not just Han but the audience confused as well. At one point you're not sure where her allegiance lies what her motivations are and what drives her to stick or stay away from Han.  Moreover the story really doesn't aim to tell a properly structured narrative instead it felt like a Han's Biggest Hits Montage all through out. Now this is not to say that it's hard and impossible to tell a proper movie about iconic personsevents we probably know about andor have learned about and theorized ourselves. Rogue One 2016 was able to do it to an admittedly better extent and quite masterfully in the James Bond reboot with Casino Royale back in 2006. To use Casino Royale as an example it's a perfect story that shows how James Bond became THE James Bond we know and love the commanding suave and rough 007 agent. When the movie starts he's not yet quite the Bond we're used to know yet but what happens in that film contributes to why he changes. Then in the end that's the only time we get the iconic line of James Bond introducing himself because that character has earned it through the context of the film.  While Solo tried to achieve this same level of success it falls hard on its knees really hard in the process. The definition of context the filmmakers had in mind with Solo was just throwing in fan service after fan service of what made Han Solo iconic but we never really see why THIS character in THIS film in particular earned that iconic status. Han is basically the same person from the beginning till the end compare this to James Bond in Casino Royale wherein his relationship with Vesper and how it ended changed his character forever inevitably giving strong emotional and narrative context as to why he became how he is. This is never explored in the film and it instead becomes a bythenumbers monotone and dull looking film.Verdict 610".

I did not read the reviews but I heard about the fact that the studio bosses are not very satisfied with the cashier of the film because Salon solo expectations sorry for the pun were not justified.Personally I liked it but there are reservations.The plot is clear and digestible. There are no illogicalities and strange twists. Pianos too really one moment in the end more precisely the appearance of me yes I think most surprised. Hint on the continuation of the story prequel Solo? Well I do not know. There is a problem with the arches of the heroes especially with the line of the protagonist  he shows us from the middle point. There was no need to remove it from the young nails but there was a lack of disclosure.It is important to note that in contrast to the serious Outcast humor appeared here. Relevant and adequate. To become a protagonist. And there are no excesses.Howard promised us fantasy with a touch of a criminal film. And this promise was kept. Even overfulfilled! In the film there are notes of a western  robbery chases dashing guys. Not to mention some of the miseenscenes characteristic of the genre. And this greatly pleased me.In addition to westerns there are a lot of Easter eggs for other films  I personally saw the Army of the Dead and The Empire Strikes Back. With fanservisom managed to cheer.That did not work with Khan. It is clear that the second Harison Ford can be obtained only by cloning and then there are no guarantees. But somehow Alden does not stretch. Too so cute and charisma is not enough. So harrowing young Solo and not a brave captainsmuggler Solo. Eh. But Harelson and Bethany pleased so pleased. Suppose that the second does not have much screen time but he used them in full. It's a pity that other directors unlike Howard do not notice him. Clarke. c. a. the Dragon Mammon? Yes as always no! I actually do not understand why she was loved in the Thrones? Quasi is cute a doll with a doll and a game of eyebrows. Not ice.In the end we got a good movie no worse but not better than Outcast. It turned out to be a kind of western in the network of Star Wars with good humor but with a bad actor in the title role and strange story arches.It's strange and not clear  what rejected the audience? Disappointment with the 8th episode and the mouse house?I want to believe that the universe has potential! And the invitation of such craftsmen as Howard will contribute to good films in the lineup.".

To become a protagonist. And there are no excesses.Howard promised us fantasy with a touch of a criminal film. And this promise was kept. Even overfulfilled! In the film there are notes of a western  robbery chases dashing guys. Not to mention some of the miseenscenes characteristic of the genre. And this greatly pleased me.In addition to westerns there are a lot of Easter eggs for other films  I personally saw the Army of the Dead and The Empire Strikes Back. With fanservisom managed to cheer.That did not work with Khan. It is clear that the second Harison Ford can be obtained only by cloning and then there are no guarantees. But somehow Alden does not stretch. Too so cute and charisma is not enough. So harrowing young Solo and not a brave captainsmuggler Solo. Eh. But Harelson and Bethany pleased so pleased. Suppose that the second does not have much screen time but he used them in full. It's a pity that other directors unlike Howard do not notice him. Clarke. c. a. the Dragon Mammon? Yes as always no! I actually do not understand why she was loved in the Thrones? Quasi is cute a doll with a doll and a game of eyebrows. Not ice.In the end we got a good movie no worse but not better than Outcast. It turned out to be a kind of western in the network of Star Wars with good humor but with a bad actor in the title role and strange story arches.It's strange and not clear  what rejected the audience? Disappointment with the 8th episode and the mouse house?I want to believe that the universe has potential! And the invitation of such craftsmen as Howard will contribute to good films in the lineup.";

	schema:reviewBody "Let me first say that I'm a very big Star Wars fan. I saw the first one as a teenager back in 1978 had to wait a very long time for the new ones and thought that both Rogue One and The Last Jedi were brilliant. This one however isn't. I even think that Solo A Star Wars Story is the worst entry in the series.Disney has bought the rights to Star Wars and in order to get their investment back they must earn money I get that. So they made a sequel trilogy to Return of the Jedi and are planning a brand new one in the future too. I get that as well. At the same time they produce standalone movies so they can have a Star Wars movie every year. Logical. But why choose Han Solo as a subject a project that can only fail?Making a Han Solo movie without Harrison Ford is a big risk. Who can follow in his iconic footsteps? Actor Alden Ehrenreich does a decent job but he can't make us forget the original actor. It's not even close. Trying to see the movie as a nonHan Solo movie isn't possible either because you're constantly reminded that Alden is supposed to be the real deal. I don't know how many times the famous dice Solo's lucky charm is shown to proof this or when Alden tries to smile like the famous scoundrel.Then the story... Well somebody must have asked the question Okay we'll do Han Solo. Which elements of his past can we use? How he met Chewbacca how he won the Falcon the Kessel run... well they all appear in the story. Wow that's some lazy writing!And remember that famous scene in the Godfather part 2 when Vito arrives in America and somebody asks him his name? Well there is a similar scene in this movie explaining Han's surname. What has he lived his life all the time without one? No it doesn't look like a tribute. Again it's just some lazy writing. Visually the movie is also disappointing.The first part when we meet Han and his girlfriend Qi'ra for the first time even looks like a middleoftheroad DirecttoDVD film. There is a nice scene however when Han and his crew must rob a train as shown in the trailer. To me that was the visual highlight of the movie.In the end there's an effort to make this standalone film fit more into the Star Wars movie canon by showing a famous character that will probably play a big part in the sequel. This surprise comes out of nowhere and it just doesn't work.And yes sequel. Depending on the success two sequels will follow. At the end of part 3 Han will probably walk into the cantina on Tattooine to meet ObiWan and Luke for the first time. So yes that doesn't happen in this movie.It's incredible that the great Lawrence Kasdan Empire Strikes Back Raiders of the lost arc cowrote this story. There are absolutely no surprises in there and the character build up of Solo and Emilia Clarke's Kira pardon Qi'ra is very poor at times. The scene in which Han speaks Wookie ! is an all time low in Star Wars history only to be outlowed by the Yippie from Episode 1 and Nooooo! from Episode 3. And a robot with an attitude? Come on! Been there done that.I think Disney  like so many Stormtroopers  pretty much misfired with this movie. Who the hell okayed this script? Donald Glover is charming as Lando but could have had more screentime. Woody Harrelson and Paul Bettany always perform well and Emilia Clarke... well the movie stops just when her character becomes interesting. Her character could be fascinating in the sequel that hopefully will not be made.Ever since I heard of Solo A Star Wars Story I had a bad feeling about it. I wasn't wrong. Solo is a movie made for all the wrong reasons money and should have never been green lit. It's just Star Wars overkill.Let me end with something positive in the movie theatre there were also fans who did like the movie so there's a slight chance that I'm too harsh for the film. So if you really want to see it go ahead!Oh yeah there's no aftercredits scene in this film!".

	schema:reviewBody "I have a really good feeling about this! That's the line that Han says in the trailer that's playing in the cinema before the movies. And I remember my friend leaning over to me and saying I hate that he says that so much. There's no denying that all of my friends felt that this movie was not needed me included. But we got it nonetheless and I always wanna give every movie a chance. Star Wars has been a very meaningful and inspirational saga for me and my family since ever before I can even remember. When Disney took over I held out hope that the new adventures would give me some joy of revisiting these characters in this world that I love. Unfortunately I have been feeling more and more let down about the whole situation. I'm not gonna get into it here because there's too much to discuss. And there's already plenty of people who have voiced their displeasure of the mishandling of this property. The fear of us getting a new SW film every year is that the specialness will fade away. That they no longer feel like the events they were and that SW becomes oversaturated. It's been talked to death on other platforms I know. I'm gonna get to what I thought since that's why you are reading. Well I did my best to go in with no expectations. Just to be open with the whole expect the worst and hope for the best type thing. And yes you feel the Star Warsyness but I couldn't help but to leave the cinema less happy than you should watching a SW movie. The action setpieces the references and the practical effects are appreciated. But the core of the story needed more.Every beat of what you sort of expect to happen happens. Chewbacca and Han's friendship was what I bought the most. It honestly felt pure and sympathetic. They got that right. Of course the heist stuff is fun but the care for the people and story? Other than the fact that you already know some of them based on previous films you don't feel the importance of why this needed to be told. It becomes an uneventful film in the series that really adds nothing new to what you already know about our main characters. It's nice to see Lando because you know him but in the end he is just there in surfacelevel form. Nothing against Donald Glover he was a great casting choice. But if this was your introduction to him or Han then I'm not sure how much you would care. The reason I felt I could care a little was based on knowing who Han or Lando are in the other movies. I will again say that I enjoyed when the sense of urgency kicked in. You know when a mission or quest is presented and you go Yeah I'm ready. Let's go on an adventure. It's unfortunate that the adventure leads to no special impact. Creature effects and designs felt organic to the world so that was nice to see. I bought the underground gambling places a lot more here than I did in The Last Jedi. Here they blended in to the world and didn't distract. Everything looked and felt like it belonged in the SW universe. Although I would be happy if they didn't overrelay on everything that's nostalgia. Some new element would be nice to introduce. But this movie lands in a safe zone where no big leaps of risks are taken. The problem is that it failed to engage me in the actual story.The movie didn't make me feel happy or angry it's a feeling in between. It's probably just fine but you won't remember most if it. An average scifi movie that doesn't do much more than to be mildly entertaining. I have nothing against Ron Howard. I feel more bad for him because he had to take over midproduction and fix what he could. I respect the commitment in his effort but I think I would have done some changes to make sure it got a warmer reaction. How about Alden Would that it were so simple  The rules don't apply to you Ehrenreich? Well he's not a bad actor kids. Leave him alone. The issue is that I just couldn't buy him as Solo. I'm sorry Alden. You did your best but you seemed more like another character. There's glimmers towards the end that remind you that it's supposed to be Han but again it's surface level. Not to say that I didn't think his character was likeable. No he has charisma and humanity about him. But it's sad that it's never to the point where he earns the role and you go That's Solo!. I'm gonna end the review by saying that I'm conflicted about it. There are fun scenes to enjoy but the the bigger picture is... kind of ..uninteresting. I hate to say it and the worst part is that I'm starting to feel ready to let go of the new SW. If Episode IX doesn't give me the motivation to see what happens next then... What's the point?PS There's a cameo at the end and it was actually the most unexpected and exciting part of the movie. But it's also a little bit like Oh I'm happy to see you.. But what.. Why again?".

Alden Ehrenreich's acting is ordinary but it is quite acceptable. Audiences expected there would be some familiar actors in this Disney Star Wars marketing product however I unfortunately could not find Harrison Ford in this film. I remember there was his credit in online data but it had gone. Ron Howard's directing had editorial support from Pietro Scalia. What factor made this product dull and boring? That must be the story screenplay. Is there any dramatic moment in this film?  I think that is when tragedy of Solo and Qi'ra happens at expositional sequence at the beginning. The worst moment is miracle of Solo easily reencountering Qi'ra. This plot defect failed the dramatic dynamics of the entire film and made it extremely boring.  I'm sorry in my mind true Han Solo is only Harrison Ford. Only Harrison can make this film successful!  My rating is 2 out of 10. 1 for Pietro Scalia and the other for tragedy of Solo and Oi'ra. Anyway there is a translational gag for this film that Solo in Chinese means Soros the neoliberal demon. Thus Chinese translation of this film is Han Solo Han Suoluo. It is a great job to mention in this review.".

The main guy I refuse to call him Han and the Mother of Dragons had about four facial expressions between them in the entire movie.

It doesn't have a clear vision  hell it doesn't have any at all. The pacing of it is all over the place. The story is cliched weak it lacks a strong direction. The jokes most of the time fall flat  most of the time they do not work or feel inappropriate and forced. Also the movie's tone is quite inconsistent while the actors don't really do a convincing job portraying their characters either.This movie sums up perfectly what Star Wars has become. What once was the holy grail of popculture and a shining beacon of hope that showed how massappealing movies can carry just as important messages as arthouse movies and dramas turned into something that's anything but reminiscent of Star Wars. It feels like a 4 days old dry burger from a fastfood restaurant that was halfly chewed and spitted out.There's only one good thing in this movie that leads to my two star rating as much as it tried through it's entire runtime it wasn't able to spin SW in the mud the way The Last Jedi did. This movie just wasn't able to be as disrespectful to the world and characters of Star Wars and to it's fans as The Last Jedi was. Because making such an unbelievably bad and insulting movie takes true talent  that the 'masterminds' behind Solo fortunately did not have. Or maybe it just wasn't able to make things worse because Rian Johnson already killed the Star Wars movies at least in my eyes.".

Talk about Life Imitating Art. But the poor kid didn't have a chance nor would even a great actor who actually resembled Harrison Ford andor channeled him correctly. The SOLO A STAR WAYS STORY screenplay is almost entirely to blame...Lawrence Kasdan who scripted George Lucas's stories for EMPIRE RETURN and RAIDERS and his son Jonathan had no idea what type of fantasy they were creating. Part Space Pirate part Buddy Picture part ActionAdventure part Comedy Part Western Part Chase all enveloped into a preachy melodrama involving the slave labor of children teenage girls and even robots Set Your Blenders Free!...The Kasdans had no vision. Instead they only seemed to Have a dream. But that kind of forcefed melodrama is at this point tiresome clich. In SOLO the message kicks the viewer in the face and doesn't let up.As for the box office SOLO bombed on the opening weekend which means audiences didn't care.

Their planned Boba Fett and Obi Wan prequels are now under a looming shadow plus the fact George Lucas already covered those particular backstories in his rightfully maligned prequels...And in this case hardcore fans and even mainstream audiences didn't need a reason for Han Solo to be anything but the character he was in the Original Trilogy where Harrison Ford's performance felt both effortless and driven leaving no time to reflect upon a life that led to a position of needing to move forward beyond what he was hired for i.e. what he does is who he is...And while the significance of Han Chewbacca and the Millennium Falcon obviously stretches beyond giving the young hero a ride to rescue a princess they still exist to fillin the now while Mark Hamill's oftenthankless Luke Skywalker along with Obi Wan and Leia are left to suffer through the how's and where's and especially the whys. What Harrison Ford brought to the character was a pointed focused glib and mischievous persona that is still involving addictive and timeless.

The plot is decent. Nothing really special. But if you're like me you'll be too busy cringing at nearly every line of dialogue and rooting for the failure of several annoying side characters to even remember what's going on in this story. Also the romance between Han and Kira Emilia Clarke seems forced at times which doesn't help when the two have little to no on screen chemistry. It's sad to say that the biggest redeeming quality of this movie is Chewbacca. Donald Glover as Lando Calrissian is probably the best performance by a human in this movie and he's only ok. He manages to capture a good amount of the charisma of Lando from the original trilogy but sometimes slips into this weird accent that will have you saying 'wtf?'Long story short don't waste your money to go see this movie. I'm a Star Wars fan not a die hard but still a committed fan and following up a mediocre episode in The Last Jedi with this piece of hot garbage has me wondering if I should ever spend my money on a Star Wars movie again.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've been an avid Star Wars fan since 1977. I've seen all the live action films multiple times and even sat through the Holiday Special and the Ewok spinoffs. I was looking forward to Rogue One and booked tickets well in advance for the first show of the first day.I was surprised to find the cinema mostly deserted  especially after the full houses I experienced during the first couple of weeks of The Force Awakens' run. Having watched all the trailers TV spots and clips I had a good idea what to expect and as the film began those expectations were justified. This was a more 'grownup' Star Wars darker more violent and morally ambiguous. I was loving it and thinking it might well turn out to be my new favourite Star Wars film.But... it began to feel very rushed. The action sequences and special effects were superb and there was no doubt this was a film set in the Star Wars universe but characters were being introduced and killedoff at such a pace it was hard to keep up and even harder to care about them. We were whizzed at breakneck pace from planet to planet complete with some slightly jarring captions to tell us where we were and then it suddenly began to sag. As the hastily assembled Rebel crew went on their mission to find Galen I began to lose interest and even found myself nodding off. It was all a bit boring.The pace soon picked up and I got back into it but I was disappointed with Vader's first appearance and completely distracted by the CGI Tarkin. Vader seemed too small physically the voice sounded off and the dialogue especially the final quip seemed out of character. Resurrecting Peter Cushing in digital form was a brave move but the technology is still not quite there and I began to feel more detached from the plot and characters as I analysed the strangeness of his appearance. As the film moved to its final act I was wowed by the visuals but by now I had no real interest in the characters and their deaths just came and went with no emotional impact. In fact my mind was wandering as I noticed more and more how much of the previously released footage wasn't in the final cut of the film  including some of the most spectacular shots such as the TIE fighter looming in front of Jyn on the gantry and the beautiful shot of Krennic striding towards the shore surrounded by the floating bodies of his troops. Rogue One had lost me and was beginning to disappoint.As Vader made his final appearance I was at last feeling some excitement. It was a great scene but... that final shot of CGI Leia was a real 'What? Why? No!' moment. Terrible. Less in this case would definitely have been more.As the film ended there was no applause and everybody got up and left immediately leaving me to watch the credits alone feeling more than a little underwhelmed. It is not a bad film. The design and special effects CGI human faces not withstanding are superb. The cast are interesting and do a good job with very limited characterisation. But Rogue One ultimately failed to involve me emotionally in the story or characters and in the end it kind of felt like watching somebody else play a beautiful video game.".

	schema:reviewBody "Just like the thousands of Star Wars fans out there in the world I was absolutely giddy when I heard that J.J. Abrams was taking the director's helm for the seventh installment of George Lucas's beloved space opera. After I saw the Force Awakens I was not sure how I felt about the movie. It has gotten so many rave reviews and I desperately wanted to feel the same way. After some time since its release and the adrenaline rush has worn out I can honestly say that it was a big disappointment for me as a Star Wars fan. I will not get into the reasons as to why that is since the top reviews of Force Awakens do a superb job pointing out the flaws of that monstrosity.So anyhow I went to see this film with low expectations because of my previous disappointment with the recent addition of the Star Wars franchise. Boy was I wrong.Gareth Edwards puts the WARS in Star Wars unlike I've seen AND felt in the previous films. The dark and serious tone of the film makes you feel the rebel's fear of gruesome warfare as they fight against the more well equipped and ruthless Empire. At one point the film was reminiscent of WWII films due to its excellent portrayal of battle scenes. The acting and dialogue was for the most part well done and the comic reliefs in the film did not feel as forced as ahem FORCED Awakens.The director also does an excellent job connecting the prequels and the original series together. If a viewer sees the series in the numbered order with this film the story line will play out seamlessly.And lastly Darth Vader's scenes in the film definitely adds a terrifying legacy to his name. I will not spoil the scenes for you but he portrays ruthlessness here that was not seen in the other films. The viewer will have a better grasp as to why he is such a feared character in the universe.J.J. Abrams diminished my love for Star Wars. This film has brought back hope in me for the franchise once more as Jyn Erso has done with the rebels.".

	schema:reviewBody "Long ago when I had a poor understanding of the cinematographic universe when the plot of films was deeply indifferent to me I saw a wonderful film in which the hero escaped in the belly of a dead unknown beast and giant metal elephantturtles walked along the snowcovered planet. And I did not think that these feelings can be repeated in adulthood.Unexpected discovery Rogue One one woke a child in me although the plot was clear and there was no infantile desire to jump into tact with gunfights and fights. It was just great. It was just a classic trilogy elevated to the absolute. It's just the same as many years ago. And what is very important without any hidden pathos without an obsessive director's wink in the style of well you realized that this character returned and everyone giggles and applauds.So Rogue One of course is a fresh look. This is another camera work. These are other perspectives and as was rightly noted in trailer analyzes this is an amazing work with scales. The director and the cameraman made things that you believe in. You believe in the size of the Death Star. Believe in the size of the Star Destroyer. And okay it would be one thing launched a comparative infographics and finished on that one. No here all objects of space are constantly involved in some kind of action. The Death Star moves the Destroyers engage in battle the transport workers fighter jets and bombers are fighting alongside. This is a wow this is super this is the star thriller we wanted. The fighter in which the fighters actually shoot down the enemy and the bombers cause point torpedo strikes where the technique creates a real cover and not just hanging around for the crowd as in the Awakening of the Force. And yes this is the very setting of the fights that was in the original trilogy. I am delighted. This is a new operator's view of the old scale of star battles.The next moment is the preservation of the style of Lucas. Here everything pleases not less. This is a city similar both to Naboo I episode and Tatooine IV episode. This is nature similar to what we saw in the second part during the rapprochement of Anakin with Amidala or on Kashyyyk with its battles in the woods. Everything looks natural and beautiful. There are no eared adherents of the dark side wading through unnatural winter forests built on an old 3D engine. The whole environment looks beautiful relevant familiar in the atmosphere. It seems that this is called landscape design.The plot of the film is not snotty does not shine with pathos. Everything happens naturally. Heroes look vital at first glance there is no logic. The actors also played very well. Emotions want to believe the motivation is clear.VII episode of the Star Wars exported at the expense of the name. If you remove the name you will receive a parody of the IV part with comical physics and a trash story. But Rogue One is a terrific epic saga. One of the best films in the universe of Star Wars.".

Fortunately my fears were unfounded. Rogue one is as engrossing as it is seamless and while its not perfect it had everything required to make a great movie. I guess everyone has different expectations of Star Wars. The plot which I will only briefly describe involves a group of rebels attempting to secure the plans to the Death Star the designer of which having a morale conscience built the deliberate flaw The exhaust port which Stewie Darth Vader asked about in Family Guy so that it could be easily destroyed as long as the information fell into the right hands. This information is contained in an archive and it falls to the daughter of the designer Jyn Erso to not only restore her fathers name but get the designs to the rebels who are just itching to get on with events in Episode Four New Hope and blow the thing up.So does it hold up? Well yes not only does it hold up I would put this film on par with Empire and also Episode IV and this coming from someone who saw the first film on the silver screen in 1977. Gareth Edwards is a director who understands all the combined elements that make a Star Wars Film great. First a good script with the right mix of drama action pathos and humour and above all a story that actually makes sense secondly good well written rounded characters that are interesting diverse and unique third great visuals  there's so many memorable shots in this film and so many of them are the shots you always wanted to see fourth well directed action that looks and feels real that is tense and that you can follow fifth  tension this film has it in spades Sixth nods and references to the original trilogy  they come in abundance some are comedic some pure nostalgia while others are entirely appropriate and work so well within the story. Seventh  real sets please give me a London Underground station redressed over bland CGI sterile sets any day of the week. Here the technology enhances the story and the tension and at no time tries to substitute for either. It is the perfect mix of live action  CG effects. I have not seen them so well combined since Lord of the Rings. This is a man who clearly understands his craft of what makes for a great film. I was highly critical of the prequel movies which really are a masterclass in how not to make a film here the total opposite is true. I am not a die hard Star Wars fan in any sense and was fully prepared to be very critical of this film but find it hard to find fault in it anywhere. The supporting cast were especially good here everyone from Riz Ahmed to Forest Whitaker giving it their all. The new villain of the piece is brilliantly played by Ben Mendelson Hard to believe this is the kid from The Big Steal! Donnie Yen's character was beautifully written I could have watched another movie just about him alone. The cast feels truly international as any universe should. Many British actors really make their mark in smaller roles including Duncan Pow  Ben Daniels as Rebel Foot Solider and General Pilot respectively while the likes of Sharon DuncanBrewster  Jonathon Aris as Rebel Senators argue the merits of the attack in a tense conference debate  gone are the boring council meetings of the prequels. Strong drama is the key ingredient of the day. Here the Rebellion is shown as a far more tangible real faction not everyone agrees with each other things get messy and sometimes the wrong people are killed  the film even begs to ask the question how better really are they than the Empire???  we know of course but its great to see such shades rather than just plain good and bad guys.The film contains so many pure Star Wars moments. I have no doubt the Droid Voiced with skill by Alan Tudky will become a favourite of many and new aliens and ship designs are not thin on the ground.Chiefly in the acting credits plaudits must go to Felicity Jones who plays Jyn with real conviction while Diego Luna avoids a Han Solo portrayal of Cassian her would be ally and sometimes adversary. The appearances of Vader and Tarkin Incredible are entirely warranted and in proportion with the rest of the film.One or two of the subplot characters are a little underwritten perhaps deleted scenes and a longer cut will reveal them to be less so but that really is nit picking I had no issue with this at all. To juggle so many major and minor characters in a single narrative in a tight running time for any director is no mean feat and Edwards manages it extremely well. I have no doubt Edwards had to steer an entire army of Executives in order to deliver the film he wanted. Perhaps one day someone will make a film about that? I have no doubt it would make for quite a story  Whatever were his obstacles he clearly overcame them. He has done himself and every Star Wars fan proud. Pure class.".

I have no doubt Edwards had to steer an entire army of Executives in order to deliver the film he wanted. Perhaps one day someone will make a film about that? I have no doubt it would make for quite a story  Whatever were his obstacles he clearly overcame them. He has done himself and every Star Wars fan proud. Pure class.";

Leading female actor wasn't that good in my opinion but otherwise this movie had everything a SW fan could wish for. Good old characters good old places and an overall good old SW feeling.

But after seeing Rogue One I appreciate TFA a lot more because at least it was entertaining and engaging.Rogue One is boring. Boring boring boring boring and boring. I can appreciate where it sits within the timeline and was actually interested in how to the Death Star plans got into R2D2. However the story is so ludicrously unimaginative that I wish I could unlearn the official story and go back to making up something myself.The fundamental problem is that the writers forgot this was a Star Wars movie until about 75 of the way in and then went Oh crap there's supposed to be space battles in this thing. And here begins the rant spoilers ahead...Let's start with the main character Jyn. Firstly I said this in my review of Guardians of the Galaxy and I will say it here killing a main characters parents when they are a small child is not enough to make me give a crap about what happens to them. So she was orphaned when her mother was killed and her father chose to go back to the Empire.. just like millions of other children effected by the war. Secondly this character is so unimpressive and has basically no skills that are helpful to the Rebellion other than the fact that she's the daughter of the genius scientist behind the Death Star. Sure she can fire a phaser but that's pretty much as helpful as she gets. Why a group of committed Rebellion fighters would follow this girl into battle confounds me.Cassian the rebel fighter assigned to help Jyn is just as unimpressive. We're supposed to feel for him because he lost his family and has been forced to kill people for the Rebellion and feels bad about it but in the end you feel nothing.K2SO  ah the generic and expected robot comedy relief that brings a few chuckles but nothing much else which is no reflection on Alan Tudyk who I love but they didn't give him much to work with And whilst it was nice to see Darth Vader back in all his glory and in the voice of James Earl Jones his cameo was blinkandyou'dmissit and really doesn't add to the story in any way.And then basically all the other characters were so unimpressive that I don't remember any of them and therefore have nothing to say about them.The 2 stars I've given to this review are purely for the CGI in the final 45 mins of this movie which is pretty bloody spectacular. But once it got to that point I'd stopped caring a while ago. The exception being the CGI young Princess Leia which was just CREEPY.So to summarise Boring and unimaginative shouldn't have been made in the first place.".

It has a few bright moments with their reprogrammed droid K 2SO being the only good character out of the whole movie. The action scenes fall short and are more inclined to have something explode rather than show the tide of a battle drastically change within a second. As for the Death Star well it honestly only needed to be used once. But no go ahead and destroy a key base which has all of your plans most of which most likely don't have any back ups. I'm sure the Emperor won't mind losing key military schematics. Then the movie fails to even get the menacing Lord Vader's look right. Episode 3 did it well enough you can do it too Disney. This movie was an eye opener critics had nothing but praise for this movie yet all I see is a big step in the wrong direction.".

NO OPENING CRAWL  It seems like the people who made this movie did not consider consistency to be important in the Star Wars franchise. This is the first movie in the franchise to not have an opening crawl and not having consistency really shows in the quality of the movie.2. BAD PACING and TRANSITION  In the beginning of the movie you have the camera jump from random planets without any real explanation as to what is going on and this type of camera work goes on for the entire movie. It just feels like a bunch of random shots put together.3. NO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT  You feel absolutely no emotion or bond towards any of the characters. All of them feel replaceable and there is no memorable chemistry between the characters in any way. I have no idea why Forrest Whittaker was even in the film because he serves no purpose. His character finds the main lead and then it entirely skips any sort of character development that could've happened between the two. I don't even remember the characters names because most of them were so unmemorable4. THE ROBOT  As I said before consistency did not seem to be important to the makers of this movie. The reprogrammed imperial robot seemed TOO human. He moved too much like a human and talked too much like a human which did not happen in any of the other star wars movies. The most human like droid was C3p0 but even he did not MOVE like a human.5. VADER  Something about this Vader seemed to be off. I can't point my finger as to what it is but his style of talking and also his suit seems to be different because I didn't see a chain around his neck. Also his lightsabre fighting style seemed too agile and more like the prequel rather than a hard hitting slow style like in the original trilogy. As I said before consistency didn't seem important to the filmmakers and little things like this pulled me out of the movie.6. Obvious SJW Agenda  I am KoreanAmerican. When I watch a Star Wars film I just want a good Star Wars film. I don't need a Star Wars filmed disguised with a SJW Agenda. Is it a coincidence that the Rebels has a woman an arab two Asian guys a hispanic etc. and the Empire is all white? Why can't I just have a good Star Wars film?I will say this. The only good part of the movie was at the end when the Death Star fires at the planet because that is the only time I actually felt emotion for the characters and saw a little bit of character development.Otherwise this was a terrible movie. You will only watch it just because it is Star Wars.".

Why on earth did they put her in it? Her acting is so bad she is simply unwatchable. Forest Whitaker must have caught something from the other actors because this was the worst I have seen him. What voice was that? Breathing like Vader? What??Where is any of the Star Wars magic? None of the star wars movies outside of the original trilogy even touch the same soul and spiritual mysticism magic and excitement. This felt like a waste of time. I could have written a better story and script myself. This was so disjointed no continuity I squirmed and shuffled in my seat in agony. One blind dude who can sort of use the Force? What a bore. His acting was almost as bad as Felicity Jones'. I am one with the force.. nuh nuh nerrr no you're not. I couldn't understand Diego Luna's dialogue nor many of the other actors. What was the point in the robot? Misfiring comedy was the final nail in the coffin of this tripe.I have a bad feeling about this.... again?! Really? How wincingly weak can you make it? The dialogue between Darth Vader with Orson was inanely boring and erratic from the first line I switch off and wondered if I'd left the heating on at home. They couldn't even get the electronic tone right. The original trilogy had you on the edge of your seat with every line Vader spoke. Ben Mendelsohn as Orson was terribly miscast his voice like many of the other characters was sharp and hysterical with no conviction. What happened to the music?! No love put into it no excitement generated at ALL! Awful. Just keep the Star Wars theme until the end credits?! Why bother? Action the wobbly handheld first person is way too old hat and doesn't work. Whose firing on who and... why? Nonconsequential blasting for the sake of it. The last battle at the end had some hope then it just threw in some Walkers and some other things we might recognize to help it sustain some resemblance to 'star wars. Some climbing falling in a futuristic tunnel..Then there was a sudden rush to tie in the ending with the start of 'A New Hope' which culminated with Disney animated Princess Leah taking the Death Star plans? She seemed so much more involved than to just pay such weak homage to her  just at the end? Why do that? How irritating like the rest of the movie. Star Wars stupidly destroyed.".

I felt as if this was a great opportunity to bring him along because of it being a standalone movie that has a start and end. The director did an absolutely brilliant job helped give us a good understanding of the characters whilst moving the story along the way at an appropriate pace to a massive climax the actor behind the blind monk was the star of the film for me and I definitely think Felicity Jones did a great job as the lead actress of the film The acting cast did a great job to capture the emotion of the movie without overdoing it which was incredibly pleasing to see. For me it sits just behind Empire Strikes Back as the best Star Wars film and as for pop came out of the film not saying anything just grinning as much as I've ever seen him until he was dropped off home where he got out with a wink and said 'Thanks for inviting me loved every minute of it'".

	schema:reviewBody "Gareth Edwards and his crew accomplished something I never thought would be possible they contributed a great Star Wars film to the Star Wars saga and canon.This movie was great as far as Star Wars is concerned. It truly felt like a real Star Wars movie and not a cheap fan service attempt like the Force Awakens was although the Force Awakens was very fun it felt like it didn't take Star Wars itself seriously enough.So what worked with this one? Here's the list1The story. It felt like a totally believable space fantasy story and furthermore a totally believable Star Wars story. It clearly was Gareth Edwards doing his own thing with Star Wars but also paying total respect to the path George Lucas originally paved with a New Hope.At the end of the day this story is a GOOD Star Wars story and it feels like it can be placed alongside the original trilogy in story quality.2Not only the story but the fact it was taken seriously.Whether you like the Force Awakens or not you got to admit it felt a bit cartoony. It didn't feel like a serious addition to the Star Wars saga. It felt as if that the people involved certainly liked Star Wars but in a very fanservicy sort of way. Everything felt very fun in the Force Awakens but not serious. Rogue One doesn't fall into this trap. It was an amusing and fun ride surely but the story was clearly priority here.Furthermore the story elements and movie went dark when it needed to and didn't hold back. If the story needed death that's what we saw. If it needed to show slaughter and killing we saw it.3No element of Star Wars was abused.There was no over abuse of lighstabers the Force or any old Star Wars characters. Wherever there was any fan service in this movie it was done VERY tastefully. A respectful nod to the previous movies but it never went HEY LOOK HOW COOL THIS IS. THIS IS SOMETHING YOU GUYS LOVE RIGHT?4The characters and the actors that played them.Star Wars is never going to be known as a movie with great acting but full credit should go to the actors in this edition of Star Wars. They did a great job of bringing life to these characters enough for us to care about them and the action occurring on screen but not so much that it distracted from the ensemble story.5The pacing. This movie was perfect Star Wars pacing. And by perfect Star Wars pacing I refer to Empire Strikes Back. This was not an overly speedy movie that gave you no time to think and yet it was not an overly slow and drawn out movie.6The tiein with the original trilogy.This story takes place before A New Hope. And as much as Rogue One completely does it's own thing and takes its own direction as a standalone film it beautifully ties in with the original series. As I said above I completely believe and accept this story as great Star Wars material as much as I do George Lucas' original stories.Overall this Star Wars film is a 55 Star Wars film. I only rate it 710 on IMDb because well Star Wars is Star Wars and not the Godfather D. As far as Rogue One stands in movie history it's a great action movie. But as a Star Wars film it now has a special place in my heart.My personal new Star Wars top 3 ranking goes as follows 1Empire Strikes Back 2A New Hope 3Rogue One".

	onyx:emotionText "Gareth Edwards and his crew accomplished something I never thought would be possible they contributed a great Star Wars film to the Star Wars saga and canon.This movie was great as far as Star Wars is concerned. It truly felt like a real Star Wars movie and not a cheap fan service attempt like the Force Awakens was although the Force Awakens was very fun it felt like it didn't take Star Wars itself seriously enough.So what worked with this one? Here's the list1The story. It felt like a totally believable space fantasy story and furthermore a totally believable Star Wars story. It clearly was Gareth Edwards doing his own thing with Star Wars but also paying total respect to the path George Lucas originally paved with a New Hope.At the end of the day this story is a GOOD Star Wars story and it feels like it can be placed alongside the original trilogy in story quality.2Not only the story but the fact it was taken seriously.Whether you like the Force Awakens or not you got to admit it felt a bit cartoony. It didn't feel like a serious addition to the Star Wars saga. It felt as if that the people involved certainly liked Star Wars but in a very fanservicy sort of way. Everything felt very fun in the Force Awakens but not serious. Rogue One doesn't fall into this trap. It was an amusing and fun ride surely but the story was clearly priority here.Furthermore the story elements and movie went dark when it needed to and didn't hold back. If the story needed death that's what we saw. If it needed to show slaughter and killing we saw it.3No element of Star Wars was abused.There was no over abuse of lighstabers the Force or any old Star Wars characters.

	schema:reviewBody "In 1977 Star Wars a New Hope entered our cultural conscious as a brilliant mythic coming of age tale. Alienated youth of our technological age were treated to a unique blending of chivalrysamurai code western and WW2 heroics couching a message very relevant to the cold war destruction of planets can be defeated if we turn to our own human feelings. The following two Star Wars films developed the wonderful characters setting up the true hero who stands up to evil and rather than betray his values faces death and continues with unwavering hope that the most corrupted can be turned back to the light. A young 10year old watching the original trilogy could be pretty inspired and morally educated. What do we have in Rogue One? We have covert field assassinations an ostensibly good guy using mind torture a friendly robot who casually murders stormtroopers for comic relief a good guy who shoots a villain in the back wounded enemies being finished off urban ambushes by rebels with collateral damage. Absolutely inept character exposition. Action and war movie clichs. Fan service insertions. An utterly bizarre character backstory attempting to explain that the weakness in the Death Star was not a thematic element based in the fundamental truth about the weakness of technology and fallibility of human design but actually a designedin flaw by a saboteur under the most implausible of circumstances. Not only is this a bad movie it is culturally conservative. It tells us to lower ourselves to complete the task. If the message of 'A New Hope' was to have faith in humanity to bring down the military machine the message of Rogue One is that in order to win you have to get your hands dirty and be prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice for your cause. If this is the sustenance for the youth of the next generation we should be ashamed and alarmed. It is disappointing that Disney the writers producers and a director could so completely miss what makes Star Wars Star Wars.".

	schema:reviewBody "Rogue One is the first Star Wars film to be set outside the Episodic Sagas. With that there was a lot of pressure on it to perform and launch this new series of Star Wars films.By far this is the least kid friendly film. This was at it's core a war film something we have never really gotten in the Star Wars universe. With the war theme we got an overall darker tone than we are use to and it really suited the story they were telling. We never have experienced the war side of Star Wars because the stories have always been focused on a force user rather than the events around them. Because there are no jedi we got to see more of the Rebellion and the Empire and the battle that is taking place during the original trilogy.Offsetting the darker tone of the film I thought this was perhaps the funniest Star Wars film. There are so many one liners and comedic moments that brings a lighter tone to the darker moments. I think much of the comedic moments came from the droid character K2SO. For the most part he was the comedic relief and because of that you are drawn to his character and is a stand out.While still on the cast and characters I thought they were near perfect. While the characters themselves aren't as fleshed out as we get during the saga films for the role themselves they served their purpose. Apart from K2SO I thought Donnie Yen's character Chirrut was a close second standout. I really enjoyed his character because of his connection into the Star Wars law.How much you enjoy Rogue One is for the most part going to depend how deep you invested you are into the world of Star Wars. As someone who read Cataylst in the lead up to Rogue One I felt as though my experience during this film was enhanced so much. There were so many moments that was so much meaningful and heartfelt because I knew the backstory to some of these events and characters. There is also a lot fan service in Rogue One that on paper it seems like it's too much. But what stood out was that not one of the fan services felt shoed in. All of it felt like it had a place in the movie and should of been there regardless of if it was a fan service moment or not.Walking out of this film you are going to be on a high and that is because of the fantastic third act this film has. Rogue One has a third act that will rival that of Return of the Jedi. This is one of the best space battle I have ever seen. While I love the one in Return of the Jedi personally I rank the opening battle from Revenge of the Sith above it. However the space battle in Rogue One beats them all. It had the feel that Return of the Jedi brought in their space battle but with the action and visual effects the space battle in Revenge of the Sith.Stepping back from the space battle the third act has a terrific ground level fight. This was where the war tone was heavily present. This was a scene we see in a WWII war film but with a Star Wars skin. There's no better way to describe it and that is a good thing. What really enhanced the war toned ground fight was how well it was edited between the action happening on the ground and the spectacle of a space battle happening above them.I have to mention Vader. While he isn't in it all that much when he is his presence is felt. Without giving so much away his final scene is perhaps one of my favourite scenes I have ever seen. The short scene alone rivals the Airport scene in Captain America Civil War for me. It is so exciting that it has the capability to make any major Star Wars fans cry with happiness.Overall I loved this movie. This did what it need to do and prove that they can make Star Wars films that isn't all lightsabers and Skywalkers. But what this film does the best is enhance A New Hope. As soon as I walked out the cinema I wanted to go and watch A New Hope. Personally I really struggle with watching A New Hope but with Rogue One it makes me excited to go back and watch the original Star Wars.910".

	schema:reviewBody "Star Wars Episode VI  Return of the Jedi 1983 is a third sequel in the original Star Wars trilogy it is flawed yet very entertaining solid third sequel and an epic conclusion to the original Star Wars trilogy. Honestly in my opinion Return of the Jedi is far way better film than The Force Awakens that movie was a disaster and it sucked I rather watch this movie any time. It is not my favorite film in the series and I don't love this movie that much like I love the first two movies but I like it and it think it is very good at some points. The film has a lot of problems that hurts the movie. I still have enjoyed this movie and I had a lot of fun. Return of the Jedi 1983 is directed this time from Richard Marquand a different director than it was directed from Irvin Kershner and George Lucas. This movie was released on the same year that I was born in 1983. The film is pretty good on it is own way but on the other thing it suffers from problems and flaws.Things I like in this movie The first hour is set back on planet Tatooine which is a rescue mission which I like the story is set where the first movie begins and ends here.Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker Chewbacca Lando Calrissian Princess Leia Organa C3PO and R2D2 return to Tatooine to rescue Han Solo who was encased in carbonite at the end of Star Wars Episode V  The Empire Strikes Back from the gangster Jabba the Hutt voice Larry Ward.A battle on ship with Luke steadily taking the fight to Jabba's men. During the battle Leia strangles Jabba to death with the chain around her neck and with R2D2's help escapes from her bonds. The heroes destroy the ship kills the bad guys and save Han solo. I love the explosion the rescue and than they are all save.I love that we find out from ghost of ObiWan Ben Kenobi Alec Guinness that Leia Carrie Fisher is the sister of Luke  Mark Hamill. I love that Luke revels to Leia that she is his sister.I like the battle on the Endor Leia Han Chewbacca C3PO R2D2 and Ewoks are battling Stormtroopers to destroying the shield generator for the second Death Star and they do the destroy it. Lando and his assault team destroys the deaths tar on the end.Luke face Darth Vader and the evil Emperor and fights both of them while they where both trying to bring him on a dark side of the force to join them.I love when Vader toys with the notion of turning Leia to the dark side Luke gives in to his rage and furiously gains the upper hand in the battle slicing off Vader's right robotic hand in a rage in one swift cut and makes his father succumb to defeat at the mercy of his son's blade.Realizing that Luke cannot be turned the Emperor uses Force lightning against him to torture and attempt to kill him. Deeply affected by the sight of his son dying before him Vader repents and turns on the Emperor throwing him down a reactor shaft to his death.Luke try's to save Anakin but he dies before he could save him.I feel that Luke's transition from a teenager to calm and collected warrior of the Force feels very authentic. His conflict between Darth Vader and the Emperor contains some of the best scenes in the entire saga.Things I don't like The film has a few problems that are really unnecessary and I really hate it This movie's biggest flaw is the pacing the Ewoks and their role in the film. Star Wars been in a forest aren't Star Wars suppose to set in the Galaxy and not in the forest? Personally I don't mind the Ewoks but their introduction causes the movie comes to a screeching halt. Another fault of this movie is its attempts at humor. It feels often unnatural and forced a lot of the time. The Phantom Menace has been notorious for having this problem as well but they most likely originated here.Master Yoda dies in this film! Why? Watching Yoda in the prequels I have really enjoyed him much more than I have watching him in the last two movies. Little guy grove up in to my heart. So I disagree about him dying.I am giving this movie an 8 I watch A New Hope and Retun of the Jedi on TV as a kid I don't remember watching The Empire Strikes Back but I have saw those tow movies and still I like Return of the Jedi a lot.".

Deeply affected by the sight of his son dying before him Vader repents and turns on the Emperor throwing him down a reactor shaft to his death.Luke try's to save Anakin but he dies before he could save him.I feel that Luke's transition from a teenager to calm and collected warrior of the Force feels very authentic. His conflict between Darth Vader and the Emperor contains some of the best scenes in the entire saga.Things I don't like The film has a few problems that are really unnecessary and I really hate it This movie's biggest flaw is the pacing the Ewoks and their role in the film. Star Wars been in a forest aren't Star Wars suppose to set in the Galaxy and not in the forest? Personally I don't mind the Ewoks but their introduction causes the movie comes to a screeching halt. Another fault of this movie is its attempts at humor. It feels often unnatural and forced a lot of the time. The Phantom Menace has been notorious for having this problem as well but they most likely originated here.Master Yoda dies in this film! Why? Watching Yoda in the prequels I have really enjoyed him much more than I have watching him in the last two movies. Little guy grove up in to my heart. So I disagree about him dying.I am giving this movie an 8 I watch A New Hope and Retun of the Jedi on TV as a kid I don't remember watching The Empire Strikes Back but I have saw those tow movies and still I like Return of the Jedi a lot.";

	schema:reviewBody "A long time ago in a galaxy far far away.....There was a boy who was only two years old when the original Star Wars film was released. He doesn't remember first seeing the movie but he also doesn't remember life before it. He does remember the first Star Wars themed gift he got...a shoebox full of action figures from the original set. He was too young to fully appreciate how special that gift would be. But years later he would get what to this day goes down as one of the best gifts he's ever received another box full of action figures ten of the final twelve he needed to complete his collection. It's now legendary in this boy's family how the last action figure he needed Anakin Skywalker stopped being produced and carried in stores and how this boy went for about ten years until he got into college trying to track one down and finally bought it from someone on his dorm floor for a bag of beer nuggets don't ask...it's a Northern Illinois University thing.I can't review Star Wars as a movie. It represents absolutely everything good fun and magical about my childhood. There's no separating it in my mind from Christmases birthdays summers and winters growing up. In the winter my friends and I would build snow forts and pretend we were on Hoth I was always Han Solo. My friends' dad built them a kickass tree house and that served as the Ewok village. They also had a huge pine tree whose bottom branches were high enough to create a sort of cave underneath it and this made a great spot to pretend we were in Yoda's home. I am unabashedly dorky when it comes to Star Wars and I think people either just understand that or they don't. I don't get the appeal of Lord of the Rings or Star Trek but I understand the rabid flocks of fans that follow them because I am a rabid fan of George Lucas's films.I feel no need to defend my opinion of these movies as some of the greatest of all time. Every time I put them in the DVD player I feel like I'm eight years old again when life was simple and the biggest problem I had was figuring out how I was going to track down a figure of Anakin Skywalker.Grade for the entire trilogy A".

Besides they ARE cute and I don't care if they're marketable.  Yubb Nubb!This movie always leaves me in tears.  It's perfect.  The end could not be better.  I'm excited for The Phantom Menace because it will suddenly throw the focus of the whole story from Luke to Anakin.  I love how he is revealed at the end  it would be too unresolved any other way.  So those of you who are complaining that Vader's helmet was removed take a moment to think about it.  It's very effective.  Vader the man who hid behind a mask for 20 years is finally revealed as a sicklooking man.  He is not entirely machine  he's vulnerable.I don't know how the casting director happened to pick such good actors in A New Hope.  They all do so well.  They are believable characters.  Hamill does an excellent job with his dramatic character development.  Fisher does a fine job being a female role model I mean come on!  She killed Jabba even when so many others had failed!.  Harrison Ford  need I say more?The music is once again brilliant.  It's so very touching and significant when you can pick out character themes at different parts of the movie. The best climax is when Luke shouts NOOO! and jumps out to fight his father in the Final Battle.  John Williams is nothing short of a genius!  What an amazing man!Already the movie has so much more meaning for me because of Episode I. I can't wait to finally see it in the theatres CAN I WAIT??? and then watch the original trilogy yet again.Bravo!".

	schema:reviewBody "After Star Wars A New Hope redefined science fiction and The Empire Strikes Back redefined Star Wars it's hard to believe that the third and final film of this trilogy can manage to be as good as the other two but this one really does a nice job.  The first part of the film resolves the cliffhanger left by the previous one with an elaborate escape plan that is in keeping with the incredible suspense and action of the first two films. Then the film moves back to the rebel alliance and what's going on in the war.  There is a lot of action in the scenes building up to the rebellion's final confrontation with the Emperor.  When the battle begins the audience is already on the edge of their seats from everything leading up to it and this final battle is even more intense than those from the other films. This climax is definitely more dense with action than any other part of the trilogy with the most at stake for the rebellion.  This is continually changing between a ground battle between the rebel strike crew on land including Han Solo Chewbacca and Leia the battle raging on in space including Lando and a confrontation between Luke and the Emperor on the new Death Star which leads up to another duel with Darth Vader.  It is really intense since the rebels constantly seem to be losing the battle that will determine the outcome of the war and there seems to be no escape. Although I think the idea of Ewoks overpowering stormtroopers is a bit farfetched it didn't seem very unrealistic since they were more of a distraction that the rebels could use rather than an actual threat to the stormtroopers although they did have some luck fighting them.  There is also a twist or two at the end that nobody saw coming which may not be quite as stunning as that of The Empire Strikes Back but still complete a very spectacular trilogy very well.  With the light tone of A New Hope and the more sinnister tone of The Empire Strikes Back this film really completes them by combining the two in this grand finale.  The Special Edition for Return of the Jedi concentrated on what would have been nice to change since not much of the original really needed it.  Fifteen years of technology advancements didn't seem to make up for fifteen years of deterioration as far as the rancor scene is concerned and there still is the occasional disappearing TIE fighter but other than that it was good. The gaping nonthreatening Sarlaac's mouth was given moving tentacles and a huge flytrap looking head that emerged which definitely added to the suspense.  Also the disco was taken out of Jabba's palace and the lame ending of the original was replaced by a huge victory celebration spanning the entire galaxy instead of just a small Ewok village which was the case of the original and that didn't really end a story this big the way it deserved.  It's hard to say which of the three films was the best but since it's all part of the same story the overall trilogy is like one big outstanding film.  A THIRD mustsee for film fans.".

	schema:reviewBody "Perspective is a good thing.  Since the release of Star Wars Episode I The Phantom Menace claims and counterclaims of just how Episode's II and III will eventuate has taken the spotlight off the 'original' Star Wars films making them part of a cohesive whole rather than segregating the older and new films into separate trilogies.  What the new films have done is allow fresh perspectives to be placed on the older films.  This new outlook allows us to greater appreciate what has often been viewed as the weakest of the original trilogy Return of the Jedi.  Often derided for its overly 'cute' factor ROTJ is in a sense as strong as the original and only slightly less impressive than the nearly perfect The Empire Strikes Back.  Indeed the 'cute' element of ROTJ namely the Ewoks remains a weak link in the entire series.  Did George Lucas place the furry midgets in the film purely for the merchandising possibilities?  Only he can answer that question.This cute factor aside the film is a brilliant full circle AND evolution of the saga.  Following on from the conclusion of The Empire Strikes Back Luke Skywalker Mark Hamill follows his Rebel Alliance friends to Tatooine his home planet to rescue Han Solo Harrison Ford the space pirate turned Rebel hero who was captured by Jabba the Hutt for overdue debts.Skywalker is a changed man since leaving Tatooine with Ben 'Obi Wan' Kenobi Alec Guiness to fight the evil Empire.  Now swathed all in black Luke's discovery of his origins have left him confused and torn.  His psychological make up is not as strong as his outward appearance would suggest.  While he might aim to always assist his Rebel friends he yearns for another chance to confront the evil Darth Vader again despite his unassuredness as to whether he will destroy him or eventually turn to the Dark Side and join Vader at the Emperor's side.Early scenes in Tatooine are impressive from Jabba's lair to his floating palace and the 'almighty Sarlac'  an intenstine that lives in the sand. Lucas' CGI enhancements to the film in 1997 actually worsened the overall effect of the Sarlac making it look fake and overdone.The battle scene on Tatooine is outstanding and is one of the more memorable of the saga.  Luke almost singlehandedly anihiliates Jabba and his cronies proving his prowess as a Jedi is now almost complete.When Luke returns to the Degobah system to visit the ailing Yoda one more time the viewer is let down by Yoda's distinct lack of screentime. Undoubtably the star of The Empire Strikes Back Yoda is all but erased from the story as the progression of Luke's destiny is played out on screen.ROTJ really is Luke's film perhaps even more so than the original.  His journey carries the movie as he moves closer to his confrontation with Darth Vader and his fate.  The other Rebel characters certainly work in his shadow.  The romance between Leia Carrie Fisher and Solo is all but nonexistant unlike in Empire.  In fact only Leia's character is developed in ROTJ Solo's character seems to fade as the facets of his personality have become too familiar in the first two films.Their roles are consigned to working alongside the Rebels to destroy an all new Death Star that nears completion.  This time the Emperor himself is overseeing the final stages of construction.  The Empire intends to crush the Rebellion once and for all while the Emperor himself schemes to bring the now powerful Skywalker to his side to work alongside or is that replace? Darth Vader.  The Emperor is a different kind of evil for this film less cunning than Governor Tarkin Peter Cushing from Star Wars more deeply psychologically dark than anything else.  Played brilliantly by Ian McDiarmid the Emperor is just one of those characters you love to hate.All the other actors are well entrenched in their roles.  Hamill surprises as the more wisened Luke making his character's progression from whiny teenager impatient student to enlightened warrior one of the few real character developments of the series.  Ford's role is waring thin as all his charm and charisma was spent in the first two films  he was the REAL star of the first film after all.  Fisher's Leia is more of a prop at least unti the end of the film where she learns things about herself that she was never sure about...  Add in favourites like Alec Guiness as Kenobi Yoda and the loveable Chewbacca C3PO and R2D2 and the series resembles a family more than a cast.Despite the film's corny forest battle involving the Ewoks and the Empire it ends well and includes a three way battle sequence on Endor in space and on the Death Star each with very impressive special effects.  The music as always is brilliant and captures the mood perfectly in every instance.  Just as the 'Blue Danube' worked perfectly for 2001 A Space Odyssey John Williams' score is as much a part of Star Wars folklore as light sabers and the Force.Lucas left the ending open to interpretation meaning there could have been more episodes made.  Indeed scifi fans have created their own versions of Episodes VII VIII and IX in their heads over and over again.  ROTJ works when given a chance and furry cute animals aside is a good finish to the series.When all six episodes get to be viewed together this saga could well be the best ever made.  Is it already?  The addition of Episode I changed the landscape of the series.  This is why Return of the Jedi can now be viewed in a different light and be given a whole new appreciation nearly 20 years after its release.".

Just as the 'Blue Danube' worked perfectly for 2001 A Space Odyssey John Williams' score is as much a part of Star Wars folklore as light sabers and the Force.Lucas left the ending open to interpretation meaning there could have been more episodes made.  Indeed scifi fans have created their own versions of Episodes VII VIII and IX in their heads over and over again.  ROTJ works when given a chance and furry cute animals aside is a good finish to the series.When all six episodes get to be viewed together this saga could well be the best ever made.  Is it already?  The addition of Episode I changed the landscape of the series.  This is why Return of the Jedi can now be viewed in a different light and be given a whole new appreciation nearly 20 years after its release.";

The last half hour exemplifies this the most as the scene switches every few minutes from the woods to the battle among space ships to the individual laserduel between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader.Another nice characteristic this film had that the two previous did not was the absence of infighting between two of the stars. Gone was the incessant bickering between Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford. Finally everyone was on the same page!

	schema:reviewBody "This final entry in George Lucas's STAR WARS movies is often regarded as the weakest of the lot. However this is not to say that it is a totally worthless entry in the series. On the contrary. Sure it's not as groundbreaking as its predecessors and a bit more slowgoing at times but RETURN OF THE JEDI still offers a lot to warrant the price of admission.The first third of the movie where Luke and his friends rescue Han from the palace of Jabba the Hutt is a classic. Jabba a truly disgusting blob of bloated flesh who speaks in his own language not only makes a great villain but a memorable one too. It must have been a nightmare to construct this giant puppet much less give it the spark and life that we see on the finished product. Actually what also makes this sequence fun is the clever use of puppets for the various members of Jabba's court including the intimidating slavering Rancor and scary Sarlaac pit monster. It builds masterfully to its climax and pulls punches all the while.Things get a little bit slower around the second act where Luke discovers that he and Leia are related by blood and when we travel to the forest planet of Endor home of the cuddlesome yet stalwart Ewoks. Most of the complaints about RETURN OF THE JEDI that I've read seem to be centered on these furry creatures in that they somehow disrupt the tone of the saga. I don't totally agree with that although this moment is probably played out a bit longer than it should. However their leader Wicket played by Warrick Davis is a delightfully memorable creation and watching how they handle the Imperial Troops' technology with their simple natural weapons provides a nice contrast.By the time we get to the third act though the pace picks up again as we intercut between the Ewoks battle against the troops Lando and the Rebel Forces launching an attack against the Empire's allnew halfcompleted Death Star and Luke's final showdown with Darth Vader and the Emperor. The latter ties with the Jabba Palace sequence as the highlight of the movie. Mark Hamill flexes his acting chops once again as Luke Skywalker in these scenes and watching him as a fully matured Jedi Knight makes for an unforgettable performance. Also as iconic as James Earl Jones' voice as Darth Vader is he is rivaled only by the shriveled cronelike Emperor played with deliciously raspy frightening evil by Ian McDiarmid. The tension between this trio heightens the excitement of this climactic moment which is appropriately darkly lit and menacingly underscored.The STAR WARS movies have always set standards for special effects and the technical work in RETURN OF THE JEDI can easily hold a candle to its predecessors. The space battle fights are as exhilarating as always and the speeder bike chase through the forest is a knockout. Of course given that this movie was made after A NEW HOPE and THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK it probably shouldn't be so surprising that the special effects have reached an even greater level of excellence. The acting is classic STAR WARS fare Hamill Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher all mature and deepen into their roles and Anthony Daniels provides more hilarious moments as C3PO. Frank Oz's Yoda only appears in two scenes but he makes the most of it. And yes there's also John Williams' music.All told while RETURN OF THE JEDI falters a little bit in the middle the first and third acts deliver in style making this a rather satisfactory finale to one of the greatest sagas ever.In 1997 George Lucas rereleased the classic STAR WARS in digitally restored and revamped Special Editions which featured addedin effects andor shots as well as some enhancements. Of the three RETURN OF THE JEDI appears to have caused the most commotion with STAR WARS fans. Perhaps it can be due to the jarringly outofplace albeit funny if you're not so easily offended Jedi Rocks musical number in Jabba's Palace which although technically amazing does disrupt the flow of the film. However I DID like the ending montage scenes where we see victory celebrations occurring on the various planets of the galaxy. This DVD version features yet more tweakingwe get to see more montage finale scenes notably on Naboo where we hear what sounds like Jar Jar Binks screaming Wesa free! and in what is probably the most controversial change Hayden Christensen as the specter of Anakin Skywalker in the closing scenes. Probably due to the intense and unfair disdain fans have for his somewhat shaky work in EPISODE II ATTACK OF THE CLONES it seems inevitable that fans would put this edition down for that alone. However if you're watching the STAR WARS saga chronologically and contemplating about it chances are you may react a little differently. Nonetheless it is an issue that fans have raised so it's probably best to be warned beforehand.As nice as it would be to have Lucas release the original versions of these three classic films he nonetheless stands by what he said about these revamps being the definitive editions of his classic trilogy and when viewing the STAR WARS movies altogether as one complete saga as Lucas intended it actually makes sense to keep them technically and aurally consistent. The original films will always be engraved in our memories but these new incarnations are just as much fun if one can give them a chance.".

Luke pretty much wanted to redeem his father's good name and at the end Vader regains his humanity just in time not only to save his son Luke but to destroy the Emperor the man who cost Vader his soul.  I also liked the scene in the film where 3PO summarizes the events of the previous chapters for the Ewoks. This also helps to tie everything together as far as the saga is concerned. Also even though many have called this the weakest film in the trilogy it still has enough of a story and great special effects to put it on a par with the previous films.".

	schema:headline " A fine ending  especially after having seen Episode III";
	schema:reviewBody "I thought that ROTJ was clearly the best out of the three Star Wars movies. I find it surprising that ROTJ is considered the weakest installment in the Trilogy by many who have voted. To me it seemed like ROTJ was the best because it had the most profound plot the most suspense surprises most emotionalespecially the ending and definitely the most episodic movie. I personally like the Empire Strikes Back a lot also but I think it is slightly less good than than ROTJ since it was slowermoving was not as episodic and I just did not feel as much suspense or emotion as I did with the third movie.It also seems like to me that after reading these surprising reviews that the reasons people cited for ROTJ being an inferior film to the other two are just plain ludicrous and are insignificant reasons compared to the sheer excellence of the film as a whole. I have heard many strange reasons such as a Because Yoda died b Because Bobba Fett died c Because small Ewoks defeated a band of stormtroopers d Because Darth Vader was revealedI would like to debunk each of these reasons because I believe that they miss the point completely. First off WHO CARES if Bobba Fett died??? If George Lucas wanted him to die then he wanted him to die. Don't get me wrong I am fan of Bobba Fett but he made a few cameo appearances and it was not Lucas' intention to make him a central character in the films that Star Wars fans made him out to be. His name was not even mentioned anywhere in the movie... You had to go to the credits to find out Bobba Fett's name!!! Judging ROTJ because a minor character died is a bit much I think... Secondly many fans did not like Yoda dying. Sure it was a momentous period in the movie. I was not happy to see him die either but it makes the movie more realistic. All the good guys can't stay alive in a realistic movie you know. Otherwise if ALL the good guys lived and ALL the bad guys died this movie would have been tantamount to a cheesy Saturday morning cartoon. Another aspect to this point about people not liking Yoda's death.. Well nobody complained when Darth Vader struck down Obi Wan Kenobi in A New Hope. Many consider A New Hope to be the best of the Trilogy  Why was Obi Wan's death okay but Yoda's not... hmmmmmmmmmmmm.... Another reason I just can not believe was even stated was because people found cute Ewoks overpowering stormtroopers to be impossible. That is utterly ridiculous!! I can not believe this one!! First off the Ewoks are in their native planet Endor so they are cognizant of their home terrain since they live there. If you watch the movie carefully many of the tactics the Ewoks used in defeating the stormtroopers was through excellent use of their home field advantage. Since you lived in the forest all your life I hope you would have learned to use it to your advantage They had swinging vines ropes logs set up to trip those walkers and other traps. The stormtroopers were highly disadvantaged because they were outnumbered and not aware of the advantages of the forest. The only thing they had was their blasters. To add  it was not like the Ewoks were battling the stormtroopers themselves they were heavily assisted by the band of rebels in that conquest. I thought that if the stormtroopers were to have defeated a combination of the Star Wars heros the band of rebels as well as the huge clan of Ewoks with great familiarity of their home terrain that would have been a great upset. Lastly if this scene was still unbelievable to you.. How about in Empire Strikes Back or in A New Hope where there were SEVERAL scenes of a group consisting of just Han Solo Chewbacca and the Princess being shot at by like ten stormtroopers and all their blasters missed while the heros were in full view!! And not only that the heroes  of course always hit the Stormtroopers with their blasters. The troopers must have VERY VERY bad aim then! At least in Empire Strikes Back the Battle of Endor was much more believable since you had two armies pitted each other not 3 heroes against a legion of stormtroopers. Don't believe me? Check out the battle at Cloud City when our heroes were escaping Lando's base. Or when our heros were rescuing Princess Leia and being shot at  somehow they missedas Han Solo and Luke were trying to exit the Death Star.The last reason that I care to discuss others are just too plain ridiculous for me to spend my time here. is that people did not like Darth Vader being revealed! Well in many ways that was a major part of the plot in the movie. Luke was trying to find whether or not Darth Vader was his father Annakin Skywalker. It would have been disappointing if the movie had ended without Luke getting to see his father's face because it made it complete. By Annakin's revelation it symbolized the transition Darth Vader underwent from being possessed by the dark side in his helmet and to the good person he was Annakin Skywalker by removing the helmet. The point is that Annakin died converted to the light side again and that is what the meaning of the helmet removal scene was about. In fact that's is what I would have done in that scene too if I were Luke's father...Isn't that what you would have done if you wanted to see your son with your own eyes before you died and not in a mechanized helmet?On another note I think a subconscious or conscious expectation among most people is that the sequel MUST be worse even if it is better that preceding movies is another reason that ROTJ does not get as many accolades as it deserves. I never go into a film with that deception in mind I always try to go into a film with the attitude that Well it might be better or worse that the original .. But I can not know for sure.. Let's see. That way I go with an open mind and do not dupe myself into thinking that a clearly superior film is not as good as it really was.I am not sure who criticizes these movies but I have asked many college students and adults about which is their favorite Star Wars movie and they all tell me except for one person that said that A New Hope was their favorite that it is ROTJ. I believe that the results on these polls are appalling and quite misleading.Bottom line the Return of the Jedi was the best of the Trilogy. This movie was the only one of the three that kept me riveted all throughout its 135 minutes. There was not a moment of boredom because each scene was either suspenseful exciting surprising or all of the above. For example the emotional light saber battle between Luke and his father in ROTJ was better than the one in the Empire Strikes Back any day!!!Finally I hope people go see the Phantom Menace with an open mind because if fans start looking for nitpicky insignificant details or see it as just another sequel to trash the movie such as This movie stinks because Luke is not in it! then this meritorious film will become another spectacular movie that will be the subject of derision like ROTJ suffered unfortunately.".

	schema:reviewBody "When it comes to creating a universe George Lucas is the undisputed master and his final Star Wars film is very very good and more appropriately rated in comparison to the two previous films in the original saga. Having recently seen Revenge of the Sith really puts this movie in perspective. The final battle seems even more climactic knowing what Anakin Skywalker went through at the manipulative hands of the Emperor. It also makes the final battle between Luke and Vader more bitter considering the love he felt for Padm and the love she felt for her children. Actually while the new films especially Episode II are inferior to the original films they are good for one reason only. They make the old films seem even better.Mark Hamill does an exceptional job in this movie. He really brings the changes Luke has gone through seem real. In all fairness I believe that he should have become a big actor based on these films because he really does a great job. Harrison Ford is still good. However you can feel that he has done Raiders and Blade Runner in between the two final chapters of Star Wars because he seems to have grown quite a bit. He adds more comedy obviously inspired from Raiders to the character which works brilliantly. In short Han Solo is better than ever. Carrie Fisher was never really a good actress but she does a decent job and is certainly passable. Ian McDiarmid appears in this film and having seen Episode III I can safely say that he is one of the most accomplished villains ever. James Earl Jones still provides the voice for Vader and he is still very very good.In terms of how the movie looks its pretty safe to say that the Star Wars universe looks better than in either of the previous two movies but this was always Lucas' fort so that is really to be expected. The final battle over Endor is very well made both in terms of the general effects and tension wise. It was also a nice touch that Lucas decided to have three battles take place at the same time as it added to the overall tension of the climax. The only thing I feel is dragging the movie down from an otherwise deserved 9 are the Ewoks. These little creatures are so annoying they almost ruin every scene they are in. Besides I find it to be a little to kiddy when a group of teddy bears with bows and arrows can defeat a squadron of Storm Troopers with laser guns and mighty machinery.All in all Return of the Jedi is a very good movie but the fact that Richard Marquand is a less accomplished director than Irvin Kershner does that the overall feel of the movie is less than brilliant. Also George Lucas' stupid decision to add the Ewoks to the universe does that the film falls short of brilliance.810".

Besides I find it to be a little to kiddy when a group of teddy bears with bows and arrows can defeat a squadron of Storm Troopers with laser guns and mighty machinery.All in all Return of the Jedi is a very good movie but the fact that Richard Marquand is a less accomplished director than Irvin Kershner does that the overall feel of the movie is less than brilliant. Also George Lucas' stupid decision to add the Ewoks to the universe does that the film falls short of brilliance.810";

	schema:reviewBody "In many ways Return of the Jedi cut firmly against the brilliant grain set by Empire Strikes Back. The reason Empire was so effective was that it showed us the rebels were still losing you can't just destroy the Death Star and have everything go away. But here Lucas rounds out the trilogy with another climactic space battle and everything wraps up really nicely with no questions ask. Return of the Jedi is clearly the least impressive of the original trilogy. It is full of holes tonal inconsistencies and plot implausibilities. I'd chalk this up to Richard Marquand not being half as competent as Irvin Kershner and the departure of Gary Kurtz from the project. Kurtz reportedly left because he and Lucas couldn't agree on whether story or spectacle should take priority Lucas was obviously in favour of spectacle and you can tell because Return of the Jedi's story makes absolutely no sense in places.The opening sequences in Jabba's palace entertained me to no end as a child but now it just confuses me. How long has it been since Empire Strikes Back? Didn't Lando and Chewie go in to try and rescue Han? Chewie and the droids are turned over to Jabba but Leia seems ready to get Han out of there and leave them behind. Was it the plan to get captured? Was Luke's plan to get captured? Since when can Luke do Jedi mind tricks? Did Luke go back and train with Yoda for a year and if so why wasn't is Vader really my father not asked then? The film's screenplay is quite messy and doesn't flow on from the rest of the saga. In one typical scene Yoda admonishes Luke for rushing off to face Vader without proper training then says he doesn't need anymore training and only when he confronts Vader will he be a Jedi. Again maybe some concrete evidence on how long has passed would help. This film is the point where the story meant little to Lucas and the details even less Solo is promoted from Captain to General where all he did was get frozen in carbonite and Calrissian walks off the street into the role of General!. I've always regarded Darth Vader quite lowly on my list of movie villains and watching Star Wars and Empire Strikes Back I found myself wondering why. I now realise its because Return of the Jedi completely nukes him. The idea of there still being good in Vader comes completely out of nowhere  he tortured his son with the knowledge that his father is the most evil man in the galaxy and then chopped his hand off and let him fall to his likely death. The addition of Emperor Palpatine also relegates Darth Vader to a side character  during the conversations between Luke and the Emperor Vader sort of stands diffently to the side and chips in with the occasional yeah. what he said. Palpatine's character development pretty much begins and ends with evil  he seems so sure that Luke will join him yet Luke's battle with the dark side emerges only as a plot point in those scenes. Even if Luke turns to the dark side what will make him join Palpatine? The expanded universe implies more information about this but its not very well established here. The execution is pretty inconsistent  Luke goes from being Alec Guinnessstyle calm to flailing his lightsaber around like he's never held one before. Now that I mention it Mark Hamill seems to be playing two characters simultaneously. I've covered what I didn't like but this is a Star Wars film and there's so much to love. The epic space battle at the second Death Star only reminds me how much I missed it in Empire Strikes Back. Ford is having a lot of fun in this movie and the rest of the cast delivers pretty solidly as well. The gorgeously shot introduction of Red Guards in stark contrast with the white stormtroopers is a beautiful throwback to Vader's blackwhite contrast in the original Star Wars and once again it tells us the bars have been raised. The sound editingmixing is always in good form in Star Wars  my favourite scene being a harsh lightsaber ignition sound just as Luke says Vader won't hurt him or turn him over to Palpatine. The Battle of Endor walks a narrow line between cheesy and genuinely exciting and Marquand keeps the Ewoks just shy of the Gungans.Return of the Jedi is a really fun movie but its not a cinematic artwork like its predecessors. I grew up watching this film but when I read about where the story would have gone were it not for Lucas' toy revenue  the death of Han Solo and a tired Luke walking into the distance like an old Western  I'd be lying if I said the film's sickly sweet dance party ending didn't stick in my craw just a bit.".

He should have been ashamed of himself but this abomination undeniably proves that he doesn't have subatomic particle of shame in his cold greedy heart. Episode I would go on to reinforce this fact  your honor I call Jarjar Binks but please issue barf bags to the members of the jury first.From the initial raising of the gate at Jabba's lair this film was nothing more than a twoplushour commercial for as many licensable profitmaking action figures as Lucas could cram into it  the piglike guards the hokey fleshpigtailed flunky that vile muppetpet of Jabba's the new and recycled cabaret figures the monsters etc. etc. ad vomitum. Then there were the detestably cute and marketable Ewoks. Pile on top of that all of the rebel alliance aliens. Fifteen seconds each onscreen or less and the kiddies just GOTTA have one for their collection. The blatant exploitative financial baiting of children is nauseating.Lucas didn't even bother to come up with a new plot  he just exhumed the Death Star from A New Hope and heaved in a boatload of cheap sentiment.

I can't shake the notion that Lucas took a perverse pleasure in inflicting this dreck on his fans I've got these lemmings hooked so bad that I can crank out the worst piece of stinking putrid garbage that I could dream up and they'll flock to the theaters to scarf it up. Plus all the kiddies will whine and torture their parents until they buy the brats a complete collection of action figures of every single incidental undeveloped cartoonish caricature that I stuffed in and I get a cut from every single one. It'll make me even more obscenely rich.There may have been a paltry partial handful of redeeming moments in this miserable ripoff. I seem to recall that Harrison Ford managed to just barely keep his nose above the surface of this cesspool.

	schema:reviewBody "The Return of the Jedi was George Lucas's last Star Wars film for 16 years until he followed it up with the disappointing prequel The Phantom Menace in 1999. At the time that I am writing this review Episode II has come out and proved that George Lucas is still able to produce an action packed space adventure although he also proves that he is relying far too much on computer generated effects and we are eagerly awaiting the release of Episode III in 2005 the film which has more possibilities than any of the Star Wars films since the original in 1977. The Return of the Jedi is the film in which we are introduced to the hideous Jabba the Hutt for the first time as well as a score of other repugnant creatures. When I first watched this film the first thing that struck me was an enormous increase in the level of gruesomeness that is seen in the creatures in the film. In the first film even the antagonist creatures were at least mildly pleasant but now we see Jabba we see Jabba's disgusting sidekick with the snake things growing out of his head and around his neck that toothriddled pit in the ground as well as scores of other sickening things. We also get to the first glimpses of the badly damaged Death Star whose postexplosive appearance is probably even more famous as an image in film history than its original appearance.  The Death Star is the focus of much of the conflict in the film. The Rebellion is making an elaborate attempt to destroy the Death Star a nearly impossible excursion that involves timing an attack perfectly so that starfighters can make an internal attack on the Death Star at just the right moment that their rebel partners are on a nearby planet shutting down the defense mechanism that the Death Star is deriving from it. Clearly this is not going to be an easy thing to do and the majority of the film presents the efforts to get all of the forces coordinated to pull this task off with the ultimate climax occurring as the rebel attack coincides with the revelation that the Death Star is fully functional as a weapon despite massive damage a little secret they have tactfully decided not to reveal and that they are already aware of the impending attack and more than capable of squishing all of the attackers like a lot of spacebugs. Great story I think. And it's a good thing too because there were at least a few other things that I was less than impressed with about this particular installment in the Star Wars saga. The Ewoks for example just didn't strike me as something that belonged in a Star Wars film. I am more than willing to accept them if for no other reason than the fact that they are now one of the more recognizable things from the old Star Wars films although it seems like there are thousands of recognizable things from the old Star Wars films but there were several battle scenes that failed to generate much excitement due to all of the cuddly little snuggle bears running around. Besides that the Ewok costumes were some of the least impressive outfits in any Star Wars film to this day. You could almost see the seams along the sides the faces were about as realistic as any stuffed animal and the pads of the feet which occasionally were in view were just as toylike. They were little more than cheap Halloween costumes.On the other hand the rest of the film is so entertaining that I am willing to forgive things like this. It's 1983 for crying out loud so I'm not about to downgrade the movie for something like that even though both of its predecessors had universally better costumes despite being older films. It's clear throughout the film that we are watching the conclusion of the conflict between the Imperial Forces and the Rebellion that we saw develop in the last two films which is why it does not quite reach the same level of stupendous excitement and entertainment of them. There are a lot of fascinating characters and creatures introduced here and some of the battles scenes in space far surpass anything in Star Wars or The Empire Strikes Back but despite the fascinating story there is just too much an element of conclusion and tying up loose ends for this movie to be as fresh and exhilarating. There is great concern in the last act of the movie with the metaphorical presentation of the dark side and the well the light side I guess. Maybe the bright side? Yeah the bright side that sounds better. The dark side and the bright side. Luke is being held captive by Darth Vader and the Emperor and being forced to watch his friends careen helplessly into a battle unaware that they have no chance of winning. As this happens we are just itching to see Luke go for that light saber and strike someone down with it and do something heroic but then the Emperor starts trying to convince him to do this. He encourages Luke to give in to his anger and officially become part of the dark side. It's easy to see how Vader was seduced by the dark side if all it takes is the killing of someone that you bitterly hate because they are forcing you to watch the deaths of your friends. Throughout the entire Star Wars saga one of the things that I always wondered about was how exactly Vader was seduced by the dark side and in this scene I found myself seduced by it because I so badly wanted to see Luke do exactly what the Emperor was asking him to do. Clearly the story of The Return of the Jedi leaves very little to be desired with the exciting battles that come from the struggle between the Rebels and the Empire and with Luke's struggles against the dark side as well as his interaction with Vader as Vader lay dying in his arms another heavily metaphorical representation of the dark and bright sides. And despite a few elements of the film that prevent it from really rising to the level of quality and pure entertainment that it could have risen to this is a powerful installment in the Star Wars saga. Given the relatively cheesy end that we saw in this film with all of our heroes partying and hugging at an Ewok party in the woods and with Luke giving the stereotypical grin to the ghostly images of Obi Wan and Yoda and the image of his father before he became Darth Vader ? I am curious about the future of the Star Wars saga. I've heard rumors about the production of Episodes VII VIII and IX which seem a little farfetched at this point but it also seems almost as farfetched that old George would end one of the greatest film sagas of all time with the closing scene of The Return of the Jedi.".

	onyx:emotionText "The Return of the Jedi was George Lucas's last Star Wars film for 16 years until he followed it up with the disappointing prequel The Phantom Menace in 1999. At the time that I am writing this review Episode II has come out and proved that George Lucas is still able to produce an action packed space adventure although he also proves that he is relying far too much on computer generated effects and we are eagerly awaiting the release of Episode III in 2005 the film which has more possibilities than any of the Star Wars films since the original in 1977. The Return of the Jedi is the film in which we are introduced to the hideous Jabba the Hutt for the first time as well as a score of other repugnant creatures. When I first watched this film the first thing that struck me was an enormous increase in the level of gruesomeness that is seen in the creatures in the film. In the first film even the antagonist creatures were at least mildly pleasant but now we see Jabba we see Jabba's disgusting sidekick with the snake things growing out of his head and around his neck that toothriddled pit in the ground as well as scores of other sickening things. We also get to the first glimpses of the badly damaged Death Star whose postexplosive appearance is probably even more famous as an image in film history than its original appearance.  The Death Star is the focus of much of the conflict in the film. The Rebellion is making an elaborate attempt to destroy the Death Star a nearly impossible excursion that involves timing an attack perfectly so that starfighters can make an internal attack on the Death Star at just the right moment that their rebel partners are on a nearby planet shutting down the defense mechanism that the Death Star is deriving from it.
