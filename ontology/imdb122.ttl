Series of sex scenes don't fit well together opening with a boring night club striptease. Film proper begins with hubby Ben picking up a hitchhiker then humping her on a blanket. Crude sound recording is no fun as narrator tells us about the psychological ramifications of what we're watching.Back home Friedland acts the shrew but her sensuous blow job is effective especially since the actress is more frequently associated with softcore assignments. Hubby works in a Bank of America office bldg. where he shows his pal Jim photos he's taken of wifey. There's a lame kinky scene where Friedland insists on being dominant with hubby her slave yet she has him whip her with a belt all adding up to nothing.Picture climaxes with a 6person orgy at Jim's house staged like umpteen swapping scenes that were standard in porn of the early '70s. Alice plays hard to get at first but the clumsiness of the improvised dialog make this extremely tedious. Two buxom actresses are added to the mix a bleached blonde and a busty brunette latter a familiar porn face  perhaps Mycle Brandy.

	schema:reviewBody "Ed Wood Jr. is well known as the protoindie filmmaker who made films by hook or by crook but aspired to Hollywood success. Yet when he got his first shot at a feature he made a bizarrely personal statement on alternate sexual lifestyles such as crossdressing and sexchange the semiexperimental Glen or Glenda 1953. He arguably blew his shot at a Hollywood career by this effort.It is also known that Wood fell into the world of pulp novel writing in the early 1960's which led to writing for skin magazines and finally working in the production of skin movies I am simplifying things quite a bit here. His new film vocation followed the trajectory of increasing permissiveness in the second half of that decade from topless features like Orgy of the Dead 1965 to frontal nudity and simulated sex movies then finally to films with real sexual contact. Wood's Necromania 1971 exists in a soft or simulated sex version and also a hard version with a couple of minutes of inserts or editedin shots of actual sexual intercourse which were shot separately from the main feature. Yet even in this blatantly sexual film Wood had not fully entered the genre of hardcore and it was not believed he had participated as director to that degree.The discovery of the lost Ed Woodscripted and directed film The Young Marrieds the movie is actually dated 1972 in the credits reveals that Wood indeed finally entered into hardcore feature filmmakingthe antithesis of his desired Hollywood careerbut that the issues of his first mainstream feature were still very much his personal concern. Like Glen or Glenda The Young Marrieds is preoccupied with alternative sexualities and how society views those. They both also function as a plea for tolerance by that society. The similarity can be readily proved by comparing the VO stripper bar conversation early in The Young Marrieds with the trailer for Glen or Glenda. The viewer will be amazed by how Wood utilized virtually the same conversation in the same way in two films made almost 20 years apart. Further the male protagonist in The Young Marrieds is put through an eyes wide shut type of sexual journey in which his confidently assumed macho heterosexuality is progressively challenged and undermined to the final shocking confrontation which contradicts porngenre expectations just as surely as Glen or Glenda contradicted Hollywood ones note that I am referring here to the fulllength version of The Young Marrieds which appears on the After Hours' DVD release Ed Wood's Dirty Movies and not the Alpha Blue Archive version which is 8 minutes shorter. It is my belief that Ed Wood was a bona fide film rebel and auteur who put his personal stamp strongly into his final film even though it was a low budget sex movie.Lastly even though I state that The Young Marrieds is a hardcore film it actually isn't quite 'alltheway' partly because the hardcore or Xrated genre wasn't fully established stylistically or even legally i.e. obscenitywise at that date and possibly because Wood was reluctant or unable to coax the proper performances for hardcore. The Young Marrieds lacks the requisite money shot in every sex scene and the lesbian scenes are still simulated it is known that Wood had a fascinationfear of lesbianism. But as has been established by Ed Wood Jr. biographer Rudolph Grey Wood went on to make fully hardcore sex in the short subjects for 8mm loop release that he wrote and directed for Swedish Erotica and other lines in 1972 and later.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Young Marrieds 1972 out of 4 Ben Louis Wolf spends most of his time at the strip club or picking up hookers for sex because his wife Ginny Alice Friedland just isn't exciting to him anymore. While she's a hot woman she's quite boring in the sack but Ben brings a camera into the bedroom one day which turns her on and soon the couple are experimenting with new items to get them in the mood.THE YOUNG MARRIES was released in 1972 and was the final film directed by the cult favorite Edward D. Wood Jr.. Sadly it went missing soon after it was first shown and was lost for decades until a print turned up in a yard sale. This film is certainly a lot different than Wood's previous ventures into the genre. Both NECROMANIA and NYMPHO CYLCER just dabbled in the hardcore stuff but this here pretty much goes full into the genre. I think fans of Wood might be a little surprised to see how graphic this one is because it's certainly a full hardcore picture.Being as its full hardcore I must admit that I do question how much of it Wood directed or if perhaps someone else was calling more shots. I say this because there's really nothing here that looks like a Wood film. The money shots something missing from the other two films are on full display here and there's a lot more movement with the camera making sure to pick up all the sexual views. Perhaps Wood just learned more about the genre since his last two pictures but either way this thing might have just been the director doing something new.Either way for the most part it's a slightly entertaining hardcore picture. The performances are actually a little bit better than you'd expect and there's no question that Friedland is fun and attractive in her role. The cinematography is also better than you'd expect. The film actually started off reminding me of the director's GLEN OR GLENDA? because we get a narrator being way too dramatic as he explains various things we're seeing. Just wait until you hear what the narrator says during the first segment between the husband and the hooker.THE YOUNG MARRIEDS was thankfully found for fans of the director to enjoy. It's certainly unlike anything else that he did throughout his career and it's more professional look makes one wonder why he didn't do more films in the genre after this one.".

	schema:reviewBody "From the point of view of someone who has only come across the game fleetingly in the past and not really cared whether the film turned out bad or good either way other than for my own entertainment value I suppose It has to be said that I found this film woefully wanting.I can only assume that tekken fans liked this simply because of the 1520 fight scene at the end and from what I've learned it sticks close to the story of the game.To be honest it was awful i thought this was going to be an action film but it turned into a bore snoozefest pretty quickly. OK a number of problems 1. What exactly do they think an untrained teenage girl can do for them? Oh yes and lets throw a knife at her head at point blank range for the fun of it. She should be dead film over. 2. She's asked to find out what she can? I swear this is the worst reason for getting someone to do anything. What does this mean find out that he is gay or straight? find out where he lives? find out what he eats for dinner? Find out what they presumably already know that he is an 'immortal person'? Moving on. 3. Look everyone An immortal kid is jumping off a building. Now everyone already knows what he is so eh i feel embarrassed pointing this out because it's so stupid but Jin jin's father and grandfather he's over there get him film over. 4.Between 3045 mins of teenage girls whining enough said moving on. 5. Why was there some guy in the shower with shin????? Quickly moving on 6. How does shin know that the two girls are agents? 7. Robot grows feelings... Enough said moving on 8. Weirdo teacher just happens to find them in the woods creeper or what? 9. Shin is immortal but dies in two seconds film over oh wait. 10. they killed off the main character this film was revolving around and then dumped him like a rag doll just what??? 11. Cheesy 15 minute fight scene for tekken lovers the only redeeming factor I would think for many. 12. Cheesy fight scene has typical good guy gets ass whupped for a few minutes before remembering that he can fight and starts ass whupping the bad guys. 13. Let me just fly around aimlessly here for a while dodging the giants arms swinging just to give the studio more time for this completely pointless fight scene before I remember I have this giant laser that's all bad ass and cool and will rip my enemies to pieces. 14. So why was heihachi in hiding.... 15. Why was shin so sure he could lure heihachi out of hiding? 16. Why didn't someone just kidnap him one day as he went to school. Would have saved us this complete dross. 17. Typical Japanese moral at the end about humans fighting blah blah. 18. 'I know you'll come for me some day I'll be waiting' This line was just as bad as batman's 'I know there's good in you' Completely pointless and you're left wondering what the character is seeing that the audience can't.Anyway absolutely awful couldn't believe how bad this was.".

So why was heihachi in hiding.... 15. Why was shin so sure he could lure heihachi out of hiding? 16. Why didn't someone just kidnap him one day as he went to school. Would have saved us this complete dross. 17. Typical Japanese moral at the end about humans fighting blah blah. 18. 'I know you'll come for me some day I'll be waiting' This line was just as bad as batman's 'I know there's good in you' Completely pointless and you're left wondering what the character is seeing that the audience can't.Anyway absolutely awful couldn't believe how bad this was.";

Lee was only there in a humorous role although I wouldn't really have expected him in such a role. I've liked Lee in the games mainly Tekken 5 so that's okay. I decided to watch the English version so I would understand better. Big mistake. The voice acting is ridiculous. I'm going to watch bits or so of the Japanese version so I can get over how bad the English dubbing is. I wouldn't mind Namco trying again but seeing all the main characters of the game would be interesting. 3 stars for Kazuya Jin Heihachi Xiouyu Lee Nina and Panda. Excuse the spelling.".

It is every tekken fan's dream for there to be a true masterpiece of a movie. Unfortunately it did not happen. this movie turned out to be yet another mediocre attempt. Better than the live action for sure but still fall way short of what was expected of it.First problem is the general directing and acting too much pretentious I am cool crap mostly from Anna Nina Jin and Shin yuck! if tekken was aimed at 15 years olds then I would understand but most long time tekken fans are now in their mid twenties to mid thirties. these high school wannabe facial and body expressions simply come off superfacial and repulsive.Second problem is voice acting. I watched the English version after the 3rd line of the whole movie where Nina and Anna exchange greetings I was like oh boy... The voice acting is closer to a cheap DVD localised release of anime series than a mainstream feature animated film. it was as if voice actors had no proper direction or had not understood their characters several characters come off as cheese and pretentious. since it's just like their acting maybe it was intended after all.third and the biggest disappointment of this movie is the way the final battle had taken powers so out of proportion almost as if we have moved from Tekken universe into Dragon Ball Z universe. this sort of elevation is not a problem if the movie did not have tekken in its roots. the whole point of tekken is balanced fighting power between its characters that makes a fight possible. Turning it into a plasma canon feast completely destroys the fundamental dynamic between the characters. and in the end one super Saiyan characters seemingly seriously but obviously jokingly tells a teenage girl some day you will defeat me .Having said all this Blood Vengeance is not without merits. I really enjoyed its animination in general Ling has a difference face in every tekken game she appeared but she looked the best in this one yet still maintains a very oriental look. some perverted shots from below hers and Allisa's short skirt were amusing. Music and sound effects are top quality. Lee's comical presences was great it was a pity that they did not handle Anna and Nina in a similar lessserious morefun approach.All in all Tekken fans will see it regardless what people say non fans will find plot somewhat puzzling and over movie lacklustre but semi decent entertainment nevertheless.".

Well this movie manages to sucker punch you there too because there is HARDLY any fighting whatsoever. It's no exaggeration that more time is spent between the two girls yacking their heads off than fighting. The only good fight is the one at the end between three certain characters partially because the two stupid girls aren't involved and also because it's actually exciting. But is that worth sitting through all the bullcrap this movie has? HELL no.

After one lackluster animated film and one downright disappointing liveaction one a film adaptation of the celebrated fighting game hits it out of the park. Rather than trying to forcefeed the viewer as many of the 44todate major characters as they can while explaining the history of the King of Iron Fist Tournaments to people who may or may not have playedloved the games this movie takes a different track. Focusing on a very limited cast of charactersyet a cast drawn from all the way across the history of the gamesthis piece tells a story which falls squarely within the universe of the games as opposed to one merely based on them. Occurring between the events of Tekken 5Tekken 5 Dark Resurrection and Tekken 6 this follows popular character Ling Xiaoyu as she is recruited by a powerful corporation to do some undercover investigation of a handsome high school student. Along the way she encounters and befriends the quirky Alisa Bosconovich unaware that she is on a similar missionnot to mention unaware of some other secrets Alisa is keeping. As the two work their way closer to the truth dirty secrets both little and big about their employers are uncovered and plots within plots lead inevitably to a generational confrontation which could potentially alter what it means to be human.This movie has a fair amount of depth and character development. Thanks to the small cast tightly focused story and an understanding of what makes a good game as opposed to a good movie the audience is treated to something speciallearning who these people we fight with ingame truly are and how they got that way. Characters were clearly selected because relationships which already existed between them could heighten the drama or because they were foils for each other allowing new relationships to form while informing the audience of important plot points. Don't get me wrong There's plenty of action and plenty of fights. Characters even use those wonderful combos players are so familiar with. The NinaAnna encounters provide a deeper understanding of their relationship than we can get ingameyes even while they're fighting!and avoids being reduced to clich. And near the end is the battle royale that gamers all wished we could have seen at the end of Tekken 4 but the consoles lacked the power to make happen. It's glorious.There are moments when it gets a bit campy of course but overall the nice mix of characters the nice mix of action and development and the crisp truetothegame visuals make this movie the unicorn of gaming A gamebased movie that's actually good!".

	schema:reviewBody "We all know how awful live action movies are when they're based on video games but we rarely get to see a CGI movie based on one. Tekken Blood Vengeance is a work of art from start to end.Most fans are disappointed that the story is centered on Xiaoyu and her friendship with Alisa and how there aren't enough fight scenes and how Shin had no point of being in the movie. Honestly though Shin was useless and the climax involving him was weak. But I disagree with everything else. A movie centered around the Mishimas and Kazamas would be just another Devil Within or Bloodline Rebellion or Tekken live action movie to which most of everyone were disappointed in. Focusing on a different person's perspective was actually quite smart and refreshing. It's nice to know how other people are effected around them. Plus it readds a bit of emphasis on the character who felt forgotten due to the increasing character roster. And I also believe there were fairly enough fight scenes. Those who're complaining would only complain about there being TOO MUCH fights had there been more. The only other weak points I can think of is the most of the dialogue but let's face it Japanese were always cheesy in this case and the final battle scene. I'm not talking about the threeway fight building up to the Devil Jin vs Devil Kazuya. No. THAT WAS EPIC! I'm talking about Heihachi in Mokujin Monster Fashion whatever... that was unnecessary. Withal every piece of work has its flaws but once you get over yourself and enjoy what there is and think about how much effort was put into it it's actually a wellmade masterpiece.".

Tekken Blood Vengeance is a work of art from start to end.Most fans are disappointed that the story is centered on Xiaoyu and her friendship with Alisa and how there aren't enough fight scenes and how Shin had no point of being in the movie. Honestly though Shin was useless and the climax involving him was weak. But I disagree with everything else. A movie centered around the Mishimas and Kazamas would be just another Devil Within or Bloodline Rebellion or Tekken live action movie to which most of everyone were disappointed in. Focusing on a different person's perspective was actually quite smart and refreshing. It's nice to know how other people are effected around them. Plus it readds a bit of emphasis on the character who felt forgotten due to the increasing character roster. And I also believe there were fairly enough fight scenes. Those who're complaining would only complain about there being TOO MUCH fights had there been more. The only other weak points I can think of is the most of the dialogue but let's face it Japanese were always cheesy in this case and the final battle scene. I'm not talking about the threeway fight building up to the Devil Jin vs Devil Kazuya. No. THAT WAS EPIC! I'm talking about Heihachi in Mokujin Monster Fashion whatever... that was unnecessary. Withal every piece of work has its flaws but once you get over yourself and enjoy what there is and think about how much effort was put into it it's actually a wellmade masterpiece.";

I honestly did enjoy the plot and I found Ling Xiaoyu  Alisa Bosconovitch very likable character in this movie. I know this movie is receiving hate but overall the movie did deliver for me and had some strong character developments. My favorite Tekken game is Tekken 4 btw.  If anything the movie would had been fine if they just found better voice actors to fit the character's role. Even though that was a bother to me I can't say that it's going to effect my score due to them not being present most of the film.".

The problem is with the way there bodies react.I am accustomed to watching people body muscle move in a certain fashion when they're moving and when we have 4 main female characters it's really hard to avoid noticing that part. Hence throughout the movie it kept bugging me.If only they moved it around a bit the whole movement would seem natural. The CGI was a bit repetitive when it comes to the scenes but I guess you can't really complain about that considering what the movie is based on.Apart from all those minor issues that I noticed and personally felt the movie is indeed fun to watch although I have to skip the dialogues because the dub was just messing up everything. I guess this movie should be watched in it's original language with subtitles enabled.Again don't get me wrong. I liked the movie I am just a bit put off by certain things that I couldn't stop noticing. Didn't see other Tekken movies and honestly reading the reviews I am glad a didn't.The movie does contain some good action perhaps a bit more of it would be awesome. Good job NAMCO.".

But the beautiful visuals and cool fight scenes make the movie more watchable. You can marvel at the detailed animation and fight scenes are almost flawless like in a liveaction movie. The few fight scenes for an CGI movie are topnotch. Although action fans will have to patiently wait for the actionpacked third act which features one of the best fight scene in animated and CGI movies. The story in fact is not too bad. It has a bit of the spy stuff. Music wise is good. Best to be viewed with the Japanese voiceover. The English one sounds weird.Overall It is supposedly a Tekken movie for the fans who are enraged by the liveaction movie. I guess the fans will enjoy this better than the liveaction movie. The hybrid Bluray is interesting. It plays the 2D and 3D version on Bluray and 3D Bluray players plus the game on Playstation 3.".

You can see that this movie is a wink to the fans however it is a bit clumsy and predictable at some times. The dialog can get pretty corny too but it doesn't ruin the whole experience. The visuals are neat and the combat is great. There are parts in the story that i would like to call plot holes but we have to keep in mind this is a game to movie conversion and a lot lies behind the background of the characters. And that changes a lot. I halted for a moment and realised that they did pretty good considering this is a game. If you have enjoyed any tekken games in your life i would advise you to see this. Even if you haven't played any of them this is a great way to get in the mood for Tekken.Oh and gotta love the panda !!!".

I don't understand how the previous reviewer can say this film seems dated and funny for all the wrong reasons. It is as fresh and interesting as it was back at the time of its release.

	schema:reviewBody "When I worked in a psychiatric hospital I noticed that one or two of the patients had a peculiar tendency to stand up start walking purposefully across the ward stop and look around then begin walking just as purposefully in another direction then sit down again. A kind of ambulatory non sequitur.This whole movie is like that. I mean that to be a compliment. People break up the interactive script they've initiated and do something completely unpredictable. I'll just give one example. Walker Marvin and his companion Angie Dickenson have an argument and she begins whacking him across the head with her purse. At first he guards himself with his arms but then lowers them and stands silently and without any expression as she beats him slaps him and pounds his chest finally slumping to the floor exhausted. At that he strides wordlessly to the couch plops down turns on the TV and begins surfing the channels.It's a neonoir film if there ever was one. There is betrayal a false woman suicide multiple double crosses revenge an urban setting and an ambiguous ending.So although it is a genre film it is nevertheless unique. Everything comes together. The production designer gives us sterile urban vistas featuring bland cement boxes and the Los Angeles River without which no noir would be complete. The apartments these people live in look like ordinary arid gray middleclass bourgeois digs. Wardrobe too has fitted these performers out in ordinary suits and ties and the women are always rather chic looking.The direction and editing are splendid. I'll give an example of what I mean here too. Lee Marvin throws John Vernon out on the roof of his penthouse wrapped only in a bed sheet. Vernon begins to tumble over the edge Marvin grabs for him but winds up holding only the sheet while Vernon plunges some dozen floors to the street below. His body winds up impossibly intact. A cat might have survived such a fall but a fullgrown man would have splashed. In an ordinary movie we'd get a cut from the body hitting the street to Marvin staring down at it over the railing. But here Marvin is still holding the sheet. Not only that but it's WINDY on the fourteenth floor roof and the wind is whipping the sheet up into billows around Marvin like some demonic object with its own malevolent life force before he is finally able to unwrap himself and fling it away.The editing gives us a couple of brief flashbacks but not just to evoke a mood. They are instrumental in letting us know what Marvin is thinking. Marvin is holding a gun to his expal's Vernon's face and the poor guy faints until Marvin slaps him awake and then he begs Marvin to trust him. A flashback lasting only a few seconds reminds us of an earlier scene in which Vernon begged Marvin's help in carrying out a heist and shouted at him Walker! Trust me! The editing is so precise that in this  and in a dozen other scenes  a few seconds more or less would drain them of their impact.The score is by Johnny Mandel an arranger and composer whose work I've admired for years. He was a child prodigy played both trumpet and trombone with Tommy Dorsey's band before turning to composing and arranging. He's never edgy or irritating. His music is smooth and melodic and sometimes strangely orchestrated. Here he suits his talents to the demands of the scene. When a man is trying to seduce a woman a romantic piano melody tinkles behind them. At other times again depending on the context the score glides from Henry Mancini to Gil Evans. Nicely done.So is the acting. Marvin has been this good in other films but never better. The plot has to do with his regaining 93000 that the organization has cheated him out of. There is no mafianess to the movie. The only foreign language we hear is Portugese. And 93K was a lot of money then. You could find gas at 29 cents a gallon. Marvin more or less kills his way up the ladder searching for someone in a position to pay me my money. He finally gets to Carrol O'Connor who explains to him that in a huge corporation like this nobody ever handles any money. O'Connor has got maybe eleven dollars in his wallet. And Marvin holding a gun on him hesitates and looks genuinely put out  puzzled the way a child might be puzzled by a disappointing reply. No there's no Santa Claus. I think I'll leave it at that before I run out of space. I've pretty much skipped the plot but that must be adequately covered elsewhere. Besides the plot is either extremely simple or very complicated indeed depending on how far you want your conjectures to dig. Is the whole movie nothing more than the fantasy of Marvin as he lies dying on Alcatraz after being shot at the beginning of the story? See what I mean? Don't miss it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Love it great film.For one thing POINT BLANK directed by British director John Boorman has all the good looks of the various movements of the European New Wave but walks the walk and talks the talk of an American thriller and I mean that as a good thing. Boorman's brilliantly composed combination of European artfulness with filmnoir elements make for an exceptionally rich and multilayered crime thriller. Lee Marvin in typically emotionless fashion is the remorseless Walker who after pulling off a successful heist from the mob is doublecrossed shot and left for dead in the now abandoned Alcatraz prison by his wife Sharon Acker and his partnerincrime John Vernon. Walker survives escapes and moves to LA where he kills his way up the ladder of a vaguely defined organized crime syndicate called The Organization hardly distinguishable from a legitimate cooperate business in order to get his 93000 occasionally aided by his sister Chris a great Angie Dickinson who seems to know Walker's targets pretty well.Philip Wisethrop's widescreen compositions are absolutely stunning. One of the most impressive scenes is when Walker is fighting two hoods in a nightclub against a swirling psychedelic backdrop to the strains of the RB houseband with its black singer hysterically shouting letting the mostly white clientle shout with him in his microphone. But every scene is a marvel to watch with every detail painstakingly composed without getting stiff or forced in any way. Even the car windows are almost unrealistically spotless in order to film Walker through the glass with the reflections of the city on his face. The film is packed with all kinds of surreal surroundings and lots of flashbacks concerning Walker's past. Boorman's games with narrative time with extensive use of echoing flashbacks and jumpcuts are the perfect reflection of Walker's dreamlike struggle for justice He's the typical tragic noirhero in a perpetual struggle to grasp what happened to him. He desperately tries to comprehend the situation he's in but hasn't got a clue who's who and his outdated moral codes make him seem an even bigger anomaly in the modern corporate world he works his way into. Whether this is all actually happening or it's all a mindspin inside Walker's head is impossible to say. Best to enjoy the ride in this true genre classic definitely one of the best American thrillers of the '60s. If you get the chance watch it together with Melville's LE SAMOURAI 1967 and Seijun Suzuki's BRANDED TO KILL 1967 in many ways its French and Japanese counterparts.Camera Obscura  910".

	schema:reviewBody "I first saw this movie when I was in college in the Seventies. I viewed the film again in 2001. The power of the film was the same on my senses. Several reasons come up British Director John Boorman was at his best trying to outdo Don Siegel's The Killers 1967which also stars Marvin and Dickinson in somewhat similar roles. I will really be surprised if Boorman denies that he was not influenced by the Siegel movie.Why did Point Blank make an impact on me? Was it Lee Marvin's raw machismo? No. It was Boorman who gave cinema a brilliant essay on alienation. When Dickinson's Chris asks Marvin's Walker 'What's my last name?' after a bout of sex and gets a repartee 'What's my first name?' you can argue the alienation is embedded in the dialog. But Boorman's cinema includes the loud footsteps of a determined Walker on the soundtrack somewhat like Godard in Alpahaville contrasting bright wide open spaces for the exchange of money that goes according to plan and closed dimly lit confines of Alcatraz for those that go wrong. There is laconic humor without laughter pumping bullets into an empty bed guards who narrowly miss Marvin going up the lift the car salesman's interest in an attractive customer than in his job the sharpshooter's smug satisfaction not realizing that he has got the wrong manThe list is endless. The camerawork of Philip Lathrop is inventive but was it Lathrop or Boorman that made the visual appeal of the Panavision format of this film come alive? Viewing the film in 2001 several points emerge. 93000 was important to Walker nothing more nothing less. But was it money he was after or was it the value of an agreement among thieves? The open ended finale runs parallel to the end of an Arthur Penn film also on alienationcalled Night Moves made some 10 years later. What surprises me is how a good movie like Point Blank never won an award or even an Oscar nomination.".

A simple story told in a very stylish and at times surreal manner. Though the storyline is a variation on revenge themes it is Boorman's images that open it up and find paydirt.  Images of Lee Marvin emptying his pistol in slow motion the sound of footsteps over a string of pictures that curdle the mind and the seemingly limitless use of rawness perfectly realized in the action and performance by Marvin andinterestingly Angie Dickinson. There is a wonderful conflict between the primal Marvin and the Corporate Crime world which he cannot understand. Marvin knows survival of the fittest not the richest. It's hypnotic and aggressive. Boorman balances perfectly on the line between the two.".

Rumor has it that Keanu Reeves studied his method religiously.Marvin plays a dead guy  no a dying guy  no a guy who almost died  even the director said he didn't know and didn't care. Anyway Marvin gets doublecrossed by his buddy so Marvin spends his time either bumbling his way into unintentional deaths or watching other people murder people. One highlight is when the hitman is ordered to kill Marvin and instead kills the very guy who ordered the hit. The hitman can pick off a moving target at great distance but apparently he had trouble seeing Marvin pushing his boss out into the open and he had trouble seeing that his boss was not Marvin. Until later. Then he reported to the next higher boss that he killed his boss because he was there instead of Marvin. Good reasoning.And Angie is great at  well at being a model who gets a few lines. Her character learns that her sister just died due to Marvin scaring the holy heck out of her. So she leaves her sister to rot on the floor and goes off with Marvin. She gets to wear a few garish outfits and towards the end for no apparent reason she goes berserk on Marvin and then sleeps with him.The bad guys are a trip. We don't have cash. We use checks. We can't get you your money. Only the accountant writes checks. That's what they keep telling Marvin and apparently it's not their concern whether Marvin kills them. They just know that they don't have cash.They threw out the script. They only liked the main character. I don't think they wrote a replacement script. I imagine each day on the set they told Marvin to stand over there and don't say anything because that's mostly what he did.Marvin can't carry a movie. He can be great as a supporting character with his onedimensional nonacting but that's all. Dickinson certainly can't carry a movie. She is eye candy and nothing more. This is supposed to be an action movie and she is the second lead playing against a guy who doesn't act emote or move any facial muscles. That's much too much for her. She would be better as the second banana's love interest.Marvins stands and stares. Dickinson has boobs. The director had no script. That's about all.Strangely enough because this was done like a rushed high school art project people look for great meaning in its obvious deficiencies. No it's not avantgarde or highly stylized. It's a bad or nonexistent script with exceptionally bad editing. Is he dead? Is he alive? Is he dying? Nobody knows because not to beat a dead horse they didn't have a script.".

	schema:reviewBody "The most famous sequence in this film is Walker Lee Marvin striding down an empty airport corridor intercut with the morning routine of the wife Sharon Acker who betrayed him and let her lover John Vernon shoot him and leave him for dead. The setup promises a bloody payoff in which the two nogoodnicks get theirs . . .And indeed Walker bursts into the woman's apartment silences her roughly and empties his Big Gun into . . . an empty bed. The lover has deserted her he sends a monthly payoff she dreams of suicide and we realize that this supposed femme fatale is just a sad weak woman who knows she did something terrible and has been paying the psychological price ever since.And so begins a pattern Walker works his way up the leadership chain of the crime family and none of the men he encounters and whose deaths he is indirectly responsible for he doesn't actually kill anybody can pay him back the 93000 he wants or give him back what he really wants those few brief months of happiness with his wife before the snake oozed into their wrongsideofthelaw Garden of Eden.The screenplay is adapted from The Hunter which was written by Donald Westlake under the pseudonym Richard Stark. 'Adapted' is the key word because the original book is an icy pulpnovel bloodbath where the main character Parker really isn't interested in anything but the money he's owed and casually kills anybody and everybody who gets in his way. The book is interesting mostly as a stylistic exercise personally it left me with a major case of The Creeps. This is a crime story that is really a mood piece about loneliness and missed connections and bad karma. The acting is incredible not just Marvin as the despondent Walker but Angie Dickinson as his sisterinlaw who has heartbreaks of her own and John Vernon Michael Strong Lloyd Bochner and Carroll O'Connor as the slick empty men he destroys. Sharon Acker is absolutely heartbreaking as his betraying wife even though she's really onscreen for maybe 10 minutes tops and Keenan Wynn takes a role with little substance and fills it with a commanding unsettling presence.A lot of talent behind the camera as well Phillip Lathrop's photography has a mesmerizing chill to it using the Panavision screen to create empty spaces that unnerve the audience setting the film in Los Angeles also helps even with all of the skyscrapers it's still a suburb in search of a city.

	onyx:emotionText "The most famous sequence in this film is Walker Lee Marvin striding down an empty airport corridor intercut with the morning routine of the wife Sharon Acker who betrayed him and let her lover John Vernon shoot him and leave him for dead. The setup promises a bloody payoff in which the two nogoodnicks get theirs . . .And indeed Walker bursts into the woman's apartment silences her roughly and empties his Big Gun into . . . an empty bed. The lover has deserted her he sends a monthly payoff she dreams of suicide and we realize that this supposed femme fatale is just a sad weak woman who knows she did something terrible and has been paying the psychological price ever since.And so begins a pattern Walker works his way up the leadership chain of the crime family and none of the men he encounters and whose deaths he is indirectly responsible for he doesn't actually kill anybody can pay him back the 93000 he wants or give him back what he really wants those few brief months of happiness with his wife before the snake oozed into their wrongsideofthelaw Garden of Eden.The screenplay is adapted from The Hunter which was written by Donald Westlake under the pseudonym Richard Stark. 'Adapted' is the key word because the original book is an icy pulpnovel bloodbath where the main character Parker really isn't interested in anything but the money he's owed and casually kills anybody and everybody who gets in his way. The book is interesting mostly as a stylistic exercise personally it left me with a major case of The Creeps. This is a crime story that is really a mood piece about loneliness and missed connections and bad karma. The acting is incredible not just Marvin as the despondent Walker but Angie Dickinson as his sisterinlaw who has heartbreaks of her own and John Vernon Michael Strong Lloyd Bochner and Carroll O'Connor as the slick empty men he destroys. Sharon Acker is absolutely heartbreaking as his betraying wife even though she's really onscreen for maybe 10 minutes tops and Keenan Wynn takes a role with little substance and fills it with a commanding unsettling presence.A lot of talent behind the camera as well Phillip Lathrop's photography has a mesmerizing chill to it using the Panavision screen to create empty spaces that unnerve the audience setting the film in Los Angeles also helps even with all of the skyscrapers it's still a suburb in search of a city. Johnny Mandel's music is both eerie and mournful and the sets not only use color for psychological purposes but find the formal beauty in even the most vulgar of settings.Behind all of this ultimately of course is director John Boorman who had already made the underrated comedydrama CATCH US IF YOU CAN shown here as HAVING A WILD WEEKEND which could have been just a silly vehicle for The Dave Clark Five but thanks to Boorman's direction Peter Nichols' script and the performances of the cast including Dave Clark remains one of those 60's movies that behaved the way that films of the era were supposed to asking unsettling questions about life and not always providing pat answers.

If Reese and Walker were partners in crime there how on earth could Angie Dickinson's character also have been present? Presumeably the notsomortally wounded Walker is one day released. Who is that guy he's negotiating with on the boat? That guy presumably wants to capture Reese. Does he give Walker the address so as to let Walker do the dirty work? Lee Marvin's Walker is somewhat interestingly played if in a stunningly onenote way. If it's all about revenge why did he barge into Reese's home guns ablazing so that if he'd actually found his prey Reese wouldn't have had a chance to know who'd gotten him? And how would Walker have found out where to get his 93000? The part where Reese goes over the balcony was dramatic but not believable. I found the final scene particularly incomprehensible. I just did not get the stuff about Fairfax at all.So Walker was ready to give up the fight after all he'd been through? I guess we have to assume so. Movies like this are disappointingly full of flash with very little to back them up. To its credit this film has some excellent dialog thanks to the penmanship of Donald C. Westlake.".

	schema:reviewBody "Point Blank 1967The slow steady surreal fractured and utterly beautiful filming of this strangely hauntingly unique crime film makes it special for its period and a gem in any period. It has an irregular narrative structure and is a movie mostly about personal vendettasall precursor to Pulp Fiction. The conspicuous precise and really too neglected use of focus and abstraction in the shooting is pure visual power. And the consistency of the plot throughout in mood in overlapping flashbacks and in the form of a relentless patient criminal or excriminal named Walker played by Lee Marvin makes it a complete massive and blunt whole. The movie is a juggernaut of formal intention if nothing else.Heads up the first five minutes are confusing enough and deliberately hostile to put off even a modern viewer. It's hard to quite know what a moviegoer thought at the time beyond the experienced viewers known as critics. Possibly it was more fitting for the mood of 1967 with many movies pushing all kinds of boundaries and the culture with its huge drug us going on a binge. But it smooths out and bounces around more logically as it goes. The idea is to create a sense of the anger and confusion in Walker's head. When he becomes a victim of his own partner's greed and cruelty and eventually to the less intentional cruelty of his wife he decides to do the most honorable simple thing for a thief get what he is owed. This wanting his share of the money drives the movie underneath but it's the psychological state of Walker and the way he confronts each obstacle with a kind of fearless and lucky precision that matters. The money in the end isn't the point. As a movie Marvin is almost just a vehicle for the photography and editing. Such gorgeous widescreen shooting you'll rarely see. Really even for the 1960s this is a new level of artsy feeling that is just short of an art film. It isn't really the sets or even the lighting that make it work though both are first rate and helpful but in more than almost any film it's the camera and in particular the lens itself that matters the range of focus and defocus the layering of imagery and obstructions. There are some amazing scenes though including a fabulous fabulous nightclub confrontation with images projected on the walls. Subtract the dancing girls and you have ten minutes of some of the best cinema anywhere any time. And listen to the music and in the whole movie to the soundWalker's shoes in the long hallway as the camera cuts to a woman putting on makeup or just overlapping ambient sounds with somewhat conventional movie music soundtrack. It's great. Even when it breaks to eerie silence the soundtrack makes unusual sense the rising elevator comes to mind.British director John Boorman is better known for Deliverance 1972 which has its own legend and a plot to write home about. But Point Blank is a better film for how it looks and might last longer in the history books coming out of the very first year of New Hollywood. It has some sections of slightly tired script or slightly strained stereotyping but these are dwarfed by the rest. Point Blank changes the way caper films like this would be seen and felt much like The French Connection 1971 did in its own way and a bit later Chinatown 1974. See it and be surprised. A neglected gem.".

Lee Marvin is simply awesome as Walker more of a force of nature wearing tailor made suits that go beyond cool rather than a human being.My favourite moment in this film is where Keenan Wynn as Yost gives Walker his wife's and Reese's address and we see him stomping down a long coloured corridor inter cut with his wife waking up in bed and going about her business as Walker's footsteps get louder and louder until he kicks her door in and throttles her to the ground. It is a brilliant moment.I also liked the way he remembers his life with Lynne and how she narrates how they were so happy together before and after he met up with his long lost friend Mal Reese its actually quite moving.There's also this excellent idea that while you watch this film you are only seeing what Walker would have wanted to happen IF he survived...and that he is still lying there in that cell on Alcatraz.Thats my theory.

	schema:reviewBody "It's been nearly 40 years since Point Blank hit the screen and people still debate about what it all means. I remember seeing it with my brother and sisterinlaw when it was released. I liked it even if I didn't completely understand it especially the ending. My brother and sister in law hated it because they were baffled by it. It's a seemingly simple story. Marvin plays a thug left for dead in a cell in Alcatraz by his cheating wife and partner after a robbery involving a large sum of cash. Marvin somehow survives and while wounded somehow swims the San Francisco bay waters that claimed dozens of escapees who had to be in much better shape. Marvin then begins a violent spree of revenge culminating in a nighttime climax at Alcatraz managing in the process to sleep with a then luscious Angie Dickenson. However director John Boorman Deliverance Excalibur and his editor create such a sensuous dreamlike environment it's really impossible at film's end to know exactly what has happened. That's not the kind of movie being made in 1967 and I'm fairly certain it was a financial flop. Had things been otherwise I'm sure Point Blank would have been a BEST PICTURE contender at the Oscars. It's certainly in my mind the year's best picture.WARNING SPOILERSWhile not as densely confusing as The Swimming Pool Point Blank is still ambiguous enough to offer several possible conclusions1. Marvin is in the cell at Alcatraz for the entire movie dreaming of his revenge and dieing at the conclusion.2.

	onyx:emotionText "It's been nearly 40 years since Point Blank hit the screen and people still debate about what it all means. I remember seeing it with my brother and sisterinlaw when it was released. I liked it even if I didn't completely understand it especially the ending. My brother and sister in law hated it because they were baffled by it. It's a seemingly simple story. Marvin plays a thug left for dead in a cell in Alcatraz by his cheating wife and partner after a robbery involving a large sum of cash. Marvin somehow survives and while wounded somehow swims the San Francisco bay waters that claimed dozens of escapees who had to be in much better shape. Marvin then begins a violent spree of revenge culminating in a nighttime climax at Alcatraz managing in the process to sleep with a then luscious Angie Dickenson. However director John Boorman Deliverance Excalibur and his editor create such a sensuous dreamlike environment it's really impossible at film's end to know exactly what has happened. That's not the kind of movie being made in 1967 and I'm fairly certain it was a financial flop. Had things been otherwise I'm sure Point Blank would have been a BEST PICTURE contender at the Oscars. It's certainly in my mind the year's best picture.WARNING SPOILERSWhile not as densely confusing as The Swimming Pool Point Blank is still ambiguous enough to offer several possible conclusions1. Marvin is in the cell at Alcatraz for the entire movie dreaming of his revenge and dieing at the conclusion.2. Marvin died at Alcatraz and is an Avenging Angel a ghost seeking revenge on those who betrayed him.3. Marvin mortally wounded but NOT at Alcatraz is DREAMING he is a cell at Alcatraz and DREAMING of his revenge.4.

The first five minutes tries one's patience as the plot darts here and there with discordant flow and confusing plot points. It doesn't get any better later on. The script is a nightmare of too many flashbacks among other problems.Characters are totally not interesting. Walker is one angry dude as he shoots his way through a series of encounters trying to get revenge and money. Lee Marvin helps not at all. His tough guy image only exaggerates the raging Walker character. There's a glut of reptilian men in black suits they belong to something called the organization the outfit that apparently betrayed Walker. Throw in a few cowering fems and the story's subtext just screams ... it'saman'sworld honey and we're greedy tough men.Further secondary characters are thrown into the mix seemingly in random order again there's a conspicuous absence of organic plot flow. In addition the actual story is pretty thin but padded with lots of filler apparently to extend the runtime.And then there's the excess ... excess violence just for the sake of violence excessive loudness in Walker's footsteps as he marches through a corridor angrily on his way to meet someone after a few seconds these loud footsteps become almost torturous.The entire film reeks of an ugly mix of repugnant characters interacting in unctuous alienating ways. Maybe the film is trying to portray the urban alienation so characteristic of the 1960s. But the overall mood is so grating the characters are so unappealing and the plot structure is so messed up that the entire production comes across as incompetent.".

So does Lee Marvin whose toughguy persona and deep voice lends itself to manly roles.Actually I preferred the remake Payback starring Mel Gibson to this original version. That was far more entertaining and looked super on DVD. This cast in this movie included Archie Bunker er Carroll O'Connor. I like film noir from all eras and still consider it that even though purists think it has to always be a blackandwhite film from the 1940s or 1950s. This is definitely film noir.

Whereas previously sword play and gun fights were played down with very little depiction of injury wound or blood.FOLLOWING MANY YEARS of 'paying his dues' by working on the OffBroadway stage in supporting film roles and on Television Mr. Lee Marvin had made it! His persistence paid off as he made it to Broadway got his own TV Series in M SQUAD Latimer Prod.Revue StudiosMCA TVNBC TV Network 195760 and had ever more prestigious film roles culminating in his Oscar Winning portrayal of twin brothers Kid Shelleen and Tim Strawn in CAT BALLOU Columbia Pictures 1965. Every role following this was both one of true Star Stature and were definitely ones that Mr. Marvin wanted to do not finding it necessary to take work for work's sake.AFTER APPEARING IN such first class projects as SHIP OF FOOLS Stanley Kramer ProductionsColumbia 1965 and THE DIRTY DOZEN MKH7 ArtsMetroGoldwynMayer1967 Lee's Star continued to rise. He was now a big enough star to both carry a somewhat avantgarde film and at the same time guarantee ucce at almighty Box Office.WHAT ABOUT THIS movie would be considered to be avantgarde we hear you asking? After all we have all of that tough as nails action and Bogarting of the bad guys by the protagonist bad guy being that there really are no good guys wearing White Hats in this here shootem up. But lest we digress let us dissect some other aspects first? Do you agree? I knew you would.AS FOR the rest of the cast well what can we say? Who could take issue with the likes of Angie Dickonson Woowoowoowoo! who shows us so much of her breasts nudity and explicit sex scenes having become an important ingredient in this new wave cinema.REVIEWING THE REST of the players we are impressed with just how the cast is just chockfull of the well known and the future household names. We were witness to the talents of Keenan Wynn Lloyd Bochner from HONG KONG TV Series John Vernon a Canadian in his first American Film Carroll O'Connor future ARCHIE BUNKER Michael Strong Sharon Acker James B. Sikking future Lt. Howard Hunter on HILL STREET BLUESas James Sikkingand Michael Strong who would portray Brigadier General Hobart Carver in PATTON.AMONG THOSE THESPIANS who got noon screen credit we find Bill Hickman the Actor whose services were highly sought after as a stunt driver. He undoubtedly was responsible for Walker's Marvin super destructive test drive. Mr. Bill Hickman would also go on to design and perform the great car chases in BULLIT THE FRENCH CONNECTION and THE SEVENUPSamong many others. On screen he was ill fated Federal Narcotics Agent Mulderig who was mistakenly shot to death in THE FRENCH CONNECTION.ALRIGHT ALREADY BUT what is it about POINT BLANK that makes it so different or icebreaking if you will? Surely the film type known as Noir had been around since the World War II Era. We've had plenty of tough guys on the screen playing both sides of the law. For every baddie role that we see Humphrey Bogart James Cagney George Raft or Sterling Hayden in a movie we have a multitude of examples of their being the Good Tough guy. No Schultz! I said Sterling Hayden not Sterling Holloway! THE CRUX OF what we're driving at lies in the very nature of the screenplay and scenario that unfolds before our very eyes.IF YOU WILL please note the heavy use of flashbacks even flashbacks within other flashbacks. It starts out on an abandoned Alcatraz Island formerly the location of the Federal Prison Systems leper colony for special or problem prisoners. The story spins a whole revolution meandering through so many twists turns and double crosses. We see so many gun incidents and romps in the boudoir that we may have missed the main point of the story. I know I did back in the day that I was young innocent and naive.ABOUT SEVEN OR EIGHT years later we heard a most interesting theory from a coworker a fellow Cop on the glorious Blue of the Chicago Police Department. It was Patrolman Tom Earth who gave us this very provocative insight into the film. It was one that he had gotten in a film class I believe.ARE YOU READY for the finale? Please don't read any further unless you've screened POINT BLANK or unless you couldn't care less.OKAY DEAR READERS here it is. We're gonna spill it! The theory is that the whole story took place in Walker's imagination as he lay dying in the chilly foggy night on Alcatraz. There is plenty of evidence to support this theory. Just take the way it keeps jumping around to previous happenings the manner in which one scene of a physically depleted Walker that's Lee Marvin remember is seen about to attempt a swim from the island to the San Francisco mainland suddenly dissolves into a scene on board a ferry in the same bay mysteriously meeting up with Yost Keenan Wynnappearing as if from nowhere to give him info and encouragement. It goes on like this in so many ways.IF THIS IS truly the case with POINT BLANK's being the dramatization of what went on in the mind of a dying man and Schultz and I both concur then that would put it right up there with some fine literature. Most notable examples that we can think of are Ambrose Bierce's AN OCCURRENCE AT OWL CREEK BRIDGE and Thornton Wilder's novel THE BRIDGE AT SAN LUIS REY. That's pretty damn good company for a movie!".

The same scene is also used multiple times for different situations. For example the beast kills some one rips open their stomach and chows down on their intestines. The beast then tries to get the other prisoners but can't due to the bars either side of him. The film then loops back to the beast ripping up the mans stomach again and chowing down on his intestines!!!!!!!! This is not a rare occurrence either it must have happened about 4 times and the films only on 80 minutes! There's so much wrong with this film that I could write a 1000 word essay on it.

	schema:reviewBody "I don't believe I have ever seen a worse film in my life. Everything about this movie is the lowest of the low it is putrid. And that may be its good point! Seriously it is THAT BAD.Shapeshifter is set in some remote prison with guards who have the mentality of a middleschool dropout both in intelligence and training. They walk around the facility with nothing of substance to say or do. There is nothing of quality in this movie there is no story no value no reason to watch. The Shapeshifter appears to be some Russian immigrant prisoner who is able to transform himself into a flesheating monster. He starts by biting on his arm until it bleeds with some terrible music and special effects that will make anyone watching prone to seizures does some metamorphosis dancing which takes about 5 minutes for him to change than becomes this monster The Shapshifter. The Shapreshifter than eats the flesh of the people at the prison. I didn't even get that far into the movie but other reviewers have said that he does the same thing EVERY TIME.I cannot think of one positive thing to say about this movie not one. Terrible camera angles annoying rap music that has no place or reason to be in any of the scenes and rapidly changing movements of the director going from shot to shot add up to garbage. This movie is beyond bad.What is even worse is that some films that are bad at least have some unintentional humor to make them what some industry people call Golden Turkeys The type of movies that are so bad they are good because they are corny. Shapeshifter can't even save itself from even the smallest bit of intentional humor to give it any redeeming qualities at all. How did this trash even get made? Shame on The Chiller Channel for showing this garbage and any other stations that may air it for that matter.This movie should be pulled from distribution and destroyed. If that happened I guarantee you that whoever had to sit through this moronic film would celebrate. Please don't waste your time with this film. It's an insult to all viewers that this crap was even made. I feel sick and angry just from watching it. I have no idea what the cast and crew were smoking when they made this hideous picture.".

	schema:reviewBody "So there's this Romanian guy who can change from a person into a monster. We start off with an MTV rap video Hear that noise? That was 75 of the audience changing the channel of him killing a guy while a prostitute gets splattered with his blood. Not a terribly auspicious way to begin the movie. He's arrested for something and taken to the local jail which was apparently a prison at one point but now the upper two floors are abandoned. The cops don't know about his shapeshifting power. We meet our guards a couple of guys who behave like clowns and a female who's got a bit of a backstory gee wonder who will live 'till the end?. We meet the prisoners a group of stereotypes who do the usual trashtalking for a few minutes. Then of course our shapeshifter does his changaroo thing and the fun begins.I really wasn't too interested in this at the beginning it looked like your typical trying way too hard to be hip type thing but once the monster starts running around it actually improves quite a bit. The guard babe strips down to her seethrough Tshirt with half her bra sticking out and the stereotypical prisoners turn into fairly normal human beings who are all fighting for their survival. They crawl through some crawlspace above the ceiling of the jail and get into the abandoned upper floors which provide a suitably creepy place for them to have their various engagements with the killer critter. There's also a somewhat interesting story that develops about what the monster's motives are. The prisoner characters are used pretty well to add even more interest to the story as they of course aren't the most compassionate bunch towards their fellow prisoners. And the lead babe is quite a good actress she really does a nice job with her buttkicking heroine roll. And did I mention she's running around in a seethrough Tshirt with half her bra sticking out? Well it bears repeating.Overall after the crummy start I thought this evolved into a fairly entertaining monster flick by the midway point. I give the beginning a 210 and the rest a slightly above average 610 which averages out to about 4.".

The cast is pretty good particularly Marat Glazer and AJ Hammond. Jennifer Wiggins runs a bit hot and cold it feels like she got more direction in some scenes and less in others but it's great to see a female action lead who can throw a punch and not look ridiculous. The Beast design was well conceived. The Shapeshifter has this strange ancient quality to him. The horns the four fingered hands the nasty teeth  it's particularly effective when he gets good and bloodied up.The sound mix sounded great on our system. The music is good although it gets a bit monotonous at times and at other times seems oddly absent.There's quite a bit of gore although certainly not nearly as much as Dead Men Walking another Asylum film which was clearly shot at the same location as Shapeshifter.Typical of film in this budget range there are some parts that work and some that don't.

After witnessing him undergoing a transformation into a vicious creature they round up the remaining inmates and guards to get them to safety. There they try to form an escape plan. After a failed series of attempts which all ends in slaughter a startling revelation forces a change of plans that could save them.The Good News Yet another monsterinaprison film this one isn't all that bad. The small prison it's set in is the perfect way to generate some suspense by showing that there's really nowhere to hide. That puts them constantly at danger from the creature and it makes the peril all the more suspenseful. The creature itself is one of the best parts of the film. A fully imposing design bulky with large arms huge claws and a really shocking looking head that really strikes fear on first impression. The fact that it's a real costume instead of some CGI creation goes a long way in creating a lot of fear in it. It wouldn't work as well the other way had it been done. The next best feature here is the gore which is quite abundant and appealing. There's a very vicious mangling a person ripped in half in the waist a couple of stabbings and a head bashed into a pulp among other kills. There's even a scene where a person gnaws on their arm and chews through it. It is pretty gory when it needs to be. The small little moment here and there that was pretty nicely laid out was okay. The fact that it started early and fast was best allowing for the action to start up and get the interest level way up quite rapidly.The Bad News Beyond those few reasons there's very little to really like in this one. The small setting while also a detriment by having a closedoff area to drive suspense from also hurts it by showing off what little there is to the production. Normally this isn't a problem but when there's hardly anything to it that indicates it's just a small part of something bigger then it hurts the film a little. This is an obviously small prison that does have the appearance of just being that big in real life. Another big problem is that there is a very fast start to it but then the middle section slows down to a near crawl that is really painful to sit through. The action slows down to finally get some other scenes in which is a shame as it started out so fast. By selecting that part of the movie to get to know the characters only slows down what momentum that was built up. There's also a problem with contrasting issues brought up here and there. It has several scenes that contradict each other that are quite obviously found. These reasons keep it from being the simple monsterontheloose film it could've so easily been.The Final Verdict Not all that bad at all yet could've been helped by fixing a couple of small problems. Really recommended for fans of similar films from the company and those interested in a look while not really find much to dislike.Rated R Graphic Violence Graphic Language and Brief Nudity".

I've seen a lot of these films including those by The Asylum. They're one of my guilty pleasures outlandish gore fests often filled with hilariously campy acting.Shapeshifter is a bit different. It's is much more of a horrorthriller than a straight horror film it has a plot that makes sense a solid cast and only a moderate amount of gore. Underneath it all Shapeshifter is a classic siege film. It's has a solid premise a female prison guard gets trapped in a jail with a deadly beast and must band together with the prisoners in order to survive. It's kind of like a supernatural version of Assault on Precinct 13.The cast is a lot of fun. The inmates are one of these classic crews of ragtag prison characters. There's the Goofy Young Black Guy the Old Excommunicated Priest the fallen Brother from the Nation of Islam the White Trash exJunkie the Romanian mobster and the Prisoner who never talks.Jennnifer Lee Wiggins plays the female prison guard a former solider with an otherthan honorable discharge and a chip on her shoulder. Okay it's s bit clich but once she gets the dorky prison guard shirt off and starts running around the prison in her wifebeater tshirt she looks totally hot.There are almost no special effects or computer graphics. The film could have used some but I still thought the Beast was convincing. The plot gets a bit goofy at the end. I'm not sure why because the writing and the directing are pretty solid up until that point. Editing tricks and flashbacks are overused but still add to the film's impact.Overall a good rental for fans of the genre.".

We saved it and watched it late at night mainly yelling back at the television.The odd thing was that the first half hour was actually pretty good. There was some good suspense as the lead character and Shapeshifter gets introduced but then the film got bogged down. All the kills were pretty obvious and the gore was less realistic and more exaggerated almost as if the filmmakers were just having fun with it. I'm not sure the style would be very satisfying to hard core horror fans.The best part was actually the beast the old man in a rubber suit more more fun and way more campy than a computer made monster. It has that old fifties creature feature vibe.There are a few cool scenes  the kill with the old guy by the door the scenes in the catwalks etc. The actors vary from pretty good Marcoux Ginny  to somewhat amateur.".

We saved it and watched it late at night mainly yelling back at the television.The odd thing was that the first half hour was actually pretty good. There was some good suspense as the lead character and Shapeshifter gets introduced but then the film got bogged down. All the kills were pretty obvious and the gore was less realistic and more exaggerated almost as if the filmmakers were just having fun with it. I'm not sure the style would be very satisfying to hard core horror fans.The best part was actually the beast the old man in a rubber suit more more fun and way more campy than a computer made monster. It has that old fifties creature feature vibe.There are a few cool scenes  the kill with the old guy by the door the scenes in the catwalks etc. The actors vary from pretty good Marcoux Ginny  to somewhat amateur.";

	schema:headline " Film brilliantly combines comedy and tragedy in tale of moralresponsibility.";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie is one of my alltime favorites.  It depicts a lazy selfinterested everyman caught up in a personal struggle of good and evil.  The directorswriters question the moral responsibility of genocide as smalltown Czechs under Nazi domination respond to their Jewish neighbors. Jews are no longer allowed to own shops so their businesses' control and ultimate ownership is turned over to Christians  namely Nazi sympathizers.  One such Christian brotherinlaw of a highranking official is given a button shop owned by a deaf elderly Jewish woman who is not even aware that there is a war going on.  Due to her deafness she has the innocence of a child.  The Christian overseer finds that the shop makes no money whatsover but also learns that the Jewish community supports the old woman and will pay him a salary to watch over her.  What develops is a platonic love story between the two hilariously funny due to the old woman's inability to comprehend the impending doom around her and her assistant's struggle to shield her from harm while concerned with selfpreservation.  The movie works on numerous levels  as a love story including dreamlike fantasy elements of a bygone world where Nazi horrors don't exist and as a tale of ultimate moral responsibility.  It is a story of basically good people who say nothing see nothing hear nothing and do nothing when genocide threatens their neighbors and who thus enable genocide to occur.  The brilliant combination of hysterically funny scenes set against a background of impending mass murder brings this film to a life that is lacking in most humorless holocaustoriented films.  The laughter through tears produces an ultimate impact that is emotionally devastating. This film justly received an Oscar for Best Foreign Film when it was released.  It was produced during a brief high point of the Czech film industry prior to Russia's reconquering of the country and squelching any artistic freedom.  All the performers are exceptional particularly the two leads.  After the Russian takeover actress Ida Kaminski emigrated to New York and attempted to revive the Yiddish Theatre.".

The acting is brilliant especially in the case of the old lady who is the owner of the shop.

In the case of this film it is essential to realize that the film was made under heavy communist censorship. Thus we have plenty of antifascist rhetoric as well as the heroic rebel character who abound in Marxist cinema. Yet behind this facade is a devastating critique of the ideology of terror which is the foundation of not only fascism but the communism of 1960's Eastern Europe.There's a whole tradition of political film forced to obscure themes enough to slide them past superficial censors and into the minds of a sometimes discerning audience. It can be done by simply universalizing the themes and parallelling the setting with something the audience could recognize. But Chaplin had explored a different method with The Great Dictator by finding the similarities between two seemingly opposite figures. Through his critique of Hitler he took on American pomposity and brutality. It is a particularly effective method as it allows the target no way out turning its own accusations against itself.Much has been said about the comedy and tragedy's coexistence in this film and it is indeed an important facet. The simple reason being that life is both funny and tragic thus to universalize the themes so that any person can be in the Brtko's place it is imperative to represent both spheres of life.But the theme is not limited to a broad contemplation on life in the universal sense. There is a much more devestating critique of all totalitarian ideologies. Brtko begins with a simple and one could argue natural sense of survival. He is pushed into greed by his wife and is then pushed into desperation by the his statesanctioned duty. He finally arrives into a complete state of terror caused by the irrationality of the events around him and heightened by his relationship with Mrs. Lautmann. Of course this kind of degradation could happen just as easily under a communist regime as in the days of the Nazis and this was what the censors missed and the Academy Awards loved.Few films have the social significance of this one. Not only for its powerful message but the fact that it is a glimpse into a world we know little about.5 out of 5  Essential".

He has achieved nothing in life is slow in mind and a henpecked husband. Now he inherits the shop thanks to his wife and his brotherinlaw a converted Nazi.

In the end Brtko can consider himself lucky that he is at least admitted as a shop assistant on recommendation of other members of the Jewish community. That way he can give the impression to the town officials as if he fulfilled his obligations.It is now that Brtko's consciousness gradually begins to dawn. Little by little he understands that there is a profound contempt for  mankind in the Nazi proceedings. The day when all Jews are convoked on the Town Square he at least gets a hunch of what will be their real destination the allegedly wellmeant resettlement will lead them to a sure death in one of the concentration camps.Brtko does everything within his power to save Mrs Lautmanova from the fate that awaits her.

Not only is it memorable for the story or for it's symbolisms but also for some of the best acting in world cinema you will ever see.Set in 1942 Czechoslovakia Tono Jozef Kroner is appointed the Aryan Controller of a Jewish owned business that has been seized from an elderly Jewish woman Rozalie Lautmann Ida Kaminska. Because of her senility the woman is oblivious to events taking place around her. She believes Tono to be her newly appointed assistant. Conflict and tension for Tono appears from several different sources from his venal wife from his corrupt brotherinlaw from his growing affection and respect for the widow Lautmann from the larger external forces that threaten to overwhelm his newly arrived arrangement that for the first time offers him money status and respect. Tono is forced to decide between two equally unpalatable choices  To be a Jew loving Aryan or send Mrs. Lautmann to the concentration camp. That dilemma is played out primarily as an alcohol monologue as Tono gradually breaks down under the stress of a decision he doesn't want to make.The frailties of human psyche and dilemma of being selfless or selfish has been beautifully explored in this film. The director tells this multilayered story with the help of two wonderful actors. This kind of performance by the two central protagonists are rarely seen in world cinema. The drunken Tono and bumbling Rozalie will be etched in my memory forever. Don't miss this gem.".

	schema:reviewBody "A fine movie showing just how easy it is for people to become oppressors. Tono is just an average Joe keeping his nose clean until he is coopted into participating in the Nazi regime by his wellplaced brotherinlaw. Along the way Tono's wife shows the warping power of greed. The seeds of a fatal moral dilemma are set as Tono becomes the Aryan controller of a Jewish business run by a befuddled widow. Ultimately the horror becomes clear as the Jews are rounded up and the widow  played brilliantly  briefly comes to her senses and realizes she is the victim of a pogrom. All the relationships and characters in the movie are finely drawn and well acted and the production values were excellent.The version I reviewed was subtitled in English and unfortunately some of the subtitles were difficult to read.".

	schema:reviewBody "With The Shop on Main Street director Jan Kadar takes us to 1940s Slovakia. Set in a small rural town during the deportation of Jews to Nazi concentration camps the film revolves around Tono a kind hearted carpenter.Tono spends his days playing with his dog and being pestered by the husband of his wife's sister the local Fascist leader. Like most people in his village Tono doesn't like the Fascists but also doesn't do much to oppose them. He's timid and like many rural persons during the era doesn't quite understand what's going on around him anyway.When the Fascists begin turning Jews over to the Nazis one Jewish shop which sells buttons and trinkets is left without an owner. Tono's Fascist brotherinlaw thus gives the shop to Tono and appoints him Aryan Overseer. Tono and his wife imagine that this will make them wealthy but it turns out that the shop is still inhabited by its senile owner an elderly Jewish lady called Mrs. Lautmann who is poor and cannot make a living from her business.What's funny is that the Jewish lady is as confused as Tono is. She thinks he has come to her shop to act as an assistant whilst he has no idea how to run a shop let alone any inkling of the genocidal horrors blossoming all around him.Eventually Tono and Mrs Lautmann grow to be friends. He becomes a kind of duplicitous character simultaneously working for the Fascists in their effort to remove Jews from the town and for the Jewish community which pays him to take care of the feeble Mrs. Lautmann. This scheming comes to an end however when the Fascists finally order the deportation of all Jews leaving Toto torn ala another Holocaust movie Sophie's Choice or even the dark kid's movie Battle for Terra between three impulses save Mrs Lautmann save himself and his family and a kind of fatalistic feeling of absolute indifference.In one great sequence Tono seems to hold all these feelings simultaneously. In a drunken stupor he fluctuates wildly from one position to the next pushing the bewildered Mrs. Lautmann out into the streets then locking her in a cupboard then yanking her out again unsure whether to sell out this little Jewish lady and his soul in the process. The film's ultimate point though is that for all his heart Tono can do nothing to derail history. History is a giant machine that rolls somewhere out beyond the grasp of men comprehensible only in hindsight. The film ends shockingly with Tono's suicide and the death of Mrs Lautmann. We're then shown a nostalgic fantasy  which in a way satirises the end of Schindler's List decades before Spielberg's film was even made  in which Tono and Mrs. Lautmann dressed in the finery of a preFascist age stroll merrily together through the streets the hazy lighting indicating that such an ending is entirely wishful and counterfactual. Cinematic depictions of the Holocaust are problematic for two logically opposed yet both entirely cogent reasons. On the one hand the horror of the event is banalized by any effort to represent it making it proportional to all other events. Films like Claude Lanzmann's Shoah Lumet's Pawnbroker and in a way Mamet's Homicide and Kubrick's Shining are films that direct our attention to the unrepresentability of the Holocaust as its subject matter. On the other hand and at the same time the Holocaust gets thrown about as a token of high seriousness and good faith and as a weapon to silence other concerns and other discourses think the Ricky Gervais comedy sketch where Kate Winslet effortlessly wins Oscars through Holocaust films or Jerry Lewis' Oscar bait The Day The Clown Cried. Holocaust films win Oscars precisely because the subject matter itself is used to deflect any questions about aesthetic value and artistic integrity. Schindler's List exhibits both of these tendencies simultaneously. At the same time that Schindler's List relentlessly and aggressively banalizes the Holocaust  few set pieces are as condemned by artists directors and writers as Schindler's List's shower sequence  the film also claims a moral authority from its subject matter that preempts all criticism in advance.So in a way Kadar's film presents the antiSchindler shattering Spielberg's redemptive fable Rivette Turning the Holocaust into a redemptive allegory is an offence without reprieve.. Tono's intentions cannot buffer the monstrous forces of Fascism and Nazism let alone Stalinism Maoism American Slavery or the many other horrors of the last several hundred years. The Shop on Main Street reminds us  and this is a reminder that Americans need more than Europeans  that a good conscience and a basic human decency are not enough to save us.This is not defeatism or the admittance of a kind of individual selfreflexive impotency but rather a call for organisation. One man saving 1100 Jews whilst the pointless industrialised murder of six million occurs elsewhere does not prove that people are good and can make a difference. It proves people are brutes and that it often takes more than a molehill to stop a mountain. Human beings do indeed make their own history but as Marx went on to say they do not make it just as they please. 810  See David Mamet's Homicide and Marek Najbrt's Protector.".

The direction and photography perfectly capture the subdued horror of the inevitable tragedy facing this small Slovak town. It is simply heartbreaking yet has many warm and funny moments as well. Ida Kaminska should have won her Oscar in this film as she beautifully portrayed all the old Jewish women whose property and lives were taken by the Nazis and their cohorts.

	schema:reviewBody "The film sort of naturally divides itself into three parts. In the first we get the impression that we're about to witness a slow sliceoflife movie about a small town in Czechoslovakia during the Nazi occupation. It's not entirely without interest but it looks like it's going to be a long slog. We meet Jozef Kroner the central figure a lazy carpenter with a loving but exasperated wife and we meet his brotherinlaw an antiSemitic fascist guard in his gestapo uniform. The brotherinlaw visits Kroner's family bringing gifts of food and rum gotten from his many connections. There follows a realistic scene in which the family gets drunk and argue in between songs until finally the men fall on the floor pulling the tablecloth with them. A perfectly normal family evening.The second introduces us to the town itself including those members of the community who are Jewish. Kronin's brotherinlaw is in the process of Aryanizing the town. The process involves sending a Christian into a Jewish business and having him act as manager and clip the profits. As a favor the brotherinlaw arranges to have Kronin become the Aryan of a shop on Main Street. You'll be a rich man! he promises. But the favor is done out of spite. It's a tiny button shop with an apartment in the back. And it's run by a sweet generous but feisty old lady Ida Kaminsky who is impaired by age to the point at which she can't really understand what people are trying to tell her. For that matter she can't HEAR them. Selling buttons is not man's work Kroner complains and he's not very good at it. A comic scene has him trying to cope with a shop full of babbling housewives and spilling boxes of buttons all over the floor. Eventually Kroner and Kaminsky form a bond. The friendship makes him protective and her maternal.The third part gets entirely serious and involves the rounding up and deportation of all the Jews in the village. Here the movie is weaker than it should be. We've grown to like Mr. Katz the barber and when his shop is taken over and Aryanized and he leaves we're sad while Katz himself is more philosophical. A Christian friend who tries to hide him is beaten and driven through the village square with a sign hung around his neck  Jew Lover. But when the Jews are being assembled in the square  one by one with that long long list of names being read through a loudspeaker  and Kroner is torn by fear the instinct of selfpreservation and a desire to hide Ida Kaminska who is unaware of what's going on the scene is naturally tragic but it's overwrought too. It goes on too long. With Kaminska in her apartment saying the prayers for the Sabbath Kroner drinks a whole bottle of vodka while pacing around the shop talking to himself wildeyed and manic. His final attempt to save her ends tragically for both of them.The genocidal program of the Nazis was such a monstrous event that it's difficult to deal with a movie that describes it without the movie itself being near perfect. The terrible fate of so many millions of innocent people of all ages has to be treated carefully or else the movie comes across as an easy tearjerker demeaning and cheapening the event itself.This is a fine movie. It doesn't make an overly obvious grab for one's humanity but that final scene seems to be drawn out and Kroner's final act hasn't been adumbrated. Still well worth seeing.".

	schema:reviewBody "'The Shop on Main Street' was codirected by Jn Kadr and Elmar Klos. Klos was a Czeck and Kadr a Slovak born in Hungary. The setting of the film is a small town in Slovakia during the early part of World War II. Slovakia which became The First Slovak Republic was the only country along with Germany and the Soviet Union to invade Poland when the war started. Slovakia was forced to declare independence by Germany and a puppet regime was set up with Jozef Tiso as president and Vojtech Tuka Prime Minister. Tuka was far more radical than Tiso and headed the proNazi wing of the Slovak People's Party. The wing was supported by the Hlinka Guard who sported the double cross symbol on their uniforms. In the film a giant tower featuring the double cross is built in the center of town. The deportation of the Jews a key element of the plot was facilitated by Tuka. Approximately 57000 Jews were deported up until 1942 when various factions in Slovakia got wind that the Jews were not being deported to labor camps but rather were being exterminated. The deportations stopped for about two years when Slovakia insisted that further deportations would affect their economy in a deleterious way. In 1944 a national insurrection against the Nazis the Slovak National Uprising led to a Nazi takeover of the country. Deportations of Jews began again and even as late as March 1945 large numbers of Jews were murdered.'The Shop on Main Street' primarily addresses the issue of the ordinary man's response to living in a society under the yoke of fascist oppression. Our protagonist is Tno Brtko an often unemployed carpenter who lives in a modest home with his henpecking wife Evelyna. Tno's brotherinlaw Marku Kolkotskis commander of the Fascist guards. In an excellent scene where we really get to meet the characters for the first time Kolkotsk and his wife pay his inlaws a visit at their house and they all get drunk. Tno is angry at his brotherinlaw for not doing more for him given his position as the town commander. Kolkotsk surprises Tno when he hands him a document appointing him 'Aryan' manager of a Jewish button store hence the shop on Main Street. You'll note that at this point Tno has no guilt feelings about making a deal with the devil accepting the confiscation of the store and his position as manager as a fait accompli.When he arrives at the store he finds it owned and operated by an elderly Jewish widow Mrs. Lautmannov  who's hard of hearing and slightly senile. Kuchr an accountant and righteous Gentile resistance fighter reveals that Lautmannov primarily relies on donations from the Jewish community and most of the stock in the store is depleted. Nonetheless Tno agrees to an arrangement that if he acts as the 'Aryan manager' the Jewish community will pay him to look after Mrs. Lautmannov and make sure no harm comes to her. Gradually Tno takes a liking to Mrs. Lautmannov and when he learns that the Jewish community is about to be deported he becomes a righteous Gentile and is determined to save her. Tno becomes so militant for the just cause of sticking up for the Jews that he ends up beating his bigoted wife who is convinced that Mrs. Lautmannov is hoarding money. Unlike the famed Oskar Schindler and the Polish sewer worker Socha in the film 'In Darkness' Tno is in a position where he can only attempt to save one Jew. Unfortunately it soon becomes apparent to both Tno and the audience that he has no chance of success in saving the elderly woman especially after Kuchr is arrested for helping the Jewish community and dragged through the streets with a sign posted on his chest 'Friend of the Jews' soon to meet a horrible excruciating death.Directors Kadr and Klos are on solid ground by not glossing over the fact that a certain segment of Slovakian society was wickedly antisemitic and actively collaborated with the Nazis in the deportation of the Jews. In fact in 'The Shop on Main Street' you never see any Germansthe deportations are carried out by local Nazi supporters. Even those 'ordinary' people such as Tno's wife are not immune from basic prejudices as evidenced by her diatribe against Mrs. Lautmannov. Before his epiphany Tno is also unashamed taking money from the Jewish community while participating in the illegal confiscation of Mrs. Lautmannov's shop.Despite Kadr and Klos' admirable chronicling of the dark side of a segment of the Slovakian people they are still determined as other filmmakers who come from countries who collaborated with the Nazis to show that there were still good people amongst the bad apples. Kuchr is one of the good ones and Tno becomes one. Unlike Schindler Tno is trapped and is forced to make a 'Sophie's Choicelike' decision. Shall he push Mrs. Lautmannov out the door into the waiting hands of the Fascist Guards? Or into a closet in order to hide her? SUPER SPOILERS AHEAD. Unfortunately the 'push' is an ambivalent onehe's angry with her because her cause is hopeless and she should at least realize it but somehow he also is trying to think of a way he can save her. He ends up pushing her too hard into the closet and the ensuing fall causes her death.Are Kadr and Klos trying to assuage their own guilt by turning Tno into a martyr? The message here is that not all Slovakians were bad during that time. But I think it would have been more realistic if Tno lived with his guilt over Mrs. Lautmannov's death. His ambivalent actions where at one point he's thinking about saving his own skin were normal. By having him commit suicide Tno adopts a Christlike mantle unrepresentative of the average Slovakian's response to the harrowing reality of the times they were living in.".

	onyx:emotionText "'The Shop on Main Street' was codirected by Jn Kadr and Elmar Klos. Klos was a Czeck and Kadr a Slovak born in Hungary. The setting of the film is a small town in Slovakia during the early part of World War II. Slovakia which became The First Slovak Republic was the only country along with Germany and the Soviet Union to invade Poland when the war started. Slovakia was forced to declare independence by Germany and a puppet regime was set up with Jozef Tiso as president and Vojtech Tuka Prime Minister. Tuka was far more radical than Tiso and headed the proNazi wing of the Slovak People's Party. The wing was supported by the Hlinka Guard who sported the double cross symbol on their uniforms. In the film a giant tower featuring the double cross is built in the center of town. The deportation of the Jews a key element of the plot was facilitated by Tuka. Approximately 57000 Jews were deported up until 1942 when various factions in Slovakia got wind that the Jews were not being deported to labor camps but rather were being exterminated. The deportations stopped for about two years when Slovakia insisted that further deportations would affect their economy in a deleterious way.

	schema:reviewBody "And by breathtaking I mean literally breathtaking  while watching this movie from time to time especially during the last 30 or so minutes you will realize that you are not breathing. I don't know what else to say everything has already been said in other reviews. Naturally I've heard about this movie before I knew that it was the only Slovak movie to ever win an Oscar I've read the reviews but I was a bit hesitant to watch it because I know how badly many of the great old movies age and I didn't want to be disappointed. Well I wasn't. This movie didn't age well this movie simply doesn't age at all. The reason for this is that it deals with an eternal internal conflict in all humans  a conflict between what is good for me and what is moral. And what is good anyway? What is moral? What is the right thing to do? Is it always right to do the right thing? Is it always wrong to do the wrong thing? Where is the balance? Is there a balance? The main protagonist keeps asking these questions until it is too late. And most of all he forces you to keep asking these questions yourself. You will keep asking yourself these questions long after watching this movie. And the only answer you will be able to come up with is I don't know! I don't want to answer! Just like Tono Brtko didn't want to answer them. It is a story of an ordinary man in extraordinary circumstances. A story of an ordinary man being forced to make a decision that no one wants to make. A decision that makes you choose between two wrong outcomes. The acting is simply perfect there is no other word to describe it. Kaminska is perfect Kroner is perfect and they are both perfect together. If there was an Oscar awarded for the best chemistry between two main protagonists these two would definitely win it and to this day I haven't seen any duo perform better.The final dream sequence is the best dream sequence I have ever seen in a movie especially if you notice all the symbolism. It shows the contrast between what is and what could be. Between what podiums and uniforms are used for and what they could be used for. And ultimately a contrast between the good in each and every one of us and the evil in each and every one of us.Watch this movie and you will never forget it. Trust me.".

	schema:reviewBody "'The Shop on Main Street' is a truly remarkable film a gentle mix of comedy and tragedy that manages to tug at our heartstrings without ever resorting to unnecessary violence or overthetop melodrama. It is 1942 and World War Two is in full force. Tono Brtko Jozef Krner is a poor Aryan carpenter in the Slovak town of Sabinov. He is somewhat averse to the Nazi occupation and the persecution of the town's Jewish community though at the same time he does not actively speak out against it. He refuses on principle to work at the socalled tower of Babel that the Nazis have ordered built to symbolise their glory denying himself money that he sorely needs and he detests his wealthy but heartless brotherinlaw who has been placed in charge of the Aryanisation of the town.However despite his misgivings when his brotherinlaw places him in charge of a Jewish button shop on Main Street which by law he is entitled to Brtko needs the money too badly to refuse. The owner of the shop the old and senile Mrs. Lautmann Ida Kaminska doesn't even realise that there is a war on and so she naturally assumes that Brtko is here as her assistant. The two  with their own share of comic confrontations  launch into a sort of oddcouple relationship with Brtko becoming fonder of his Jewish coworker as each day passes.When the Nazis order all Jews to be loaded onto cattle trucks for transport Brtko must decide whether to turn Mrs. Lautmann over to the soldiers or to try and hide her and risk being labeled a white Jew. Brtko attempts to explain the situation to her but she discards his words as drunken ramblings. With soldiers threatening to enter the shop at any moment he decides to forcibly hide Mrs. Lautmann in a closet though his rough treatment results in her death. A guiltstricken Brtko subsequently hangs himself and the two of them  despite both being dead  meet again in a more perfect world strolling handinhand across a peaceful brightlylit town.Few films are more emotionallypowerful than Jn Kadr and Elmar Klos' 'The Shop on Main Street.' The insertion of comedy throughout the film reminds us that even in the most tragic of situations there is humour to be found even if we are laughing through tears. The heartbreaking ending also carries with it a glimmer of hope hope that despite the years of adversity there will be a time when the Jewish community is able to walk through a town without suffering routine persecution.The acting in this film is very good but both Krner and Kaminska a popular Polish stage actress are nothing less than magnificent. Krner effortlessly switches between the Chaplinesquire comedy of his early interactions with Mrs. Lautmann and Brtko's fear and confusion in the film's harrowing final act. Kaminska in an Oscarnominated role is delightfully amusing to watch for much of the film though her understandable confusion and terror when she eventually notices the Nazi occupation is simply heartrending. Fittingly the pair received a special mention at the Cannes Film Festival for their remarkable acting performances and the film itself won the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar for Czechoslovakia at the 1966 Academy Awards.".

	schema:reviewBody "Song Without End has a low score here on IMDb. I'm not sure why. It is superior in my opinion in every way to A Song to Remember which is a nearly totally fictionalized story of Chopin. Song without End has the basic facts right not to mention 40 absolutely gorgeous musical interludes. Jorge Bolet who plays all of the piano pieces captures the technical pyrotechnics the richness of tone and the passion for which Liszt was known as a performer.The film only covers part of Liszt's life and concentrates naturally on the turmoil in his love affairs which leads to his attempt to marry the already married Princess Carolyne Wittgenstein he left his married girlfriend Countess Marie D'Agoult the mother of his children for her. One of his daughters Cosima married Richard Wagner who features in this film. I disagree with a previous comment complaining about the way Liszt is portrayed. While it's not emphasized it is obvious that he was a man of great charity donating many of his fees to various organizations and playing many benefit concerts. Later on he concentrated on composing at which he was very successful. As a performer Liszt was a bona fide rock star in his day complete with hysterical fans. He was most certainly attractive to women and religiously conflicted.Dirk Bogarde does a sensational job as Liszt. This and The Angel Wore Red were his only Hollywood films. Even if they had been successful it's doubtful Bogarde would have stayed in the states as he probably wouldn't have been cast in the kinds of films he wanted to make andor the kinds of parts he wanted to play. He makes a very romantic intense Liszt and his fingerings are nothing short of amazing. Capucine is good if a little wooden as Carolyne. The supporting cast is very good.The production and costumes are opulent but they are dwarfed by the music. Definitely some of the most brilliantly performed classical music in film.Highly recommended for classical music lovers.".

Dirk and Cappy have a whole lot of hurdles to overcome before they can be happy put there by the Romanov family and the Catholic Church but it does sort of work itself out in the end.My favorite performance in the film is that of Martita Hunt who plays a dowager German princess who offers Liszt employment when he needs it.

Capucine as the Princess Carolyne and Genevieve Page as the abandoned mistress were truly terrific here as well as a fine supporting performance by Martita Hunt as the Czar's sympathetic sister. Hunt literally made a career of playing strong erudite women.The set decorations here are phenomenal they're on par with the great 1944 film Wilson.The music is magnificent although we could have done without knowing about the friendship between Liszt and the antiSemite Richard Wagner. Another flaw is the miscasting of Lou Jacobi as Bogarde's manager. Jacobi sounded like he came out of the Catskills. This film for Jacobi came after his super performance the year before in the beloved The Diary of Anne Frank. Happy Birthday Lou as you turn 95 on Dec. 28th.The first part of the film deals with Liszt's career. His playing in concerts in various European countries was remarkable. The second part deals with his illfated love with the Countess Cathryne of Lichtenstein.While we see that Liszt entered the priesthood when his proposed marriage to Cathryne was rejected we really can't tell if Cathryne became a nun. I imagine no since she was still technically married in the eyes of the church. Nonetheless we have a powerful beautifully acted film. Too bad that Totentanz a Liszt masterpiece was not played here. I had to know that piece of grand music in a required music course at college. Like the movie Totentanz was a masterful piece.".

	schema:reviewBody "While it may take time to warm to Liszt if at all personally this reviewer loves his music if more when at an older age than younger one cannot deny how influential he was as a composer and especially as a performer he was incredibly important in his lifetime.'Song Without End' is certainly much better than Ken Russell's 'Lisztomania' a very hard to rate film that was visually striking but ruined by gratuitous excess and lack of taste and does have many pleasures but biographically it disappoints. It is a visually sumptuous film for starters it's very beautifully photographed the costumes are lavish richly colourful and true to period and the settings interiors and scenery are gorgeous to watch. The music is definitely the highlight of 'Song Without End' whether it is bombastic and energetic like the second 'Hungarian Rhapsody' or intimate and poignant like the third 'Liebestraume' and it's all cleverly arranged. Contrary to one reviewer the inclusion of music of other composers was quite nice though there could have been a little more of Liszt's 'Totentanz' would have been absolutely thrilling to listen to. One mustn't forget the magnificent playing of Jorge Bolet absolutely agree that it is some of the bestperformed classical music in film. Liszt's music is fiendishly and notoriously difficult for a pianist 'Totentanz' for example is hard enough with piano and orchestra in solo piano version it's a killer but Bolet  with such energetic hugely musical and poetic playing makes it sound effortless. 'Song Without End' is nicely directed and never resorts to vulgarity or excess. While its representation of Liszt is not exactly a faithful one one doesn't find it easy to believe him as that much of a womaniser almost too much on the slightly sleazy side and especially as a prima donna it is not the literal character assassination of 'Lisztomania' because it also gets some things right like he was a man of great charity was highly noble and women were attracted to him. 'Song Without End' is also not without its powerful and affecting moments and the music plays an enormous part in why that is the fact that Liszt played the music of other composers as well and that he was a fan of Chopin is incorporated remarkably intelligently.The cast are very good. Whether one takes issue with how Liszt is portrayed it cannot be blamed at Dirk Bogarde's door but how he's written. Bogarde does an excellent job and is very believable and charismatic whether amorous or more intense in the context of how Liszt is written and as a performance in general. Genevieve Page and especially Capucine are breathtakingly beautiful and Page also plays the film's most sympathetic character very poignantly. Martita Hunt is also memorable Hunt as is evidenced by her definitive Miss Havisham in David Lean's classic 'Great Expectations' had a knack for stealing scenes regardless of the size of the role. Bogarde and Capucine and particularly Bogarde and Page also convince together quite touching in fact at times.For all its many good things 'Song Without End' is not without its flaws. There is an exception to the high standard set by the cast and that is agreed the miscast and out of place Lou Jacobi whose appearance and the way he spoke being somewhat anachronistic and jarring. The film does drag in places getting bogged down by a few strands like the greatly and too obviously romanticized romances that are also factually distorted the film fails to mention the Countess' emotional problems before meeting Liszt and how big a part it played in their break up. The story here is compelling but some things that were included could have been elaborated on in more detail. While there are some things that are faithful like his devotion for art it is every bit as easy to spot the inaccuracies and anachronisms like the notion of Liszt feeling inferior to Chopin with the existence of his 'Transcendental Etudes' being long before he even met Chopin . It does focus too much on the romantic side of his character and not enough on his magnetic way of performing he held that earned him the admiration of several other fellow performers it does focus on a small portion of his life and unfortunately it is not the most compelling or the most telling of Liszt's character. Lastly some of the script is flimsy with some soapoperalike dialogue and areas that were potentially interesting but lack depth.All in all disappointing in some areas but also a film of many pleasures. 610 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a very beautiful film made with great meticulousness and with a serious intention to for once stick to the truth in a biopic and the actors are all superb especially Martita Hunt as the Grand Duchess the most convincing one. Dirk Bogarde is excellent as Liszt but not at all as he was more like an English gentleman than the emotionally wayward and unstable victim of his own vanity with much confusion that he was. Capucine is spellbindingly beautiful as Carolyne carrying herself with great style and Genevive Page makes a very convincing Marie d'Agoult. But what about the others? George Sand makes a very brief appearance Lola Montez is not allowed at all and there were others. Instead of telling the truth the film devotes itself to the Liszt myths and embellishes them thoroughly so that Franz Liszt would have liked it. Of course this at least is preferred to the terrible character assassination Lisztomania by Ken Russell 1975 dragging it all down to vulgarity. At least Liszt was never vulgar. On the contrary he was very careful about excluding himself only to the highest circles of nobility which the film conveys adequately. Still it's not a great film seconded by both the great Chopin films like Liszt never came close to the genius of Chopin. The relationship with the Princess Carolyne is greatly romanticized and Franz Liszt confessed himself that Marie d'Agoult was his only true love. Like Liszt himself the film is gradually bogged down into his sanctimonious catholic penchant for superstition he neglects his own life music and love to follow the church and thus made a fool of himself instead of fulfilling his glorious career. Well well. The film remains a most beautiful musical illustration to his life and enjoyable as such while it leaves you deploring his bathos. The last third of his life he became 75 was wasted getting mummified in the church with very few more compositions.".

	onyx:emotionText "This is a very beautiful film made with great meticulousness and with a serious intention to for once stick to the truth in a biopic and the actors are all superb especially Martita Hunt as the Grand Duchess the most convincing one. Dirk Bogarde is excellent as Liszt but not at all as he was more like an English gentleman than the emotionally wayward and unstable victim of his own vanity with much confusion that he was. Capucine is spellbindingly beautiful as Carolyne carrying herself with great style and Genevive Page makes a very convincing Marie d'Agoult. But what about the others? George Sand makes a very brief appearance Lola Montez is not allowed at all and there were others. Instead of telling the truth the film devotes itself to the Liszt myths and embellishes them thoroughly so that Franz Liszt would have liked it. Of course this at least is preferred to the terrible character assassination Lisztomania by Ken Russell 1975 dragging it all down to vulgarity. At least Liszt was never vulgar. On the contrary he was very careful about excluding himself only to the highest circles of nobility which the film conveys adequately. Still it's not a great film seconded by both the great Chopin films like Liszt never came close to the genius of Chopin. The relationship with the Princess Carolyne is greatly romanticized and Franz Liszt confessed himself that Marie d'Agoult was his only true love. Like Liszt himself the film is gradually bogged down into his sanctimonious catholic penchant for superstition he neglects his own life music and love to follow the church and thus made a fool of himself instead of fulfilling his glorious career. Well well. The film remains a most beautiful musical illustration to his life and enjoyable as such while it leaves you deploring his bathos. The last third of his life he became 75 was wasted getting mummified in the church with very few more compositions.";

My dislike of most biopics is important to note as unlike the other reviewers I really didn't adore Franz Liszt and the idea of a film about him. That's because in my opinion and I am sure many will disagree most biographical movies are either short on entertainment value they can be sluggish or they avoid this by playing fast and loose with the facts. Frankly I don't like either extreme. But when it comes to Liszt I have no idea if this film is accuratehe is someone about whom I know very little other than the fact that Bogarde looked nothing like him and the film makers did little to correct this. But I do know that the film is lethargic...very very lethargic. So despite his affairs and illegitimate children the film managed to make all this very very dulland that is a crime. How can a film that often focuses on the composer's scandalous relationships be so turgid?! Perhaps because all too often nothing happens in the filmjust lots and lots and lots of scenes with Bogarde playing either the piano or the organ. And as many of the songs were not Liszt's compositions I just felt a bit bored. So aside from nice music though a bit too much of it and nice costumes I found the whole thing pretty stale. If you are a musician andor adore Liszt perhaps you'll have a very different opinionI just know that Dirk Bogarde made other films with a lot more energy and entertainment value.".

	schema:headline " Effective atmosphere and unflinching violence make up for an unevenlypaced finale in this mythological thriller";
	schema:reviewBody "John Cassavetes stars as a surgeon in a small New England town where a series of bizarre rapesturnedmurders are occurring left and right against the area's female residents. Thrown into the mix is his teenager daughter whose boyfriend claims to be witnessing the crimes as they are occurring within nightmares he experiences.As far as I'm concerned John Hough is one of horror's unsung heroes when it comes to mood and atmosphere if The Legend of Hell House or the marginal Disney thriller The Watcher in the Woods aren't enough proof of that The Incubus is. This dreary thriller is considerably more violent than Hough's other horror pictures but has his signature stylistics that I absolutely love. Like in most of all Hough's work the cinematography is slick and thoughtful making goosebumpsinducing use of POV shots. In the film the camera follows the victims almost like a predator before launching its vicious assault and each attack is just as effective as the next. There is also a substantial Gothic feel underpinning the events and the photography accentuates the beauty of New England landscapes even in spite of the Canadian shooting locales. The musty and discomforting atmosphere of the film is underlined by an unnerving score another signature element of Hough's films. A somewhat withered Cassavetes is still on his game here with John Ireland supporting as the miffed sheriff and Kerri Keane as a nosy local reporter.The chilly Gothic autumnal environment in which the film takes place is entirely disrupted by its explicit sexual violence and it features some of the most disturbing and visceral assault scenes I've ever seen in a horror film the library sequence near the beginning especially stands out. The script's medley of violence and female sexuality under attack is fascinating in its repulsive representation and even more bizarre are the incestuous undertones and genderbending revelation at the film's twisted conclusion. While the finale is irrefutably shocking and the monster makeup surprisingly scary even by today's standards I can say that the narrative buildup could have been a tad better handled as it all does seem to come crashing down rather awkwardly a bit more finesse in script and editing could have remedied this but the film still works in spite of it.Overall I found The Incubus to be a formidable and disturbing film Hough's handling of the rural New England locale is fantastic in atmosphere and tone and effective moody cinematography really establishes a menacing and inauspicious feel. The film's one major flaw is the hackneyed pacing in its last act but I personally found this a forgivable sin amidst the movie's audacious presentation of sexual violence and generally grim demeanor. This is definitely one of the more aggressive horror films of its era in terms of thematics but the quaint and Gothic feel hearkens back to a more classical and almost British sensibility. A fantastic thriller best suited for viewing on a chilly autumn night with all the lights off. 810.".

Also there are quite a few tedious parts to struggle yourself through like footage of a Bruce Dickinson concert! and the usually very reliable John Hough's direction is nearly unnoticeable.

	schema:reviewBody "Incubus is one hell of a bizarre and trashy horror film. In fact it's just bizarre and trashy enough to keep its viewers watching out of sheer curiosity. It doesn't exactly have a strong story it's based on a novel by Ray Russell and perhaps something was lost in the transition to film. The story is about brutal rapes  murders being committed in a small New England town named Galen. A relative newcomer to the town doctor Sam Cordell a slumming John Cassavetes tries hard to help the befuddled local police chief Hank Walden John Ireland by working the clues. Meanwhile Sams' daughter Jenny Erin Noble is dating a local boy Tim Galen Duncan McIntosh whose nightmares serve as precursors to the crimes. As directed by John Hough The Legend of Hell House this is interesting to say the least. It's a very amusing and relentlessly nasty film that should have its audience feeling some amount of sympathy for the poor female victims. Making it worth sticking with is a central performance by the great Oscarnominated Cassavetes whose face is rarely to be seen here without a bemused smile. The other actors including Ireland Noble McIntosh Kerrie Keane as the trouble making newspaper editor Helen Hughes Harvey Atkin and Harry Ditson are okay but this is definitely Cassavetes's show. People who enjoy twisted little details in stories will be intrigued to watch as he kisses his daughter on the lips and peers at her while she emerges from a shower. Overall this is pretty creepy stuff and it is NOT without its fun moments. One of them is seeing a preIron Maiden Bruce Dickinson performing with Samson the band he was in at the time. Another is the sequence with a farming family the guntoting dad is struck in the neck with a pitchfork and as a result accidentally blows off his foot! The camerawork in a subsequent scene that reveals a victim through the crack at the bottom of a door is VERY impressive. People also might enjoy the twist ending when the title demons' human guise is revealed. The atmosphere is decent and the gore well executed when it is utilized. There is also some good nudity for the voyeurs among us. Horror fans should find this an acceptable entertainment. Six out of 10.".

	schema:headline " With a tighter story this could have been great.";
	schema:reviewBody "Horror is perhaps one of two genres where logic doesn't always win out over imagination.  We all know that killers like Freddy Jason Michael and even Leatherface shouldn't be able to sustain the amount of pain they do and still live to fight another day.  Most of us don't believe that zombies really rise from the dead to stalk people and eat their brains.  And let's hope that at least some people know that when you enter places like Funhouses and old mansions that unspeakable crimes are not going to be perpetrated against them.  This is where imagination wins out over fact. Horror and most films in general requires us to suspend our disbelief for a couple of hours and just go with the flow.  This usually isn't a problem when I watch bouncing balls being hurled down the stairs at George C. Scott or when I see an unseen force stalking three amateur film makers in the woods near Burketsville.  But what I do have a problem digesting  without wanting to regurgitate  is when a film has a killer like the one in this film.  To give away who the killer is would actually be a huge spoiler and it would take away all fun of watching it for yourself but just suffice to say that I actually enjoyed this film right up to final scene when the killer is revealed.  There are too many events in the film that transpire for it to make any sense that the killer is who it is.  But the 90 minutes prior to this point is a well done suspenseful blood soaked film directed with panache and skill by John Hough.  If the film would have offered me a different killer then I would actually be raving about it.  This may sound like a completely asinine reason to discredit the film but believe me anyone who has seen the film is almost sure to agree with me.John Cassevetes plays Dr. Sam Cordell.  He and his daughter Jenny  played beautifully by Erin Flannery  have just recently moved to this small New England town.  Cordell is a recent widow and it is unclear how his wife died.  We see several flashback scenes where a mystery woman  one can only presume it is his wife  is laying backside on the ground during a torrential downpour.  Her face is bloodied and her eyes are closed.  Again I am not sure who this woman is and what relevance she has to the story but she is there anyway.  Cassevetes it has to be mentioned is strange to say the least.  Cordell is a loving father but his love for his daughter seems to be a little more than just parental.  There are a few scenes that hint of incestuous possibilities.  It never comes to fruition but it just seems to be omnipotent but somewhere just beneath the proverbial rug.  Thankfully the film never really explores this element of the relationship but it does make you a little uneasy.  Casevettes seems like a cross between the porno actor John Leslie and screen great James Caan.  He has a deceptive smile and a virile commanding voice that makes you sit up and take notice.  But he also looks like he is about to disrobe during a business luncheon in every scene.  He just has that slimy disingenuous phlegmatic uneasy way about him.  He never really looks like he can be trusted in this film.  I guess that is a credit to the writers the director and to Cassevetes himself.  There was always something that just bothered me about his character from the getgo. The story begins on an excellent note as two would be lovers are swimming in the local quarry.  There is a rickety old changing shed near by and as we can see something or someone is watching them.  When the young man briefly disappears to get something from the truck the young woman wanders into the shed just to play a prank.  Once she is there she is attacked.  The young man dashes to the shed to find her and he is impaled with a board and nail. Hough shrewdly sets us up for the payoff pitch when the young man comes in. He looks frantically scours the room and spots his wouldbe lover bleeding in the corner and then smacko the guy gets it.  It is a very tense moment and it starts the film off on the correct note.Also introduced into the tangled wed of a story is a young man named Tim that seems to be having strange dreams of a faceless woman that is bound in a torture chamber surrounded by men with cloaks covering their faces.  Tim seems to think that his dreams have something to do with the murders because every time a murder takes place he has another dream. Toss in a quiet and turbid grandmother a meretricious female reporter and a strong yet venal local sheriff and you have all the ingredients necessary to create the makings of an imbroglio in the small town of Galen.Throughout the film more people are massacred but most of the time the males are slaughtered with extreme prejudice and the females are raped. This is my first feeble and careful attempt to tell you that this is what left me unconvinced with the denouement.  It just didn't strike the right chord.The Incubus is a well done film.  It is tense tight and even most of the performances are very well done.  I was intrigued by the dreams that Tim was having and I was anxious to find out what significance they had to the story and ultimately to the murders.  But when you get through all that was good in the film you are still left with that acerbic taste in your mouth.  And bitter pills are always more difficult to swallow than sweet ones. 7 out of 10 This could have been a nine.  Too bad.".

And let's hope that at least some people know that when you enter places like Funhouses and old mansions that unspeakable crimes are not going to be perpetrated against them.  This is where imagination wins out over fact. Horror and most films in general requires us to suspend our disbelief for a couple of hours and just go with the flow.  This usually isn't a problem when I watch bouncing balls being hurled down the stairs at George C. Scott or when I see an unseen force stalking three amateur film makers in the woods near Burketsville.  But what I do have a problem digesting  without wanting to regurgitate  is when a film has a killer like the one in this film.  To give away who the killer is would actually be a huge spoiler and it would take away all fun of watching it for yourself but just suffice to say that I actually enjoyed this film right up to final scene when the killer is revealed.  There are too many events in the film that transpire for it to make any sense that the killer is who it is.  But the 90 minutes prior to this point is a well done suspenseful blood soaked film directed with panache and skill by John Hough.  If the film would have offered me a different killer then I would actually be raving about it.  This may sound like a completely asinine reason to discredit the film but believe me anyone who has seen the film is almost sure to agree with me.John Cassevetes plays Dr. Sam Cordell.  He and his daughter Jenny  played beautifully by Erin Flannery  have just recently moved to this small New England town.  Cordell is a recent widow and it is unclear how his wife died.  We see several flashback scenes where a mystery woman  one can only presume it is his wife  is laying backside on the ground during a torrential downpour.  Her face is bloodied and her eyes are closed.  Again I am not sure who this woman is and what relevance she has to the story but she is there anyway.  Cassevetes it has to be mentioned is strange to say the least.  Cordell is a loving father but his love for his daughter seems to be a little more than just parental.  There are a few scenes that hint of incestuous possibilities.  It never comes to fruition but it just seems to be omnipotent but somewhere just beneath the proverbial rug.  Thankfully the film never really explores this element of the relationship but it does make you a little uneasy.  Casevettes seems like a cross between the porno actor John Leslie and screen great James Caan.  He has a deceptive smile and a virile commanding voice that makes you sit up and take notice.  But he also looks like he is about to disrobe during a business luncheon in every scene.  He just has that slimy disingenuous phlegmatic uneasy way about him.  He never really looks like he can be trusted in this film.  I guess that is a credit to the writers the director and to Cassevetes himself.  There was always something that just bothered me about his character from the getgo. The story begins on an excellent note as two would be lovers are swimming in the local quarry.  There is a rickety old changing shed near by and as we can see something or someone is watching them.  When the young man briefly disappears to get something from the truck the young woman wanders into the shed just to play a prank.  Once she is there she is attacked.  The young man dashes to the shed to find her and he is impaled with a board and nail. Hough shrewdly sets us up for the payoff pitch when the young man comes in. He looks frantically scours the room and spots his wouldbe lover bleeding in the corner and then smacko the guy gets it.  It is a very tense moment and it starts the film off on the correct note.Also introduced into the tangled wed of a story is a young man named Tim that seems to be having strange dreams of a faceless woman that is bound in a torture chamber surrounded by men with cloaks covering their faces.  Tim seems to think that his dreams have something to do with the murders because every time a murder takes place he has another dream. Toss in a quiet and turbid grandmother a meretricious female reporter and a strong yet venal local sheriff and you have all the ingredients necessary to create the makings of an imbroglio in the small town of Galen.Throughout the film more people are massacred but most of the time the males are slaughtered with extreme prejudice and the females are raped. This is my first feeble and careful attempt to tell you that this is what left me unconvinced with the denouement.  It just didn't strike the right chord.The Incubus is a well done film.  It is tense tight and even most of the performances are very well done.  I was intrigued by the dreams that Tim was having and I was anxious to find out what significance they had to the story and ultimately to the murders.  But when you get through all that was good in the film you are still left with that acerbic taste in your mouth.  And bitter pills are always more difficult to swallow than sweet ones. 7 out of 10 This could have been a nine.  Too bad.";

Roy tries to help her after hearing her screams but is killed. Dr. Sam Cordell John Cassavetes and his daughter Jenny Erin Flannery are both new to Galen after the death of Sam's wife. Sam is called into action by Police Chief Hank Walden John Ireland when Mandy and Roy are found. He performs the autopsy on Roy and treats Mandy for her horrific injuries.

A local journalist named Laura Kincaid Kerrie Keane reports the events and suggests to Sam that a similar string of rapes and murders occurred in the town 30 years earlier. More rapes and murders occur. Meanwhile Jenny's boyfriend Tim Galen Duncan MacIntosh has been having strange dreams and nightmares and is convinced that he has something to do with the horrific acts. Tim's story and digging into the towns past makes Sam become convinced of the existence of a creature known as an Incubus  a shapeshifting demonic entity that exists only to reproduce! Directed by John Hough this is one seriously dull horror film. The script by George Franklin based on the novel by Ray Russell is slow to say the least. Nothing interesting or exciting happens and it finishes with one of the most boring none event of a twist ending I've ever seen and frustratingly it just finishes suddenly. As the story plods along at a snails pace there are a few rapes but none are shown on screen. There is only one gore scene in the entire film too. The monster itself is only shown at the very end and has all of three short scenes. Everything about this film productionwise is very static and flat the film has no energy or pace. The acting is dull and you don't feel or care for anyone. Check out the scene in the autopsy room where you can clearly see the boom mike at the top of the screen on several occasions. The type of rubbish horror film making that you'll forget within a day. A real waste of time don't bother.".

	schema:reviewBody "In a small Wisconsin town a series of aggressive rapes and bloody murders plague the community with the police authorities baffled to who or what is responsible. The local drainedout Dr. Cordell is called upon to examine the bodies when they start to pile up. He is basically a newcomer to the town along with his teenage daughter. His daughter's boyfriend is having terrible nightmares that he believes are connected to the brutal deaths and this leads Cordell to the conclusion that they are facing a supernatural threat.There are some deft touches evident but what foils this luridly glum Canadian Bgrade shocker is that it's criminally underdeveloped. Even though it's compelling it could have been so much more but in the end it's a basic routine format of a slasher flick with supernatural overtones that just sits there and turns into an incomplete muddle of whoha. Just like a dream does it doesn't make a whole lot of sense and the story fits that description. And for most time what a slow moving and quite uneventful exercise it was. The mysterious story which is taken by Ray Russell's novel just seems rather dead and irrational with little in the way of character and subplot developments. Also some strange occurrences pop up in the contexts that are never truly expanded on. But maybe that was the editing? These sudden offbeat interruptions involving nightmare sequences lack any sort of structure and the script lacks drive. There is some disquieting hysterical and rather callous moments worked into the film but they aren't terribly graphic and there's a small dosage of flesh included. The demonic spirit The Incubus is mostly kept off screen when it attacks its victims until it finally shows in a couple of frames in the final few minutes of the film. The design of the monster looked topnotch. When it does come to it's conclusion it leaves you with a blank expression on your face and you going Come again? Quite like what Cassavetes looks like throughout most of the film. The performances teeter on plain drab or dramatically overthetop. Kerrie Kane takes the cake on that latter point and John Cassavetes in the lead role seems really outofit and in a state of bemusement. He plays Dr. Cordell is such a weary state that he just feels distant and rather distracted to what's actually happening. The direction by John Hough is definitely the film's strong point with Hough creating a cold and dark heavy air that sucks the life out of the picture. A highly atmospheric and robust score surrounds proceedings adding to the nauseating awe and the racy soundtrack harps on. On the surface the film's slick photography has a wide range of inventive shots and arty angles. Visually it looked well with many solid techniques integrated into this production despite some cheap fumbles.Incubus has an interestingly foreboding setup with a decent looking production but sloppy handling within the material and outofsorts performances bring this one down to mediocre.".

The sound is poorly recorded. The video is grainy and dark making it difficult to tell what's going on. The actors read people who owed the director money couldn't act for their worthless lives and the story was not one of the best I've ever seen.SPOILERS When the father tells the girl that she shouldn't get too close to the townspeople in the beginning of the film what the crap was he talking about? That like many other things in this film never comes up again anywhere in this film. When the farmer is killed in the barn he has his foot shot off and in the next scene when he flies out of the hayloft it's still attached to his leg. The dreams the coroner has are creepy to be sure but once again they never make any sense and they never come up again. The ending what the crap was wrong with that ending?? How did the daughter die? Why did no one seem to care?The characters aren't all that endearing. In fact I spent the majority of my time wishing the characters would die horrible horrible deaths and was severely disappointed when many did not. The actual incubus when it was finally shown was laughable. it looked like SwampThing's retarded brother. Quite frankly all of the frightening scenes were laughable. Even the nudity something you'd figure a director couldn't possibly screw up was made to be creepy. SPOILER AGAIN in the beginning when the daughter is naked in the shower with the door open okay? the father just stands there for a good solid minute watching her. I assume that the terrible secret the townspeople can't know is they're incestuous but once again that's never explained. And did anyone notice that the supposedly small town has a surprising number of large scale office buildings and highrise apartments and general large citysized hustle and bustle?This movie should not have been made. I regret ever hearing about it and the director should be beaten with the original master reel for ever thinking he should do this film. If you don't have the budget for proper scene edits good sound recording and overdubbing and acceptable screenwriters don't make a movie. I can't imagine what the writer of the original novel feels about this film but I'd be scared to find out.Avoid this movie. Avoid it like the crapridden garbage pile that it is. I know it sounds like I'm being overly negative but if you feel that way go ahead and watch the movie. Just don't say I didn't warn you.".

I regret ever hearing about it and the director should be beaten with the original master reel for ever thinking he should do this film. If you don't have the budget for proper scene edits good sound recording and overdubbing and acceptable screenwriters don't make a movie. I can't imagine what the writer of the original novel feels about this film but I'd be scared to find out.Avoid this movie. Avoid it like the crapridden garbage pile that it is. I know it sounds like I'm being overly negative but if you feel that way go ahead and watch the movie. Just don't say I didn't warn you.";

An anthropologist returns to the city after years of travelling and investigating only to find that the spirits of the places he travelled have become aware of his probing eye and have come looking in return.  A balancing by the Manitou as it were.  The film has a heavy oppressive mood to it but leaves the watcher to figure out a great deal of the content for themselves. Coming from the same director as Die Hard and The 13th Warrior this is a rather surprisingly subtle film and quite delightful in it's execution. Highly recommended if you can find it.".

But before he goes he somehow manages to pass his memories on to a doctor LesleyAnne Downe. She begins to slide into hallucinatory states where she sees how and why Brosnan was killed with the dead anthropologist every step of the way in his flashbacks. For some reason some streetpunks are very interested in his house and he finds that they have built a shrine to a murder in his garage. He begins to track them and study their behavior and how they live. It's not very long at all before he not only realizes that these people are no human beings but also becomes the hunted as they begin to terrorize him. Then the doctor finds that the mysterious mystical demons known as nomads want her next. Some parts are extremely creepy like the sequence with the nuns. Man that was eerie.

I was just surprised it's a McTiernan movie I hadn't heard of.I wasn't completely convinced at first and thought that it was 2 euros flushed down the toilet. The story picks up quite slow and the beginning is executed in a style I wasn't very fond of. Brosnan portraying a frenchman was a bit annoying too. But after 30 minutes or so I was pretty hooked to see how the movie would eventually unfold.Even tho it turned out to be ok it's got a lot of flaws. It feels as if it would've needed a lot more substance in script. The whole nomad story is pretty vague and there's not much background info on Brosnans expeditions which would've made this movie more gripping and interesting. The connection is there but to me it didn't deliver. I was left a bit confused with a lot of things. It almost goes into David Lynch territory at times which isn't a completely bad thing but you need to have that something to pull off a supernatural mystery like this. To me this wasn't such a movie even tho it may not be too far from succeeding. Something was missing from the story.I was also left wondering if the movie had worked better without the doctor lady completely concentrating on Brosnans character. The whole flashbackhallucination thing was mostly just confusing. There was some nice editing at times and it added to the tension but I still feel this movie would've worked better in a more linear fashion dropping the doctor character completely.So the initial story was interesting but the execution made it a mess. Maybe I should watch it again to appreciate the structure but at the moment I don't see myself spending another 90 minutes on it. I'll keep it in my movie library tho just in case I wan't to revisit it at some point.As a side note the movie contains one of the most brutal scenes I've witnessed on screen. It's not graphic at all and is portrayed from a distance but it comes very unexpected. It really made me feel uncomfortable.6 points for the story and originality may be a bit generous tho. Maybe it was worth the 2 euros I payed for it but not more. McTiernan continues to be a mystery of a director having made classics and my favorites Die Hard and Predator but still capable of creating an artsy movie like this and some complete garbage like Rollerball remake.".

While Brosnan does a really ridiculous French accent the acting was decent and the atmosphere was genuinely creepy.This was one of those movies that like 'Near Dark' assumes the audience has half a brain and makes them think a little. What exactly are the Nomads? It's never spelled out  it's left up to the viewer to decide. Now while this can be a good strategy it worked like a charm in 'Near Dark' sometimes you can go a little overboard.This was one of those times. While I have my own ideas as to what the Nomads were and what they did a teensy bit of explanation from DirectorWriter John McTiernan would've been useful.But overall it was a decent way to spend 90 minutes. And check out the last scene... pretty trippy.".

	schema:reviewBody "John McTiernan's directorial debut has earned seven ten star votes along with a few nines and eights as of writing this review. I find it hard to believe that Nomads can be considered brilliant or a masterpiece more than his later works like Die Hard and the underrated 13th Warrior when he had more experience under his belt. The aggregate score of five is more indicative of where this film truly belongs.We are introduced to a bloodied JeanClaude Pommier Pierce Brosnan a French anthropologist that whispers into the ear of his attending doctor LesleyAnne Down as Dr. Eileen Flax somehow transferring his last memories to her just before he dies. Soon Dr. Flax is plagued by hallucinatory flashbacks that tell the story of Pommier's last days on earth told oddly enough from a third person point of view. JeanClaude and his wife have just moved into a house in L.A. and becomes intrigued by the local ruffians that insist on congregating outside of his home. After finding graffiti scrawled upon his garage Pommier decides to pursue this group and analyze what sort of mindset drives these people to choose this kind of nomadic life. Soon Pommier becomes obsessed with observing these people prompting him to approach the nomads for an impromptu photo session. When the photos develop JeanClaude realizes that these people are anything but normal. It then becomes the task of Dr. Flax to save Pommier's wife and flee their common supernatural pursuers.Nomads sadly reflects the era it was made in when it comes to the absurdly dressed gang. They appear like glamrocker extras from a Mad Max movie. Mary Woronov bares the brunt of this as her heavy makeup and teased hair make her look like a transvestite. It's just very hard to take them as a serious threat. The Irish born Brosnan and England bred Down both constantly slip in and out of character making me wonder why they had to play a French man and an American doctor respectively. The ending is a bit of a disappointment as it seems even ghosts must respect state jurisdiction. Nomads starts with promise and tails off drastically toward the end. Not a bad movie by any stretch of the imagination just not as good as some reviewers would have you think. But don't take my word for it rent it yourself and give me your thoughts.".

And that's why I'm not going to lambaste this movie.This is an experiment that fails.It probably should have been good but this has to be one of the worst 100 directing jobs ever.It's too confusing to tell you what it's about. You won't be able to stay awake for any ten minute stretch so you will have to watch it in chunks. Plodding is the huge understatement for this movie.It's a supernatural piece about a woman who hallucinates seeing a man who has died and what occurs in the movie is something you could never possibly guess without looking at the plot synopsis in the guide. There's nothing in the movie to tell you what it is about.The mistake here is that the director tries too hard. Technically things look good. The women who occupy most of the screen time are very pretty. There is some good scenery in rare spots.Technically the dramatic suspense is text book but it isn't inspired. It simply drags and drags. And the good scenery is rare compared to the bland city scenery. Hospitals cars streets homes are dull. Making them duller with actors plying their suspense acting makes it a debacle.I don't care about the accents. The actors try and that's the problem. It's all trying. The director extends every scene to make it last forever. Roughly 90 minutes is what this runs. It should have been 8 minutes.The experiment here by the director was to suspend everything to try to make the most out of a simple movement. There was a popular poetteacher who held a Writer's meeting in Louisville named Leon Driskoll who loved that sort of boredom but it bores me to tears. Still I realize there are people like him who love boredom.".

When it soon gets to be a little more than her friends can bear she is tested by the staff for signs of what's happening while she begins to experience his life through some strange means. She begins to realizer that she is being possessed by him in order to find out his obsession with a specific roaming nomadic biker gang that's been terrorizing people for a long time until she realizes what the connection is between the two of them. Finally understanding what's going on she vows to get away from the horrifying truth and solve the mystery of the gang.The Good News There's only a few moments here that actually work. The early scenes where it's hard to determine what's going on and are based around the confusion over what's happening is actually not that bad and generates some decent moments especially with the flashing images that appear to be from one source but come from another set leaving this part feeling rather creepy and interesting. That's it all done in the first half of the film with the wild hospital scenes also coming into play as well making really enjoyable. The chases at the end are also really good with it's fun setting and only real use of putting in something with some adrenaline into it which the rest of the film sorely lacks and manages to get something out of it. The only other part in here that manages to get anything decent out of it is the single sequence where confronted inside a singularly creepylooking house by a similarly creepylooking apparition is told the truth about what's happening and then disappears off into the darkened house forcing him to chase them through the house. It's a long creepy chase that actually does a lot of good and manages to have some really tense moments. Frankly though these are all the film has going for it.The Bad News This is a thoroughly disappointing and disjointed effort. The fact that this one is so dull is one of the greatest problems with it. Nothing in here happens as it's mainly just a bunch of scenes of him running around the gang trying not all that greatly to incorporate himself amongst them which isn't exciting. Watching him walk around doing his worst at being incognito around them with some of the lamest tricks to try to hide the fact that he's spying on them is some of the lamest stuff around and offers up nothing interesting or exciting about these things. Since they're so flawed it manages to make for some really lame sequences and are just so dull that there's nothing at all so impressive about the scenes which take up nearly all the scenes in the middle of the film that there's nothing worthwhile in there. The other flaw in here has two big parts to it the film's sheer incomprehensive storyline. This one has one of the single hardest plots to figure out in the world making it nearly impossible to figure out or understand. It has something to do with an Eskimo spirit that only they believe in tormenting the professor but even that's a stretch to fully use in here it's so hard to understand. There's also the fact that it's nearly impossible to figure out if what we're seeing is even real or not. This has an ability to show the scene as being through the one person's eyes then switching it around to show that it's really about the person possessing the other one and seeing life through their eyes. It's all done in a very confusing manner and it's impossible to figure out. The inherent dullness though constitutes the biggest flaw.The Final Verdict Barely features anything worthwhile at all and those few good moments are so beaten down by the negatives that it all falls apart badly. If you want to give it a shot go ahead but keep expectations low but those who know this won't appeal to them shouldn't waste time on it.Rated R Violence Language Nudity and a mild sex scene".

Nestled so far back into the 80's that it stands as the mile marker for Pierce Brosnan's first on screen leading role it's a beautifully tense atmospherically crafted fright flick that's been lost to the hazy aeons of time. Unique in it's ambiguity this is a film bereft of bells whistles gore effects or even obviously spooky apparitions relying solely on mood to impart illusory menace that's never shoved in your face of spoon fed. Brosnan plays a French hon hon archaeologist who begins to suspect he's being followed by a group of unruly urban punks which upon further introspection could possibly be the malevolent spirits of a now extinct tribe he discovered years ago. It's a vague very weird concept but it just somehow works the presence of these grimy streetwalkers inciting palpable fear at the thought that they're not what they seem at all. Opposites are at work here by showing nothing the filmmakers tell us and make us feel everything that is unseen daring us to imagine what these mysterious beings might actually be unsettling us further by having them appear in such benign relatively speaking form. It'll frustrate many but those tuned into the film's eerie frequency will get the same chill down their spine that Brosnan perpetually walks around with harassed no end by these meanies. The actors for these things are all especially chosen as well each coached beautifully by McTiernan to act just normal enough to blend into the derelict fringes of an urban environment while giving their demeanour an unnerving esoteric aspect until they seem like a cross between mute versions of the Near Dark gypsy vampire clan and spectral coyotes. Brilliant concoction of subtle horror clammy tension and gorgeously layered atmosphere.".

It will all be over in 90 minutes anyway ...2015 update  a U.S bluray release has been advertised for August. Hoping they will give it a 5.1 sound upgrade!";

	schema:reviewBody "Nomads really shouldn't be classified as a horror film per se. I really consider it more of a Supernatural thriller since nothing horrific actually happens.The movie starts off with Pierce Brosnan who plays a French Anthropologist with the worst french accent this side of a grade school production who winds up in the emergency room ranting and raving and dies while whispering something in Lesley Anne Down's ear who plays the ER Doctor attending him. Her character going forward is pretty much used to tell his story leading up to his arrival in the ER in flashbacks as it seems his spirit or at the very least his memories have taken her over.Though somewhat enjoyablethis movie could have been a lot better than it actually was with a few retweakings. Lesley Anne Down's character was completely unnecessary and added nothing to the final story even at the end. They would have been better off just telling the story from the moment Pierce Brosnan and his wife move into the house. Also the horrible French accents used by Mr. Brosnan and Ms. Monticelli who portrays his wife are so horrible it adds an unintentional comedic flair to the film. There doesn't seem to be any real reason as to why their characters had to be French other than to have Lesley Anne Down's character utter some french words while in a delusional state perhaps to give the appearance that she's possessed? Or maybe to stretch Pierce Brosnan's acting wings since he was still doing Remington Steele at the time as was not as of yet a big movie star.However a movie that shows Pierce Brosnan in a full frontal nude scene that was completely gratuitous can't be all bad. If anything you have to give Mr. Brosnan some props for showing his junk during a time period when very few male actors would especially television stars.".

Also just try to imagine Brosnan trying to play a French guy! Brosnan is a great actor but his French accent is downright hilarious. Downe does what she can with a seriously under written role. However it was fun seeing Adam Ant and Mary Woronov as part of the tribe even though they have no dialogue. I will admit that this film had one scarewhen you find out who is riding the motorcycle at the end. Still that one scene doesn't make watching this any easier. Mostly forgottenfor good reason!".

I really have no idea what I just watched. Let me see if I can attempt to make this thing make sense for myself. Pierce Brosnan is a French anthropologist who studies nomadic tribes around the globe. He moves to California and at the film's opening we find him at a hospital. He dies there and whispers his last words to nurse Leslie Anne Down who then becomes possessed by his memories. Through flashbacks she witnesses Brosnan's last days as he tracks a modern nomadic gang through the city. However these nomads may not be human. They may be mythological spirits who have actually been tracking Brosnan all along. Sounds complicated no? Well that's not really even scratching the surface with this movie. There's a lot more going on but I'll leave it to you to answer some of the more nervewracking questions. Let's just say there's no linear narrative and the convoluted script is unapologetic. We see twist after twist after twist and hope the end is in sight soon. I must confess I was getting really restless towards the end of the film. I can say that the end image does bring some coherency to the first 90 minutes but I'm still missing a piece of the puzzle. It's not at all what I expected out of director John McTiernan Predator Die Hard. Surprisingly subtle stuff for a McTiernan film. Nomads is a film that will benefit from repeat viewings.".

	schema:reviewBody "His Dark Materials Northern Lights the original name for the book in the UK. What a poignant mysterious title for a book. The Golden Compass? Well it doesn't quite have the same impact does it? The use of the American name of the book for the film really didn't bother me at first but as early warning signs come it doesn't get much more obvious than this we should have guessed from the off that this was going to be a very different beast to the book.As a huge fan of Philip Pullman's epic trilogy I had been eagerly anticipating this film adaptation for at least a year. I had fallen in love with the books a while back not due to the fantastical elements but due to the way it introduced this fantastical parallel universe to the reader in a slow subtle familiar way and made it feel real and tangible. The books are gritty rugged and at times violent and the stories' themes are philosophical and even spiritual in a way. It grieves me to say that the film misses the point concentrating instead on the fantasy the action and the giant talking polar bears panserbjorne.The story is the same it follows the exploits of a young orphan girl Lyra who lives among scholars at Oxford's Jordan College in a world parallel to our own in which every human is joined to a physical manifestation of their soul daemon. One day Lyra hears hushed talk of an extraordinary particle which is rumoured to possess profound properties that could unite whole universes. But there are those who fear the particle and would stop at nothing to destroy it. Children are also being kidnapped left right and centre and Lyra's best friend Roger is among them. Catapulted into the heart of a desperate struggle Lyra is forced to seek aid from witches gyptians and formidable armoured bears to help her save her friends from these evil experiments.But the soul of the story is all but gone. Gone is the mystery the slow developing understanding of a person's bond with their daemon and the gentle calm introduction to each character and their entwining relationships. Granted such a complex story was always going to be difficult to adapt but surely restricting it to such a shorttime span 114 minutes to tell the story just increases that difficulty. By ripping out the very things that made the novel so spellbinding and original we're left with an ultimately quite hollow shallow and selfconscious movie which is more interested in showing off it's admittedly breathtaking special effects than telling an interesting story.The problem isn't that I've read the books. The problem is that this film is very nearly a complete disaster even as a film unto it's own right there is no character development some of the dialogue is awfully contrived and the pacing is all over the shop. Virtually everything from the book is in there in fact it's just every scene flies by at a ridiculous pace. The characters are given no time to breathe or grow and concepts such as the daemons Dust and the magesterium are explained to you via convoluted exposition rather than simply shown to you. The result is a rather detached feeling and thus you never care about any of the characters which is a crying shame considering the source from which the stories came.Oddly despite nearly being a disaster the film could have gone the other way  some of it teeters on perfection even. For one it is visual eye candy with the design departments each paying extraordinary attention to detail in their creation of Lyra's world and it is not their fault that Weitz's or New Line's vision differs so wildly from Pullman's description. Also the acting itself from almost everyone is very strong with each actor portraying the characters from the books superbly. Daniel Craig owns both scenes he's in as Lord Asriel does in the book Nicole Kidman's magnetic seductive beauty is perfect for Mrs Coulter Sam Elliott charms and delights as Lee Scoresby and Dakota Blue Richards is every bit the lovable rogue of the Lyra of the novel. Had there not been the need for her to be so pleonastic the audience might even have actually cared about her.As far as entertainment goes the whole film is actually pretty high up the scale captivating and engrossing the audience throughout who barely have time to catch a breath. It's a damn good spectacle that's for sure. It's just an utter shame how great this could have been on many levels and how as it is it's only a little better than your average family adventure film. Children from about 814 WILL love this but it doesn't have the depth or layers of say... The Lord of the Rings the comparison was always inevitable to not only entertain but to excite thrill shock scare move and even inspire viewers of all ages like it could have done.As far as summaries go you need just watch the film which is over in an instant and in fact runs very much like a summary of the book. It's worth watching for the entertainment value but you'll probably have forgotten about it by tomorrow.It sounds like a pretty scathing review but I still think the quality of the story shines through in the end and most people will find something to enjoy on some level. It is certainly unlike anything you've ever seen so very good and yet so very very unsatisfactory.Must do better.".

I would have liked to see the second movie but unfortunately there is a rumour that it may not happen which is quite a pity because I thought 'The Golden Compass' was going somewhere. It is not the best movie of its kind but I thought it was not so bad either. The special effects are good. The characters are lively. I loved the daemons. It's got quite a stellar cast but only Nicole Kidman gets enough screen time to be noticed. Gorgeous glamorous and deceitful could not picture anyone else for the part of Mrs. Coultier. I am almost sure that the rest were promised a lengthier role in the sequels. Daniel Craig only has about 15 minutes but he makes the best of it. Sam Elliot is funny. Dakota Blue Richards is a confident young actress and she carries off Lyra well. Overall I enjoyed the world that was created in this movie and the characters. Too bad that it's left incomplete.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Golden Compass in my eyes was the must see film of this Christmas. I am a huge fan of the His Dark Materials books and was reading all three in preparation for the movie to come I was praying this would be the new fantasy epic to watch. I suppose I got myself way too hyped for this movie even the slightly negative reviews didn't stop me from being excited so what a shame to say this cannot help but be a disappointment for me. I have a few major problems with this mainly mainly I suppose because of the changes from the book in fact had I have not read the book I most probably would have completely adored the movie rather than have just liked it. The Golden Compass is not a bad movie its definitely better than the first Narnia movie and Harry Potter movie but after reading the book I couldn't help but criticise because I know how amazing this movie could have been. Thankfuly the entire cast yes the entire cast are absolutely perfect there are two notable set pieces and the storyline still keeps its grip on the audience despite being rushed. The lack of the ending from the book actually didn't even bother me that much so long as people who have read the book are aware its going to be in the second movie then I believe that they won't be that bothered. Overall Golden Compass is an entertaining two hours that could benefit from another half hour. Its a great film to watch for Christmas and will hopefully do well at the box office so the Subtle Knife is made very soon.The biggest surprise of the cast definitely comes from Dakota Blue Richards as the lead Lyra. In the trailers I actually thought that Lyra looked terrible her voice sounded monotone and the girl showed no expression. Thankfuly in the movie that is far from the truth. Richards pulls off the character of Lyra perfectly she's cheeky at times rude but alway likable and definitely well acted. Her cockney accent surprisingly works and never gets too irritating although at first it takes some adjusting too and her emotions throughout the film are very well displayed. She carries the entire movie very well and it will be great to see her return in the future films as I know how much dramatic stuff she will have to do. But its Nicole Kidman who practically runs over the hills with this movie. Mrs Coulter was always my favourite character in the movie and Kidman delivers an icy turn as the villainess. Kidman makes her multilayered and highly memorable her best scenes definitely being towards the end. Daniel Craig unfortunately features very little but he delivers a great performance. Eva Green is superb as Serafine Pekkala but once again features way too little for my liking. The other two superb characters and my joint second favourite performances come from Ian Mckellen doing the voice of Iorek and Sam Eliott who is perfectly cast as Lee Scoresby.However despite the incredible performances its the cruel way things have been changed or cut that made me incapable of ever giving this higher than a 710. I will never understand to this day why the polar bear fight was changed from near the end to the middle and why the Bolvangar scenes are so unnecessarily rushed its almost cruel. Also changing certain characters and changing certain facts just infuriated me all the more! But the ultimate problem with the movie is the fact it is way too rushed. Occasionally it is a blessing to get a two hour movie rather than a bloated two and a half hour once but this story requires all the time it can get and with events just taking up mere seconds and events being cut out fans of the book will hate The Cocktail Party not being in the film makes the film feel too short and missing something. Thankfuly the bear fight is as incredible as I hoped for it ends in very cool way and the final battle at Bolvangar while way too short is definitely well done. The movie also packs an emotional punch at times the intercision scenes are pitch perfect and the ending is amazing in my eyes in terms of emotion. The effects of the daemons are very well done and the daemons themselves are pretty cool most namely Mrs Coulter's golden monkey which will terrify kids for a while.The Golden Compass is hardly the new Lord of the Rings as many including me admittedly had hoped for but thankfully it looks much more promising than the Narnia series and perhaps with a new director and less editing this series could really take off. But for now I just need to get over my slight disappointment of it. Still very much worth watching though.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was so extremely excited for this movie I had just read the books and truly could not wait to see how it translated to the screen having such a vivid and vibrant plot. My excitement was short lived however when this butchered movie began to roll. The largest flaw was that of character development. The whole beginning of the book truly creates Lyras character and her supporting characters such as Roger Lord Asriel Master of Jordan and so forth this instead was replaced with a few minutes of monologue and if you happened to sneeze you would miss the explanation of daemons which is integral to the plot they could have included the catacomb exploration to explain that but alas they clipped that as well. And what about Lord Asriels visit why change who tried to poison him? and what happened to the trepanned head of Stanislaus Grumman? This was a powerful scene in the book but it became a 2 minute meeting on screen. Also I don't know about you but I pictured Lord Asriel as this big powerful looking man that commanded a room not quite Daniel Craig.So she leaves with Mrs. Coulter and again a rushed relationship which never develops as it does in the book. No visit to the Royal Artic Institute no fitting for arctic clothing where did it all go and then the escape which was perfect in the book became a very short scene that was completely different.The Gyptians. This was a HUGE part of the book especially her relationships with them all of it was axed. Once she arrives at the Gyptian city there is a ton of character development between Lyra and John Faa Farder Coram Ma Costa none of this was included in fact what took weeks in the book was dwindled down to a short conversation immediately upon Lyras arrival. What happened to finding out that Ma Costa nursed her as a child? or finding out from John Faa that Lord Asriel and Mrs. Coulter were her parents and why she ended up at Jordan College? We leave this part in the movie not knowing why the Gyptians want to help why they agree to take her along no town vote or attack plan in the book she is taken under Farder Corams wing for weeks.From here it is a rush job to a cut off ending. Her relationship with Iorek is cut she all of a sudden has a strong relationship with him? The boy who was cut was not Billy Costa why change that and the boy ends up dying. The Samoyans bring her to Bolvangar and all the events leading to her escape were cut out. The movie brings us to the Ice Bears directly and although things were cut the bear fight was done pretty well but there was no build up so it was not as intense as it should have been no pinnacle. Even Ioreks background was changed he was outcast for killing another bear. The final fight scene after the children's escape was also anticlimactic due to the lack of build up and tension you almost didn't care.Now I understand they were making way for the next movie but cutting out the entire ending??? The movie left you with nothing resolved Lord Asriel was in it for 2 minutes. I only hope Philip Pullman does not sell his soul on The Subtle Knife because he was royally abused on this one.".

	schema:headline " The blame starts with Chris Weitz and goes north.";
	schema:reviewBody "The opening scene was the very first clue that this film was going to be the barrage of formula drudgery that it ultimately turned out to be. Weitz began by unveiling all the information which the reader isn't even aware of by the end of the first novel in a horrific attempt to follow the footsteps of The Lord of the Rings with an opening prelude. Much of the intrigue of Pullman's storytelling is derived from the careful progression of revealed information letting the reader know only as much as it needs to at any moment and no more. The mystery is not only lost it is purposely banished by the blundering slate of exposition which begins with the prologue and carrys on through the film's duration. Every bit of exposition has the feel of a technical bother that must be gotten out of the way so that the action scenes can make some kind of sense. But the real kicker is the obviousness. The obviousness ranging from New Line's less than subtle attempt to repeat a miracle LOTR to the individual lines in the film Why am I here? What do they want? What is she going to do with me? and everything in between. Show don't tell is the first rule of third grade story writing a class these film makers clearly missed. The film makers Chris Weitz and everyone above him have absolutely no respect for their audience. Somehow they expect people to go to a film like TGC for the action sequences and great CG. They expect people can't make inferences and connect the dots unless it is entirely spelled out for them. And the really amazing thing is that in spite of spilling every possible secret of the narrative before the audience could possibly start to wonder about it the tangle of facts are hugely more confusing than the novel. This is a fumble truly. It was too big of a project for Weitz and there was way too much it would seem direction from above the director making this superb story of amazingly real characters in an amazing whimsical world nothing more than a long string of pretty CG which amounts to a fantastically muddled flop. I really have to say that the first mistake made was the same one made by Walden Media with the Chronicles on Narnia making a children's film out of something that wasn't childmaterial. His Dark Materials are not for children Narnia wasn't either. They fit into a genre of literature clearly not understood by Newline Walden and film studios like them Novels. Just because the main characters are children people readily assume they are children's stories but Pullman's work more so even than Narnia is written with an intelligent imaginative but somewhat cynical audience in mind. Sure their isn't graphic sex and foul swearing but the themes addressed in his books are not of a preteen nature in the least. The main character in the Sixth Sense is a preteen but no one would assume the bulk of the audience would be ten year olds. Somehow in the fantasy realm studios have seen giant dollar signs over the heads of young children and grasped for material with a previously established audience that appeals to this demographic. What they forgot about Lord of the Rings is that it was directed by a genius a genius who cared about both the source material and making as good a film as possible someone who actually understood the language of film something that cannot be said for Weitz or anyone above him responsible for this film. Jackson was a dark film maker his previous films Brain Dead Heavenly Creatures and The Frighteners preparing him to deal very appropriately with the material of the Lord of the Rings. Material which while far denser than Narnia or Compass material was no more deserving of a serious handling and of caring talented hands.The question I have to ask is do the people responsible realize what they have done wrong and if they do do they care? My guess is they will begin to care when TGC loses money and perhaps they will begin to understand that audiences don't want a bunch of CG action sequences or pretty costumes. Audiences for every genre and category want a good story well told with characters that they care about and mystery they can feel. Maybe the next time they spend 180 million dollars they will ponder this and maybe then we will see something worthwhile. Until then we can expect nothing more than a steady stream of NarniaCompassEregonEtc. drivle from the studio machine.".

The actors did a great job with what they had and what they had is what ruined the movie. The script was rough at best with randomly thrown together scenes that were leading towards an Aha! moment that never came. The whole movie kept building and the plot kept thickening. However in the end we are left with a sub par battle and more questions than when the movie started.It seems as if the sole purpose for this movie was to be the directors vehicle for a sequel as the end comes at a point in the story which traditionally would be the arc of the plot however we end up getting rolling credits in place of explanation. If there is one thing that I did actually enjoy in this movie I will say once again the animation was superb the ice bears were magnificent and the actors were good but not even those could save this movie. Unless you have the mental capacity of a young child this film will seem like a huge waste of your time and your dollars once the credits roll and you as I will end up walking out unfulfilled and ultimately let down.".

	schema:headline " Chris Weitz should be Intercised from the rest of the series";
	schema:reviewBody "Now a review from someone who just finished the book a second time last Friday...First of all the actors were not convincing. Not one time did I feel like any of the characters really knew what they were talking about. They were throwing the term Dust Intercision and the phrase It's just a little cut! around without any meaning. Almost like someone told Chris Weitz Hey look this term Dust...that sounds cool! Make sure you use that as much as possible! I was waiting for the band Kansas to kick into the soundtrack at any moment.The meanings in the novel are slowly revealed during the course of the book were part of the discovery and suspense. Lyra had no idea what they meant until later in the book. They explain them during the first 15 minutes of the film and they suddenly become arbitrary and overused. No mystery no sense of menace that the novel had...Also the dialog was overly expository. People saying things along the lines of I must tell you this because something related to it comes up later in the story so even though its out of character for me the audience must know what's going on. Case in point when Mrs. Coulter explains about how the King of the bears wants to be human to Lyra at the beginning of the movie for no apparent reason at all. Everything else was so glaringly obvious that it wasn't for Lyra's benefit but for the benefit of the audience. It's lazy writing. Rather than maybe flesh out that part of the story where Lyra learns about it on her own some character just decides to randomly blurt it out. Even worse none of this dialog really tells the audience anything because it's too fast and doesn't say enough. Then there is this whole If your Daemon gets strangled you're getting strangled thing. When a Daemon gets hurt in the book the hurt the person has is a very emotional one. It's like your heart literally being broken...an overwhelming sadness as if you're most dearest friend is literally being torn apart from you permanently...a sense of loss. So if someone is slapping your daemon around you're not going to feel a slap in the face. Mrs. Coulter is seen belting her own Daemon across the face and using their logic makes no sense as we should at least see her flinch as if she slapped herself in the face.Related to the above issue is the fact that none of the character's relationships that they have with their Daemon is ever realized. Then this dialog came up Don't worry Billy we'll get your Daemon back. At that point I knew the screenwriter just didn't understand this novel. The whole point is people taking the souls from children is a permanent horrible thing. There is no getting your daemon reattached. In the novel it's a heart wrenching emotional sucking worstthingthatcouldpossiblyhappen to you experience. In the movie they're just like..oh well it happens. We'll fix it. How ignorant can a screenwriter be?The kid who really lost his Daemon in the book was Tony Markios in a very sad part of the book where he's holding onto a dead fish because it's all he has left while asking Have you seen ratter? in a very zombielike state. He eventually dies because of it. A very haunting part of the book that has absolutely no weight in the movie. The haunted city where the boy was found in the novel was replaced by this little shed out in the middle of nowhere. A person without their Daemon is also very repulsive to the people in this world. A lot of them kinda kept their distance from Tony at first almost like they were disgusted until someone yells at them to help the kid.They also took out the scenes that showed how they tricked the children into coming with them. Without that there really was no feeling that children were being taken. It was just said in an offthecuff sort of way. No scene with the children outsmarting their dimwit captors with Lyra's help either. In other words The Gobblers is just another cool term that Chris felt he should use that seems to have no meaning in the movie....glossing over the whole Oblation Board while he was at it.The story itself was rushed. We meet Lyra and 10 minutes later she's already been with Mrs. Coulter and is on the boat with the Gyptians. They yanked out a lot of necessary character and story building aspects that really needed to be in there. Showing the Gyptians as just this sort of ragtag group when there were meetings and planning in the book that showed just how well organized they were...and how much they loved their children. Grumman's head...the whole You can't trick a bear conversation. Too much of the soul of the story was left out.I know the argument that they cant put EVERYTHING from the novel into the movie but you can at least try to keep the spirit of the novel in the movie and not change the novel's meaning. If you cant explain why a character is the way he is then at least let the actor keep that as a motivation and let it be conveyed in the acting. A 5 minute conversation with Iroek and Lyra to help build their relationship isn't asking too much. The Golden Compass is a dumbeddown picturebook version of the novel with simple characterizations of the people in the novel. Its a bunch of characters going through actions who don't seem to have any motivation or reason for what they are doing and the only reason why they are doing what they are doing is because a script tells them to.".

Five minutes later I was glad it wasn't me that paid for the cinema tickets! Despite the impressive cast the acting was wooden and lack luster. The characters which were so full of life and attitude in the book were flattened to one dimensional props. Make way for the fantastic CGI? Nope. Nowhere near the standard required with cartoonish caricature faces for the daemons and far too much reliance on swirling gold dust.Now looking at my watch I see there's only a couple of minutes of the film left. I think How on earth are they going to fit in... And as the credits roll I understand. They're not going to put in the ending of the book. Much better to leave the film on some attempt at a cliffhanger to try and pull the punters in for the next movie  possibly to be called The Shiny Silver Cutting Thing?. I for one will be going to see it but only to poke fun at it.".

	schema:reviewBody "An evil empire called the Magestirium attempts total control of the population by hiding the secrets or parallel universes and a unifying particle called Dust in Chris Weitz's clunky but entertaining adaptation of Philip Pullman's The Golden Compass.Harry Potter and The Lord of the Rings have never apologized about their overt paganism. Likewise The Chronicles of Narnia have never been accused of being subtle as a Christian allegory. These series in both literary and film forms have been monster hits due to their unapologetic natures that speak truths to their ardent fan bases. British writer Philip Pullman's darkly subversive antireligious fantasy books have also been hugely successful more so overseas than here in the States. Stripped of the books' overt atheistic messages The Golden Compass takes a reverse psychology approach in its film treatment and oddly positions itself as an apology for Pullman's work. The result is a tepid affair that joins a long line of fantasy films about children discovering they are the chosen ones destined to save the world. At least this film is refreshing in its stance on girlpower as represented in the main character Lyra played wonderfully by newcomer Dakota Blue Richards who apparently is a graduate of the Dakota Fanning school of acting. Whether or not this tactic to strip the film of its soul much like the Magesiterium strips children of their daemons will make the film broadly appealing enough to warrant a franchise has yet to be determined.The film comes across as more antiauthoritarianism in general than specifically antireligion. In the 21st century the line between authoritarian politics and organized religion has become increasingly blurred. Since we currently live in a world where a bornagain Christian sits in the White House and wages wars in Muslim nations it's easy to see why folks from both sides of the aisle ardent fans of the books and conservative Christians alike have been worked up into a mindless and silly frenzy over even just a watereddown film version of the first of Pullman's His Dark Materials trilogy with one side saying it's not wickedly subversive enough and the other side saying it's still subversively wicked.However viewing the film out of the context of the books upon which it is based and the ridiculous fauxcontroversy surrounding them it makes the grade as a bigbudget fantasy flick. Yes there are too many characters to keep track of and the film has rushed feel to it as if it was edited at the last minute but it still makes for an interesting trip. Kids will be wowed by the elaborate set designs and CGI effects which are far superior to the ones in the similarly clunky but still entertaining Chronicles of Narnia and culminate in an awesome battle sequence involving armored polar bearstake that Global Warming! Adults will get a kick out the nimble ensemble cast who all seem to be having a great deal of fun with the selfseriousness of the whole production and are headlined by Nicole Kidmanbotoxed fulllipped and deliciously frosty in a creepy villain role that suits her perfectly.Possibly the strangest aspect of the film comes as an accidental subtext resulting from its apologetic nature. With its depiction of mysticalminded dogooders rallying against the totalitarian Magestirium The Golden Compass almost comes across as a period piece antiCommunist allegory rallying for the fall of the Soviet Union. It makes the film feel charmingly dated. There's also the disturbing subtext of child abuse at the hands of the Catholic Church as seen in the Magestirium's cruel experiments with kidnapped children which makes the film feel charmingly grotesque.Bottom Line Any movie that depicts Nicole Kidman walking around with a monkey and preaches the importance of free will making bonds sticking together and fighting for your friends and loved ones can't be all that bad. Despite some of the themes of the books being exorcised and arbitrarily presented by a poorly chosen Chris Weitz a director known for his comedies American Pie and About a Boy The Golden Compass still has enough interesting elements and oldfashioned razzle dazzle presented with new age CGI to make it entertaining. At its worst it presents two hours of dark fantasyland eye candy. At its best it encourages adults and children alike to use their free will to do something far better with their two hours like read.".

I had become concerned over the past months as it became increasingly clear that the film was at great risk of losing direction the vision if you will that had drawn readers to the books series in the first place. That it was doomed. I feared this strange kind of antiNarnia was likely being so diluted that BO disaster was certain. That may still be the case if the bulk of early reviews are to be believed but see Ebert's allout glowing review. Admittedly the movie probably works better if you have read the first book I had but those readers are precisely the people who would likely complain the most. I worried and yet . . .Despite its breathtaking pace both in terms of action and concept introduction  we all agree this is not your typical fantasy  the Golden Compass worked for me. I thought the people involved had done the best they could in making this movie tell the story making the best possible film despite the conflict and panic that must have gone into it. The sincerity shows. The cast is superb the action sequences the effects the sheer look of the film are triumphs. I stayed through all the credits which seemed to last for almost as long as the movie and good gracious what a lot of people worked on this! It's expensive all right but the money is all on the screen. These people should be saluted.Dakota Blue Richards it appears if you want your daughter to have a movie career these days you had best name her Dakota in a great year for the debut of young actresses stands out as the best of them. She has poise indomitable courage fierce determination and it just keeps coming. The whole movie depends on her and if she had faltered they truly would have had a disaster on their hands a calender movie with no where to go and nothing to do. Whatever the ultimate financial fate of the film I think young Miss Richards has a great future ahead of her.So I am recommending the film highly though I respect the objections that have been made against it. I think if people just relax and go with it they will find themselves enjoying it immensely. However if you grit your teeth and go into critic mode yep you guess it you won't enjoy it at all.As for myself I would have liked the producers to have gone with the original extended version  everyone knows the last few minutes were cut. Moreover with a full three hour version just like Lord of the Rings I think all the objections would have been met. A director's cut will likely appear some day and I think at that point people will realize how great this movie truly is. Such an enhanced cut would fill in a lot of the details of this world more fully develop the scenes and characters and truly give a feeling of being part of the adventure instead of just watching it. Of course for the Golden Compass series by then it may well be too late.Here's hoping it's not I dare not say praying. Here's hoping that audiences will respond so this noble beginning of a great philosophical adventure and permit it to continue.It's all bottom line at this point folks.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was so excited to see this movie. I have read all the books and absolutely love them. I think Pullman is ingenious. The material was all there for another epic fantasy film just waiting for a great director to pick it up...Unfortunately no such thing happened. I am a little confused as to why Chris Weitz director of films like American Pie and Down to Earth was allowed to director this. He was clearly the wrong choice. The movie which I did not expect to follow the book exactly due to limited time appeared to make no effort to tell Pullman's wonderful tale through images. The screenplay was poorly written and seemed to be dumbed down for a six year old yet the movie's rated PG13. There was no intrigue. It was choppy and fast paced. There was no sense of story development. Characters and scenes were switched around and a major part of the book was cut out entirely! This makes absolutely no sense to me especially since the previews for the movie allude to this part that's cut out being in it. Nope. Instead the movie stops short with a terribly corny scene and forced dialogue making no effort to hide the fact that the movie is concluding. When seeing a special premiere of this on Dec. 2 I can recall the entire audience letting out a groan as the movie ended a few viewer's even booed. Even if one had not read the books as two of my friends who saw the movie with me had not I believe they would still be utterly disappointed. From a film standpoint it was very poorly done. There was an exorbitant use of CG making the movie appear artificial. Every time Lyra went to read the alethiometer there were some special effects implying Lyra's ability to see things in her mind because of the alethiometer which is not how it happens in the book this being one of many examples. I was hoping that for a movie such as this one there would be an incredible score to help mount emotions but I was in for another disappointment. The musical score was dry flat and did nothing to enhance viewing. The one thing that I did like about the movie was the choice of Lyra. I thought Dakota Blue Richards did a wonderful job as a newcomer in a role that demanded several complex emotions. She executed the character perfectly and it's unfortunate that the movie did not match her perfection. Other cast members Eva Green Jim Carter Sam Elliot did a good job as well but did not have enough screen time to really be appreciated. As for Kidman and Craig I was not thrilled with their portrayals of Coulter and Asriel. In the end I think people who have read and appreciated the books who go see this movie will be overwhelmingly disappointed and those who have not read the books will be confused and dissatisfied as well. In comparison to films like Narnia where the director knew how to take the time to produce a work of art with effective dialogue scenery musical score mix of real and CG characters and storytelling the Golden Compass unfortunately doesn't even hold a candle.".

	schema:reviewBody "so apparently you can't give 010 stars on IMDb so let's chart my level of excitement and subsequent disappointment and anger while watching this disaster of an adaptation.opening meh. kids sparkly things CGI daemons. yeah this is about what i expected 5Jordan College OK we're starting to change some pretty important stuff and blow unnecessary cash on more CGI. Important details cropped i'm starting to worry 3Lyra with Mrs. Coulter this should have been a really easy montage sequence but instead stumbles over terrible acting Weitz's ideas about daemons and bad editing. this is getting kinda painful actually 2Lyra's escape and travel with the Gyptians disastrous pacing but possibly the first line actually taken from the book in this section. Seraphina Pekkala just seems stupid and Lyra's ability to read the alethiometer comes out of the blue without a word of explanation. really this sucks 1Trollesund and journey north Iorek was kicked out of Svalbard for losing a fight? why isn't the can'ttrickabear conversation in there? i don't even know what the hell Weitz was trying to pull with these changes this is utter crap. ughhhhhh 0Svalbard OK they're really changed the sequence here. and there's no mention of the fact that the ways of the bears has been changed by their new king. the fight between the bears is OK but the drama of not being able to trick a bear unless he's acting like a human is all gone.

Important details cropped i'm starting to worry 3Lyra with Mrs. Coulter this should have been a really easy montage sequence but instead stumbles over terrible acting Weitz's ideas about daemons and bad editing. this is getting kinda painful actually 2Lyra's escape and travel with the Gyptians disastrous pacing but possibly the first line actually taken from the book in this section. Seraphina Pekkala just seems stupid and Lyra's ability to read the alethiometer comes out of the blue without a word of explanation. really this sucks 1Trollesund and journey north Iorek was kicked out of Svalbard for losing a fight? why isn't the can'ttrickabear conversation in there? i don't even know what the hell Weitz was trying to pull with these changes this is utter crap. ughhhhhh 0Svalbard OK they're really changed the sequence here. and there's no mention of the fact that the ways of the bears has been changed by their new king. the fight between the bears is OK but the drama of not being able to trick a bear unless he's acting like a human is all gone. Iorek tears off Ragnar's jaw and rips out his throat. just to make sure we realize this ain't no damn kids movie! 0Bolvangar out of sequence crap and Lyra ends up at Bolvangar. worst editing ever no set up no discussion about what intercision is really no metal blade did he read the subtle knife?!?! no saving the daemons... i just don't understand what the hell stronger words would be used if IMDb allowed is going on. and did he just have Nicole Kidman faint as a cop out? is it the 1950's?!?!

	schema:reviewBody "I watched the film expecting the worst and I was surprised. The film opens in cinematic fashion with a voiceover by Eva Green explaining dust and parallel worlds. I think it was digestible for anyone who is a nonfamiliar. Next we move into our own world the true Oxford of London. Then in a seamless and beautiful effect a wave of light shimmers across the screen and we enter Lyra's Oxford like something out of Doctor Who. It's a visually stunning opening that suggests great things lie ahead. Next we are thrown into a wild children romp like something out of Lord of the Flies with Lyra Roger and pals against the Gyptian kids. And here enters the star of this movie  Dakota Blue Richards. From the start to the end she perfectly embodies all the cheek all the inquisitiveness all the curiosity all the fight all the courage and all the heart of Lyra. I think she is the heart of the movie and the best thing in it. In the Oxford section of the story is some of the best scenes in the movie. No big action sequences just intimate moments between the characters. Lyra and Rogers respect for each other is made abundantly clear. Daniel Craig is on superior form as he presents his findings at Jordan college. And Mrs Coulters entrance and icy exchange with the Master sent chills down my spine. Kidman delivers the line Let me deal with Asriel with such unbelievable venom. Nicole Kidman has been burdened by a few flops recently. I can report the iconic actress is back where she belongs. She is sinister and stunningly beautiful in equal measure. I thought the movie was going down a path of perfection right up until Lyra's escape scene. This is where the story starts moving very quickly. To illustrate my point Lyra runs away gets attacked is saved by the Gyptians asks the Gyptians to take her North and its all aboard the ship in about the space of 15 minutes. This is all very exciting and full of adrenaline but as a book fan i don't understand why they are in such a hurry. The movie continues to move along at a quick pace barely giving you time to breath. Its really a good thing and a bad thing. You could say it's a good thing because as a result it holds your interest. However non book readers would be easily lost if they decide on a 2 minute toilet break. I'm a fan of thrillers so I like frantic and quick paced however in the case of this movie it would have been nice if they had just slowed things down now and again because like the Oxford scenes proved intimacy between characters is Weitz strong suit. I also thought there where scenes missing like it was filmed to be longer but either by Weitz hand or by New Lines some scenes where lost. One such scene is Lyra crossing the Ice Bridge. People who have read the book will know that Lyra crosses the bridge in pursuit of Lord Asriel and Roger. In the film this bridge now leads to Bolvanger. But it was evident to me that when they filmed the scene it was still leading to Lord Asriel and was intended as a farewell scene to Iorek. Overall the scene I loved the most was the Bear Fight. Though I had one complaint. While the animation of Iorek and Ragnar is astounding unfortunately a few of the surrounding bears who watch the fight appear to have been rushed and not given the same time as Iorek and Ragnar. Though most of the time your attention will be focused on the fight. All the Oxford scenes are pure perfection the scene of Lyra riding Iorek and finding the severed form of Billy Costa is brief but chillingly effective the battle at Bolvanger which is suitably brutal and action packed and the final scene. While I still missed the books climax the movies end is still satisfying. On board Scoresby's balloon we are treated to a heart wrenching scene between Lyra and Roger. Roger exclaims with all his sincerity that he would travel to the ends of the world with Lyra and Lyra says just let them try and stop us. Book familiars will know why this is heart wrenching because we all know Rogers fate. The films conclusion worked because the reunion of Lyra and Roger was emotionally satisfying but I think the books climax would have lifted it to greater strenghts. What I didn't like it was too short Kidman and Craig don't really get enough screen time Mckellens voice rushed at times evidently missing scenes and the Magesterium just isn't sinister enough. Its a fantastic fantasy adventure that will be enjoyed by most. Its just aggravating knowing that it could have been even better. I also think it is infinitely better than both Narnia and Potters first cinema outings. How  Well the Daemons are so much more full of life than the talking creatures of Narnia. If you have a good eye you will notice that the Daemons are rarely ever static or simply shot fillers in a scene. They are alive. The original material of the book is much better realised and visualised than Potter. But they are not the most important reasons. For me it is the young leads that makes the difference. The Potter trio were not great and the Narnia kids were agonising. But Dakota Blue Richards Is excellent. She is the heart and soul of it.FINAL VERDICT A hugely enjoyable entertaining movieastounding visual effects perfect performances and action packed. If it had been 30 minutes longer book ending kept  more screen time for Kidman and Craig and less meddling from New Line it would have been a masterpiece!!45 810".

I wasn't sure what I was getting into as there seems to be a rather large glut of Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings wannabes crowding theaters now and in the near future. This version of the Golden Compass beautifully brings the books to life and was very pleasing to watch with rather nice visuals. The acting is quite good especially from the young lead and the animation makes one wonder what they can't do with computers these days. The only true complaint I have about this movie is that it is difficult to understand and follow if one is not familiar with the books. Some scenes at the beginning seems disconnected but after the halfway point the story comes together. The Golden Compass series is rather dark in its nature and I'm glad that the movie didn't pull any punches with the supernatural combat which is awesome specifically when the witches and bears do battle. Some liberty is taken with the story as expected and many church references are renamed but the quality of the story never suffers. I recommend the movie and I look forward to seeing the rest of the trilogy completed.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I first heard that The Golden Compass was going to be made into a movie I had very low expectations. At first I thought Daniel Craig and Nicole Kidman were very poor choices for the roles of Lord Asriel and Marisa Coulter. However as the hype started to build about the movie I became more and more convinced of their ability to do justice to those characters.I went to see the sneak preview of the movie on December 1st and was extremely disappointed. How a director can take a novel that is so brilliantly subversive complex and daring and turn it into such a watereddown piece of drivel is beyond me. Chris Weitz the director said that he thought the focus of the novel is Lyra's relationship with Iorek Byrnison an armored bear. His perspective is apparent in the sense that Iorek's ferocity in the book is transformed into an almost paternal overly sensitive figure. Weitz leaves out the concept that you cannot trick a bear as it is presented in the book therefore leaving the scene where Iorek and Iofur Raknison Ragnar fight to be completely meaningless. It does not translate that the bears are equally matched and the only reason Iorek prevails is because Iofur is trying to be a human. Omitting the idea that bears cannot be tricked also muddles the reason why the townspeople of Trollesund are able to steal Iorek's armor in the first place. This makes the bears seem flawed and foolishnot the courageous aloof figures they are in the books. Finally the movie claims that Iorek was banished because he was the bear prince and lost in the battle to be kinga huge difference from the book. All of these changes and omissions soften Iorek's ferocity therefore making him seem more sensitive in his relationship with Lyra. In the books it is extremely apparent that the two love each other but not necessarily in the tender emotive way that is presented in the movie.It almost goes without my saying it but it is very clear that the movie was trying to evade as much wrath as possible from the Catholic church. The religious elements and the corruption of the Magisterium are very downplayed as well as the actual significance of Dust as original sin from the Magisterium's perspective.The worst part of this movie BY FAR is the ending. The end of the book presents an extremely emotional plot twist with its own cliffhanger. The movie however stops short of the pivotal scene where Lyra brings Roger to Lord Asriel and instead ends on an optimistic notethat Lyra will be reunited with her father and will help him bridge the gap between worlds. Weitz ignores the emotional complexity of the final interaction between Asriel and Mrs. Coulter and instead offers a dull blissfully ignorant ending that ultimately is an injustice to the book.There are several other nitpicky things that this movie got wrong that I haven't the space to explain among them Billy Costa's assumption of Tony Makarios's role in the story which completely changes the Gyptians involvement in the war as well as Mrs. Coulter's revelation to Lyra that she and Asriel are Lyra's parents. I will say that all of the actors were well suited for their roles especially Sam Elliott as Lee Scoresbythe problem was that the actors had to fill watered down versions of the characters in the books. This movie was so disappointing I am extremely skeptical that there will be any way to redeem it in The Subtle Knife and The Amber Spyglass.".

	schema:reviewBody "It gets 1 for the visuals alone. Yes it looks pretty but pretty alone isn't enough to carry a story this complicated.We get the tiny explanation at the start which is practically useless. This film was made for those who have read the book which I haven't. I found the film incredibly inaccessible to me.It's too long winded far too self important and self indulgent. It requires a narrator and I found myself getting bored after less than 30 minutes less than 13 of the way through. The film didn't hold my attention very well it'd struggle to find an audience amongst children I'm unsure who the target demographic actually are and I frequently found my attention waning.I didn't care about any of the characters or the plot at all the film was that interesting ie not at all. I won't try to explain the plot as I didn't really understand much of it other than to say it seems to follow the voyage of a girl and people trying to discover a path from their realm into alternate realities  others trying to stop them doing that.None of the characters were compelling enough to pique my interest likewise the animal companions. They might be the ohah factor for kids but they had no substance and their shape changing abilities weren't explained neither was why they were with the people they were with.All the locations and characters seem to be very tenuously linked together and are very much a mishmash of ideas that don't quite fit or work or ring true. The book itself must seem like someone took 10 different fantasy books cut all the pages out threw them in the air and picked random pages up and glued those together calling it their book. A hotchpotch. But botched.I can see this boring most of the people who go to watch it with their expectations from the trailer being dashed. Parents taking kids might find they have to leave before 40 minutes have passed they won't be able to pay attention to it.Far too complex for it's own good. It's like trying to watch Dune for the 1st time or Blade Runner without the voice over for the 1st time. But not as interesting.Wait for the DVD release. You won't get a refund if your kids are bored by the film at the cinema. I'd recommend Stardust. It's a better film  easier to watch.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Golden Compass was one of the most anticipated films of the year. With a budget well north of 150 million and a best seller as source material expectations were high.

	schema:reviewBody "I went in cynical about this especially after the travesty that was the Narnia film but i was quickly converted it's great fun. A really entertaining and immersive film that intelligently builds a fantastical world that the uninitiated can marvel and thrill in. I have to say i haven't read the books so can't comment on a book to film comparison.On the cast I don't know how it works in the book but the adults are barely in this. Nicole has the most significant work and Sam Elliott while a late arrival is a great presence once he's around. However Daniel Craig and Eva Green are barely in it and Christopher Lee has one blinkandyou'll miss him scene. That said the casting is excellent. Green is suitably witchy and Craig makes an impact in his onetwo dialogue scenes early on which along with a couple of wordless inserts of his storyline put him enough into your mind to wonder about him. He feels set up for a more significant role in future instalments. Elliott is great. That sonorous voice sneaking out from underneath that bushy moustache feels exactly right for Lee Scorsby.Kidman is perfect. There's something indelibly creepy about her rigid manner that works for the elegant but sinister Mrs Coulter. Meanwhile Simon McBurney is magnificently slimy and loathsome as the magisterium main face. You know he's a villain from the moment he enters frame.Dakota Blue Richards is a great find as Lara. While the first two Potter films and Lion the Witch  the Wardrobe were significantly hampered by the incredibly mannered unrealistic wooden acting of the young leads most of the Potter cast got better time will tell on Narnia Richards is a winner from the outset. Precocious and feisty without seeming too forced she is generally believable whether is her rebellion or her loyalty. This is just as well as the film is really entirely on her shoulders. It will work or not for people based on whether you like her. She's in virtually every scene and has a lot of different emotions to get across as well as having to have significant interaction with CGI creations like her spirit animal Pan the ubiquitous Freddie Highmore and the polar bear played by Ian McKellen. She has a couple of slightly actorly moments but does incredibly well for a first timer under this kind of pressure.Of the voiceonly cast McKellen is a perfect choice for the honourable polar bear while Highmore is either getting less annoying or it's just beneficial not being able to see him as he is nicely understated as Pan. My only note on this casting would be once or twice I couldn't tell is Lyra or Pan was speaking in their interaction as in quiet moments Highmore and Richards' voices are remarkably similar!The effects are good but not great. I had worried they'd be as weak as Narnia and they aren't. The world is beautifully created and always feels real whether Scorsby's flying ship or the blimp thing from the trailer or stunning Arctic landscapes and big cities. The smaller creatures are also brilliantly rendered Pan in particular. Some of the bigger creatures are less perfect. The polar bears have a cartoony unreal feel but in a fantasy setting with battle armour and stuff they work well enough. Certainly better than Aslan in Narnia. However the leopard creature with Daniel Craig doesn't look right at all.As for the film itself it really zips along quickly. The uninitiated like me may occasionally lose track of what's going on early on as strange terms and names are thrown back and forth but it soon settles down and makes sense. Rather than frustrating me that I might be missing key elements of what this world was about I felt happy going with it and was left thinking I'll watch it again when it's released just to be sure I didn't miss anything. It's a relief to see a fantasy film that brings it in at almost exactly two hours and has a cracking momentum as opposed to the seemingly endless drag of Lord of the Rings Harry Potter and Narnia. Don't get me wrong taking time can work. I really liked Fellowship of the Ring but the pace of the Potters really tests my patience. Golden Compass moves so fast before you know it it's over and it leaves you wanting more. Indeed at the end of this film I could say it had succeeded in doing something the Potter franchise has never done it left me desperate to see the next one.However what really made me like this film more than those others is the tone and some of the things they do in it. There are moments in this that i won't spoil for those like me who didn't know the plot that really surprised me that they'd do in a family film.A big fight scene between polar bears and the end battle are suitably exciting and i found myself really invested. I cared about the characters. Whereas in Narnia they hadn't done enough to make you care about Aslan's fate criminal given how effectively the book and the 80s BBC TV serial managed it this really has you on the edge of your seat for the good guys.Overall I really liked Golden Compass and would give it an 810  compared to LOTR 1010 910 710 for the series Potter 510 610 810 710 710 for the series and Narnia 410. I will be watching this again when it comes out something I never did for Potter or Narnia and am looking forward to the next instalment. I hope Daniel Craig and Eva Green get bigger roles in the next film but all round a great start to a potential franchise that I had middling hopes for.".

	schema:reviewBody "All the elements of a 10 star movie are obviously prevalent here but they don't all get put into play.I don't understand why New Line advertised this as the next Lord Of The Rings epic when they gave that movie close to three hours of film time and this only two! ? Another half hour at least of this movie would have done it more justice because it felt extremely rushed. It seemed like they were throwing information out at you too quick to fully grasp and never letting the cast just immerse themselves in it.The music here was nothing short of ordinary. I don't remember a single song from the movie save the gyption theme. I honestly think the music could have been 100 times better and bring more immersion in.However I believed the cast was great. It is truly great that Lyra portrayed by Dakota Blue Richards now has a face. They picked someone with the look and talent to really shine. Lord Asriel portrayed by Daniel Craig and Ms. Coulter portrayed by Nicole Kidman were played fantastically. Although Daniel Craig fans will be disappointed. He only has a 15 minute cameo. Lee Scoresby portrayed by Sam Elliot was great. It seems they intended him for a bit of comic relief but I just had hoped they gave him more time to show it off due to the nonstop drama sequences.The scenery was amazing and very believable. The daemons magic witches are all very well done and very beautiful.I see this movie as a financial failure. You have to look at this from a critical view the new comers. The people the movie is trying to grab. I brought ten people to the advanced screening December 1st four of which had read the books myself included. They and myself had said that the plot was too rushed. The six that had not read them either said it was too confusing and ending up requiring explanations or said it was too boring because they didn't take the time to flesh out the characters. Coincidentally one of them got too frustrated with it and bored and walked out.Fanaticly I really like this movie but it is real rushed however I tried looking at this movie with a newcomer view. Reality wise people walking in who aren't loyal fanatics are probably going to be very disappointed. Unfortunately the list of loyal fanatics isn't going to be enough to make this movie a success. At any rate this is definitely no Lord Of The Rings... It's just another flick to watch on a rainy afternoon.".

	schema:reviewBody "It is obvious from the very beginning that New Line interfered with the overall formula of the story. The bookmovie puzzle is nearly complete but a few pieces are still missing... And NO it does NOT promote atheism for the LAST time!First off it opens up in our world with Eva Green giving a brief description of Dust and other worlds. It's useful especially for nonfans. Then transitions into Lyra's Oxford. The beginning has some of the most memorable scenes if not best scenes of the film. My reasoning is not because of action but of the pure heart of it. Sure it strays some from the book but bookmovie translations have never been perfect just ask a potter fan. The first hour is basic character development and wraps you completely into the world of Lyra's Oxford. The movie does this effectively and the daemons are so full of life it's like their real! Don't get me wrong the Alist actors are great despite short screen time but the daemons steal the show. Not just the daemons but the animals as well. Iorek for example is one of the most proud strong characters i've ever seen. It fits the book's vision of him perfectly if not better. Now more to the plot of the film Lyra leaves for the North with the beautifully malevolent Mrs. Coulter after Roger disappears and escapes after finding her to be the leader of the Gobblers. Yes Gobblers in the trailer Lyra said 'magisterium' rest assured it's gobblers in the film. also it's 'alethiometer' in the film. You fans can let the weight off your shoulders. After leaving Mrs. Coulter she is attacked then saved by the gyptians. She pleads with them to go north to save the kids at bolvangar and winds up on the boat all within a short screen time. It seemed fastpaced but not so much as to seem rushed. In the book it was fastpaced as well and it was properly transitioned. When she finally reaches the north she hires the panserbjorne or armoured bear Iorek Byrnison in some of the most visually satisfying scenes of the film. As I said Iorek was crafted wonderfully and the voice actor did an excellent job of capturing his power. In the next half hour Lyra's at bolvangar after crossing the bridge they have the battle there save the kids yadda yadda. soon she's with Iorek after tricking Ragnar not Iofur and the two bears fight in another visually satisfying scene. The movie soon ends with her and roger being reunited in an emotional finale. Yes the last three chapters were cut out but it didn't take away from the movie. The good news is that we'll see those cut scenes in the Subtle Knife because its confirmed they've started filming. Because they've invested so much they can't possibly not do a follow up. The Good Satisfying visually mentally metaphysically whatever that means follows the book pretty well. Actors are great world is full of life. Lyra's the heart of most scenes. Overreacting religious groups will have nothing too complain about with this movie. it's relatively clean. Guess they'll have to boycott I Am Legend instead for it's postapocalyptic views....The Bad Does seem a bit rushed at points could've slowed down during the fast paced latter half of the movie. Magisterium wasn't dark enough. A few backgrounds feel generic. Obviously some beloved scenes in the book didn't make the final cut who knew??? Overall the best fantasy film making around it looks like New Line has another hit on its shoulders. Definitely worth a watch.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm not a fan of the books but I have read them.The story follows Lyra an orphan girl caught up in a plot between the religious ruling class and Lord Asriel a free spirited adventurer who wants to free mankind from the tyranny they currently live under.Chris Weitz should be whipped through the streets of America for the poor work put into this film. After that he should be locked in a cage with a real hungry polar bear. The plot has been dumbed down and looks to be designed by committee. Several people have clearly read the book and picked scenes they think should be in the movie and dumped the rest in the bin. While the book was an epic this 'lite' version just seems too short. It isn't exactly like the film's too long. At just 113 minutes there was at least another 30 minutes before it'd be uncomfortably long. The quick pace should have given the story spring but with the characters seemingly just jumping around the globe with no real good explanation it doesn't feel right.Daniel Craig as Lord Asriel is probably the best thing in the film all twenty minutes he's on screen. Dakota Blue Richards as Lyra is an amazing find and clearly has a great future in front of her in movies. Sadly she could have done with a better starting point. Kidman as Marisa Coulter is stunningly beautiful but as the main villain doesn't quite have the sinister punch needed.CGI was obviously the only way to create the daemons the persons soul manifested as an animal companion and this works well. The scenery and brilliant cinematography save this from being one of the few 110 movies I've rated on here.To sum up a shockingly poor effort at what should have been the building block for a great franchise. With any luck New Line will find a new director for the next part.".

After that he should be locked in a cage with a real hungry polar bear. The plot has been dumbed down and looks to be designed by committee.

	schema:reviewBody "I am about 2 thirds of the way through the book when I decided to go to the limited engagement sneak preview of The Golden Compass. I feel that the film exceeded my expectations regardless of the structure change made by the film adaptation.The story was changed moderately but not too much to take away from the mood of the book and was in no way detrimental to the flow of the story. Otherwise this movie was a rollercoaster ride from beginning to end! The effects exceeded my expectations. The flow of the daemons in the film was almost completely convincing however there were times when the speech of the animals had that typical computer animated falseness that you see in the cg cartoons. Other than some minor CG blemishes the realism is some of the most convincing I have seen! The polar bear is completely lifelike and the animal morphing I felt was simply spectacular.The flow of the film is very fast which is a negative and a positive. While it really leaves us guessing or feeling unfulfilled in some of the crucial story elements it also sets the pace for an exhilarating fastpaced adventure story that keeps you on the edge! The broad range of characters prevents the film from truly developing the characters that we really WANT to know. Since the book is a 3 part series hopefully these characters will develop further in the next 2 films.I must say that there were several parts in this film that surprised me considering this is marketed as a family film. This is a dark film. This could frighten some small kids. I feel this film definitely belongs in the pg13 rating and might even be a bit much for a 13 year old for the more sheltering type parents. Not only can it be conceived as very violent there are some very adult themes that could be considered questionable.Overall this is a film I would like to see again and I am DYING to see the next film in the series. I walked out of this film excited satisfied and wanting more. Might want to leave the young ones at home but you won't regretting fighting for front row seats on a Friday night for this flick.".

I had thought it was a pity that David Attenborough wasn't a part of this amazing project but Glenn Close fivetime Oscar nominee indeed gave a mesmerizing voice performance and along with a powerful score deeply drew me into Home's elaborate illustrations and logical reasonings.Some might think this documentary is so emotive that it's more of a propaganda despite how factbased it is but isn't a subject like this meant to be emotive? No this is not the kind of documentary that presents you with nonjudged information for you to consider and debate of course it is not it's telling you the most overwhelming and alarming truth through worldwide facts and images in a careful logic flow and yes with a great lot of passion built in! Vastly connected with the daily life of everyone and the fate of the human race the movie left me steeped in thoughts. Like said many times in the movie everything is linked I find tons of images flashing in my head rapidly after watching Home and more importantly now I look at them linked together in a meaningful way.Let me put it this way if the entire human race were to be extinct on this planet Home would be the recording that we should bury deep underground for extraterrestrials to find out what happened and learn the lesson of our species it is that good.".

The cinematography of this documentary is amazing even the images of pollution of the environment that humans have caused look remarkably appealing to the eye. But this documentary is much more than a stream of beautiful images from across the world.The message that the documentary contains is a strong one unlike our nations our ecosystem doesn't have any borders. As humans organized in nation states we spend 12 times as much on weapons to defend ourselves from each other than we spend on aid for the poorest. The effects of the exploitation of our shared ecosystem will affect us all and will hit those who already face the toughest circumstances the hardest. The problems that our world faces cannot be solved by any country alone. Too long have we focused on what separates us as citizens of specific countries without realizing that we are all bound together as human beings. Without a rapidly growing global awareness of the situation we are facing we will leave a much harsher environment for our children in which natural resources on which we all depend will become increasingly scarce.I am a student in my twenties the state the world is in today is how my generation will inherit it before we will have had the chance to have any effect on this trend. Can this really be the inheritance of a generation that dedicated itself to peace love and happiness? Maybe. Or maybe it's not too late just yet. You might still be a skeptic about the message the documentary tries to convey after reading my comments but I promise you this it will be much harder to be skeptic about that message after having watched Home.".

	schema:reviewBody "Home is a documentary about Earth humanity nature where we're going and what we've been. Shot in 54 countries with aerial footage it's a combination of all the navelgazing movies we've seen lately like Planet Earth and Baraka. Like a guilty abusive adult we're now taking a closer look at ourselves what we've done to the planet and what we've to ourselves.That's in large part what the first 34 of the movie is about. Showing different locations on Earth the stunning gliding shots of our planet's more beautiful locations as well as the terrible damage we've caused. In that way it's much different than Baraka and Planet Earth the two films I compared this to. This movie talks about humans not just their achievements but the economic chaos we've wrought on each other.The vast differences in class structure in the west from the east. The vast amounts of wealth owned by 2 of the population. Starvation disease war are all covered in this documentary. It's not just about the nature but the capitalist system which has destroyed the planet and brought humanity to its knees.Many of these changes have occurred in the past 50100 years. Vast change which is increasing to the point where urbanization is epidemic all over the planet. The melting icecaps are also covered in very nice detail. The consequences are of course very grim. Some of this information I knew but it's good to be reminded how we live in the western world which is rapidly destroying the planet and taking all the innocent passengers along with us.The movie was released on the internet television and internet on the same day. It's on YouTube in its entirety but I downloaded a high quality version from One Big Torrent which was very nice to watch.Probably one of the best movies of 2009 and one of the best documentaries of the year as well. I highly recommend it.".

	schema:headline " Beautiful scary hopeful.";
	schema:reviewBody "The film opens with a sequence on the history of life on earth based on science. But it's somewhat important to understand this history for points made later in the film.The film shows ways in which our current activities are not sustainable such as overuse of water reliance on nonrenewable oil and sources of fresh water the use of agriculture primarily to feed animals to become meat overpopulation monoculture shipping etc.It spotlights one case in history Easter Island to show what happens when a society doesn't react to the damage it is doing to its own environment.I thank the filmmakers for drawing attention to my own country's Canada's dangerously wasteful use of land water and energy in the tar sands of Alberta and Saskatchewan in the junkie's quest for hardertoget oil.Near the end the film puts some facts on the screen a few were unfortunately too small to be read. Some struck me as not particularly relevant to the film such as how many people may be going hungry or thirsty. On the face of it given the facts in the film that's a good thing. To clarify they needed to tie that to the fact that we could fix this problem if the rich used less and if there were fewer rich.It does end on a hopeful note spotlighting some cases where people have taken small steps toward stopping our bad behaviours and living sustainably. It is hopeful but I wish they had dwelled more on that because we need concrete solutions that we can go to our mayors and councils with right now. Many of them have their head in the sand with petty politics social issues labour issues the recession and aren't thinking about when it really hits the fan a decade or two from now.The images were mostly wide shots or aerial shots of landscapes herds cities factory farms etc. and were mostly quite beautiful. I also liked the music. Narration was a bit sparse and in the English version I watched on Youtube no subtitles I think the narrator said climactic several times when she meant climatic. But given the scale of what we're facing maybe either word is OK.The film was not shown in theatres in my area nor was it shown on TV except on the French channel of course ... all the best stuff is on the French channels in my area so I did appreciate the simultaneous Youtube release of this film. Given the free home viewing a torrent would have been even more preferred for portability and quality. My poor PC had trouble keeping up with the video AND the downloading at the same time.In comparison with Earth 2007 I found this film to be more relevant to today. It isn't about the beauty of individual animals but rather our entire home and it clearly lays out that it's changing and that at a minimum we need to be preparing to handle that and ideally trying to slow the change down. It's more honest.In comparison with An Inconvenient Truth I think it trades some of the information and style for a richer visual that lets the pictures do the talking. It's been a while since I've seen An Inconvenient Truth but I think it covers much the same territory. I think Al's lecture approach was effective at drawing some people in and presenting the message clearly. But being a political figure maybe Home will attract some different viewers that may have been driven away by the earlier film just by his presence in it.".

	schema:headline " Visually stunning but with questionable content";
	schema:reviewBody "Well I am not a native speaker so please bear with me! I have seen this movie twice now and I really wanted to like it. I love the Planet EarthSeries and other natureenvironmentrelated movies but this one is a little...special. First of all the visuals e.g. photography are stunning and very beautiful. Sadly this is the only real good thing about this movie. What I consider bad about this movie? Well there are several thingsThe whole movie has a kind of instructive touch as in preaching from above to dumb people and it seems as if the filmmakers thought of their audience as stupid and therefore repeat everything over and over again  maybe they have to but it still leaves a bit of a bad taste in my mouth.  The narration Firstly the female narrator is not bad but in no way can she compare to David Attenborough of the Planet EarthSeries. The narration makes this movie seem a little alarmist but not in a way that shocks you and makes you want to change things but in a way that makes you think 'Yes yes I know! You said that already!'. Then there is the vocabulary used. This is one of the things that disturbed me from the start especially me as a German. Talking about herding cattle as keeping livestock in concentration camplike conditions is not only outrageously insensitive but also outright stupid. While saying things like this may be effective in creating attention there are definitely better ways to do so. And why is half of what the narrator is saying numbers and statistics without any reference or comparison? Nobody will remember any of the numbers anyways so please at least give us the numbers with a context!  I personally don't like what I call the spiritualistic approach of this movie. By this I mean that it is repeated over and over how everything in this world is connected and how humans are kind of a tumor on this earth that ruins it. While this may be true to some degree it still leaves a weird taste and makes this movie seem like creationist propaganda which I am sure it is not I'm just saying that this is not a very smart thing to do.  The movie basically only complains about the destruction of the earth by humans but offers no real solutions. The solutions it offers are ones that are already being used e.g. using solar power or are weirdly esoteric ones e.g. everybody live in peace the rest will work itself out.  This movie is very oversimplistic and onesided. While none of the things being said are really wrong most of them aren't really correct either. By using debatable arguments like this the movie gets a bit of a manipulative touch.  While sponsoring this movie might be a good idea for the companies involved this leaves one question Why was every company allowed to put their name on this movie? Most of the companies produce in socalled thirdworld countries under worst circumstances for the workers and sell the products as luxury articles in industrialized countries and therefore actively take part in some of the activities that this movie wants to tell you about  so why the heck did the filmmakers take their money?  All in all as a movie this film isn't very entertaining. There is not really anything more than the visuals to keep you watching it the narration is basically mostly throwing statistics at you and there is simply nothing new to it.  Another big problem with this movie is that it doesn't seem to know what it wants to be. It isn't a documentary but it isn't a normal picture either. It starts with stating that certain things are bad about the way humans treat the earth but keeps adding stuff until you just don't care anymore. For example the narrator says that eating meat is bad for the environment. Then it adds that coal mining is bad goes on to say something else is bad and so on. Starting from 'Oh yes that's interesting I didn't know that!' you will go to 'Okay so everything is bad?' This IMHO also weakens the message of the movie a lot the filmmakers should have just focused on fewer issues to tackle instead of being against environmental destruction industrialism globalization and the military. Don't get me wrong it is very right to be against all of those things but being against all of them at once is just hard to communicate in only one movie.Also please keep in mind that this movie is NOT a documentary in the usual sense of the word. There is nothing that is being documented there is nothing new and there is nothing innovative in any way about this movie. While this is not necessarily bad it changes the focus of the film from being a very boring documentary which as I have already said it is not to what it really is a beautiful but still only mildly entertaining movie.So in short If you haven't seen the Planet EarthSeries go see it now! If you have already seen it and watched all the other recent documentaries about environmental issues and want to see this one go on and see it but don't expect it to be more than average. Keep in mind what I have written above about this movie not being a documentary and you should be happy with it. About my rating Considering 10 is the best and 1 is the worst possible rating on IMDb I gave this movie 6 stars. 5 stars is average I added two stars for the awesome visuals none for the narration above average voicework but without any real substance and subtracted one point for things that really made me angry for stuff like the concentration campreference and similar things.".

	schema:headline " Eyeopening and beautiful but sadly not perfect";
	schema:reviewBody "First of all I am relieved that a movie on this subject has been produced with such a high budget. It's about time someone really tried to sum up what the human condition is and the relationship between our condition and the condition of our planet.The visuals for 'Home' are for the most part near perfect pinpointing the beauties and miracles of this world whilst also the disgraces and disasters with a total sensitivity and respect for all sides of the issue. The subjects covered are well chosen and diverse and you really get perspective on how widespread and potentially devastating our manipulation of the natural world has become. Unfortunately though what slightly let this movie down for me was its 'matter of fact' approach and a lack of attention to some important details. In some ways this film avoids a onesided approach with interesting stats showing how our attempts at alternative fuels have their own negative effects but for the first section particularly it felt like some very dated notes on the history of the earth. We know some amazing things about the history of our planet but it's important to recognise that there is far more that we don't. I for one stand firmly on the side of science that can admit to not knowing. The most blatant error as picked up by IMDb in the 'goofs' section is the narration that the first towns appeared 600 years ago how could you get that wrong!!? Apparently they meant to say 6000 years ago but even this isn't fact as there is evidence of towns up to over 8000 years ago. On top of this it is continually stated that human beings have been around for 200'000 years a theory that has been far from proved and therefore should be treated as such. I think that in a film that is trying to be scientifically credible in this case vaguespeculative language would possibly be more accurate. At least they managed to avoid a '2001 A Space Odyssey' style chimpanzee scene! Scientific stuff aside though the most inexcusable error is that in the fairly small amount of on screen text there are numerous spelling mistakes. In most cases that doesn't bother me but in a high budget film production it does and it certainly doesn't help the reputation of the Ecowarriors hippies come to mind!After watching this movie though I'll admit that I had mostly forgotten the flaws because it really forces you to think about the issues. This is a good thing and for the most part it is done with beauty sensitivity and grace which is why I've given it such a high rating. Watch this movie the cinematography and well crafted narrative will open your eyes to the fragile state of our planet and cause you to appreciate your place in it more. Just don't be a sucker for the slightly antihuman philosophy.".

	onyx:emotionText "First of all I am relieved that a movie on this subject has been produced with such a high budget. It's about time someone really tried to sum up what the human condition is and the relationship between our condition and the condition of our planet.The visuals for 'Home' are for the most part near perfect pinpointing the beauties and miracles of this world whilst also the disgraces and disasters with a total sensitivity and respect for all sides of the issue. The subjects covered are well chosen and diverse and you really get perspective on how widespread and potentially devastating our manipulation of the natural world has become. Unfortunately though what slightly let this movie down for me was its 'matter of fact' approach and a lack of attention to some important details. In some ways this film avoids a onesided approach with interesting stats showing how our attempts at alternative fuels have their own negative effects but for the first section particularly it felt like some very dated notes on the history of the earth.

She's actually quite disturbing. Where did you get your numbers from? why are you repeating everything? Do I look stupid to you I'm not a child. Maybe its what many of us needs to hear?

What if the script said 6 thousand years ago. There is no archaeologist in the entire world who would support that date. Cities are thousands of years older than that. Let alone towns.60.000 years? That would be a bit of a stretch. So where does the number come from people? Can anyone clarify?It gets a 11 on imagery a 7 on accuracy and credibility rather essential in a documentary I would think. On the whole that makes a five. Don't ask me about maths".

Especially considering the effort it took for the ones who made this wake up call. I would love to be hopeful about the future of us humans. But the ratings on IMDb imply so much about how aware we are about what we've been doing to our home. This documentary was significantly meant to be on all around the world in 90 different countries the same day the 5th of June which happens! to be World Environment Day.The purpose was basically to reach as many people as possible all around the world. Many things were done for the same call. But to be honest it's hard to say a lot has changed. For the ones who want to see it is in front of our eyes that our planet is responding to the things we've been doing and the way we're dominating every living thing with the planet itself. But hey! We are nothing old compared to the planet's age. Our planet is 4.5 billion years old. It's seen lots of species before us. Some of them were wiped out. Not because they ruined the planet's own cycle. But because it is an everchanging journey in a massive time scale. But we humans actually started a new geological era with the things we've been doing effecting the very environment that created us. This documentary tells us the story of us leaving the ending for us to conclude. And to be aware as Dr. Iain Stewart once said that planet Earth doesn't need to be saved. Earth is a great survivor. It's not the planet we should be worrying about. It is us. But the end is near. I think no one will deny it when it happens. I just hope people actually wake up and start saving us. Watch this documentary people! And tell people to watch it. Because it is for all of us. Including the things we love. Thanks to everyone who took part in making it.".

Then at about the 25 minute point they show some flames from oil wells and switch away from their massageparlour narration and soothing soundtrack to a more tense narration with a sinistersounding soundtrack. It's all so rudimentally transparent it actually makes you laugh. The rest of the movie has some valid points but is so filled with hyperbole that it's hard to take seriously and sift through the scare tactics to get at the actual facts.".

They also describe how the meat packing industry is one of the greatest causes of air pollution because in fact many of the chemicals released from meat packing are worse then CO2 and the UN said that meat packing contributes more to global warming than the cars.They don't mention it but meat and other forms of processed foods are really bad for people's health which is why the more developed societies have things like Colon Cancer Heart Disease and Obesity well poorer societies do not and it is extremely cruel to animals. This is why I personally am a vegetarian.This movie even explores how some people are using solar power to create a better lifestyle but that is not enough we need a government in the world that actually cares about this stuff instead of caring about pleasing the corporate bosses who are destroying the earth anyways.This movie also explains how we are cutting down the Amazon rainforest and we have already got rid of more then 20 of it and if we get rid of the entire thing there won't be much hope left for humanity. Humanity will be doomed. Considering that I am less then twenty I might live to see the earth turn into easter island. I have heard that by 2030 we will lose half of the amazon.

Several times throughout the picture it is underlined that in the past 5 decades human kind has changed the face of our planet more than it has in it's 200.000 years of existence. In the past 50 years has the Planet been depleted of some of it's most precious minerals and soil treasures  including the most precious of them all WATER.One of the reasons I loved the documentary so much is that it names a lot of names it doesn't only name the reasons why our planet is suffering but it also tells the viewer who is responsible for it. Tokyo and Lagos 2 of the most developing cities worldwide and India Bangladesh and USA are named to be the greatest consumers of our resources  the cost to sustain the lives of the hundreds of millions of people are so incredible huge that in only a few decades we will have depleted all the available resources.Another reason I truly recommend this documentary is that it gave us an example of what could and eventually will happen of the human race. Apparently there existed a highly educated and developed civilization on the Easter Islands. Although they were struck by famine riots and natural catastrophes it always survived because of the human mind. However the people depleted the island of all of its resources until they starved to death.The documentary states several times that we became dependent of oil petroleum and the several other forms of the 'black gold'. We are reminded that although we have already run out of oil in some of the corners of our planet we still drill dig and try to find more and more. Impressive images of Arabia and Africa are shown to let us know that we also ran out of underearthed water supplies. Water is used for almost everything in our daily routine from washing our cars and watering the tropical paradise of the desert located Las Vegas to cultivating grain for the life stock we depend upon.The human greed its quickly development and the impossibility to sustain life as it is nowadays without destructing its own planet damages permanently the balance of nature. We are living in exceptional times. Scientists tell us that we have 10 years to change the way we live avert the depletion of natural resources and the catastrophic evolution of the Earth's climate. quote from the Homeproject Youtube channel  the link is above.I recommend the documentary to everybody who still believes that living the American dram of heaving a big house and 2 cars is still the way to go.".

	schema:reviewBody "The cinematography is absolutely stunning.This film is beautiful and some of the sequences are pure genius. The Dubai skyscraper the oil tanker at sea and the tar sands are all jawdropping. The 'natural' environments are the focus of the story  and they do not disappoint either. Icebergs rainforests and deserts complete a stunning canvas.The music is also perfectly pitched matching the visuals perfectly and by using a palette that goes from ethereal voices to frantic orchestration tells a complex story all on its own.But... add in Glenn Close and her earnest recital and suddenly it's less clear what this film is about. Evolution? The history of civilization? Overpopulation? Poverty? Education? The nature of human greed? Evil multinationals? Defence spending?!

The Dubai skyscraper the oil tanker at sea and the tar sands are all jawdropping. The 'natural' environments are the focus of the story  and they do not disappoint either. Icebergs rainforests and deserts complete a stunning canvas.The music is also perfectly pitched matching the visuals perfectly and by using a palette that goes from ethereal voices to frantic orchestration tells a complex story all on its own.But... add in Glenn Close and her earnest recital and suddenly it's less clear what this film is about. Evolution? The history of civilization? Overpopulation? Poverty? Education? The nature of human greed? Evil multinationals? Defence spending?!

And yes i HAVE seen a lot of the other recent environmental and nature documentaries and I also liked Al Gore's truth  .Consider several shots where you cannot immediately figure out what on earth you are watching other than some beautiful colors that might as well be an impressionist painting and then the camera slowly zooms out to reveal for instance the plastic covered fields in Almeria or rice fields on a mountain or suddenly some humans appear floating into the frame in the distance and the camera rises to show them in a boat on a canal... It is just stunningly breathtaking and it is like that ALL THE TIME in the entire movie! For people who knows Bertrand's still photographs this is not surprising but seeing it in moving form and presented as a narrative does actually increase the impact considerably.So yes this is a definite 10 in my book purely because of these visuals  As for the politics I however don't see a way out of this mess unless we get some serious decrease in the worlds population and soon... which is a point that this movie really does not want to address. Highly recommended but do yourself a favor and watch it in HD 720p or more.".

	schema:reviewBody "Most people think of the burst of creative energy from the Italian cinema after 1945 as mostly serious in films like Open City The Bicycle Thief La Strada and La Dolce Vita. In reality the films of that period included some extremely funny comedies. Even a master of serious if fantastic cinema like Frederico Fellini did The White Sheik with Alberto Sordi. But besides that you had films like Big Deal On Madonna Street Divorce Italian Style Marriage Italian Style and Seduced And Abandoned.Fantasmi a Roma Ghosts of Rome was one of these comedies  an extremely good one. It has a nicetwisted little plot and some good characterizations comparing the fairly likable set of ghosts with their sense of responsibility and honor to the past with a modern set of greedy materialists.The film is set in a palace in the eternal city. There are a set of ghosts residing in the palace headed by Reginaldo Marcello Mastroianni an 18th Century Casanova clone Father Bartolomeo Tino Buozzelli a monk who died centuries earlier when he was accidentally poisoned by his abbot who was trying to kill the rat that was eating too much of the monastery's larder and Dona Flora Sandra Milo an 18th Century romantic who drowned herself for love. There existence is noted by the current owner of the palace Don Anibale Prince di Roviano Eduardo De Filippo. He in fact tells another character about the history of the ghosts as well as of his older brother. The older brother ghost leads to the initial stage of goofiness in the film  Don Anibale was only six when his older brother died age ten. Don Anibale is now in his seventies. As he dies in the film when he returns as a ghost to join the others he embraces his older brother who looks more like his grandson!Don Anibale is killed in a gas oven explosion and this is unfortunate because he was used to and friendly with the ghosts and his heir Frederico Mastroianni again is not interested in them or the palace or traditions at all. He just knows the palace is an expensive white elephant that is worth a fortune because of the land it's located on. He and his girl friend Eileen Belinda Lee have made arrangements to sell the property for a small fortune to a developer.The ghosts are naturally upset by this turn of events and try to derail it. First they try the obvious  scare and annoy Frederico and Eileen into leaving. All this does is make the pair more determined to get rid of the palace. Then they try to convince the authorities that the house is unsafe for a wrecking crew. This actually backfires as it convinces the authorities the building should be dismantled. They try to convince the authorities in a switch that the building has historical interest  and we watch while the developer and Frederico use generous dollops of cash to convince the authorities to ignore the historical interest.Fate steps in as an accident reveals a long hidden fresco. Reginaldo recognizes it as the work of Giovanni Battista Vilari Vittorio Gassman a talented but egotistical painter of the late baroque early rococo periods. Gassman steals the last twenty minutes of the film when he returns to salvage his fresco improve it and finally prove to those idiot art critics that he was the greatest Italian painter of his age and not some generally agreed upon rival he can't stand. In the end his painting does save the day  but in a surprisingly odd manner.This film remains a treasured memory to me after all these years it has not been on television in New York City since the 1970s I'm sorry to say. The seesawing battle between a set of dead but lovable human beings and selfish living ones is odd with Mastoianni ably demonstrating his acting in several roles including a third towards the end of the film. It's considerations of landmark status for endangered buildings is still a vital and timely one and never has such a dry subject managed to be captured so humorously or so humanely.".

He just knows the palace is an expensive white elephant that is worth a fortune because of the land it's located on. He and his girl friend Eileen Belinda Lee have made arrangements to sell the property for a small fortune to a developer.The ghosts are naturally upset by this turn of events and try to derail it. First they try the obvious  scare and annoy Frederico and Eileen into leaving. All this does is make the pair more determined to get rid of the palace. Then they try to convince the authorities that the house is unsafe for a wrecking crew. This actually backfires as it convinces the authorities the building should be dismantled. They try to convince the authorities in a switch that the building has historical interest  and we watch while the developer and Frederico use generous dollops of cash to convince the authorities to ignore the historical interest.Fate steps in as an accident reveals a long hidden fresco. Reginaldo recognizes it as the work of Giovanni Battista Vilari Vittorio Gassman a talented but egotistical painter of the late baroque early rococo periods. Gassman steals the last twenty minutes of the film when he returns to salvage his fresco improve it and finally prove to those idiot art critics that he was the greatest Italian painter of his age and not some generally agreed upon rival he can't stand. In the end his painting does save the day  but in a surprisingly odd manner.This film remains a treasured memory to me after all these years it has not been on television in New York City since the 1970s I'm sorry to say. The seesawing battle between a set of dead but lovable human beings and selfish living ones is odd with Mastoianni ably demonstrating his acting in several roles including a third towards the end of the film. It's considerations of landmark status for endangered buildings is still a vital and timely one and never has such a dry subject managed to be captured so humorously or so humanely.";

Most of her performances transcend time and come off as fresh and natural today as when they were first delivered. She just must have made it look too easy. The woman could do everything! At any rate this film features another strong performance from her. She plays a young American girl who comes to England with her father the irascible Morgan and is soon swept off her feet by dashing and wealthy Marshall. Before they can enjoy any sort of life together he is called to serve in WWI and they are separated. This is only part of the story as her life unfolds through the next decades and she struggles with letting her son McDowall then Lawford serve in WWII. The film is obviously patriotic and propaganda filled but understandably so as WWII was still being waged! Dunne is luminescent in the role and is surrounded by a strong array of familiar supporting actors. Notable are Cooper endlessly watchable in anything! and Witty wonderfully crotchety yet sentimental. It is a touch jarring to see Taylor grow into Lockhart young Taylor barely says anything but Yes Sir John. Lawford is at his most youthful and appealing. The film has a lot of sentiment and melodrama but also a lot of heart and a little humor. It winds up being quite touching at times and displays a time long gone but a patriotism that can still be resurrected when events call for it.".

A little too weepy at times the movie tries to convey its message of the dangers of Germany in the scene where the two teenage boys proclaim an almost fervent admiration for their own country and that they most definitely have not lost the war and their pride yet.A salute to the British and American soldiers who fought World War II THE WHITE CLIFFS OF DOVER features a massive cast of established actors and rising stars Gladys Cooper Van Johnson Dame May Witty an uncredited June Lockhart Peter Lawford and Elizabeth Taylor. A good movie that only was Oscar nominated in technical categories that has Irene Dunne aptly playing her role as if Greer Garson would have it's a shame that she never received a recognition for her body of work and here her work makes watching the movie worth the effort even if it goes on for a little too much.".

	onyx:emotionText "Irene Dunne stars as the American woman who is romanced by an Englishman Alan Marshall then loses him to the first World War and who decides to raise her son Roddy McDowell in England only to have him go to war once he grows up as Peter Lawford and die in battle. A little too weepy at times the movie tries to convey its message of the dangers of Germany in the scene where the two teenage boys proclaim an almost fervent admiration for their own country and that they most definitely have not lost the war and their pride yet.A salute to the British and American soldiers who fought World War II THE WHITE CLIFFS OF DOVER features a massive cast of established actors and rising stars Gladys Cooper Van Johnson Dame May Witty an uncredited June Lockhart Peter Lawford and Elizabeth Taylor. A good movie that only was Oscar nominated in technical categories that has Irene Dunne aptly playing her role as if Greer Garson would have it's a shame that she never received a recognition for her body of work and here her work makes watching the movie worth the effort even if it goes on for a little too much.";

	schema:headline " This film makes me proud to be an American!";
	schema:reviewBody "I really liked this movie. Although much is predictable about the plot I found the music cinematography the history aristocracy etc. very enjoyable. This clearly is a propaganda piece but you can't help but find yourself swept away in the patriotism willingly.It reminds us of how our great country was once heroes to the world. We were the great saviors of freedom. It is a little sad now some 60 years later that our country has lost favorable opinion in the eyes of the world. The parade scenes where Irene Dunne's character watches the US troops arriving and marching through town can bring tears to your eyes.The characters are all quite endearing and believable. Dunne is quite sweet. Marshal is so dashing. As a woman I can imagine myself being swept up in such a man at the onset of WWI  as Dunne was or WWII which the viewers themselves were in the midst of.The intertwining of US  British history is a nice reminder that we are really made from the same beginnings in our country. Even though we eventually sought our freedom from the British which is pointed out in the movie it also points out our common heritage in being derived from Sir Walter Raleigh  the Mayflower. Our countries have been great allies over the past century. I'm sure there have been prejudices between yanks  Brits as pointed out in the scene where Dunne breaks down over her future inlaws prejudices of Americans. But clearly the movie is designed to foster a common bond among the US  Britain while acknowledging our differences.My absolute favorite scene is at the end. It is especially poignant  the dying son is relaying to his mother about an American soldier that said before he died  God would never forgive us neither England or America if we break the faith with our dead again that he would really start to fight the day the war ended for a good peace a peace that would stick. Wow  what a message that must have truly resonated with the WWII audience especially those who had also lived through WWI. I don't think my generation can relate to having been through 2 such costly wars back to back. Women who lost husbands in the first war were now faced with the loss of sons in the 2nd war as Dunne's character was. What tremendous sacrifice was made by that generation! We should be forever grateful!".

The magnificent cliffs are seen in the distance in all their splendor. Susan clearly moved by the sight revels on the many things that await her in London where she and her father are going to spend two weeks vacation.Alas when they arrive they are treated to the typical rainy weather that puts a damp no pun intended in her enjoyment of a city and all things English she has always admired. Instead of finding a place that meets all her expectations Susan has to endure the weather and the prospect of going back without seeing the sights and places she really wanted to see.Enter the kind Colonel the man living in the modest hotel where the Dunns are staying. He invites Susan to a society ball where she meets Sir John Ashwood the man who will become her husband. John is instrumental in her staying in England. Susan never expected to be married into the rich gentry that John belongs to. In fact the beginning of her life in the family country estate convinces her she doesn't belong.It's 1915 and WWI arrives without warning. Susan sees in horror how John goes to his regiment and to the front. He eventually dies but the son that arrives for her is in a way a painful reminder of the great loss she suffered. Like his father the boy grows up and has to go to war as it's expected of his kind.The White Cliffs of Dover was directed by Clarence Brown who gave it a great look. Irene Dunne makes a good impression as Susan the courageous woman who stays in a strange country and has to make a new life for herself and her new family. Alan Marshal is perfect as the dashing John Ashwood.In minor roles we see Roddy McDowall who plays the young John Ashwood. Harry Morgan is Susan's father. Gladys Cooper May Witty Peter Lawford Van Johnson C. Aubrey Smith and the rest of the cast do good work. The young Elizabeth Taylor is seen as the young Betsy and June Lockhart appears as the grown up girl in uncredited roles.The White Cliffs of Dover is about loyalty for one's country and how tradition plays a role in the lives of all the people one meets in the story even during the difficult times these characters had to live.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have a dissenting voice about White Cliffs of Dover. Most reviewers seem to love it. I thought the movie began well but descended into sappiness before it mercifully ended. When did it lose its way? Probably around the 23 mark. The plot line of a highspirited Yankee being swept off her feet by a member of the landed gentry caught my interest. One knew from the date of their meeting that WWI was looming over their romance. And knowing that the movie was produced during WWII I could almost write the rest of the plot. The problem with the film for me was in the execution. The last third of it became selfconsciously sentimental and dreary the weepiness intermingled with the overthetop attempt to stir the fires of patriotism in viewers. The sounds of a military band and the sight of our soldiers marching on a heroic mission always thrill me personally. My son is in the military. And WWII is the epitome of heroic times. But I did not appreciate the way the movie clumsily tried to manipulate my thoughts and feelings. What I did love about the film were the superb character actorsFrank Morgan at his best Dame May Witty Gladys Cooper C. Aubrey Smith and the young Roddy McDowall. It was fun seeing other familiar facesVan Johnson Elizabeth Taylor Tom Drake. Again I have to differ with viewers who loved Irene Dunne in this part. Her portrayal just didn't work for me. I could see Greer Garson as better suited for the role. I felt the othersMorgan Smith Witty Alan Marshal who played her husband and even McDowallcarried Dunne along and gave her believability. Two aspects of the movie I especially applaud. First the significance of Dieppe in the lives of the main characters brought an emotional weight and synchronicity to the film that has stayed with me. And Nanny's final scene helped me to understand the whole situation through her sad old eyes. I will remember that touching moment when all the marching bands have passed.".

She marries an Englishman Sir John Ashwood Alan Marshall who dies in World War I. She raises their son John Jr. Roddy McDowell as young boy and then Peter Lawford as an adult. He dies in the end too so you see there is a lot of sadness in this story.

	schema:headline " Where Those Bluebirds Come Over";
	schema:reviewBody "With a title based on a very popular song on both sides of the pond in those World War II years The White Cliffs Of Dover is seen in flashback by Irene Dunne of her life as an American in Great Britain in the years covering two World Wars. It was one of those hands across the oceans films so popular in those days.I heard it said that the main fact about the 20th Century that one should realize in studying it is that the United States and Great Britain both spoke a common language. That fact made us overcome a few cultural differences and was the reason America entered two World Wars to save a Great Britain from invasion.Thus it was for Irene Dunne who came over with her father Frank Morgan on holiday in 1914 and met and married a minor titled fellow played by Alan Marshal. Marshal is killed and she spends a long widowhood raising their son and heir to his title. She lives with her motherinlaw Gladys Cooper and raises her son who at various times is played by Roddy McDowall and Peter Lawford. The son rather fancies the daughter of one of their tenants played at various times by Elizabeth Taylor and June Lockhart.Of course this interoceanic love feast has a rather rocky beginning especially when Frank Morgan while arguing chess with C. Aubrey Smith gets confronted with the fact that the chess board and pieces were the property of the looted White House from the War of 1812. It's my favorite scene in the film.Dunne who ages gracefully and magnificently gives a stirring performance as a woman who lost what she loved in one war and is ready to sacrifice again for her adopted country. I've a feeling that the folks at MGM might have had her character as an answer to that real female American expatriate Lady Nancy Astor and that we were all not members in good standing of the Nazi appeasing Cliveden set.There's also a scene similar to the one in Mrs. Miniver where Greer Garson has to entertain a wounded German flier Helmut Dantine where he's made a symbol of what they're at war against. Dunne Morgan and McDowall entertain a pair of German boys on holiday and when the discussion turns to politics it gets pretty heated. These two are thinking nothing more than winning what they should have won back in 1918.The White Cliffs Of Dover is a nice film typical of the era it came out of. You do wonder though if Irene Dunne had met a nice German guy from the Weimar Republic days how that might have been dealt with.".

	onyx:emotionText "With a title based on a very popular song on both sides of the pond in those World War II years The White Cliffs Of Dover is seen in flashback by Irene Dunne of her life as an American in Great Britain in the years covering two World Wars. It was one of those hands across the oceans films so popular in those days.I heard it said that the main fact about the 20th Century that one should realize in studying it is that the United States and Great Britain both spoke a common language. That fact made us overcome a few cultural differences and was the reason America entered two World Wars to save a Great Britain from invasion.Thus it was for Irene Dunne who came over with her father Frank Morgan on holiday in 1914 and met and married a minor titled fellow played by Alan Marshal. Marshal is killed and she spends a long widowhood raising their son and heir to his title. She lives with her motherinlaw Gladys Cooper and raises her son who at various times is played by Roddy McDowall and Peter Lawford. The son rather fancies the daughter of one of their tenants played at various times by Elizabeth Taylor and June Lockhart.Of course this interoceanic love feast has a rather rocky beginning especially when Frank Morgan while arguing chess with C. Aubrey Smith gets confronted with the fact that the chess board and pieces were the property of the looted White House from the War of 1812.

	schema:headline " A Cinderella tale intertwined with tragedy";
	schema:reviewBody "White Cliffs of Dover was made to stoke the flames of patriotism. The film is largely Dunne as a 50 something WWII nurse awaiting a large number of casualties as she looks back on her life in England.Her memories consist of the tale of a Yankee girl Irene Dunne as Susan Dunn who goes on a two week vacation to England with her father and on her last day there meets a member of the English gentry who is instantly smitten by her and talks her into staying and marrying him. At first Susan feels out of her element as Lady Ashwood but she quickly finds her footing. She and her husband Sir John Ashwood don't even have time for a honeymoon as WWI starts and he is off to fight with his regiment. After three years he finally gets a few days leave but it is long enough to conceive his son John Ashwood Jr. or John Ashwood II as the British would say.Irene Dunne always gave good subtle performances in parts that could have easily gotten hamfisted and this role is no exception. Frank Morgan as her Yankee dad is a revelation as he is for once not the befuddled comic relief but a spirited American father who wants his daughter home in America before her marriage and safe from the Nazi bombs as the winds of a second war approach. C. Aubrey Smith lends terrific support as Colonel Walter Forsythe considered a crackpot at the boarding house where he and the Dunns were staying during their trip because he claims to have a standing invitation to the most exclusive ball in England but seems to just be a common pensioner. Well it turns out he really can turn pumpkins into carriages after all. Roddy McDowell plays John Jr. and he is smitten by one of the daughters of the tenant farmers on the estate played by a twelve year old Elizabeth Taylor in only her third credited role. Their scenes together are just too cute. As with most of the WWII films there are a few lines and a few scenes that get over the top just a bit. There are the American soldiers marching through the streets of London to rousing patriotic songs played by a military band as the film comes full circle. There are the two German preteens who are friends of John Jr. during the early 1930's who just happen to erupt into Nazi propaganda at the dinner table. I was surprised one of them didn't put a comb under his nose and start imitating the Bohemian corporal. And then there is grief that takes all of 15 seconds in spite of its cruel irony because you just HAVE to keep that stiff upper lip! But it's not overdone for a film that is over two hours long and it does take that long to do the tale justice.".

It is a very strange note on which to end this movie especially since when it was released in June 1944 we were just landing in Normandy and had no idea when World War II would end and how.This is in short about as close to an antiwar movie as the Office of War Information could have countenanced during the war.As I said at the beginning most of it is just Hollywood clichs about the English recycled.

	schema:reviewBody "As I was watching this film  a sentimental film produced DURING World War II  I couldn't help but think how ironic it was that the sentimentality of the story would be virtually obsolete in American films just one year later as World War II ended and America faced a new reality in the world.Nevertheless this is a charming story albeit a somewhat melancholy one. It is usually labeled as a home front war movie covering both World Wars but the war really doesn't come into the picture except at the beginning and almost halfway through the film. And it ends well before the end of the picture. Then the story is of how the living go on with life. So I would prefer to see it as a romance taking place in the late 1930s and early 1940s and the war is part of the story...the sad part. I'm not sure why but in some ways it reminds me of Mrs. Miniver although it is a very different film.An American newspaper publisher  the always delightful Frank Morgan  and his daughter  the also always delightful Irene Dunne  vacation in England where Dunne's character is swept off her feet by upper class army officer Sir John Ashwood  Alan Marshall who is excellent. The honeymoon begins just as World War I breaks out. Sir John is killed in action near the end of the war but not before siring a son who in turn goes off to World War II while his mother is a nurse. And what will his fate be? The supporting actors in this film are superb  Gladys Cooper Dame May Witty Elizabeth Taylor so young here she is almost unrecognizable among others. Perhaps the goofiest part was played by Van Johnson was it bad acting or supposed to be that way?There's a great scene between Frank Morgan and C. Aubrey Smith early on in the film...over a chess set. Another exceptional scene is where Dunne points out the insensitivity of her British hosts.This is a very handsome production. If there is a problem with the film  at least for Americans  the pace is a bit slow. Although it feels like a British film it is actually and American MGM production. I'm not quite sure I agree with the film's ending. Too much sacrifice for one woman. Excellent. Well worth an 8 a rating I rarely give.".

S. Churchill born 1874 was the product of an American mother born Jennie Jerome  a British father Randolph Churchill.My understanding of the 1942 Dieppe raid was that it was an exclusively Canadian operation almost a dress rehearsal for the real invasion two years later so I felt it was a bit too pat to have three nationalities of soldiers together in a shell crater but I understand why this scene was written into the film script.".

Churchill born 1874 was the product of an American mother born Jennie Jerome  a British father Randolph Churchill.My understanding of the 1942 Dieppe raid was that it was an exclusively Canadian operation almost a dress rehearsal for the real invasion two years later so I felt it was a bit too pat to have three nationalities of soldiers together in a shell crater but I understand why this scene was written into the film script.";

	schema:reviewBody "Directed by Clarence Brown this patriotic World War II film boasts a cast of a dozen or more familiar faces including Irene Dunne Alan Marshal Roddy McDowall Frank Morgan Van Johnson C. Aubrey Smith Dame May Witty Gladys Cooper Norma Varden and Peter Lawford. And that's just the credited cast. Tom Drake June Lockhart Elizabeth Taylor and Ian Wolfe also appear.The story is told mostly in retrospect by Susan Dunn Dunne who is evidently a head nurse at a London hospital in WW II on the eve of DDay. Though she was born and raised by her newspaperman father Hiram Morgan in Oklahoma she's saying that it seems like she's lived all her life in England. She recalls coming to the green land as a young woman on an ocean liner in April 1914 with her father and a young man Johnson who'd made their acquaintance. Hiram is proud to be an American and has a lot of grumbling to do about the differences between the two countries and their cultures. After nearly two weeks on vacation Susan hasn't seen very much of London outside of museums nor met anyone besides those living in the boarding house run by Varden where she and her father have stayed. That all changes on the last evening when an old gentleman the Colonel Smith decides to take her to an exclusive party which includes the Queen!At the party Susan meets Sir John Ashwood Marshal who sweeps her off her feet and convinces his mother Lady Ashwood Cooper to invite her to stay. Hiram begrudgingly allows her to stay an additional week but returns to America himself. After days of idyllic life on the Ashwood's large estate John proposes to Susan. Though she doesn't accept immediately sighting the differences between them he more or less forces her to accept by chasing her back to London and insisting. Hiram toasts them at the wedding and the young couple goes yachting on their honeymoon Wolfe is the boat's Captain. However WW I breaks out and John must report to his unit to serve as an officer. For three years Susan lives with Lady Ashley and Nanny Whitty the woman who'd raised John and his brother Reggie John Warburton who's killed in the war. Later Susan is allowed to travel to France to spend a weekend with John. Nanny tells Susan they should take care of business while they see each other. While in a seaside hotel in Dieppe together they learn that the United States has entered the war. A French band actually plays our National Anthem.Susan returns to England and nine months later has a child a boy. She and Nanny bring the baby to see the Colonel at the boarding house in London. They hear a band playing American patriotic music and go to the window. The Yanks are marching down the street in perfect formation while a proud Susan holding her baby looks on. The British are grateful. The next scene shows the Colonel phoning the Ashwood's to inform them of the Armistice and learning that John had been killed in action. Susan is distraught but encouraged by Lady Ashwood to tough it out. So she raises her boy John Jr. McDowall with help from the Lady Nanny and her father who seems to have come to stay with them. John Jr. rides his horse around the large estate stopping to see a young girl Betsy Taylor. There is an odd scene at a luncheon outdoors to which John Jr. has invited two neighborhood boys who happen to be German. The implication is that they are proud of their heritage and are aware of their country's plans to try  conquer the world again. Hiram warns Susan of the inevitability of another war prompting her to make plans to sell the estate and return to America with John Jr.. But the boy convinces her otherwise and they stay. Betsy and John Jr. grow up together then WW II breaks out. We see John Jr. in uniform Lawford now saying goodbye to Betsy Lockhart now.The story returns to the present with Susan examining DDay casualties as they arrive to assign them to the appropriate wards. Of course John Jr. is one of them. Later on his deathbed he relates how he was injured to his mother telling of a young American Drake in his bunker located in the same general area of his conception in France.The film closes with Susan looking out the window thinking platitudes about honoring the dead by continuing the fight.".

The cast was excellent and they managed to evoke much emotion out of a fairy tale like story. One of the few remakes worthy of discussion. I would consider this a must see for anyone who has any kind of feelings whatsoever.";

A remake of 1941 semiclassic HERE COMES MR. JORDAN HEAVEN CAN WAIT may not surpass the delightful whimsy of the original classic but it emerges as somewhat of a modern classic in it's own right. The film was an instant hit with both critics and audiences was nominated for an astounding 9 Oscars including Best Picture and remains a magical film that is almost impossible not to love.Beatty not only proves himself to be a perfectly competent film director and the picture also provides the star with one of his best roles as an actor. Beatty's goodnatured football player Joe is the exact type of lovable stud that you cannot help but fall for. The film's screenplay takes Joe from earth to heaven and to back to earth again through an assortment of various bodies and Beatty's easygoing charisma holds it all together and keeps viewers involved in the story and fixated on the screen. This is a star performance if there ever was one and Beatty has rarely been more likable.The rest of the cast is particularly winning. The still silvertongued James Mason in a part originally offered to the retired Cary Grant as the heavenly Mr. Jordan and the endearing gruff Jack Warden are perfect as father figuretypes for Beatty's Joe and Charles Grodin and Dyan Cannon are absolutely terrific as the film's pair of villains. The only performer missing the boat is a blah Julie Christie who is pleasant but unconvincing in the sadly underwritten role of the ecologist love interest of the body Beatty has temporarily inherited. It seems as though the creators thought dressing Christie in frumpy wardrobe and frizzy hairstyle was enough to give the character depth but all they succeeded in was making a natural beauty look rather hideous.The film is a joyous comedic piece of whimsy that manages to incorporate slapstick comedy romance fantasy and even an underdog sports story without ever feeling bloated or disjointed. The true emotional highpoint comes with Mr. Jordan's farewell to Joe as well as Max failing to recognize him in his new body. The rather shallow development of Christie's character leaves the film's THE WAY WE WERElike finale ringing a bit hollow but it's still an effectively bittersweet coda nonetheless. This film launched a major revival of whimsical comedies that remained popular until the lateeighties and it easily remains the best effort of this revival.".

Some modern offerings include Mr Destiny Maid to Order and the TV shows The Flying Nun and Touched by an Angel. None of these kinds of films have much in the way of cutting social commentary or even groundbreaking cinematic techniques. However their entertainment value is very high being nothing but. Heaven Can Wait is this kind of a movie maybe the perfect chick flick as it combines fantasy football and even a little love story.The story is relatively simple Joe Pendleton Warren Beatty a quarterback in the twilight of his career feels destined to make it to the Superbowl. The LA Rams his team are in the playoffs. One day during earlymorning training after consuming his liverandwhey shake he bicycles into a tunnel where two large vehicles taking both lanes are charging from the other direction of the tunnel. Looks like Pendleton will be playing in a Superbowl coached by Vince Lombardi with George The Gipper Gipp as one of his teammates. The next thing he knows he's jogging among clouds with an escort played by writerdirector Buck Henry who also played the hotel attendant in The Graduate in a suit and tie trying to get him to stop running around. Pendleton is still in his athletic clothes sporting a soprano saxophone and doing pushups among the fluffy billows. He doesn't quite realize he's died. Or has he? Turns out the escort made a mistake Pendleton would have survived perhaps avoided the collision but the escort nabbed him from his body before the resolution of the event relying on probability and outcome a recurring theme of the movie. Pendleton was not due for many decades.His case is taken up by Mr Jordan James Mason in one of his later roles a kind of heavenly supervisor who apparently coordinates peoples' souls. Realizing the mistake Jordan takes Pendleton back to earth to find him a new body so he can live out the rest of his life as he was meant to. The only one available is the body of millionaire Leo Farnsworth who has just been murdered care of his estranged wife and personal assistant played brilliantly by Dyan Cannon and Charles Grodin. One of the best scenes is when Pendleton reappears as Farnsworth and Cannon nearly has a conniption. Pendleton now as stuffy gazillionaire Farnsworth must forge a way to get back to the Rams in time for the Superbowl.The aspect that saves this film from falling too far into sentimental gush or absolute unbelievability is the quality of the acting of the leads particularly Warren Beatty Charles Grodin Dyan Cannon Julie Christie James Mason and Jack Warden as Max the Rams' trainer coupled with a fine screenplay. Everything is believable. Certainly the whole concept is just about as farfetched as the Land of Oz but you never contemplate that possibility for a moment. For some reason everything works and you run with it not unlike It's a Wonderful Life. As silly and fantastical as it is the trip is well worth it.".

I saw each of these films more than once during that summer a transition time for me and the memories come flooding back each time I see even a movie still or quick clip from any of those films. Heaven Can Wait is an excellent remake of an equally excellent 1940's classic Here Comes Mr. Jordan changing the dead character from boxer to football player but pretty much keeping everything else the same.Robert Montgomery's boxer was killed in an airplane crash coming back to earth due to the fact that an overzealous angel took him before waiting for the outcome. Warren Beatty's football player is bicycling through the Hollywood Hills and killed by speeding automobiles going through a tunnel. Escorted into heaven's waiting station by the same overzealous angel Buck Henry he insists that he doesn't belong there. Head angel Mr. Jordan James Mason discovers that indeed he was supposed to arrive years later and now they must find another body for him to return to earth in. More concerned with getting to the super bowl Beatty turns down the variety of bodies he is given and finally settles for a murdered millionaire whose wife a hysterically funny Dyan Cannon and assistant Charles Grodin conspired against. Now Beatty must not only get himself ready for the superbowl he must also prevent his second demise which he tries with heavenly guidance.Julie Christie Beatty's oft 1970's costar gives a lighthearted performance as a British activist out to prevent a nuclear plant from being put into her home town. Of course that becomes a major plot point to get them together romantically and gives Beatty something more to do than just turn millionaire Farnsworth's mansion into a football training camp. In great support there's Jack Warden as Beatty's former coach stumped by his return Arthur Malet and Joseph Maher as eccentric servants having an amusing conversation concerning Beatty's constant meeting with the invisible angel James Mason in a closet and Vincent Gardenia as the police investigator who exposes the crimes at Farnsworth Mansion.A great screenplay by Beatty Elaine May and Robert Towne makes this delightful fantasy flow with witty dialog and the codirection by Beatty and Buck Henry keeps things at a lighthearted pace. This is a film definitely worth sharing with family and one you will want to see again and again.".

	schema:reviewBody "I finally saw the last of the five Oscarnominated male leading performances from 1978 and although I'm still not sure about who deserved to win and why Brad Davis wasn't even nominated for his performance in Midnight Express I admit that something deeply touched me in Warren Beatty's performance as Joe Pendleton a Rams quarterback whose life was prematurely taken in a road accident. I don't know if it's in the eyes or in the way he looked so young despite his 40's but the sweetness and gentleness of his character made the film.Having only watched the remake with Robert Downey Jr. I thought Pendleton would reincarnate as a person and then realize who he was while Beatty remains the same person only using bodies as convenient media for his own personality which is ethically acceptable since all the bodies he takes would have been 'dead' otherwise. Joe only occupies bodies as settings for his own persona illustrating the eternal philosophical connection between the body and the spirit. Now I can't wait to see the original version by Ernst Lubitsch with its evocative title  Here Comes Mr. Jordan.Heaven Can Wait made me wonder how I would react from the announcement of my own death? I guess more than from the loss of people I love I would be sadder because of all the things I would never have the possibility to do again to have totally annihilated my chances to be a specific person to be whatever I wanted to be and never having the chance to be something else. For Joe it's the same disbelief tainted with a sort of childlike optimism he's dead yet still believes he has a chance to achieve his only dream playing in the Super Bowl. Joe's personality is the emotional core of the film as it embodies our personal vision of happiness to be what we plan to be. It's all about our plans and Heaven Can Wait tackles this issue with the constant idea that everything that is done is determined by fate a plan made by an almighty entity.The film's most fascinating aspects lie between this incertitude of what is life and death what is determined and what is natural and Beatty's tactful direction never takes its message about life and death in a too depressing tone keeping more in the tradition of Lubitch and Capra's films and the hero's childlike attitude is compensated by the domineering presence of James Mason as a suave and comprehensive Head Executive aware of the bureaucratic mistakes that accidentally took his life. This point is crucial because it explains why I used the expression 'life was taken' instead of 'killed' and why Joe is given a second chance he wasn't meant to be dead. And Joe is so goodhearted that he'll use this occasion to act positively by taking the body of Mr. Farnsworth an eccentric billionaire and controversial figure of the industrial world a man whose life is targeted by his associate and wife Charles Grodin and the Oscarnominated Dyan Cannon in irresistible comical performances.From a meaningful introspection in the concept of life and death the film flirts with pure comedy through the switchedbodies formulas and allows Beatty to shine as an altruistic person who'll almost redeem Fansworth for the sake of community and whose only selfish motive would serve his dream to play on the Superbowl. This opens the gate to the two most poignant aspects of the story the beautiful friendship with Corkle Jack Warden as his coach and the growing romance with Julie Christie as one of Farnsworth's detractor a British ecologist who'll be touched by the amount of generosity he'll suddenly display. Again the onscreen chemistry between Beatty and Christie is perfect and the romantic bond growing between them is tactfully handled by a subtle and nuanced direction combined with the villainous pair of Grodin and Cannon.But more than a romance and a fantasy the film also work as a great Sport film. In a interesting business meeting scene Joe states his personal vision by comparing business with what he know best football. This is crucial as it highlights his most endearing virtue fair play. Joe doesn't do good actions because it's good but because it's fair as it was fair that he would be allowed a second chance. Joe's second chance was also Mr. Farnsworth's second chance and then Tom Garrett's one of his teammates if life is not to be taken for granted neither is death. Fairness is the driver of the film and something that elevate it beyond the level of a simple comedy which makes us accept the idea that Farnsworth had to die and that Joe couldn't live forever with his spirit in another body.This leads to a heartbreaking scene where the only one who knew Joe's secret his buddy Corkle realizes that Joe's spirit vanished leaving him alone again with his souvenirs and his clarinet Jack Warden almost made me cry and I'm glad his performance was recognized by the Academy. Then Joe as Tom meets Julie Christie again and he wonders if they haven't met. This very moment echoes a previous scene where he was aware that his days in Farnsworth's body were numbered and then told her that she might find him somewhere in another form and the ending gives a subtle idea of what the plan is about and why sometimes we can't help but having a feeling of dj vu or of having lived some situation in different eras.In a way Heaven Can Wait's ending is bittersweet because we must face the death of Joe's spirit the only price for him to play in the Super Bowl. But I'm glad the film ended with the perfect touch by leaving some hints that his gentle spirit didn't entirely disappear in all fairness ".

	schema:reviewBody "I was really enjoying this movie. It was moving along at a good pace I thought Warren Beatty was giving a good performance  and then the last twenty minutes threw in a plot twist that was totally unexpected which would have been fine except that it made no sense. That along with some illogical parts to the storyline really brought this movie down a notch or two in my estimation.Beatty played Joe Pendleton a quarterback for the Los Angeles Rams who finally gets a chance to quarterback his team in the Super Bowl except that heaven makes a mistake. The Escort Buck Henry wants to save Pendleton the pain of dying in a road accident and so plucks him out of his body before the accident happens. Unfortunately Pendleton wasn't supposed to die in the accident but by the time the mistake is figured out his body is cremated so he has to return to earth in the body of the fabulously wealthy Mr. Farnsworth. First problem. Everybody has a time to die. OK. It's bad that The Escort brought Pendleton to heaven before he was supposed to die. But isn't it equally bad that Pendleton gets to keep living through the lives of two people whose time was supposedly up? Seems to me that would throw everything off balance too. What if Pendleton as Farnsworth or the quarterback whose body he took over and I have to confess that name escapes me killed someone after their time was supposedly up? Seems to me that would create real problems. But the real problem for me was the ending.SPOILER AHEADWhy all of a sudden is Pendleton told that he won't be allowed to remember anything and will simply live as the quarterback whose body he took over? I thought the point was that Pendleton wasn't supposed to have died. But in effect heaven's Mr. Jordan James Mason kills him anyway by wiping away his memory when everything in the movie to that point suggested that he could keep living as Pendleton in someone else's body. I don't mind a plot twist but that just made no sense to me.Anyway the movie is entertaining in spite of those plot problems. I enjoyed Beatty's performance as Pendleton knowing nothing about business attending Farnsworth's company's Board meeting and completely changing everything the company had been about by convincing the directors to look at things like a football game. That was quite humourous. Jack Warden was quite good as Rams' trainer Max Corkle who tries to get Farnsworth's body into shape for the Super Bowl and Charles Grodin Dyan Cannon and Julie Christie also offered good performances here.610".

	schema:reviewBody "A charming stylish update of the 1941 film Here Comes Mr. Jordan that starred Robert Montgomery and Claude Rains Warren Beatty's 1978 fantasy romance Heaven Can Wait is the rare remake that arguably equals or even outshines the original. Although fans of Beatty's work on Bonnie and Clyde and Reds may find this film a trifle by comparison nevertheless solid performances and a sharp screenplay by Elaine May and Beatty have kept this near classic fresh for almost thirty years.As Joe Pendleton a quarterback who is snatched from his body before his time by an overeager angel Beatty is all goodnatured charm especially as Austin Farnsworth the first replacement body that he tries on for size. Beatty surrounded himself with a great cast of supporting players. From the distinguished James Mason as Mr. Jordan Joe's heavenly agent who works to rectify the error to Jack Warden as Joe's friend and trainer Max Corkle to the glowing Julie Christie as Joe's romantic interest there is not a false note. However the scenestealers are Charles Grodin as Farnsworth's scheming doublecrossing secretary and Dyan Cannon as Farnsworth's unfaithful wife. Whenever these two are together the film hits its comedy high notes.Directed by Beatty and Buck Henry the film's production values are first class. The cinematography is lush and the Oscarwinning art direction is well rendered. The Farnsworth mansion which is an interior decorator's heaven is a riot of floral prints and fresh flowers whose patterns and colors almost distract from the dialog.From It's a Wonderful Life to What Dreams May Come and Defending Your Life tales of heavenly visitors and afterdeath experiences are a popular genre perhaps because they are reassuring and comforting. How can anyone fear death if there is a Mr. Jordan on the other side to greet you? The pain of loss is easier if a loved one might be nearby in the body of another. Heaven Can Wait plays to these sentiments without descending to sentimentality. As light entertainment Beatty's take on the afterlife is about as good as it gets.".

It is only in the field of American Football that I was rather lost as for a nonamerican this game is totally incomprehensible  after all what does 285 mean they keep shouting that all the time ??? .All the actors give magnificent performances and some very comic situations arrive. Of course we are a little frustrated that Beatty has to lose his memory at the end once he has reintegrated his definitive terrestrial body but one look at Julie Christie and the mention of quarterback sees off a happy ending to the film and so it should be. I love light fantasy films of this style and this one is a gem. The most moving passage is when Beatty as Farnsworth is trying to infer to Corkle that he is in fact Joe Pendleton and Corkle obviously think's he's crackers. Then Mason says try a little music and Beatty plays Ciribiribin on his clarinet. The look on Corkle's face is at this moment unforgettable. In fact poor old Corkle is victim of events beyond his control like at the end when Beatty has forgotten his past in the changing room and Corkle alone addresses him as Joe and he looks at him in utter amazement. The look of incomprehension on Corkle's face is unforgettable. Unfortunately we don't get to see what happens to him at the end as the film pursues and ends with Beatty and Christie !! Anyway the test of a good film is that you can watch it over and over again without getting tired of it . For me this film easily passes this test !".

	schema:reviewBody "Clint Eastwood and Lee Marvin  in a musical?  Yes and it works rather well.      No expense was spared by Paramount in assembling the behindcamera talent.  Lerner and Loewe's successful stage show was beefed up by Andre Previn's compositions and Nelson Riddle's arrangements and a script by Paddy Chayefsky.  If Clint and Lee aren't exactly Mario Lanza and Tito Gobbi they are good enough.  Clint sings timidly but tunefully I Talk To The Trees Gold Fever and Marvin's growly Wandering Star was a big chart success back in 1969.  The songs are strong the lyrics clever and the choreography slick and busy.  At two and threequarter hours the film is rather too long but it contains plenty of interesting things including some excellent comedy.     NoName Town is a rough and ready prospectors' settlement one of many such ramshackle communities springing up during the California Gold Rush. Two very different men link up as partners and grow into inseperable friends.  'Pardner' Eastwood is a straight solid farmer from the Mid West while Ben Rumson Marvin is a hellraising wildman from no place in particular.  When a mormon auctions one of his wives Elizabeth played by Jean Seberg Rumson buys her.  Things get complicated when Pardner falls in love with Elizabeth and she falls in love with .... er both men.     Added interest is provided by the arrival of a bunch of French whores and a party of rescued wagontrainers this last was drawn from a true story.     Good things include a barnstorming performance from Marvin radiating enormous personality and a real flair for comedy.  His career flowered late but he was at his best in the late sixties Point Blank Hell In The Pacific and of course this one.  Previn's musical interlude which introduces the Parson Alan Dexter is superb leading into one of the film's best songs Here It Is.  The comical discords of the musical passage are a joy in themselves and they pave the way perfectly for the Parson who is at odds with everybody.  Hand Me Down That Can Of Beans is rendered by the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band guesting in the movie.  The boys obviously decided to stay on because they crop up in various shots throughout the film.  Mad Jack is played with manic zest and a peculiar British accent by Ray Walston none other than TV's My Favourite Martian.     The interminable gag of the collapsing tunnels stand as a metaphor of the film's shortcomings  overelaborate and overlong.".

	onyx:emotionText "Clint Eastwood and Lee Marvin  in a musical?  Yes and it works rather well.      No expense was spared by Paramount in assembling the behindcamera talent.  Lerner and Loewe's successful stage show was beefed up by Andre Previn's compositions and Nelson Riddle's arrangements and a script by Paddy Chayefsky.  If Clint and Lee aren't exactly Mario Lanza and Tito Gobbi they are good enough.  Clint sings timidly but tunefully I Talk To The Trees Gold Fever and Marvin's growly Wandering Star was a big chart success back in 1969.  The songs are strong the lyrics clever and the choreography slick and busy.  At two and threequarter hours the film is rather too long but it contains plenty of interesting things including some excellent comedy.     NoName Town is a rough and ready prospectors' settlement one of many such ramshackle communities springing up during the California Gold Rush. Two very different men link up as partners and grow into inseperable friends.  'Pardner' Eastwood is a straight solid farmer from the Mid West while Ben Rumson Marvin is a hellraising wildman from no place in particular.  When a mormon auctions one of his wives Elizabeth played by Jean Seberg Rumson buys her.  Things get complicated when Pardner falls in love with Elizabeth and she falls in love with .... er both men.     Added interest is provided by the arrival of a bunch of French whores and a party of rescued wagontrainers this last was drawn from a true story.     Good things include a barnstorming performance from Marvin radiating enormous personality and a real flair for comedy.  His career flowered late but he was at his best in the late sixties Point Blank Hell In The Pacific and of course this one.  Previn's musical interlude which introduces the Parson Alan Dexter is superb leading into one of the film's best songs Here It Is.  The comical discords of the musical passage are a joy in themselves and they pave the way perfectly for the Parson who is at odds with everybody.  Hand Me Down That Can Of Beans is rendered by the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band guesting in the movie.  The boys obviously decided to stay on because they crop up in various shots throughout the film.  Mad Jack is played with manic zest and a peculiar British accent by Ray Walston none other than TV's My Favourite Martian.     The interminable gag of the collapsing tunnels stand as a metaphor of the film's shortcomings  overelaborate and overlong.";

Other singing duties are performed by the splendid Harve Presnell and a rousing mostly male chorus for this is a musical western of a more robust kind than Seven Brides for Seven Brothers. It's plot which concerns mining for gold polygamy and the building of a town fairly races along. Logan handles the whole thing with great aplomb and brings to it some nice naturalistic touches sadly lacking from his earlier musicals South Pacific and Camelot.

More is the pity too because the movie has much to offer. The scenery is beautiful the sets reconstructions are first rate. Listen to the lyrics of some of the songs 'Gold Fever' and 'The First Thing You Know' are two good examples and you can appreciate the wordsmithing skill of Alan Jay Lerner. If you like a large allmale chorus the film offers some of the best singing of that kind you are likely to hear. Listen especially during 'There's a Coach Coming In'.I must confess a guilty admiration for characters who are unapologetically amoral and corrupt at least as defined by 'respectable society'. I wouldn't necessarily want one for a neighbor or even a friend well .. maybe but they are fascinating on film or stage. If the film is a comedy they can be hilarious and often steal the show. All you need is the right actor to fill the role. Paint Your Wagon offers one of the most uproariously amoral characters on film brought to amazing life by Lee Marvin. He delivers Ben Rumson's imminently quotable homespun philosophy of life with great relish and comedic timing. Can he sing? No. But then would a somewhat dissipated Gold Rush miner likely be a good singer? His nonsinging actually fits.The rest of the cast is good but not exceptional. Ray Walston is memorable as Mad Jack. I still find it hard to spot the actor I am used to behind the beard and accent. He also has some great lines. Harve Presnell is the only truly majorleague singer in the cast and delivers the most memorable song. The remaining actors are adequate. Eastwood is good but replaceable. Jean Seaberg is not Meryl Streep but is certainly easy on the eyes. The townsfolk are solid.An enjoyable movie with Lee Marvin's performance worth the price of admission. It is too bad it requires such a long time commitment to experience it all.".

	schema:reviewBody "Unfortunately Paint Your Wagon came at a time when big budget musicals were going out of vogue. The expenses of this film nearly bankrupted Paramount and it was many years before the studio recouped its investment. Another big Broadway hit from the same era Finian's Rainbow also came to the big screen a few years earlier and bombed at the box office.Paint Your Wagon ran 289 performances for the 19511952 season on Broadway. Daring in its time Paint Your Wagon had an interracial love theme. That was too tame for the newly liberated silver screen from the Code and here we have a woman Jean Seberg marrying two gold miners Clint Eastwood and Lee Marvin. This might be the first story on screen about polyandry unless you count Noel Coward's Design for Living and that was a heavily censored version.Listening to Lee Marvin it sounds like an eminently practical arrangement. Lee saves Clint Eastwood after a fall and nurses him back to health and he makes him a partner. Then he 'buys' at auction Jean Seberg who is the second wife of passing Mormon John Mitchum. Since Clint's a partner in everything sharing a wife seems a sensible arrangement. Lee's character Ben Rumson has some very interesting ideas on morality especially morality out in the wilds. You'll have to see Paint Your Wagon to hear him explain his views.Jean Seberg's voice is dubbed by Anita Gordon but Eastwood and Marvin do their own numbers. For Marvin he does it in the tradition of Rex Harrison and Richard Burton in those other Lerner and Loewe musicals and it comes off nicely. Clint Eastwood's many talents do not include singing however.But as it turned out Paint Your Wagon needed all the help it could get at the box office. They could have cast a singer in Clint's part but where was there on who could play the role be the right age and bring in the dollars. By 1969 there really was no such male singer in Hollywood. Probably in the fifties someone like Gordon MacRae or Howard Keel might have done it then.The comedy is pretty raucous from Lee Marvin's original ideas on sex to the whole town caving in because of all the mine tunnels beneath. Paint Your Wagon holds up well and it's not as bad a film as has come down by reputation. It might be painful for Clint Eastwood fans to hear him sing though.".

Lee saves Clint Eastwood after a fall and nurses him back to health and he makes him a partner. Then he 'buys' at auction Jean Seberg who is the second wife of passing Mormon John Mitchum. Since Clint's a partner in everything sharing a wife seems a sensible arrangement. Lee's character Ben Rumson has some very interesting ideas on morality especially morality out in the wilds. You'll have to see Paint Your Wagon to hear him explain his views.Jean Seberg's voice is dubbed by Anita Gordon but Eastwood and Marvin do their own numbers. For Marvin he does it in the tradition of Rex Harrison and Richard Burton in those other Lerner and Loewe musicals and it comes off nicely. Clint Eastwood's many talents do not include singing however.But as it turned out Paint Your Wagon needed all the help it could get at the box office. They could have cast a singer in Clint's part but where was there on who could play the role be the right age and bring in the dollars. By 1969 there really was no such male singer in Hollywood. Probably in the fifties someone like Gordon MacRae or Howard Keel might have done it then.The comedy is pretty raucous from Lee Marvin's original ideas on sex to the whole town caving in because of all the mine tunnels beneath. Paint Your Wagon holds up well and it's not as bad a film as has come down by reputation. It might be painful for Clint Eastwood fans to hear him sing though.";

	schema:reviewBody "I've never understood the cloud of negativity surrounding Paint Your Wagon a terminally eccentric raucously bawdy musical western epic in which old school tough guys Lee Marvin and Clint Eastwood get to sing or at least do their best. Sure it's a giant unwieldy spectacle not all of the songs make a three point landing and it runs on far too long but it's such an interesting piece from many perspectives it doesn't deserve even half the shade thrown on it by critics over the years. I like it specifically because of how odd and random it is at times how it meanders and lingers across the gold rush frontier town it takes place in following the paths of it's strange characters diligently. Marvin is the life of the party as Ben Rumson a booze soaked misanthropic prospector idling his way through the west in a haze of hangovers and hijinks. Eastwood is Pardner a soft spoken stoic type whose life is saved by Ben and the two strike a bond that's eventually tested by Elizabeth Jean Seberg the beauty who loves them both. The trio makes the best of life in a rough n' tumble settlement called No Name City a feverish shantytown on the precipice of nowhere populated by scoundrels miscreants and hooligans. And that's pretty much it the story punctuated by a whole gallery of songs some brilliant and others excruciating. The best is a haunting melancholy melody by Marvin called 'Wandering Star' which is so good it could be listened to on repeat. 'They Call The Wind Mariah' is a gorgeous tune belted out by a young looking Harve Presnell as Rotten Luck Willie a slick kingpin who basically runs the township. 'There's a Coach Comin In' rouses spirits and the titular theme is well staged too. Unfortunately all of the songs sung solely by Eastwood are a slog through the mud as he bleats like a goat and gets saddled with the most boring tracks like 'I Talk To The Trees' the sappy 'Elisa' and 'Gold Fever' a musical sleeping pill. Whenever Marvin is around it's a banger of a party he goes the extra mile to keep the energy levels unbridled while Eastwood is a little sleepier. There's no way the film deserves the dodgy reputation it's been slapped with though a lot of it is fun as all hell the big budget is spent well on fantastic production design epic sets and big names who earn their keep Marvin in particular.".

In fact it's a delightfully homegrown story and its tongue in cheek awareness of its own make it up as you go ethic is wholly part of the movies charm. And what's not universal about striking out on your own in the company of kindred spirits met along the way? The music is downright terrific there's not a bad tune in the bunch. I'm particularly fond of Hand me down that can of beans as performed by the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band it doesn't appear on any of their albums. Wandrin' Star and I Talk to the Trees are so catchy that even Lee Marvin's croaking and Clint Eastwood's warbling respectively can't muck 'em up. The big hit of course is Maria mareyeah but from the rousing opening opening theme Where am I going I don't know. When will I get there I ain't certain. What will I do I ain't equipped to say. But who gives a damn I'm on my way!  it's clear that the film is carried along by quite a different sort of manicdepressive momentum. From The first thing you know to Ben's wedding day to Four Cabin Walls to The Best things in life are dirty to Noname city the plot just rollicks along.

However it does have legends Lee Marvin and Clint Eastwood teaming up for this one time engagement that caught my interest. I can understand why these guys chose this project as a departure from the tough guy roles they are normally cast in. However if you are a fan of either star's work Paint Your Wagon is a painful 3 hour experience that I wish on no one. Paint Your Wagon is an inane big budget flop that is pretentious dated and criminally stupid. I'm sure the studios wished to court a more arty audience with this crap but failed to generate success at the box office or receive acclaim from critics. Essentially Paint Your Wagon is lowbrow entertainment for a highbrow crowd. Any way you slice it this film is crud. This westerncomedymusical was intended to be a huge hit by the studios. Paint Your Wagon is epic in scope with a huge cast enormous great looking sets and great cinematography. On the technical end of things Paint Your Wagon is pretty solid. The epic treatment does not make up for the other film's faults or why they even considered making this at all. The storyline is about as dumb as it gets and a cast of hundreds of extras and the frequent need to break into song can not and does not compensate for a story this bad. Clint Lee and French actress Jean Seberg do their best to carry this garbage and make it somewhat watchable. Paint Your Wagon is an epic failure disappointment and waste of time. While these guys are best known for their work in the action genre Lee Marvin and Clint Eastwood are talented actors and artists. In fact some of Clint's left turns are some of his most interesting films. Either way it worked out okay for those involved. Jean Seberg got a free trip to America Lee Marvin got drunk and Clint Eastwood got to bang Jean Seberg.

	schema:headline " A Better Film Than Its Original Reviews";
	schema:reviewBody "Paint Your Wagon has often been sited as an example of a bigbudget film that lost its way. The problem for the film was that it was released at a time that the traditional Hollywood musical was dying. Motion pictures such as Bonnie and Clyde and Midnight Cowboy were ushering in the age of dramatic realism. However with the film's release now more than forty years in the past it holds up amazingly well and is thoroughly entertaining.The film follows the life of two gold mining partners Lee Marvin and Clint Eastwood who find themselves in love with the same woman Jean Seberg. The twist is that she is in love with both men. The solution is that Seberg's character marries and lives with both of them. This unusual family is made possible by the fact that they find themselves in a rough gold mining camp in the California wilderness. Eventually the trimarriage breaks down due to a variety of circumstances and one of the husband leaves and one stays.The oftendismissed production values of the film now look amazing. Alan Jay Lerner shot much of the film outside of Baker City Oregon in the wilderness. The town No Name City was recreated to scale. Indeed no studio would greenlight this kind of bigbudget musical film today. One of the things that make it so special is that a modern audience is seeing something that could not be produced in the present.Along with the production values the music is exceptional. There are no throwaway songs and against the backdrop of the Oregon wilderness they come alive. When it was released Marvin's and Eastwood's voices were ridiculed. Once again the passing of time has led to audiences that don't expect the perfect pitchandtone musicals of the 1940s and 1950s. Their voices sound like that of a couple of gold miner's.No matter the age group this is a film that is worth seeing. Undoubtedly it will be a pleasant surprise for young and old.".

The antisocial gold miner is a perfect character for him. Even his singing fits the character rough and basic. I don't know about anyone else but at the end of the movie when Lee Marvin's character Ben Rumson is leaving looking for a place where the people haven't got to yet I'm sad. I'm sad because I know that places where people haven't got to yet are almost gone even though there are still a lot of this type of person around.The music the lines Harve Presnell Ray Walston and Lee Marvin are terrific. The rest of the cast are OK. Harve Presnell would go on to play Miss Parker's father in The Pretender on TV but in this movie he is young flatout gorgeous with a heavenly voice. Ray Walston is his usual best. Lee Marvin is great. Flat out great. I remember reading that his widow said that he identified with this character the most out of all his roles. Everybody seems to remember him singing A Wanderin' Starbut I remember him singing The First Thing You Know. That was perfect for this character. It said everything.If you haven't seen this movie yet watch it with an open mind no preconceived ideas and I think you will love it as much as I do.".

It does have some nice photography costumes and sets and the score and songs are very pleasant and hummable. Out of the cast Ray Walston and Harve Presnellwho actually has the best songs come off best and the chorale work directed by Roger Wagner is some of the finest ever heard in a musical. However Joshua Logan's direction didn't work I personally found it too stagebound and smug. Also the dialogue doesn't convince the film is too long and the story is forgettable and has one too many silly moments. The acting is nothing special and while the singing isn't amazing it was passable. Lee Marvin's rendition of Wandrin' Star is listenable and some of his comedy is a nice touch. Wasn't sure about Clint Eastwood though I was perplexed at his casting initially and after hearing his singing my opinion hasn't changed. In conclusion if I had to make an honest summary of this film I would say worth watching for the music chorale work and production values if little else. 510 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "Like the title says Cobra is one of my personal favorite action horror films of all time that it is mixed with action and horror. It is one of the best underrated 80's slasher films I have ever saw. You can see my title I am a huge Rambo fan I am huge Sylvester Stallone fan he is my number 1 favorite action star. Rambo films will always be Sly's number 1 my personal favorite action franchise. Cobra is my number 2 favorite action film of all time. Rambo First Blood Part II Rambo III and Cobra are my personal favorite 80's action films of all time. Cobra is my second favorite film because it is directed by George P. Cosmatos who reunited with Stallone a year later. Cobra is highly entertaining underrated action  horror flick.I would put this movie right between Rambo First Blood Part II Rambo III Terminator 2 Judgment Day Predator 1 and 2 Hard Target Robocop John Wick 1 and 2 and Aliens a great action flick.Cobra is directed by George P. Cosmatos who directed Rambo First Blood Part II my all time personal favorite action film of all time. I thought George P. Cosmatos directed well the movie I love Cobra to death it is a decent action film from the 80's I love love love this movie to death! This is Stallone's answer to Dirty Harry. The reason it looks like Dirty Harry is because there were 2 actors who played in Dirty Harry Reni Santoni and Andrew Robinson who both played their characters respectfully in this movie. Sylvester Stallone adapted the screenplay from the Paula Gosling novel Fair Game. He was written a script for Beverly Hills Cop but he was fired from Paramount so he make this movie. Cobra is also part of The Cannon Group Inc. The film ultimately proved to be a critical and financial disappointment.A serial killer known the Night Slasher Brian Thompson  is terrorizing the city in L.A. he kills everyone old people children young girls everyone. Lt. Marion Cobra Cobretti Sylvester Stallone is the only cop who try's to prevent the murders and stop the killer. But the trail leads to an army of killers who are murders cult who believe in New World they want to whip everyone in the city  the weak people in the society so the strongest survives. There is only one witness a girl Brigitte Nielsen who can identify the leader of the cult she is a treat to them they want to waste her. Cobra is the only who is able to protect her at any cost.Lt. Marion Cobra Cobretti is my comic book hero my all time ultimate favorite action hero. He is onemen army assault force with his laser submachine gun and pearlhandled Colt .45 spit pure crime stopping venom. This my favorite action hero of all time John Rambo is my first hero Cobra 2 and John Matrix from Commando is 3.Brigitte Nielsen did an excellent job as female lead Ingrid Knudsen she was excellent she remind me on my mom in the 80's I love her she is so likeable character in this movie. Brian Thompson was terrifying one of the best creepy slasher villains I have ever seen. He was decent at acting. The film has tons of action in this movie there are explostions people are been slashed in the hospital and axed in the parking garage. Cobra gun fire with his 45. Colt gang of motorcycles he spills a psycho with gas and he torches him in to fire. Cobra machine guns annihilate bikers on a motorcycles in his truck who are following him. You have a great chase in the car Night Slasher and his side kick are car chasing Cobra and Ingrid great chase. I love Cobra's car 1950 Mercury Monterey Coupe with his nitrous oxide engine.I love the music theme from Sylvester Levay for the movie. I love the soundtracks for this movie Angel of the City by Robert Tepper Hold on to Your Vision by Gary Wright and Feel the Heat by Jean Beauvoir. This film come the same year as Friday the 13th Part VI Jason Lives Aliens The Hitcher Top Gun and even Schwarzenegger's Raw Deal and I would put this movie over Raw Deal and I don't understand the hate for Cobra.The film is short and goes fast paced around. It is my personal Stallone's favorite action film and it is rated R and they don't make movies like this anymore.".

Marion Cobra Cobretti is my comic book hero my all time ultimate favorite action hero. He is onemen army assault force with his laser submachine gun and pearlhandled Colt .45 spit pure crime stopping venom. This my favorite action hero of all time John Rambo is my first hero Cobra 2 and John Matrix from Commando is 3.Brigitte Nielsen did an excellent job as female lead Ingrid Knudsen she was excellent she remind me on my mom in the 80's I love her she is so likeable character in this movie. Brian Thompson was terrifying one of the best creepy slasher villains I have ever seen. He was decent at acting. The film has tons of action in this movie there are explostions people are been slashed in the hospital and axed in the parking garage. Cobra gun fire with his 45. Colt gang of motorcycles he spills a psycho with gas and he torches him in to fire. Cobra machine guns annihilate bikers on a motorcycles in his truck who are following him. You have a great chase in the car Night Slasher and his side kick are car chasing Cobra and Ingrid great chase. I love Cobra's car 1950 Mercury Monterey Coupe with his nitrous oxide engine.I love the music theme from Sylvester Levay for the movie. I love the soundtracks for this movie Angel of the City by Robert Tepper Hold on to Your Vision by Gary Wright and Feel the Heat by Jean Beauvoir. This film come the same year as Friday the 13th Part VI Jason Lives Aliens The Hitcher Top Gun and even Schwarzenegger's Raw Deal and I would put this movie over Raw Deal and I don't understand the hate for Cobra.The film is short and goes fast paced around. It is my personal Stallone's favorite action film and it is rated R and they don't make movies like this anymore.";

	schema:reviewBody "My favorite best Stallone action movie. But from the 80's that Stallone made action films is the first stand alone film not meaning Rocky and Rambo. Cobra will never stop been my favorite best action movie horror thriller from the 80's that is out there. It is one of my personal favorite movies. I wish only the movie wouldn't be that short but still it was directed by George P. Cosmatos who directed Rambo this movie was made right after Rambo First Blood Part II was released. Cobra is also a Cannon film and one of the best action horror thrillers that is out there. Cobra simply rocks! And it is a highly entertaining underrated action flick that guarantees the viewer a great show. Cobra is another one of those movies. It's not deep it has a social message but doesn't really care about it. Its just pure old fun. The night slasher kills people randomly. He targets anyone anywhere. The police don't have a clue they can't stop him all they can do is wait for the next death. But that all changes when Ingrid gets a good clear look at the chief of the gang. Yes it's not one person it's a group of killers that have set their minds on hunting the weak of society. Now they'll do anything to kill the only witness the woman that can finish their 'dream' but they didn't count on one man Marion Cobretti. The movie plays with the idea that murderers use the system to get away with their crimes. It explores the fear in society the impotence of the courts and introduces Cobretti a cop who doesn't care about the law only his justice. Although I don't agree with this I still enjoyed the movie since Stallone didn't spend much time making his point rather went fast for the action.YOU'RE THE DISEASE AND I'M THE CURE!!!!!!!! Cobra is a 1986 American action film directed by George P. Cosmatos and written by Sylvester Stallone who also starred in the title role. The film costars Reni Santoni Brigitte Nielsen and Andrew Robinson. The film received negative reviews with much criticism focused on the overuse of genre tropes yet it debuted at the number one spot on the U.S. box office and became a financial success.The film was loosely based on the novel Fair Game by Paula Gosling which was later filmed under that title in 1995. However Stallone's screenplay was originally conceived from ideas he had during preproduction of Beverly Hills Cop whose screenplay he heavily revised. He had wanted to make Beverly Hills Cop a less comedic and more actionoriented film which the studio rejected as being far too expensive. When he left that project Eddie Murphy was brought in to play the lead roleA toughoncrime street cop must protect the only surviving witness to a strange murderous cult with far reaching plans. The cult and their leader The Night Slasher are killing people all over the town in Los Angeles for believing in their New World so that will the strongest people survived but their is one tough cop that stands in their way and he must protect a surviving witness that cab identify the Slasher. I seriously love this film from the 80'a and I wish there would be more films like this. The Action sequences the explosion death scenes are fantastic after Rambo here comes Cobra.Is one of my best Stallone Action movies beside Tango  Cash 1989 Rambo Rocky Cliffhanger Demolition Man and The Specialist it is one of my favorite action movies of all time! 1010 Grade Bad Ass Seal Of Approval".

It's a violent campy 80's Stallone vehicle that is a lot of fun. Cobra is a cool character with catchy one liners and an awesome 50 Merc Coup. He wears sunglasses and a match in his mouth. A rouge cop who works the zombie squad and is a lonely guy until he meets an aspiring model who he's been hired to protect.

	schema:reviewBody "Let me start by saying that I fully understand all the people who hate this film. After all it is a violent often extremely stupid machoactioner which falls apart if you start to think it's contents for a second. Its characters are onedimensional and there's really not much plot or dialogue. But while many others think of the above as a bad thing I think I've just described the recipe for a perfect action film.I recently watched Vampires on DVD and listened to John Carpenter's commentary and one comment amused me. When James Woods and his crew were outside a building supposedly filled with vampires everyone was wearing vests and neckpieces which protected them from being bitten except James Woods and Carpenter said about this something like You can see how everyone is wearing vests except James Woods because he's so tough. Such is the case with Cobra also. All the other cops are dressed like...well cops but Stallone he really stands out from the crowd in a positive way with his tight jeans Tshirts a pair of really cool and very 80s sunglasses and a match in his mouth which I thought was a very nice touch. And why does he look like this? You guessed it  because he's so tough.As I said before there's not much plot and what there is is pretty stupid and generic. We have seen it many times before and we will I hope! see it many times in the future but hey if it ain't broken why fix it? Of course there are several people who think it has always been broken.. There are some sequences and dialogue in Cobra which are almost embarrassingly stupid such as the opening shot where the team of killers are weaving axes to the air and then there are the legendary lines The court is civilized isn't it...pig? But I'm not.. This is where the law stops..and I start..sucker! but I'm just so glad that they included these scenes even though they probably knew that the critics wouldn't like them because they are my favorite scenes in the movie.This is a movie which has a very very specific target audience and the reason for all the bad reviews is probably the fact that unlike other movies like this this was for some reason targeted to a wider audience and of course many people didn't like it. Not because Cobra is a bad movie but because they just don't like films like this. Surprisingly the other movie which was also based on Paula Gosling's novel the William BaldwinCindy Crawford actioner Fair Game suffered the same fate. Needless to say I also liked that film a lot.I know most people don't like the movies that I like and that's OK but I want others to know that I personally have seen probably over a thousand action movies and this is one of my alltime favorites and that there are many many others who have truly enjoyed Cobra and it has become a cult classic to action fans worldwide. And when everyone starts to really think about it Cobra may just be the perfect movie. There are so many films made in the 90s which are OK. They are not great but they don't suck either. Cobra however has all the ingredients that action fans love and others hate. It doesn't leave anyone cold you either love it or you hate it. But I'll say this If you like films like Schindler's List or Shakespeare in Love and you rent a film with a tagline Crime is a disease. Meet the cure. COBRA you truly deserve what you see!Cobra is an excellent action movie because of a great macho performance I loved the deep voice! and screenplay from Stallone a truly phenomenal score from my favorite composer Sylvester Levay tight editing by Don Zimmerman and good cinematography by Ric Waite who was also the director of photography in my other favorite Marked for Death starring Steven Seagal. I also praise the director George P. Cosmatos although I haven't liked his other movies as much as this.Anyway the name and the tagline really says it all. You're either going to love or hate this and all I can say is if you look for any intelligence in a movie don't see it. I do but not in an action movie. Actually I don't even want action films to be smart or sophisticated. For me Cobra delivers! I give it a full 1010.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film deserves much more credit than it has received. Stallone is looking great with tight jeans and stubble chewing on a matchstick which comes in handy in the final bloodshed showdown. Stallone plays Marion Cobretti in a superb action packed thriller filled with one liners in a funny relationship with his partner played by Reni Santoni sexual tension with his female witness in protective custody played by his then wife Brigitte Nielsen and a raging fury from Stallone intent on eliminating the ruthless killers headed by Brian Thompson Arnold Schwarzenegger rips his heart out in The Terminator and JeanClaude Van Damme knocks him out with one kick in Lionheart. These people mean business and Andrew Robinson Scorpio in Dirty Harry thinks that a subtle solution can easily be thought of to take them out but it is only Stallone's violent tactics that can ultimately save the day. Essentially Rambo with a badge with the heart of Rocky. Stallone fans will be very pleased in a film that combines all areas of cinema not just action. Comedy romance and a great cast complement this already excellent film that Stallone has written which incorporates material from Beverly Hills Cop when he was meant to play Axel Foley. Better that Eddie Murphy Played it because Stallone has a chance to make this two years on. Trivia Eddie Murphy looks at the Cobra poster in Judge Reinhold's bedroom in Beverly Hills Cop II that Brigitte Nielsen is also in. If you like the Dirty Harry films Steven Seagal cop films and a Stallone fan in general this is a great film with an excellent soundtrack. Talking of Steven Seagal and soundtrcks on the trailer for Seagal's Marked For Death it features Chase a Sylvester LeVay track from Cobra.".

	schema:reviewBody "With two Rambo movies First Blood 1982 and Rambo  First Blood part II 1985 under his commando belt Sylvester Stallone had confidently confirmed himself as the Box Office king of the Action Thriller genre. With all the gingoism and American flag waving that went with the comic strip adventures of the worlds favourite fictional viet nam vet Stallone steps up a gear into Cobra 1986 one of the tightest exciting well written and underrated action movies of the past few decades. Stallone takes British crime novelette Running Duck US  Fair Game from celebrated writer Paula Gossling and gives it the full Rambo gloss treatment. Gone from the novel is the alcoholic schizoid lead character and in his place is Marion Cobretti the typical four square Stallone character and the story is all the better for this. Stallone' screenplay is pretty simple and so is the under lying message that evil is a force that must be met on its own terms. So what we have is a violent actioneer chock full of punch ups car chases and shooting. Sadly the script isn't developed enough and the Rocky elemnts so typical of Stallone's movies at this point IE the underdog hero who everyone is against is used to the maxim here. Unlike the Rocky movies the glare of humour isn't up to scratch and so a great many of the lead characters are unlikeable. So what? Wasn't this the case with thrillers such as Seven or Resovoir Dogs? However Rambo Director George Pan Cosmatos gives a fresh coat of paint to this particular movie adding stylish touches of film noir to the action genre in a way that precceeds FaceOff 1997 and a whole host of successors. Bridgette Nielsen is the movies real surprise giving a likeable and sincere performance as Helgar under the watchful eye of her then Husband. What is really surprising is that Cosmatos manages to succesfully blend into the action genre touches of classic and contemporary horror movies such as Friday the Thirteenth and John Carpenters Halloween with the chilling depiction of the Night Slashers. The movie also contains some of the most exhilerating action and chase sequences particularly in the movies climax where Cobra lets rip unto the Night Slashers men. This is an underrated gem a very efficient StalloneGeorge Pan Cosmatos vehicle and very possibly the best ever Menahem Golan Yoram GlobusCannon Film Group picture ever produced. .......................................................................810".

Cobra is in a supermarket on the trail of a guy who's killing safeway employees for fun. Cobra's in pursuit. He passes a 6foot display case of Coors light. Stops. Cracks a can. Takes a sip. Tosses it on the floor. Continues in pursuit.It reminds me of another 80s action flick few will remember called the Punisher with Louis Gossett Junior. Some dufus is carrying pizza into the torture chamber where LGJ is getting it. EXCEPT HE'S NOT GETTING IT guys. He's already knocked the guy out with a punch and a pressure point maneuver. Then Gosset neutralizes the pizza guy. But rather than let the pizza which is all over the floor go to waste he kneels down takes a couple of pieces bites then leaves the room as though nothing has happened.I learned a lot from Cobra and Stallone's character Marion Cobretti. First I need to get a nitro option on my car so I can go as fast as he did. Second is a great line to reel in the girl next time you're out on a date and she's using too much catsup on her fries.Do you have a lifejacket? Why To save all the french fries that are drowning.This movie is a classic for 80s action lovers. I own the DVD and highly recommend it.".

	schema:headline " This is where the law stops...and I start!";
	schema:reviewBody "When I watch this movie now it really brings back the days of my youth when things like wackedout cult members and maverick cops that shoot first and ask questions later seemed to be plausible career choices.  Oh do I remember the days of playing guns with my buddies and spewing some of the wretched oneliners from this masterpiece.  With that you may be thinking that I despise this movie or that it doesn't hold up to today's high standards of moviemaking.  Actually no.  I love this thing!  Every time I watch it it gets better and funnier.  Where once the lines of this film danced through my childhood dreams of punking bad guys in back alleys they now leave me rolling on the ground with laughter.  Hey how can you not enjoy a little Stallone with a freaking match in his mouth and a wearing a pair of aviators spouting lines like You're a disease and I'm the cure? Not to mention how could you not have seen this what with TNTTBS playing it about 35 times a year since 1990?  Also I love how people rip on how overthetop and phony 80's movies are with all the explosions and the onemangang takedowns of entire armies composed of the same five guys getting killed in different fashions.  What makes me laugh is that today's movies are no more realistic.  Have you seen anything with Vin Diesel in it? Bond anyone?  Watching these movies too much could make anyone believe in the freaking Easter Bunny!  Anyway if you haven't seen Cobra please check it out.WARNING DETAILED SYNOPSIS BELOWThe movie begins with a sleazoid taking a supermarket hostage.  In fact just to show what a punk he is he parks in a handicapped spot and shoots a nerdy kid in the back with a shotgun.  So how do the cops handle this mess? Enter Marion Cobra Cobretti complete with aviator sunglasses and matchstick in the mouth.  He's tough hardnosed and basically unemotional kinda like Stallone.  He enters the supermarket gets on the intercom and admonishes the baddie by telling him Hey dirtbag!  You're a lousy shot! I don't like lousy shots!  You wasted the kid...now it's time to waste you! Man if life were that simple.  Judge.  Jury.  And executioner.  But how could Sly have known he was auditioning for Judge Dredd way back in '86? Anyway after a sip of beer from the display stand Stallone finds himself face to face with the nutcase who threatens to blow the whole place up. Stallone deadpans Go ahead...I don't shop here.  Before the guy can draw his gun Stallone chucks a knife into the wacko's gut but not before telling him I don't deal with psychos I put 'em away.Afterward we find out that the dirtbag belonged to a cult that wants to wipe out the weak people of society.  They bang axes together and try to look menacing especially their leader who has a jaw that puts Chyna to shame.  Yikes.  However some cops on the force think that Cobretti's methods are slightly archaic and they let him know this especially a weasely looking guy that really has it out for Cobretti.Later Ingrid Brigitte Nielsen a model sees these pantyhoseovertheface nutballs acing a girl under an overpass and fears for her life after she sees Jaws' face.  Shortly she is attacked by the cult after her photoshoot is done but manages to escape their clutches and is put under police protection at the hospital.  However an attempt is made on Ingrid's life that is thwarted at the last minute by her pulling the fire alarm.  As a result Cobra believes that someone on the force leaked info to the cult. His solution is to move Ingrid to a safehouse while he continues the investigation.  Cobra and Ingrid get into one car and Cobra's partner Sgt. Gonzales and a buttugly skank the leak get into another car and head to the safehouse.  As to be expected a move is made to eliminate Ingrid albeit in broad daylight.  In one of the most hilarious scenes I have ever seen in a movie Stallone manages to spin his car while going full speed never miss a beat and continue to go full speed in reverse in order to riddle the pursuing cult members full of bullets.  I don't know about you but my car never does 60 when I back out of my driveway.  Also the closeup shots of Stallone's face while he shifts gears and glances at Ingrid are truly bada and pssyourpants hilarious!After avoiding the meatheads for now Sly and the Family Stallone if you will do it Cobra's way and head up to a motel room where they wait for the cult to show up.  Obviously they do since their nasty skeezer is riding shotgun to Gonzalez.  Upon finding them at the motel the cult begins setting themselves up for Cobra to mow them down.  Another chase leads them to some kind of metal factory where they can take on Stallone one by one. He gladly accepts the challenge by lasingsiting a grenade and acing a few culties.  After being doused in some sort of flammable liquid Number Two gets a lit match thrown onto him while Stallone slurs You have the right to remain silent.  A man of few words but amazingly such a wordsmith. Anyway this all leads to the showdown between Big Jaw and Cobra. According to Sly This is where the law stops...and I start...sucker!  Wow!  Good stuff.  Blah! Blah! The typical fight ensues with Jaws getting the upperhand until Stallone hulks up must have got it from Hogan on the set of Rocky III and spears the guy on a huge hook.  Then while the dude screams in agony Sly watches him get incinerated in a huge oven.  Now that's justice. Something to watch for during this finale how many times Jaws says the word PIG! with a bunch of slobber and cuds shooting out of his mouth might I add.So if you're in the mood for a real sidesplitter that was intended to be serious check out Sly in his one man war on evil.".

	schema:reviewBody "Rating  12 out of  Cobra is an 80s flick all the way made back in the days when macho action flicks featuring oneman armies reigned supreme so it's technically a movie that should be right up my alley. But watching it again for the first time in over ten years it serves more as a reminder that making a macho classic isn't quite as easy as it seems and why Schwarzenegger's Commando will always be the standard by which the oneman army genre will be judged. Hell forget Commando I'd estimate Cobra is only about half as good as Dolph Lundgren's The Punisher if that says anything about where this rates in the annals of 80s macho action cinema.Sylvester Stallone stars as Lieutenant Marion Cobretti a triggerhappy L.A. cop who shows little mercy to the scum of society. Naturally he's the perfect man to protect a model Brigitte Nielsen who's the target of the Night Slasher Brian Thompson the head of a nasty cult that wants to create a new world order. They've got their sights set on Nielsen because she saw the Night Slasher exerting one of his more intense facial expressions on a particularly dark night and that's apparently enough to deem her an eyewitness to a murder she clearly didn't see.Anyway it's obvious how the rest of the movie will play out Cobretti will make out with the model somehow keep her completely unharmed even when getting the both of them into lots of chases and shootouts and he'll kill all the scum before riding off with the babe into the proverbial sunset. If you think I'm giving too much away then you definitely haven't seen enough action movies.While its an unwritten rule that one usually doesn't watch these kinds of action movies for plot I think it's fair to say that one at least hopes for a fairly consistent flow in its narrative or for the writer in this case Stallone himself to offer up a compelling MacGuffin that bridges the action scenes well enough to hold interest between the shoot 'em up action. No such luck here a fair portion of the plot is structured around the cult and their serial killings but the film just glances over the cult's motives and what is revealed sounds like it was badly adlibbed by Brian Thompson on the spot.Just as bad is the main story revolving around Cobretti protecting the model. Despite being a reallife couple at the time Stallone and Nielsen have no chemistry making their scenes together painfully awkward and unconvincing. Even Schwarzenegger and Rae Dawn Chong worked way better together in Commando and there wasn't even any attempted romantic tension in that relationship. If you actually rooted for Cobretti and the chick to get together by the end you are a better person than me.Even with all these faults what ultimately kills the movie is that it's just not much fun. The action scenes are fairly plentiful and a few of them are even reasonably decent the big car chase is wellshot and edited and a later chase scene where Cobretti mows down a lot of bikers from the back of a pickup truck hints at the fun flick this could have been if it had boasted more selfknowingly outrageous moments like that but without any care towards plot or character it's hard to get involved in all the mayhem especially when a lot of these scenes are mired in boring clichs the final showdown is set in a foundry argghh I hate that setting!.Even worse is the fact that almost everyone involved seemed painfully unaware they were making pulpy escapist cinema. Aside from a few very unsuccessful oneliners Cobra is too serious in tone to genuinely enjoy. A lot of action movies that take themselves seriously manage to work because of at least mild attention to plot and characters without these elements the laziness of the filmmakers becomes more obvious as we watch a film that wishes to be taken seriously there's a halfhearted attempt at a message about the hypocrisy and ineffectiveness of justice without going into the effort to deserve that merit and that's just plain insulting.".

Not only is he stealing George Michael's lyrics Sly is also pinching his wardrobe Black leather gloves and matching jacket tight jeans boots reflective sunglasses and chin stubble. What Lt. Marion Cobretti is doing on witness protection detail while he could be cruising men's rooms is beyond me.Cobra is a very '80s film sort of a stupid cousin to the many Dirty Harry wannabes being pumped out at the time. The plot is ridiculous even by the weak standards of this genre. A gang of axewielding psychos are taking out those they view as weak in pursuit of a New World Order. Man you couldn't wake up any morning in the 1980s without hearing about some new gang of serial killers busting out.At least Lt. Cobretti is on the job. Better known as Cobra or the Cobra he carries a special pistol with a cobra head illustration on the handle stock not to mention an attitude just a little one as he himself admits. Machine guns grenades all are found in his tool box but he keeps a matchstick in his mouth instead of a cigarette so kids won't get bad ideas.The killer gang doesn't seem all that subtle attacking one waitress inside her car on a city street. Yet they carefully guard their privacy to the point that when their faciallydeformed leader is glancingly spotted in the act by a model played by Brigitte Nielsen he pulls out all the stops to kill her. Sending his minions out to get whacked by the Cobra the psycho sneaks into a hospital where she is being looked after. We get shades of Halloween II as she runs for her life through deserted corridors. You'd think he'd give up especially as he risks being spotted by others trying to kill this one witness but no this guy continues after her through the movie Ahab in a stocking mask.Yes indeed Cobra is one stupid film. It's also unpleasant in its stale echoes of reactionary politics punchy in its attempts at humor and threadbare in terms of character and motivation. One police supervisor played by Andy Robinson one of two actors from the cast of Dirty Harry Cobra sidekick Reni Santori being the other whines about Cobra's strong arm tactics which Cobretti effectively counters by physically assaulting him  twice.What's good here? The lighting is very effective giving the film a glitzy sheen very in tune with the time. Though his acting is stiff Stallone never looked better which may be why he does so little with his character  too busy vogueing. The cars and equipment are cool to look at and there are some terrific stunts.But the stunts are done in service of action scenes that don't work. Cobra fights off humanwave style attacks by dozens of motorcyclists who seem to be competing for the best wipeout. The big shootout at the end is unbelievably protracted with Cobra hitting everything he aims at with a snub machine gun while not one of the dozens of shootists firing at him manage much of anything.This whole sorry ordeal is some damn sick joke if you ask me Robinson's police supervisor complains. Actually Cobra isn't played as a joke at all but very straight a big part of the problem. One useful aspect of Cobra is it gives the lie to the phrase mindless entertainment. In order to be entertaining a mind has to be working somewhere. When one isn't the result is this.".

He thinks that to fight those he has to act like them.That is how he gets into conflict with his boss Monte who is presented as a liberal freak who'd rather let people get killed than to use violence on the evil men. In a particular scene Cobretti and his colleague Gonzales are talking about how they'd like to punch a hole in this Monte's chest. They are halfjoking about it but you still feel that those triggerhappy cops would pretty much be able to do it anytime if they felt like it.That same Monte is also presented as the person responsible for hiring a traitor female cop and forcing Cobretti to work with her. The result of this is that Cobretti almost gets killed because of the leftwing tolerant attitude of this liberal superior.At the end of the movie Cobretti saves the day by using every technique he knows to exterminate his foesshooting them blow them up put them on fire etc. and then goes to punch his liberal boss in the face.What really fascinates me the most in this film is how those ideas were mainstream less than 20 years ago. How crowd were supposed to react positively to this final punch in the mouth making a statement that liberals were responsible for the rise of crime in our society.".

	schema:reviewBody " MILD SPOILERS In possibly the greatest characterisation ever seen on screen beating even Welles' Citizen Kane Sylvester Stallone sizzles onto the screen in his blistering answer to Clint Eastwood's overrated Dirty Harry series.  Swaggering onto the screen wearing a unique style of clothes that will never go out of fashion Sly effortlessly portrays a cool streetwise cop who's not taking no st from nobody.

I can't tell my girlfriend and once I've satisfied the urge well naturally I feel quite disgusted with myself. You understand though I can't help it I should explain. Mostly the urge involves turning down the lights flicking on the TV and baying snobbishly and unpleasantly for 90minutes at films like Cobra. So far I haven't found a support group for this compulsion but I'm looking into it.So I suppose in some ways I should feel grateful to Cobra because if films like this didn't exist I should be forced to watch Star Wars again. And while this would undoubtedly sate my feelings of smug superiority it would nonetheless be masochism and I have enough of a problem with my urge as it is.I suppose I should feel grateful but part of the problem with my condition is that I can't. Cobra has to be one of the worst films ever made. If the illegitimate child of Miami Vice and Dirty Harry mated violently with the less poetically inclined twin of the Death Wish brothers it might bear nagging resemblance to Cobra. Cobra is living proof that were it possible to surgically remove the 1980s from the sphere of human history thereby losing my childhood Gandhi Bladerunner and Live Aid it would be a price worth paying.Both dialogue and delivery make the fromage of Bruce Willis positively Shakespearian in comparison. Take the following line as a sample Hey dirt bag you wasted that kid for nothing. Now I think it's time to waste you! or perhaps the following KillerThe court is civilized isn't it pig? Sly But I'm not. This is where the law stops and I start  sucker! Sly got a screen writing credit for this film by the way. I mean Rocky isn't exactly Hamlet but what a comedown. It's incredible to think that two scant years later Die Hard was in the cinemas.What is more extraordinary about Cobra is that the performances camerawork and score are more lame than the script.Anyway unless you suffer from a similar compulsion to mine avoid this film. It shares the credit with Commando for being the sphincter of 1980s cinema  and boy  as mister 'cott would say  that's saying summut. 110".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a true action movie. I feel no hesitation in stating that and no hesitation in watching this movie as such. It's solely about a Dirty Harry style police officer known as The Cobra. He works on what's called the Zombie Squad and when the regular cops can't get the job done they call the Cobra.When a cult like gang of serial killers begins targeting random civilians in an attempt to bring about anarchy Cobra is set on the case. One witness a fashion model played by the gorgeous Bridgette Nielsen is the only witness to one of the gangs murders and they are bent on hunting her down and slaughtering her. Only Cobra stands between her and certain death.Good god this movie is fantastic to watch. Stallone once again shines in the lead role kicking ass and not bothering to take names. He deals with your typical thugs at times and faces down a whining sniveling by the book cop who despises Cobra's tactics. That whining cop is played fantastically well by Hollywood veteran Andrew Robinson of Hellraiser and Dirty Harry fame. At its core though this film is about the battle between Cobra and the gang of psychopaths. The film rarely strays from that and appropriately so.As for the rest of the cast they all do a wonderful job in their roles. Bridgette Nielsen is jaw dropping and this is one of those movies that I love to refer to as a perfect storm. On the surface it should be a mediocre film that probably wouldn't work at all. But because of the cast because of the story writing and direction because of the cinematography and even because of the era in which it was made this film simply instantly became a classic.One final note about the cast. If you've watched enough in the way of movies and television especially from the eighties and nineties you will instantly recognize Brian Thompson. Thompson plays a character here known as the night slasher. A ruthless psychotic who enjoys murder more than he enjoys breathing. Thompson is fantastic in these types of roles and it's almost as if he was born for them.If your an action fan you will love this movie. There are plenty of high speed chases gun battles and insanely intense moments. Nielsen and Stallone work fantastically well together and Stallone plays Cobra to perfection. If ever there was an action film that could be called pure raw action this is certainly it.".

But D2K actually has a lot to recommend itit has a strong engaged bada performance by Seagal one with no obvious bodystunt doubles or voice dubbing a straightforward story and the kind of action you'd expect. The direction while not splashy is competent a rarity for recent Seagal flicks.Now to be honest it would take a few more million dollars a lot of retakes some recasting of supporting roles and a car chase or two to make this into a theatrical actionexploitation flick along the lines of Taken. But for a DTV movie Driven to Kill is actually quite exceptional. And for a Seagal DTV this is up there near the top of the heap with Urban Justice and better than Pistol Whipped. It reminds me of a Charles Bronson low budget mid80s movie like Murphy's Law. However the shortcomings that affect all direct to video movies with their short shooting schedules and low budgets also brings D2K down a bit as well. The biggest problem is that about half of the supporting performances are embarrassingly lamethe female police officer and the oily lawyer in particular. And there were also some really strange choices made for the film's score. Upbeat Russian folk music during dramatic and violent beatdowns? Seems odd to me. In fact sometimes the music behind the action is so illfitting that it seems like we're listening to a placeholder score that the filmmakers intended to replace. They might as well have said hey get that old polka albumwe'll use that music for the part where Ruslan cracks the guy's neck!But despite these flaws I really enjoyed D2K. It has a small scale old school action vibe that I could get into and little to none of the unintentionally comedic incompetence we have come to expect from Seagal's output over the past decade.".

Having said that I know that he has made his share of clunkers lately so my expectations weren't very high when I brought this home. Surprisingly I really enjoyed this and was impressed with the way the director shot most of the action sequences. I don't have a terribly wordy review for this DVD but I will say this the action is engaging throughout and the knife fight is a must see! The ending scenes in the hospitalwar zone were also well done and Seagal finishes the bad guy in his trademark early '90s style. Better than a lot of his recent flicks in my opinion so check it out if you like Seagal and hardaction flicks.".

	onyx:emotionText "First off I am a shameless Seagal fan who owns a high percentage of his videos. Having said that I know that he has made his share of clunkers lately so my expectations weren't very high when I brought this home. Surprisingly I really enjoyed this and was impressed with the way the director shot most of the action sequences. I don't have a terribly wordy review for this DVD but I will say this the action is engaging throughout and the knife fight is a must see! The ending scenes in the hospitalwar zone were also well done and Seagal finishes the bad guy in his trademark early '90s style. Better than a lot of his recent flicks in my opinion so check it out if you like Seagal and hardaction flicks.";

To compare it to his earlier movies would be unfair as he makes much smaller budget movies these days. First off if you are a veteran of Seagal films of the last ten or so years you can tell if he cares about the movie or not and he certainly seems to be putting a bit of effort into this one. No body doubles of bad dubbing in this which is good. The story is very generic a basic revenge movie. Not unlike the movies Charles Bronson made when he was a similar age to Seagal now. The action scenes are well done with some good shoot outs and fist and knife fights. The acting is a little hit and miss although the bad guy who will be familiar to people who seen the awful Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull was very good. So worth a rent on a Friday night but i really wish Hollywood would give Seagal another big budget action movie. Hell lets get another Under Siege movie out before its too late.".

	schema:headline " Actual quote from Seagal in this movie  I'm kind of a dinosaur";
	schema:reviewBody "So about a year ago I set out on a fallacyridden quest to watch every movie that Seagal has ever made and while this has not exactly made for much highquality entertainment it has definitely given me a unique perspective on the evolution of Seagal's storied career. Although one of the first of Seagal's new generation of films that I watched was Urban Justice which showed an aging and widening Seagal lurking around Los Angeles seeking a two dimensional revenge for his son's murder and Driven to Kill as indicated by the title is pretty much about exactly the same thing. Except this time the son is a daughter. Oh and he's a NOVELIST. Did I mention that? Did Stephen King write this thing?My initial response to learning that Seagal plays a successful novelist was shock that they actually took my advice and tried to top Against the Dark for stupid story ideas but it actually turned out to be one of the best things in the movie. The funniest things anyway. Don't get me wrong I have much more respect for Seagal than most people do. I have always been a fan of his films ever since I was a kid and he was making hardened action movies and I even still enjoy them now that they are growing less and less distinguishable from each other. But seeing Seagal's considerable mass parked in front of a computer while his meaty hands prance across the keys was quite a spectacle indeed. I would venture to guess that Seagal has never sat in front of a keyboard in his life!Sure this is a digression but it calls into question his logical thinking in the movie's opening scene. He is sitting with his daughter to whom he is still the greatest man on earth and she asks him to explain how he does that old trick with the three upside down paper cups one of which has a metal spike in it. She moves the cups around with all possible slowness challenging him to lose track of it and then he slams his hand down on one of the cups which smashes harmlessly. How do you do it? she asks incredulously. The trick he says is to just not give a fk. Or more likely the trick is to not understand that one false move and your writing career will be in grave danger because your sluggish typing will now have to be done with one hand.The plot from Hard to Kill is recycled into this one. Seagal plays a former Russian mobster named Ruslan and when an attack leaves his daughter barely clinging to life he insists that her attackers can't know she's dead in order to aid his revenge plot which takes up the rest of the movie. Complicating matters is the fact that her daughter is set to marry the son of Ruslan's former gangster archenemy who may have been behind the attack in the first place. Ruslan is torn from a charming life of living in his sundrenched beachhouse and meandering his fingers across his keyboard and back into a life of crime. Seagal's performance is uninspired at best but he has made a career out of uninspired performances. Or at least his career has fizzled out into one uninspired performances. Van Damme has done the same thing but he changed everything in the outstanding 2008 film JCVD. This is what Seagal needs to do now to win back his respect as an actor make something real and quit pumping out the lumpy directtoDVD cheeseballs. The rest of the actors are beside the point they run distant second billing to an actor who passed his prime nearly 15 years ago it happened in 1996 in case you're wondering and so don't really merit being mentioned here. But a bigger problem is that the movie does that maddening thing where there are foreign characters Russian in this case who switch back and forth at random between speaking Russian and speaking bad English. If you're going to make a movie with foreign characters just start it out in their language and then casually switch to English for the rest of the movie like in The Hunt For Red October or just have them speak their own language for the entire movie and subtitle it. Switching back and forth just calls attention to it.More importantly the action is badly screwed up. There is nothing quite so boring as these stupid shootouts where a lot of guys take turns spraying machine gun fire at each other taking turns pumping all their bullets into the walls and then hiding so the other guy can shoot his gun equally harmlessly. It's like a road where every single car is blowing it's horn. No one really pays attention anymore it just becomes noise. But if nothing else you gotta watch the movie for the scene in a strip club. Seagal and the bad guy's son go to a strip club and go to a private room together with a stripper and you should see how uncomfortable Seagal looks it is HILARIOUS!".

I'm certainly a fan of the man's glory days Above The Law Hard To Kill Marked For Death Out For Justice Under Siege 12 On Deadly Ground but was disappointed by almost everything that came after Exit Wounds. I really liked Urban Justice and Pistol Whipped but the most annoying thing was the Obvious Stuntman for all the fight scenes. The budget wasn't too big either anymore. Kill Switch gave me mixed feelings because there was some good and hard action in that one. But the production values were rather bad. Against The Dark had Seagal in an actionhorror flick which could have been a nice change for him but the story had already been done to death Resident Evil Dawn Of The Dead 28 days later etc... With Driven To Kill Seagal goes back to the basics with an actionrevenge story. Also nothing new there but the result is surprisingly entertaining. The story is exciting has a really good cast and the action is awesome. Not the moves from Above The Law but come on that was 20 years ago. The Aikido master is too old for that. But there is a lot of hard physical contact shootouts and at the end the local hospital turns into a war zone. If you enjoy a really good action movie where are they these days ?? do not miss out on this one. You'll have a good time and witness the return of the true Steven Seagal. He is still the man. Can't wait for the next one. The master is back..".

Are you sure that you can trust Seagal to play a Russian. He didn't even sound like a Russian he was just himself but there was nothing that looks even closely Russian on him he spoke Russian in some scenes but he didn't even try to pronounce the Russian words more precisely and when I remember... that Schwarzenegger put some effort in Read Heat and he sounded pretty good while speaking Russian and he even tried as much as he can to have a Russian accent. And that's what I appreciate... But Arnie is no actor too. Now back to Ruslan... the fight scenes in this film are the only thing that justify everything else meaning the fight scenes were good and they are the only thing worth watching here well on moments they looked funny and they were filled with this Russian balalaika music and that made scenes even more funny I expected Seagal to stood up and dance to this music having a good dancing rhythm but not fighting rhythm.

If you are Russian and you happen to know English do yourself a favor and watch this in English. You'll probably end up on the floor laughing.Steven is absolutely hilarious in this one. No i am not talking about his Russian yet. First of all we actually get to see him RUN...yes he does run for like 10 seconds or so himself so try to imagine that. Yes he looks old even wider than in Urban Justice. Fights are... well in KillSwitch we actually see Steven fight through fast cuts...in here we don't even get that. After watching this i understand why they dub Seagal's voice... in this movie he isn't dubbed  he talks with his own voice the whole time...which is the problem  you sometimes simply cant understand what the .... is he saying! The absolute finish is the Russian language in this film. This is supposed to be Russian mafia....not gangsters. Whoever was a technical adviser for this movie  you failed miserably. I am talking about Russian language only people don't talk like that and especially former Russian mafia. For God's sake they don't say Do Svidania to their family or brothers! They don't talk in English between themselves if they speak Russian fluently.As for the film itself  shaky camera work strange mix of music which starts to frustrate the more you watch stupid subtitles why did not they use subtitles every time someone speaks in Russian??? instead they use it only 2 times throughout the whole film and the rest remains untranslated...To sum it up  this is slightly better funnier than Attack Force and a lot worse than Urban Justice and KillSwitch.".

If you are Russian and you happen to know English do yourself a favor and watch this in English. You'll probably end up on the floor laughing.Steven is absolutely hilarious in this one. No i am not talking about his Russian yet. First of all we actually get to see him RUN...yes he does run for like 10 seconds or so himself so try to imagine that. Yes he looks old even wider than in Urban Justice. Fights are... well in KillSwitch we actually see Steven fight through fast cuts...in here we don't even get that. After watching this i understand why they dub Seagal's voice... in this movie he isn't dubbed  he talks with his own voice the whole time...which is the problem  you sometimes simply cant understand what the .... is he saying!

Babe asks Steven to close his eyes. It's not as if you'd be able to tell Seagal's face is constantly in a contorted squint. He doesn't seem to ever actually pronounce a line just whisper his way through the film. Perhaps he thinks a Russian accent is a whisper? Driven to Kill is not a driven film. For instance why that title? Is Ruslan driven? It doesn't seem so. No one in the film seems to know exactly what it going on not excepting the star. It is an uninspired lackadaisical but certainly not lazy film that makes an bizarre addition to the revenge genre.All of the characters confuse themselves for each other until the film starts to resemble particularly runny porridge. Seagal's exwife and his daughter look the exact same age. The villains are all similar and none too smart but at least aren't all named Ivan. The detectives are excruciatingly bad actors that make Steven Seagal look like Marlon Brando.The cinematography is surprisingly decent. Overall the film doesn't outwardly look like a lowbudget flick. It was surely filmed on the cheap in Canada and made to look like the United States. The action and fighting isn't terrible and kept me interested to see how our aging hero would take down the next baddie.Driven to Kill is the epitome of a lowbudget fairly intriguing action movie ideal for late night viewing and late night reviewing. If you're a fan of Seagal or a fan of cheese add it to your queue.".

But Steven Segal??? I can do that. Find me an all you can eat buffet next to a tanning salon and I will be in Segal shape in no time.Whether it is Liam Neeson rescuing his daughter in Taken or Harrison Ford taking on the bank robbers in Firewall or those geriatrics in Lethal Weapon 4 there is plenty of room for action heroes that are more AARP than Tai Kwan Do.So I am not going to harp on the fact that Stephen Segals film reminds one of an alternate past where Orson Wells had starred in Good Guys wear Black. Nor will I point out that his hand eye coordination is so out of whack he cant even type at a keyboard convincingly on camera. Heck I wont even mention his Costneresquire mastery of a Russian Accent.I want to know why this is considered a return to form for Segal by some critics. Segal is back and he is hungrier than ever crows one. The revenge plot so simple Charles Bronson would have blushed. The movies idea of a plot twist is a character who practically wears a tshirt that says Im a bad guy ask me how... turns out to be gasp a bad guy. The fist fights remind me of Blazing Saddles You Brute You Brute and the gun fights are right out of Top Secret Two guys five feet from each other hiding behind crates. I could go on but good lord this film is cheap. Throw in some CGI gargoyles and this wouldnt be out of place on the Scifi Channel. The actress that plays Segals exwife Inna Korobkina is a year younger than the actress that plays his daughter Laura Mennell. They put an old lady wig on her and hopped noone would notice. On another strange side note IMDb also has Ed Anders as thug 3 and Mike Desabrais as thug 5 but no word on the fate or identity of thugs 1 2 and 4. I admit I have liked some Segal films in the past such as Under Siege and have found others unintentional laugh riots On Deadly Ground is one of the funniest most entertaining bad films I have ever scene. Driven to Kill is unfortunately not bad enough to be entertaining and lord knows it certainly isnt good enough either.Kevin Costner in Robin Hood set the standard for the disappearing reappearing never right in the first place accent.".

There are however two factors that make this movie unintentionally hilarious1. Segal does a Russian accent. It's terrible. And very very funny. 2. Segal's character Ruslan is supposed to be a novelist. It's hard enough believing this meatfisted lunk can read let alone write but Segal has been detached from reality for some time now.As pointed out by one of the previous reviewers Segal's computer keyboard control is astonishing  and even more impressive than the deathbygunbarrelintheeye sequence.Is this enough to make the movie good? Hell no it has Steven Segal in it for a start. But if you've got nothing and I mean nothing better to do for 90 minutes this may just about fit the bill.".

Seagal fans invariably watch his movies for the action sequences yet every fight scene in this one is accompanied by some absolutely ridiculous musical accompaniment that ruins any enjoyment. The ludicrous decision to play some upbeat jaunty East European accordion folk music while Seagal beats the hell out of his enemies has to be one of the most criminal mistakes in Bmovie action history.Otherwise the film is bland with little to differentiate it from a dozen others these past few years with Seagal going after the Russian gangsters who attacked his family. He spots one hell of a fake tan and fake accent here and looks pretty bored with the proceedings. The action could have been good without that music  and things do pick up for one extended showdown at a hospital that reminded me a little of HARDBOILED  but in the end this film's a nonstarter one destined for the bargain bin.".

If not well I'm pretty sure it is the first time he tries a foreign accent. It's not bad but again he doesn't quite suspend your disbelief. In terms of acting ability this is still the same Steven Seagal who first appeared on the big screen twenty years ago only he is fifty pounds heavier and he doesn't fight as well. In the end Driven to Kill is pretty boring.Seagal is a former Russian mobster now an author in California. He flies over to the east coast to attend his daughter's wedding but someone takes a knife to her before she can leave all dressed in white to be married. Miraculously she is unconscious but not dead Seagal teams up with his soninlaw whose father is head of the local Russian mob to get revenge in kickass fashion.There is too much gun play and not enough martial arts. The fights in Driven to Kill are very uninventive except maybe one where Seagal has a 51 knife fight. Personally I'd like to see him Kickbutt not shoot it. He isn't that exciting with a gun. The climax is a typical case of an amateurishly thrill ridden hail of gunfire which may put you to sleep. The only thing less impressive than Seagal's body is his mouth. The guy really needs to speak up you can barely hear a word he says now and I don't think it has to do with the semiRussian accent. Enough said I would skip this one.".

But with the rest of the movie you will see nothing new. Seagal is still fat and he continues to wear heavy coats to mask his weight and is mostly filmed from the chest up. There is a very funny moment when we see him run for several seconds  he can barely do it. It should probably come as no surprise that there aren't that many martial arts moments here compared to his early films and they are rapidly edited and filled with shots of what appear to be doubles doing his work. The gun battle scenes are also equally hard to make out as well. The general production values cinematography set decoration etc. are passable and that's about all that's positive I can say about this.".

From a very visual person such as myself the costumes makeup and set design are outstanding! True most of the scenes are probably a little over the top compared to the real BDSM scene but once again this is film is not meant to be taken literally. Even the music is wonderfully chosen to reflect each scene. These technical and creative merits alone deserve an A. Yes Guinevere Turner is exceptionally beautiful and sexy in this film but Sue Johnston deserves a WOW for flat out courage for shaving her head and still looking this gorgeous. This film has deservedly won a place on my list of top 10 films of all time. From a visual standpoint it's easily in the top 5 right next to The Cell Moulin Rouge and Bram Stoker's Dracula.".

Its production values are pretty high for such a noncommercial film and visually it is very attractive. It does a good job of satirizing both the fetishist and conservative communities but its arguments don't really break any new ground. It represents a caricature of both worlds rather than finding any deep truths. Watch it just for silly fun and you will be satisfied.Guine Turner and Christien Anholt although not the world's greatest actors are both appealing enough to easily gain the viewer's empathy. Supporting actors do a great job and there's lots of eye candy to behold.Although I really enjoyed the humor of the film a few things were dissatisfying. We never really get to know The Mistress Turner or Peter Anholt and so the dynamics of their relationship are figured out only through guesswork on the part of the viewer. That they change is obvious through the PLOT of the film but never through their interactions. For this reason the film fails to show us anything of significance about either Peter's sexual inhibitions and desires or The Mistress' darkest fantasy. Without this it's just a movie to be forgotten in a few days.One other whine is that the MP conservatives are simply shown as hypocrites which is just too easy. I would have loved to see this movie actually engage the idea that ultraconservatives might believe the crap they spew forth. Peter after all begins as one of them ... so how does he end up where he does by the ending of the film? On the other hand what has made The Mistress so dissatisfied with her own world? Exploring the faults of both sides would have made for a VERY interesting and significant flick! Again these are just could haves. Overall I really loved the movie and found it to be laughoutloud funny in some parts. If you have even a passing acquaintance with the fetishist community you will see many jokes at the expense of types within the scene.".

Having seen one too many poorly produced and often pathetic SMBD inhouse documentaries at queer film festivals I was concerned that this would fall into the same category. However by trying to be both a lighthearted comedy and an inhouse celebration I believe the filmmakers fail on both counts. A very thin plot is complemented by an amateurish script which is delivered in a lacklustre manner by every one of the actors. Clearly the director wanted the film to be this bad.One premise for the film is said to be in response to the British oppression of private sadomasochism clubs in the early 90's. Preaching To The Perverted attempts to show SM fetishists as moral fun loving folk who advocate freedom of choice and who respect informed consent. So why do these film characters think it's perfectly OK to kill a woman's dog butcher it put in a plastic bag and mail it to the distraught owner? At this point the film lost my dwindling support completely.The only credit this film deserves is in regard to cinematography  for content it deserves zero.".

Clearly the director wanted the film to be this bad.One premise for the film is said to be in response to the British oppression of private sadomasochism clubs in the early 90's. Preaching To The Perverted attempts to show SM fetishists as moral fun loving folk who advocate freedom of choice and who respect informed consent. So why do these film characters think it's perfectly OK to kill a woman's dog butcher it put in a plastic bag and mail it to the distraught owner? At this point the film lost my dwindling support completely.The only credit this film deserves is in regard to cinematography  for content it deserves zero.";

Our protagonist Peter is a conservative Christian looking to get involved in parliament and is instantly likable whilst who first appears to be the antagonist of the film is the bisexual and beautiful Tanya Cheex.I was very surprised that it had taken it so long for someone to recommend it to me. It's extremely ahead of its time and I think of it as a sort of prog film in a way. Looking back to recent events such as the facesitting demonstrations in London it couldn't be more relevant to today's society especially with the new look of the LGBT community.The story of the film revolves around a conservative little 'c' on purpose government aiming to quash the kinky uprisings of Cheex seeing her as a figure of sexual corruption and hideous perversion. They use Peter desperate for a path into government as some kind of spy figure tasked with infiltrating the House of Thwax  Tanya's perverted domaine.This film is entertaining throughout and I cannot wait to bump into another fan. Unfortunately for you every minute you spent reading this review are minutes of certain fandom that you are depriving yourself of! A must watch.".

There is an openness about the film that in a way brings the whole fetish scene into the spotlight but also it portrays the way that society tries to cover up and silence those involved. For those into the scene it gives good account of the way society views us and for those who are not it give a good insight into what goes on. The films director is now started a campaign on kickstarter to try and raise funding to have the film remastered and brought out as bluray.

	schema:reviewBody "Having caught this supposedly controversial film for the first time since about 1998 I was shocked. I was not shocked at the second rate fetish imagery and its laughable portrayal on the bdsm scene in London but just how dated this film is. Maybe it is that when it first came out the Spanner Case was still on everyone's lips the police really were busting fetish clubs and we were all still shaking from the back to basics campaign of the Major government. It's amazing how things can change. Today watching Preaching to the Perverted is a bit like watching a 70s sex comedy where showing bottoms was considered risque. Infact the only thing missing is Leslie Phillips and his smug laugh. With the film failing to remain valid in contemporary England just about the only cause of interest in it has gone. As I've already mentioned it's a totally unrealistic image of the fetish scene from the laughable BDSM scenes to the relationship between the pervs in the film.Just to show how out of touch the writers were when the drew up the script they have the stupid idea of an American domme in this country when the reality is that Brittania rules the fetish scene of America thanks to the likes of Skin Two and Demask not the other way around. To have the major pervy character in it being American is just completely divorced from reality and if she was American how come shes wearing all that latex when leather is far more 'in' there? Patriotic bitching aside the script is horrible and the acting is even worse. The supposed center of the script is the issue of censorship and the rights of the individual but sadly that's all lost in a mix of 70s style jokes and double entendres. Jokes are few and far between and each character is as well sculpted as a lump of lard. Being a 'comedy' films like this live or die on their script. If like Shaun of the Dead it's good and the actors cope with it then the film can weather the ages but if not it quickly falls over. There are some fine actors in the supporting roles who are completely wasted we all know Keith Allen is funny Ricky Tomlinson even better Roger Lloyd Pack can be wonderfully dead pan and Tom Bell is a great actor but you're left feeling dead at their performances. The two leads are particularly bad. Gwen Turner is a talented actress as well as screen writer but here she might as well be reading from a board off camera. I know shes playing a mistress but her complete failure to ever emote effectively ruins her part maybe thats the fault of the director but either way she doesn't convey the depth her part needs.Christien Anholt son of 1999s Tony you trivia fans is even worse. So made of paper does he seem that you wonder whether he was recycled from his father's rubbish bin. It's not surprising that his careers has sunk without a trace since. I'm sure his agent can still hear his drowning cries. The dated feel I've mentioned is compounded by the soundtrack of mid 90s techno whilst some people may smile at the memory of all that pill popping it just sounds rubbish these days and really bleepy one step up from 2 Unlimited. Even the production design which some have mentioned is just gimmicky a pink prop in every scene being something people shout about just shows how little there is to shout about. I'm struggling to find anything to recommend about this film okay it does have a few funny moments but they are few in far between. I can't even recommend this film for those of you who are vanilla to get an idea of the fetish scene because it's just so laughably bad. The end result is like pouring massage oil on latex and leaving it for three months to fester  flaky white mouldy crap.".

They are in love he goes to mental institution she is pregnant but marries another Joey Travolta is for once in a movie he really belongs in and does a terrific job. Ten years later Eddie comes out and comes back for Maureen. All of these characters are semicrazy semiabusive semikind semidumb. How can you love someone who hit his wife then tells her he loves her? And how can you not love that same person for being a dad to 3 little girls one of them not his own? How can you forgive a woman for divorcing her husband while he is sick and then not sympathize with her when she paid for it by 10 years of being separated from the man she loves? And what to think of a man who comes to take a woman from a family she made without him because he clearly sees her love for him? Penn's performance is as always vulnerable and smart. Wright Penn is the most underappreciated actress of our time I still cannot forgive the aforementioned academy for not even nodding her way with her brilliant performance in Forrest Gump.' These two actors can act with their eyes alone seems fitting that they are together also in real life.Having said all that She's so Lovely' is clearly not an Oscar material. It's too real. It's too good.".

Yep.  Is it vulgar in nearly every way?  Of course.  Do the leading characters have any chance of redemption moral or otherwise?

	schema:headline " An unsuccessfully delivered narrative with confused actors and a terrible mix of dark relationship drama and comic moments produces a roundly poor film";
	schema:reviewBody "Maureen is a bit strung out and pregnant from her lowlife husband Eddie. Their lives are an unpredictable mix of actions that mostly involve drinking and scamming round on the fringe of society. When Eddie is away for a few days Marueen falls in drinking with neighbour Kiefer who tries to rape her but then just beats her. She explains this away to Eddie so as to keep him from going crazy at her or anyone else but when he does start to flip she calls the paramedics to take him into care for his own safety. However when he shoots one of them Eddie is sentenced to a mental institution. When he comes out he finds that Maureen has divorced him and has moved onto a much more stable and reliable man in the form of Joey with whom she has had more children.Almost halfway in it becomes evident that this film isn't going to work out that well because before the 10 years later jump the love between the two leads hasn't been established to a convincing degree. Given that the narrative is using this mutual attraction despite all the negatives as its lynchpin this is a bit of a problem. Other than establishing that both are unstable and using each other for meaning the film doesn't do that much for all the time it takes up. The second half isn't that much better as Eddie comes out as a sort of watered down Rainman and disrupts Maureen's new relationship with Joey. The script then asks us to swallow that she still loves Eddie to the point where the mere news that he is released sees her flush the last ten years down the toilet.I can sort of understand what the script was trying to do but it didn't manage to produce anything interest in the aggressive relationships that it paints in the gutter. The characters are where the main failing is. Maureen's character is poorly defined and WrightPenn doesn't appear to understand what motivates her character and thus turns in a really mixed performance that pushes emotional buttons in each scene but is never consistent. Eddie is OK in the first half of the film as he just seems like a drunk unstable loser but in the second half he is unconvincingly soft. Likewise Penn is strong in the first half but he is unconvincing in the second. Their performances aren't helped by a weird mix of tones  at times a dark love story at other times a cringingly awful comedy complete with jaunty music being played over a fight on the front lawn or that horrible scene at Joey's bar. Travolta is a bit better and Stanton is a reasonably nice addition in a small role.Overall this is a shocking mess of a film that spirals downhill from the midpoint onwards. The first half shows potential but doesn't manage to pull off the formative stages of the central relationship and thus fails to set up the second half. However the second half isn't helped by poor development and a terrible mishmash of comic moments that simply feel crass and out of place  I suspect even if the first half had been a stormer this second half would have been poor enough to drag it all under. Even the acting talent seems all at sea and unsure of where they stand or who they are. A load of rubbish with little or no value.".

So true love is ditching your current husband and three young children for a guy you haven't seen ONCE in the last ten years?  Sounds like those two should have shared that cell at the sanitarium.Many of the character interactions didn't make sense the story had ample amounts of LAME and the funniest part was the very very end where we see the 'happy couple' and their two loser buddies DRINKING and DRIVING down the road in that stylish 1968 Buick Riviera.

Eddie Sean Penn is a harddrinking working guy devoted to his friends and passionate about his wife Maureen Robin Wright Penn. Eddie's mentally unstable he has a very weak grasp on the concepts of time and space and thus often vanishes for days at a time without realising how long he's been gone and without understanding why Maureen worries about him. Maureen is equally passionate about Eddie but he's been gone for three days at the start of the film and their neighbour Kiefer is pleasant and more importantly there and she accepts his offer of drinks and later of dancing. Kiefer pushes it too far however and though Maureen tries to keep the truth from him Eddie finds out. His tenuous grasp on mental stability snaps at this point and this is really the climax of the film. As has been mentioned before this is not an Oscarwinning film. Not because it's not excellent  with a script by John Cassavetes and command performances by both Penns spectacular really both of them in roles that would have been poorly played by clumsier actors and John Travolta and excellent supporting roles all around  but because it isn't a Hollywood movie about Good versus Bad with Good ultimately triumphing. People don't make good choices. People aren't particularly good parents. What ultimately happens isn't supposed to happen in the movies. But it does and it's true to the characters and it lifts this film up above the usual sugarcoated drabble we're so often fed by the cookiecutter that is Hollywood.".

Sean Penn is sent to jail for a number of years and when he is released he returns to his love Robin Wright Penn. She is now married to John Travolta and they have several kids. Normally this kind of family business would take months or even years to solve but these crazy people and kids settle everything in one day. This means emotions actions and dialog concentrated to the very essence of these peoples lives. Quite fascinating to watch and reminding of the way director Nick Cassavetes' father John Cassavetes used to make movies. Sean Penn always puts his soul into his work and the other actors do a great job. This movie is great fun. Watch it!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "As a filmmaker John Cassavetes was always challenging his audience. He wanted to shake people out of their traditional patterns of the way people watch movies. He wanted to constanly stay one step ahead of viewers and challenge them to keep up. If you know this any Cassavetes movie is a rewarding viewing experience. If you are unaware of this you will surely be lost like so many reviewers I've read here are. SHE'S SO LOVELY is Nick Cassavetes paying tribute to his father's unique and often misunderstood style. The characters like real people do not know what they are going to do from one moment to the next. This is what makes the movie so funny unpredictable   and so honest and true to life  that it makes some uncomfortable. Alot of critics have stated that it is unrealistic that a mother would ever leave her family under the circumstances presented here but until you've been in a similar situation how can you really say? At any rate one thing you can never accuse this movie of being is predictable. John Cassavetes often recut his movies even when people liked them. If he were still alive he would probably be delighted to read all the negative reviews here because they all point to one thing Cassavettes has done it again. He has shaken people out of their set ways of watching movies and no one seems to be hip to it  yet. Like any great jazz artist the work of John Cassavetes may be misunderstood at first but finds it's audience eventually. He is somewhere laughing knowing he has done his job. If you don't agree keep this review in mind and watch this movie againfor the first time. Like all of his films SHE'S SO LOVELY improves with repeat viewings.".

And the acting is just phenomenal. There were several scenes I had to back up and watch again just because some of the layers of small gestures and expressions and emotional choices are so genius I just couldn't believe how thoughtfully turned out it all was.Hint Watch Penn's face when he is asking his tired pregnant wife to put on heels and a nice dress for going out. Men that is how you get your woman to say YES! And I love the theme of honesty in this movie. The characters are all more honest with themselves and each other than anyone you'll meet in the world and they're also more tolerant of other people's honesty than real people are. It's beautiful and it's not brutal honesty. And everything is beautiful until that honesty is taken away by good intentions.Yes I agree they oversimplified the whole missing ten years thing but I don't mind because this was such a stunningly original surprising little love story.Remarkable.Oh and extra credit for including Tito Larriva!".

Well first of all most of the movie is really just setup for the last 14 of the movie yet nothing really much happens in all this time so I found myself just wondering when John Travolta would enter the picture.I guess the major problem with the movie is that Robin Wright Penn's character doesn't progress at all. Though there's supposed to be this time span of ten years between the first 34 of the movie and the last.So in the last 14 of the movie we find Robin Wright Penn's character in this home in the suburbs married with kids and all yet it's played as if she just stepped out of the gutter of the proceeding portion of the movie. Really makes no sense at all.It's a fairy tale and totally unbelievable.SPOILERS AHEAD And to accept the fact that she would just run off with Sean Penn's character who's been in the nut house for 10 years even though she hasn't kept in touch with him in all those years and has a new husband Travolta and kids and a whole life yet she just leaves it all behind is just so silly.A similar scenario was played out much better in the end of the movie Castaway with Tom Hanks  Helen Hunt. In that movie he returns from the dead after having been stranded on an island for years. When he returns he finds Hunt married with kids. Though they profess their love for each other she of course says she simply can't run off with him and leave her kids and her present husband. THAT folks is reality.What we have presented in this movie is just so much silliness. Shame too because the acting's not bad.But basically what you have is a movie where the first 34 of it is one long boring setup followed by a quick totally unbelievable last 14.".

I've read one that stated something along the lines of How could a man go so insane that he's locked up for ten years because he's mad about another man beating his wife?!If one pays attention to the context clues it is apparent that Eddie has a history of mental illness.  The story does not begin with the opening scene. You have to pay attention to the film's details and its allusions to preexisting circumstances.I thought this film was excellent.  The characters are not likeable people on the surface.  If I knew someone like Maureen in real life I'd probably detest her.  Maureen left her children to be with her lover she drank while pregnant and she's dumb as rocks but you have to look past the character flaws and focus on what this story is about.  It's not about morals and reasonable rational decisionmaking.  Those concepts do not typically make for artistic expression.  This story is about love and obsession  two human conditions that are not often pleasant but very real.  Anyone who has been in love knows that it can drive you mad.  It's such a drag at the same time there's nothing else that can make you so high the way love does. You have to appreciate the feelings that Mo and Eddie have for one another.I don't understand how one can NOT appreciate how one can NOT absolutely love some of the hysterical dialogue in this film.  Maureen tells Eddie she wants to smash bottles over peoples heads and then adds Because I love you.  That thought of Maureen's becomes something later in the film that Eddie says repeatedly.  Mo's thoughts become a part of Eddie's selfperception.The defining moment in this film is when Eddie and Mo reunite.  It's the look that they give each other as they drive off leaving her family.  The look in their eyes is real and you can see that at least to them there was nothing else for her to do but go with him.  To them it was the only right thing in the world.".

Few films get such starkly opposing reactions from ordinary viewers. Worst movie they've ever seen? Wow I don't agree at all...but the movie is a litmus test a continental divide a knife's edge. Sometimes one aspect to a movie a single quality can set off a viewer so they just hate or more rarely love a movie.I'm guilty of tilting against a movie like thatMel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ was so horrible to me I had to shut my eyes through half of it and so I can't review it. I really hated it. But I know that there were aspects to the movie that were remarkable. If I did venture a review I can't imagine trying to see it again for any reason but let's pretend I did I would try my best to find those things that did work and to rise above the gut level repulsion I had for it. Because in the end I need to be able to find balance to appreciate the best in a troubling moviethe filming of Triumph of the Will for one obvious example. Can She's So Lovely a movie that has stellar acting good filming a plot that holds water and rain lots of rain and strong emotional content really be terrible? Even if the content grates on the viewer so badly they can't stand watching it? People are reacting against the movie because it's troubling depressing and raw. It has characters with flaws so big you can can't always see their virtues. And that isn't the fault of either of the Cassavetes men the dad John who wrote the script or the son Nick who retrieved it after his father's death. In family tradition real life wife and mother Gena Rowlands has an affecting role as a release counselor and this is curious because John Cassavetes used Rowlands long ago to scuff up stereotypes of mental illness in the difficult and penetrating A Woman under the Influence among other films. I wonder if people who had trouble watching She's So Lovely would have trouble with the earlier movie? There is another side to seeing a movie that is unbearably emotional or depressing. And that is learning what it is that makes it so for the viewer. For me why exactly did I find the violence so impossible to watch in The Passion? Was it the violence itself or the fact that the violence seemed so wrong or inaccurate or gratuitous? Would I watch a movie where someone horrible was being tortured that way say Hitler? The short answer no. The point being a movie that is so affecting might have something to teach me.And what is it in this Cassavetes film that works the viewer over for good and bad there are as many positive reviews as negative ones? Maybe it is the entry into a very real world that isn't so extreme or unusualthough we are shown an especially awful and pivotal moment in that worlda milieu present in every small city and common in a big one. We can really feel that scene and the players inside and that alone makes the movie compelling. Give us five or so great performances from the two Penns in love in the first half to John Travolta in the sunny and shorter second half and you have something that really gets under your skin. Isn't that what makes a movie valid? Don't we want intensity over entertainment? Sometimes?Now to the best part humor. It arrives in small ways throughout but at the end there is that chaotic comic nonsense in the front yard? It's the worst of all possible situations a mother willfully walking away from her three kids and decent if goofy husband but it gets violent in silly spurts as they tussle on the grass. Is that supposed to soften the facts so we don't melt down totally? Or is it saying that the whole film is a little just a little tongue and cheek? Surely the excesses earlier might be excessive. I mean how many dance hall ticket takers are so nice they not only let the couple in for free but loan them money on top of it? Or just after that does the couple really arrive at an old friend's flat in the middle of the night and have a beautiful family meal prepared for them an idealized clich of the Italian mother feeding everyone? Is this movie really about true love or about something mistaken for it an obsessive attachment almost an animal bonding where the two of them need each other even when it's bad for them. Blame the drugs blame the bad brain chemistry blame the poverty they do cling together when they shouldn't. They cling even ten years later leaving her new husband out of her heart that convincing suburban dad Travolta imperfect and yet successful who has given his life to her. Would you really prefer stability and superficial happiness over depth of feeling? And true love?I bought the whole package. The direction was flawed maybe a result of inexperience more than anything. But what really works really works. For me. I don't want to be them I'm not jealous in any way even of their attachments but I like these for their best parts. And I like the movie for its best parts too.".

Well if your idea of a comedy is watching a woman get drunk get beat up almost raped live with a psychopath turn him in to protect him from himself and others give birth to their child alone remarry a guy who's filled with as much rage as the 1st hubby and then when the 1st hubby returns leaves her 3 kids and 2nd hubby without so much as a I'm gonna miss you  then this is your kinda a comedy.  So pop some corn cuddle up and prepare to laugh your head off???If I had known this was an edgy drama I would have been better prepared to properly judge this movie but I kept wondering when was it going to get funny even if only in a black comedy kindofway like War of the Roses. It never did save for 4 lines Yes I counted them all.  There was little else to do. And one of those involved swearing at a 9 year old and telling her to shut up and drink her beer. Oh and it was so endearing when the 9 year old gave the adults permission to swear because after all she has heard worse.What really gets me is that all the reviews described this movie like this Hip Comedy about a woman who remarries after her 1st hubby goes to jail and then 10 years later when he is released must choose between the 2.Well that part about the 1st hubby going to jail doesn't happen until more than an hour into the story and by then you have figured out that it is a nobrainer  she will always go with this guy no matter who else she marries  even if it's John Travolta.And don't bother watching this for John Travolta.  He doesn't make his entrance until the last 30 minutes and is in only 3 major scenes.So I guess the point of this movie was more of a social commentary on the irrational thinking involved with love She's delovely.  Ha Ha! Now I get it?! Oh palease! and dealing with life's difficulties in general?  Well I guess I am now Officially UnHip because even in retrospect  No I don't get it.".

	schema:reviewBody "She's So Lovely is one of the many great flicks to come out in 1997. The movie received lukewarm reviews with the acting being praised and the plot being criticized as wasted potential. The iconic John Cassavetes was about halfway done the script before he died leaving his son Nick to finish and direct. Nick's takeover could have been better and the ending could have been so much better by anybody else.The first half of the movie is about Eddie and Maureen Quinn Penn Wright who live in the ghetto part of town. Maureen is pregnant but still smokes and drinks. Both her and Eddie are stupid trashy people which is kinda funny to see. Despite living in the slums they both try their hardest to make and satisfy their love lives. When Eddie goes missing for 3 days and Maureen is raped by their neighbour Gandolfini Eddie suspects Maureen is lying about falling and he goes on an insane rampage to destroy him. The backstory that's given on their lives is good and just enough time for the movie to really take off. After nearly killing people on his way he is taken to a mental institution where he remains for the next ten years. In that time Maureen divorced Eddie married Joey Germoni Travolta had two more daughters and moved to a big house in a nice neighbourhood. When Eddie gets released Maureen must choose between Eddie who loves her to the extreme and is overcoming mental problems and Joey who also loves her and their daughters and nice home. Sean Penn gives his most underrated performance and was cheated out of a potential win. He did better in this than most of the Oscar nods that year. But given his screen time and position in the film it is kind of hard to see if he is really the main character. Robin Wright is arguably the protagonist. Either way Penn's performance is nothing short of spectacular. Anybody with a vast knowledge of acting can vouch for this. Penn's transition from psychotic lowlife to a reformed hermit is great in the eyes of all but it is the way he does it that goes unrecognized. A lot of the great acting performances feature people with tons of energy just belting out screams and cries. Yeah this is great to seedon't get me wrongbut it is even harder to try to hold it in. Crying and screaming often feels good but trying to contain it is much harder and is often painful which makes it even that much harder. Sean Penn does exactly this in several scenes. I was blown away at his restraint. Robin Wright also gives restraint but less often as Penn. Travolta may not have restraint but he is the energy factor that carried the rest of the movie when Penn gets better.She's So Lovely doesn't quite seem to find its place in what kind of movie it wants to be. It seems like it tries to be a drama romance romanticcomedy and dark comedy all at once. If John Cassavetes finished the script then gone back over and edited it himself he would have been able to figure out where he went wrong and what could have been strengthened. The story is great and original just what genre is it? The movie is about two totally opposite men trying viewing for the same woman with a story like that and acting this good it can affect anybody that sees it. Aside from the style of the movie being unclear the ending is a complete fail that can ruin people's experience. I bet that most people that did not like this movie was overwhelmed by how bad the ending is. A great story with a fuzzy style poorly executed. We all know that Maureen will end up with Eddie again once he gets released but after seeing her family we change our minds. When Maureen winds up with Eddie at the end Cassavetes tries to say that love is eternal and true love can conquer all or something like that. There are two reasons why this doesn't work. First we don't get a good look at Maureen contemplating who she she wants. More of this would have strengthened the story. But she is so stupid for leaving her three daughters for an unstable man she hasn't seen in ten years! That just shows that she loves her first spouse more than her own children. I've seen this movie a few times and the ending always angers me. All parents that I know would die for their children. If she didn't have kids this would not be that big a deal. She should have either stayed with Joey and her daughters and talked it over with Eddie or have a scene after she leaves with the kids at her's and Eddie's apartment. I do recommend this. Just be prepared for the second half to plummet.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this one on TV on a weekend when I was cleaning house and had the tube on and it started and I watched a few minutes of it and I thought OK I want to see what happens to this wretch of a girl. I think she played the part brilliantly. Eddie really loves his girl. The thought that him and this girl are going to procreate...shudder but the little girl turns out really cute sweet and unbelievably normal in the end...more on this later... I liked the way they went up to the restaurant when it was pouring down rain and just asked for food... that was pretty cool...seemed old fashioned. I also thought the way Eddie was getting edgier and edgier as the film went on and finally broke was played well and the fact that he had no clue he was gone so long...he seemed like he really didn't have ONE CLUE about what was going on. Then comes the day when he gets let out and here is where the film actually struck a raw nerve with me. He gets out. The girl has been married to this other guy for like 10 years and Eddie comes back and she's like OK this is your Daddy THIS guy we've been living with all your life is NOT your dad...he's your two sister's dad but NOT yours. And this poor little girl has to absorb all of this AND meet the guy and he has to tell her and it gets all emotionally draining way too much way too fast. There goes the normal life!!! And then the mom LEAVES WITH EDDIE!!!! WTF???? SHe has been married to this guy for 10 years has cleaned up her life and was living in a wonderful house and had a wonderful life and then she leavesleaving her husband of 10 years and her kids behind!!and goes with this bonehead. In a way it was beautiful thatI guess her love for him never died. But it came across as shrill and like she just 'used' him all those years until her 'true' love came along. I guess she never knew the meaning of 'moving on' or 'getting over him'. Maybe this film is just too 'real' for me because I personally have dealt with this same thing.I was the little girl in a similar but not quite the same situation Not to such an extreme degree and it just grated my nerves. It was weird different and unforgettable but I wish I could!".

	onyx:emotionText "I saw this one on TV on a weekend when I was cleaning house and had the tube on and it started and I watched a few minutes of it and I thought OK I want to see what happens to this wretch of a girl. I think she played the part brilliantly. Eddie really loves his girl. The thought that him and this girl are going to procreate...shudder but the little girl turns out really cute sweet and unbelievably normal in the end...more on this later... I liked the way they went up to the restaurant when it was pouring down rain and just asked for food... that was pretty cool...seemed old fashioned. I also thought the way Eddie was getting edgier and edgier as the film went on and finally broke was played well and the fact that he had no clue he was gone so long...he seemed like he really didn't have ONE CLUE about what was going on. Then comes the day when he gets let out and here is where the film actually struck a raw nerve with me. He gets out. The girl has been married to this other guy for like 10 years and Eddie comes back and she's like OK this is your Daddy THIS guy we've been living with all your life is NOT your dad...he's your two sister's dad but NOT yours. And this poor little girl has to absorb all of this AND meet the guy and he has to tell her and it gets all emotionally draining way too much way too fast. There goes the normal life!!! And then the mom LEAVES WITH EDDIE!!!! WTF???? SHe has been married to this guy for 10 years has cleaned up her life and was living in a wonderful house and had a wonderful life and then she leavesleaving her husband of 10 years and her kids behind!!and goes with this bonehead. In a way it was beautiful thatI guess her love for him never died. But it came across as shrill and like she just 'used' him all those years until her 'true' love came along. I guess she never knew the meaning of 'moving on' or 'getting over him'. Maybe this film is just too 'real' for me because I personally have dealt with this same thing.I was the little girl in a similar but not quite the same situation Not to such an extreme degree and it just grated my nerves. It was weird different and unforgettable but I wish I could!";

	schema:reviewBody "Emmanuelle 5 is Polish surrealist Walerian Borowczyk's penultimate theatrical feature a film who's merits are hotly debated among cult and art film lovers. Some see the movie as nothing more than a commercial sellout others as an interesting addition to his body of work. It's also the last quality entry of the official Emmanuelle franchise. Adding to the confusion is the fact that there are at least three versions the theatrical European version the heavily edited US version including new scenes produced by Roger Corman! and a European home video version including extra hardcore scenes that feature none of the principal cast.This time round Emmanuelle is portrayed by Monique Gabrielle who is in a jarring change a bleach blonde American actress. Never mind that the character is supposed to be French it kind of works mainly because Ms. Gabrielle has the sense to play the role with just the right nod and wink. And while no actress came close to Sylvia Kristel's beauty charm and class Monique makes the role her own. Since the film dispenses with any previous character back story here she portrays Emmanuelle as a single freespirited woman who makes erotic art films and runs a dance studio out of her beloved loft in Paris.The movie opens with a Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous style montage of Cannes with a documentarylike narration giving us an overview of the famous film festival held there every year. It seems Emmanuelle is premiering her latest film Love Express in Cannes... causing a scandal in the process. In fact we first see her in this film within a film in a beautifully shot sequence on a set of craggy rocks overlooking the roaring ocean. At a press conference later she must defend her film to closeminded reporters who accuse her of creating pornography. It's all obviously a reference to Borowczyk's own experiences at the very same festival. After the QA Emmanuelle's producer a smarmy French type introduces her to Prince Rajid a wealthy sheik who own's the fictional Arab country of Benglagistan. He's apparently obsessed with Emmanuelle and wants to premiere the film in his homeland. Outside an adoring throng of male fans awaits Emmanuelle all desperate for a touch of the famed beauty. Things quickly escalate and soon the mob is stripping her of every last article of clothing sending her jumping onto a stranger's departing boat for safety. Her unwitting saviour is Charles D. Foster a nerdy but handsome young millionaire who disapproves of Emmanuelle's erotic films. Sparks fly and before you know it love is in the air. Is a happy ending in the works? Perhaps but not before a journey back onto the Love Express and Prince Rajid kidnaps Emmanuelle putting her in his harem.The version most people know is the English language American edit which in addition to the new Corman scenes also utilizes Borowczyk's outtakes perhaps the reason Emmanuelle 5 is dismissed by some. The new scenes while amusing just don't gel with the traditional European style that people expect from Emmanuelle films. While the original release of Emmanuelle 5 certainly doesn't lack a sense of humor Corman's New Horizon version goes over the top with campy 80s comedy seeming more like a companion to Bachelor Party also starring Ms. Gabrielle and other films of that ilk. It's also clumsily edited  the transition between film quality is jarring. What they attempt is admirable give the story more cohesion tighten the pacing but apparently they didn't even bother doing a final film print edit it was all put together on 34 video with a series of bad fadeins and bleeds. Apparently they opted for a quick home video release and couldn't be bothered to finish it off right. This version is also only available in a terrible fullscreen DVD transfer. If you can track down a copy of Borowczyk's original theatrical edit of Emmanuelle 5 do so. It's a smart interesting film well worth owning and has a lot more going for it than Monique Gabrielle's bare breasts.".

This movie seems to have several edits for the domestic and international markets. American releases have had a 77 minute R rated cut I believe as well as the 85 minute unrated edition. The French version is roughly 85 minutes but will be virtually unrecognizable to most audiences. The first 20 minutes are an extension of Emmanuelle's Love Train movie which we see being screened by Cannes audiences. This 20 minute sequence contains 3 pornographic sequences which look like they were intended for another film but found their way into Emmanuelle V. The sex toys on display are those of Borowczyk I guess to make these scenes arty. After these sequences the film continues in the same way as the American versions except for a porno sequence in the ballet school and a porno lesbian encounter at the sheik's harem with more of Borowczyk's personal collection. Monique Gabrielle does not appear in any of the porno sequences just the softcore ones. The French version has little dialogue but really do you care what they're saying?".

	schema:reviewBody "Emmanuelle the globetrotting whore returns this time portrayed by Monique Gabrielle playing hanky panky with a US businessman Charles Foster..played by the nebbish Dana Burns Westburg with considerable power and influence..he has a New Jersey company which makes door knobs!and her favorite photographer EricCrofton Hardester. Foster wants her to settle down with him in the States but that would mean she'd have to give up her Paris loft and dance studio along with the sexual depravity she so covets. Meanwhile rather dumbly Emmanuelle whisks off for the Middle East at the invite of a wealthy Shiek who wishes to produce a film with her when in actuality he wants her as part of his harem of 50 wives! Anyway there she's briefly imprisoned along with other American and Arab wives..all topless and horny of courseuntil Eric infiltrates camp and rescues her. The version I watched includes a local protector who helps Emmanuelle reach freedom..he communicates with Foster and the millionaire sends in a helicopter to lift the shack she was hiding to safety.The film is credited to Eurocult director Walerian Borowczyk but this never felt like a movie he'd make. Instead it seems like someone else maybe this Steve Barnett guy tampered with the product tossing in random sequences featuring Emmanuelle engaged in foreplay and softcore sex with whoever interests her appetites. I recommend this to those who wish to see Gabrielle naked because she has a phenomenal body and I found her ease in front of the camera intoxicating. I think she provides the right kind of performance for the ridiculous mindnumbingly juvenile material playing around with the persona of Emmanuelle. I grinned constantly at how she approaches the men working them into a frenzy like my favorite scene where she slowly disrobes for Eric when he surprises her with a visit to her office in the dance studio or demanding Foster's coat after turning up on his boat buck naked due to the rowdy Cannes crowd stripping off her glamorous wardrobe..this feels the most Borowczyk out of the movie I watched. The Harem portion of the film looks like it was shot on cheap studio sets and the most hilarious part is when Emmanuelle picks up a machine gun blasting Shiek Rajid'sYaseen Khansoldiers as she and her men attempt to escape his jungle. There's never a moment in the film I ever felt was played serious you can kind of see how this fifth film in the Emmanuelle cycle was more broad farce almost poking fun at the character and her willingness to step into problematic situations. Most will call Gabrielle's performance awful or the pits but I think she could only play the character this way for the material just can not be taken with a grain of salt. Is it a far cry from Kristel known as the true Emmanuelle I guess so but Gabrielle certainly has a body to die for and we get to see plenty of it. Is this superficial smut sure and I never felt it tried to be anything other than what was obvious.".

She will live her life her way and there's not a thing any jealous billionaire can do about it. Emmanuelle is for all to love. Don't get greedy.So Emmanuelle ends up on an island run by a maniacal dictator. He wants to host the premiere of her new film and force her to join his harem. Does he really think he can control the wild and untamed Emmanuelle? HA HA you fool! Don't you know? No man can control her! Soon Emmanuelle will make a break for it with the help of a photographer and an AK47.Well this wasn't a good movie but with this many breasts on display I can't complain too much. Gabrielle doesn't quite have the range necessary to tackle the demands of being Emmanuelle. You know like being able to act sad happy excited distraught or just about any other emotion you can think of. She has sex about four times and looks pretty good doing it. There are also a lot of scenes in the harem where the topless women roam. Overall this Emmanuelle isn't worth the time but if you must see it I doubt you'll get too upset watching it.".

	schema:reviewBody "While I don't want to rave too much about the 1970's Emmanuelle films either the official French series with Sylvia Kristel or the more notorious unofficial Black Emanuelle series of Laura Gemser and Joe D'Amato there was always SOMETHING interesting about them. This movie marked the point though where the series became totally worthless. First off they cast American Bmovie bimbo Monique Gabrielle in the title role. It's not just that she is a worse actress than Kristel or Gemser which she certainly is but she is also totally wrong for the European flavor of the role. It's like casting Queen Latifah in the lead role of Memoirs of Gisha.They did hire interesting if erratic director Walerian Borowzyc but when he and Gabrielle clashed they fired him. Roger Corman than did an incredible hatchet job on the film Borowzyc had made. Most of what he cut out I've heard were the sex scenes involving the black characters. The European fascination for these kind of interracial sex scenes was not exactly a blow for civil rights anymore than Joe D'Amato's fascination for equine masturbation was a blow for animal rights but whether these cuts made the film less racist or more racist they certainly ruined the rhythm of the movie left Gabrielle and her equally untalented male costar with too much screen time and it's even hard to tell in the final cut that this film was shot on location on the beautiful island of Reunionthus the movie loses all the travelogue appeal of the early series other than an idiotic prologue set at Cannes where Gabrielle's character is chased and stripped naked by a mob of fans.After this fiasco the producers tried to recapture the Europeanflavor and old magic with Emmanuelle 6 and by dusting off Syvia Kristel and teaming her with washedup former James Bond George Lazenby in a French television series. But finally the Emmanuelle movies fell victim to silicone both in the increasingly overstuffed breasts of increasingly untalented actresses and in the futuristic computer themed plots which were apparently aimed at sexually frustrated Star Trek fans. But even if sociallymaladjusted computer geeks weren't getting all their porn off the internet they would probably be laughing their asses off at the pathetic hitech nonsense of Emannuelle in Space and Emmanuelle 2000. A sad end for a series that was never good but certainly deserved better than this.".

Emmanuelle goes to his small country for the premiere but soon she is held captive by the evil ruler who won't even allow women to show their legs or touch themselves but that's not going to sit well with our star. Apparently there are three versions of this film the original European version an American edit and an alternate hardcore version. I watched the American edit which features some newly shot scenes as well as outtakes from the Euro version. I've never been a huge fan of the director but I might go as far to say this is the most entertaining film I've seen from him. If you've seen any of the Emmenuelle movies whether the original series or the Black Emanuelle movies then you know what to expect. Gabrille isn't much of an actress but she does have a great body and shows it off enough to keep the film moving. The supporting cast includes Crofton Hardester and Dana Bruns Westburg but they don't add a whole lot to the film. The biggest problem is the studio subplot dealing with the evil ruler who won't let women be free but of course we all know this movie was made to show women naked so the political message just comes off silly and rather stupid. Apparently fans have called Borowczyk a sell out for doing this film but there's still plenty of art here to where he can call it his own. I doubt his diehard fans are going to give this film too much credit so I'd say those seeking cheap nudity will be the ones to enjoy this the most.".

	schema:reviewBody "Emmanuelle V is the first entry in the infamous series to not feature Sylvia Kristel the Dutch actress who made the character legend. Monique Gabrielle takes the reins and is admittedly awful in the role her acting is abysmal and she lacks the classy Eurostyle beauty of Kristel and even Mia Nygren who was featured in Emmanuelle IV. It is easy to dismiss this as trash but the film does possess a unique style and features some striking avant garde imagery throughout. This opinion is based on the European theatrical version as I have yet to see the version edited and altered by Roger Corman for North American release. The Euro version runs for 84 minutes and features almost nonstop nudity and sex which is what one expects from this genre. E5 is an editing disaster random surreal imagery is splattered across the screen in a jarring repetitive style. For the first half hour the film seems to go nowhere but it certainly gets better when Emmanuelle heads to the Middle East to find herself entrapped in Prince Rajid's harem. There are some truly fine sequences like when Emmanuelle is picked up and driven to the Prince's castle by the Arab boy who calls himself Rocky Stallone! The boy seems to be enamored by Western culture calling himself Rocky and popping in a cassette of silly 80's rock music. When Emmanuelle tries to give him some money he refuses wanting instead only a kiss from the beautiful movie star Emmanuelle. The boy meets with a sad fate later in the film while Emmanuelle must escape the fanatic Rajid. Emmanuelle 5 is a garish but undeniably stylish and entertaining film. Very politically incorrect these kinds of films simply are not made today. Obviously this entry in the series is only connected to the first four in name only. Emmanuelle is not the classy and delicate French wife of an Ambassador but rather an airhead bleach blond American film star. There is no other connection and this film can be watched on it's own. The uncut European DVD is the one to look for however director Walerian Borocyvk claims in interviews that he had little to do with the filming of either version. This is a bit hard to believe as so much imagery seen here is exactly his style. Not a very good film but this one certainly deserves a cult following.".

But there's enough of Borowczyk to interest his admirers even though the result is undeniably a confused mishmash with a plot line which vies with Emmanuelle 4 for the most ludicrous of the good lady's misadventures.The film begins with Emmanuelle poorly played by the miscast blonde Monique Gabrielle running into controversy at Cannes when her new film Love Express is premiered. Critics don't seem to agree whether its art pornography or a twisted version of Walt Disney  a controversy similar to that generated by some of Borowczyk's earlier masterworks  and Emmanuelle is chased by a raving mob of paparazzi along the Cannes main drag which strips her naked and would have ripped her to shreds had not she sought refuge in the speedboat of a passing millionaire. Despite the millionaire's distaste for erotica he and Emmanuelle begin a romantic affair which continues in Paris until Emmanuelle determines to accept the invitation of a mysterious foreign Prince Rajid of some fictional Middle Eastern country. Rajid a lunatic dictator and Orientalist stereotype parexcellence kidnaps Emmanuelle and imprisons her in his harem. But the millionaire hires a SWAT team to rescue his beauty and the two intensify their relationship by taking to the air in the white elephant plane designed by the millionaire's father who seems to have had a touch of Howard Hughes.Now all of this from a rationalist POV is complete codswallop. But certain sections  most notably the clips from Love Express  demonstrate Borowczyk's usual artsy and disorientating approach to erotic miseenscene. Objects and transactions become more important than the frail human flesh everything is glimpsed partially and framed from odd angles the bodies in congress become simply another part of a systemized world. At times the film seems like a random compendium of Borowczyk's abiding interests  we see erotic memorabilia the raging sea the female struggle against objectification the male attempt to impose his own kingdom on the world of things Prince Rajid's country has some affinities with Goto Island of Love. But these affinities with Borowczyk's previous work are more like echoes from better days than a cohesive new artistic statement and the film never creates the space in which these things  believable though extraordinary in The Beast or Immoral Tales  come across as slightly ludicrous affectations.The film was taken out of his hands some time between shooting and release so I guess we'll never know how close this film is to Borowczyk's conception or whether he could have made an artistically successful contribution to the Emmanuelle series. Like the Kristel Emmanuelle films Borowczyk's heyday was in the 70s where there was a market for upmarket softcore confections which he then managed to subvert into something far more rich and strange. Emmanuelle 5 is worth seeing for both Borowczyk and Emmanuelle completists but be aware that both had seen far better days.".

Even as the fruits of their lives and career remain bright the couple's hopes for some dignity prove a dispiriting struggle even as their daughter enters the conflict.

	schema:reviewBody "What introduction could this film possibly require? Any film enthusiast recognises the name of Haneke instantly whatever their opinion of him. His latest film Amour finally arrives in the UK this week having won the Palme D'Or at Cannes Haneke's second in a row and the appraisal of most of the cinematic world. Horrible feelings accompanied me into the Friday screening of Amour  would the film live up to the hype could Haneke really better his recent works Hidden and The White Ribbon?I realized about a quarter of the way into Amour that this was the wrong way to think about it. Haneke is renowned for his chilly detached style and merciless lack of sentimentality in exploring the darker sides of human nature. Although his ruthless devotion to all things challenging and unsentimental is still evident in Amour we must at least recognise that this represents some kind of turning point in Haneke's oeuvre. Georges and Anne have been married many years and have grown old together. They are both piano teachers now retired. When we first meet them they are attending a concert of one of Anne's old students now grown and making a name for himself. They applaud congratulate him and then take the bus home smiling and talking to one another in snippets as they come closer to their apartment. If it hadn't been for a masterful disquieting opening sequence which I will not describe here we would not suspect anything was wrong. Yet after this wonderful outing which they have obviously been looking forward to for a long time their spacious Parisian apartment will become their entire world we shall never leave it. There is a brief moment masterfully shot where the couple's adult daughter in a beautiful performance from Isabelle Huppert who played the selfharming protagonist in Haneke's formidable film 'The Piano Teacher' stands by the window and through the translucent material of the curtain we see the street outside and the vehicles moving slowly along it the outside world remains completely impervious to the painful ordeal which is taking place on the other side of that curtain. The ordeal begins one morning over the couple's breakfast. The two are having a conversation. Georges tells Anne something and she suddenly becomes unresponsive. She snaps out of it and she insists she has no memory of it yet we sense in Anne as Georges tells her about this strange event a fear of something starting within her of doctors and hospitals there is even glimpsed on her face for the briefest of moments suspicion directed at her husband. It is the first event in a downward spiral and from the moment Anne returns from the hospital afterwards and a farce of a funeral that George is forced to attend alone both will be condemned to this apartment. Anne begs Georges never to take her back to the hospital thus it becomes a prison and mausoleum the sense of oncoming death pervades the coldly lit rooms.Georges and Anne are played magnificently by those acting gods of yesteryear JeanLouis Trintignant star of Bertolucci's masterpiece The Conformist and Emmanuelle Riva the female protagonist of Resnais' Hiroshima Mon Amour. Handpicked by Haneke himself these two bring a lifetime of experience to their roles their performances are breathtaking. Riva in particular whose character loses her independence and her own sense of dignity increasingly throughout the film is magnificent not afraid of baring all to the camera. Anne's condition is not the ersatz tragedy infused with humour and considerable taste that Hollywood would have us believe it is ugly painful degrading. The claustrophobia of their lives increasingly shut off from the rest of the world is intense. Characters including the couple's own daughter selfish on the surface but nursing deep hurts will come in and penetrate temporarily the organic defensive webbing that Georges and Anne are now forming for themselves but both the guest and the host feel that the couple's lives are being intruded upon. Theirs is a holistic private world that outsiders try to break into there is a great piece of symbolism early on in the film after Georges and Anne return from the concert where they discover that someone has tried to break into their apartment. This couple in the face of oncoming tragedy hide within themselves and within this space their own where they have spent so many years and built their lives together. I believe this to be the best film Haneke has ever made. Yes it is gruellingly unsentimental but unlike all of his other films there is warmth tenderness and genuine humanity to be found here. We are greeted by two highly intelligent people who have been and remain deeply in love and we are challenged now  not to watch the beginning of this relationship but its end. Georges and Anne are not perfect human beings they become frustrated even angry. The wounds that each can inflict on the other knowing each other inside out hit the audience like a punch to the gut. It is part of the searing authenticity of the film and that makes the more tender moments even more special. Amour is a film about the disappearance of a human being of what one man does in the face of losing the woman he has loved his whole life every day little by little. It is a psychological drama tinged with philosophy and moments of exquisite heartbreaking poetry. But it is also a luminous love story  one that is genuine and recognisable between two characters that we fully believe in and sympathise with. Georges and Anne have spent many long happy years together and now slowly and sadly their happiness is coming to an end".

	schema:reviewBody "In 'Amour' we delve into the deepest and most profound type of love seldom explored on screen examined to it's uncompromising end. It is one of the most moving displays of love in recent memory. That the couple at the heart of this film are 80plus year old bourgeois retired Frenchspeaking music teachers is surprising. That their story speaks to so many audiences worldwide regardless of their age and culture should not be it simply reflects the universal emotions at the core of this film told with great honesty and sensitivity.Ironically as the title suggests this is not another love story. In his most classical and refined film yet Austrian master Haneke has once again asks questions of the audience in his own subversive clinical uncomfortable methods yet in what many see as a departure with profoundly moving results. Some of the signature Haneke 'shocks' still remain but this time they also carry devastating emotional weight.Paradoxically the emotional force of the film comes from Haneke's characteristic clinical style of filmmaking static shots framed in mid to long distance no score economical and direct screenplay however assisted by an always crisp sound design sharp lighting and cinematography courtesy of Darius Khondji Midnight in Paris and naturalistic and honest performances. This time however the approach feels gentler and respectful without the standard disdain and nihilism one expects from Haneke.Yet there remains a palpable sense of the unknown and danger as film progresses ironically almost exclusively in their spacious and comfortable apartment ratcheting up a claustrophobic sense of fear. The film also spends it's time almost solely on the two leads the emotional weight they carry and the connection to the audience evidenced by genuine laughter gasps and tears laughter or sorrow I won't disclose was incredibly moving for two reallife octogenarians that few would admit they have more in common than they would believe. I've not said much about the film's story  an elderly French couple live in a Parisian apartment until an unexpected event causes them to reevaluate their life  it is simple in it's construction and execution and the emotional peaks are best experienced by yourself with a friend or family member and a receptive audience. I watched this at the Sydney Film Festival in June about a month after it's premiere in Cannes in May for which it deservedly won with enthusiastic reception. The theatre was comparatively and undeservedly under attended yet the reception was attentively silent collectively moved.Following the visceral and subversive Cach and the more refined and sprawling White Ribbon it appeared that Haneke had reached a creative zenith. Almost inevitably however and especially given with the subject matter he has restrained his somewhat acerbic style and delivered a film that is superlatively honest and sincere in all it's creative aspects. He has given an honest appraisal of a tender human relationship that should move even the most dispassionate viewer by the often unflinching humanity displayed on screen. One of the greatest and profound achievements seen on screen in many years this is film at it's purest and most powerful form.".

A film for which the jury at Cannes gave him his 2nd Palme d'Or in four years. And nothing less than this film deserves.The story of an elderly French couple their deteriorating health and devotion to each other is the basis and allows the Austrian auteur to inject something rarely if ever seen in any of his films to date heart.Some of the typical Haneke touches are still there the suffocating sense that something terrible is going to happen being his signature. His previous film the 2008 Palme d'Or winning The White Ribbon keeps up this omnipresent dread for almost its entire runtime also see the deus ex machina in Funny Games and continuous sense of dread in Hidden. With these films Haneke has proved himself to be the biggest audience manipulator since the greatest of them all Alfred Hitchcock. But there's nothing artificially manipulative in Amour. And there's none of the sentimentality less able directors would fall back on given the film's subject matter. The acting and characterisation so good that sentiment is never needed and is in fact the very last thing you'd come across in a Haneke picture.The emotion felt towards the two protagonists as they struggle with coming to the end of their lives actually gave me a crushing sensation in my chest by the end of the runtime. This is an extremely tough film to watch at times and on more than one occasion I had to look away from the screen. The biggest compliment I can give this film is that it make me want to call my parents. 55 stars. 1 film of the year so far.".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Amour";
	schema:reviewBody "If I had watched this film no less than 5 years ago I'd probably wouldn't think too much about Michael Haneke's Palme d'Or winning Amour which made him one of an elite group of filmmakers who had won the top prize at the Cannes Film Festival at least twice and within a span of three years too. But I suppose having to live through some of life's experiences both pleasant and those that are not would have opened up one's horizons connect and identify with the many elements about terminal illness and suffering love and the quality of life being affected in more ways that I would have normally allowed.As in most of the Austrian filmmaker's movies this film centers around the characters of Georges JeanLouis Trintignant and Anne Emmanuelle Riva an elderly couple whom we see are enjoying the twilight of their lives and their companionship with each other since daughter Eva Isabelle Huppert is away overseas most of the time. Unfortunately Anne suffers a stroke and more rendering her paralyzed on one side gradually relying on the primary care provided by Georges to get through day by day. And given Georges' age being primary caregiver is also something of a challenge and a stress both mentally and physically having made a vow to Anne that he is adamant in keeping of having no further hospital visits or to put her in a home.The many things that Haneke had put into his film are the hard truths revolving around the dedicated attention given to the patient from things like feeding and the changing of diapers doing the household chores which include enlisting the help of others in grocery shopping to hardware requirements like the commode or the adjustable bed. There may be a certain level of shyness involved during cleaning up and in every step of the way you want to maintain the dignity of the patient because the last thing you want to do is to have a drop of morale. The deterioration is painful to witness as Eva goes from having strength to being completely bedridden with the ability of communication a very key thing taken away when speech impairment rears its ugly head when therapy can only do so much. Haneke doesn't gloss over the necessary aspects of suffering even if under the hands of uncaring home nurses and probably introduced a little tinge of fear as one grows old gets sick and get put under the mercy of others.Georges gets the periodic visits from his daughter but you can almost feel a distant rift between the two each time they try to sit down and communicate. What Haneke's story and screenplay brilliantly achieved is to be able to say so much without saying much at all directing the actors to bring out ideas and backchannel communication through their acting craft making it a very fulfilling experience watching and dissecting the human relations and condition in each of the characters even when Eva had to spend most of her time in bed and portraying the limited range of emotions a stroke patient can muscle together. Perhaps I too felt some guilt each time Eva returns home to check on the latest status of her mom and dad as it mirrors how I would have loved to be able to do more if not for modern day commitments or what we would like to think of as commitments.Being a Haneke film we'd come to know some darker moments to sort of jump through when we least expected especially so when the title is one as benign as Love in its many forms. While what was shocking wasn't something narratively new in films done by others it still made one heck of an impact lingering for some time which I thought was quite wicked leaving things rich and open to postscreening debate. Haneke makes you work to come up with your interpretation of events never telling you verbose details unnecessary to spoonfeed preferring that you experience and take away something from it though this was perhaps one of his less obtuse works.What made this film was also the performances of JeanLouis Trintignant and Emmanuelle Riva who hardly put in a wrong foot. Trintignant returns to the big screen after an absence of 7 years with a role specifically written for him which he duly delivered. His Georges came across as heartbroken and exasperated rolled into one. Emmanuelle Riva may seem to have gotten the easier role having to be in bed and sometimes absent for the most parts as Georges keeps her Anne locked away but credit to her fine acting without having the need to overact or overcompensate for the condition she has to flesh out. The make up department also deserves mention for being able to realistically age her on screen as well.Amour continues in its winning of the minds of various critics and chalking up awards in the festival circuit as well as year end accolades. It should be interesting if it does culminate in walking away with the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar statuette next year. Recommended!".

This picture is Haneke's minimalistic yet mightily expressive homage to love as we know it showing the feeling's overpowering force and heartfelt altruistic nature. While remaining a thoroughly unsentimental and provocative picture Amour delivers a mostdemanding portrayal of an elderly couple's last days together. Those cultivated sophisticated characters need to evaluate their longlasting marriage and come to terms with their own emotions and simultaneously discover the true meaning of love in itself. Decisions need to be made and some of them might be shocking to say the least.It's a beautiful but considerable piece of filmmaking where a sombre atmosphere and touching yet disturbing imagery permeate every scene. Haneke's steady and visionary directorial hand promises many moving and heartbreaking sequences while still providing a poetic exemplification of a well lived life's concluding moments. It's impossible to find neither a plausible sense of redemption nor an authentic touch of consolation no. The film displays a marvelous characterdriven narrative where loving individuals diverge from the seemingly familiar path and start arguing with their own opinions and ideals leading to some truly perplexing choices. In the most unexpected manner Amour touches the controversial topic of euthanasia emphatically depicting how difficult it might seem to even consider such a harsh decision.Amour is a tender scrupulous demanding twohour visualization of a romance well beyond boundaries and through its difficult notions it shows human existence in its most intimate and most elegiac state. That death seems inevitable from the very first minutes is certain but the way Haneke chooses in order to finally arrive at this intensely upsetting conclusion is an uneasy one. Amour is definitely a cinematic powerhouse which will leave the audiences in a most pensive quiet  even downcast  mood still astounding with its ubiquitous beauty.".

	schema:reviewBody "I guess I'll never understand the infatuation of the arthouse crowd and the Cannes festival in particular with Michael Haneke a director who did bold and groundbreaking work in the 90s but has since slipped into eclectic mannerisms that this reviewer has found increasingly unbearable. It's not just that nothing happens in Haneke's films it's that he has been passing off artificial renditions of admittedly stylistic mastership as presentations of actual social dilemmas. If you realize however that there's always one particular scene in a Haneke film that the whole story has been carefully engineered to carry then you will find yourself rather unimpressed by the stories they tell you'll just wait two hours for it to finally happen and feel tremendously bored in the process.In 'Love' the subject dealt with is caring for a loved one impaired by a stroke and it's one that I'm personally familiar with having taken care of my paralyzed father during his last years. That's what prompted me to view it in spite of considering 'The White Ribbon' notwithstanding its laurels one of the dullest films I've ever seen. While this doesn't make me an expert on health care I found the ultimate 'solution' in the film offensive even though I more than less expected such a conclusion it's offensive because this is what intellectual people with enough money to take psychoanalytical tours of their ohsointeresting subconscious consider the logical outcome of immense stress. And yet millions of people worldwide feed their ailing relatives with spoons or change their diapers without thinking of  I might as well relieve you of the suspense  suffocating them. Situations like these tend to take you along with them rather than giving you Othelloesque airs.To be sure until that point in the film there were a lot of situations I found myself familiar with explaining what you do to relatives who think you should do a better job while staying away from the work trying to make sense out of doctor's comments telling off private nurses rushing through their routine and most of all watching a person you were close to all your life fade away. Yes there are moments when you crack. But not only is the breakdown  in an otherwise wonderful performance by the great JeanLouis Trintignant  a rather obvious 'hommage' to the climax of JeanJacques Beineix's 'Betty Blue' in which it's much more appropriate and hardhitting it's also a completely unnecessary sensationalist twist to an otherwise straightlaced nononsense account of what happens to an elderly couple.Had it not been for this I would have left the film thinking 'Good Haneke is back to his original strong storytelling even though it's 30 minutes too long'. But as it is 'Love' is one of his calculated constructed boreoffs catering to an elitist audience who probably put their parents in homes and transform their guilt over such neglect into admiration for a film dealing with the subject. 'Stopped on Track' which won the Un Certain Regard section at Cannes in 2011 is a much more honest less calculated look at a family dealing with the prospect of death. It also has what 'Love' most distinctly lacks  heart. For that is what makes me bash Haneke's films so often they may have brains but no heart to go along with.".

Situations like these tend to take you along with them rather than giving you Othelloesque airs.To be sure until that point in the film there were a lot of situations I found myself familiar with explaining what you do to relatives who think you should do a better job while staying away from the work trying to make sense out of doctor's comments telling off private nurses rushing through their routine and most of all watching a person you were close to all your life fade away. Yes there are moments when you crack. But not only is the breakdown  in an otherwise wonderful performance by the great JeanLouis Trintignant  a rather obvious 'hommage' to the climax of JeanJacques Beineix's 'Betty Blue' in which it's much more appropriate and hardhitting it's also a completely unnecessary sensationalist twist to an otherwise straightlaced nononsense account of what happens to an elderly couple.Had it not been for this I would have left the film thinking 'Good Haneke is back to his original strong storytelling even though it's 30 minutes too long'. But as it is 'Love' is one of his calculated constructed boreoffs catering to an elitist audience who probably put their parents in homes and transform their guilt over such neglect into admiration for a film dealing with the subject. 'Stopped on Track' which won the Un Certain Regard section at Cannes in 2011 is a much more honest less calculated look at a family dealing with the prospect of death. It also has what 'Love' most distinctly lacks  heart. For that is what makes me bash Haneke's films so often they may have brains but no heart to go along with.";

	schema:reviewBody "There's a scene in Michael Haneke's latest film the winner of this year's Palme d'Or AMOUR in which one of the main characters talks about a film he saw long time ago. The main characters are an elderly married couple the music teachers Georges and Eve JeanLouis Trintignant and Emmanuelle Riva respectively. So Georges is telling Eve about a film that left him a big impression  now he can't really recall the film itself name its story and stuff but only the huge emotion he felt with it not only while watching it but also while later telling someone about it. AMOUR is a film about that emotion. If JeanLouis Trintignant's character can only remember now as an elderly man what that film made him feel then Haneke only wants that you and his characters feel something. AMOUR ain't a film with a big intriguing story. In fact it opens with the conclusion of the whole thing which is certainly about that mentioned married couple  there's nothing much going on besides some music concerts until Even begins to show serious health problems she suffers a stroke actually and soon of paralysis. Obviously we know that there won't be much hope for her.I don't think none of these are spoilers hell you already guessed the conclusion to the story of Eve. Like I said Haneke decided to go a bit nonlinear with the very first shot of the film  he's telling the audience something like yes she dies I'm not going to give you any hope and I just want you to feel something. And it's really impossible not to certainly the main performers are the principals responsible for that. If anything Emmanuelle Riva gives one of the very best performances of the year perhaps the best. It's a daring work that shows her huge dedication and commitment. Think in the following words that at least according to IMDb the Mexican director Carlos Reygadas POST TENEBRAS LUX said when asked about the nudity in his film BATALLA EN EL CIELO 2005 We are all naked when we go to the shower. At least twice or three times a day we are naked. And most of us have sex once a week or more. It's a thing that occurs often. But it's not represented ever on film. So the normal thing to do would be to ask every other director why they don't have sex in their film and not ask me about it. I am the only normal one.In AMOUR we deal with the whole process of a terminal illness the preoccupation the desires of the patient the care giving the desperation and well just daytoday issues. And Haneke is just as normal as Reygadas therefore if you think he is not going to show a daytoday activity like taking a shower in its pure form well you better think again. This is part of the reason to say Emmanuelle Riva did such a great daring work. Not many people are interested in watching the latest film about a terminal illness. That theme alone makes for a very difficult experience certainly and well this one is even more than the average it's almost a horror film with truly terrifying thoughtprovoking material. It left me shocked even when like I said you know everything right from the very beginning. You better find out why! Watched it on 14 November 2012".

Writerdirector Michael Haneke strikes me as a true artist in cinema. And an exceptional one at that. Known for such unusual films as The White Ribbon Cache' and the original Funny Games 1997 Haneke often has a way of showing us things about ourselves that we prefer not to see.Amour means love and this film could easily have been titled Love and Misery as strong and indescribable feelings mount when a life partner begins the inevitable slide downhill ... a trip which often starts with something as bland as a few moments of blankness at the breakfast table.Georges JeanLouis Trintignant A Man and A Woman and Anne Emmanuelle Riva Hiroshima Mon Amour somehow draw our eye as they sit in the audience as seen from the stage of a soontobegin piano concerto. It's a thought provoking shot when paired with the familiar quip All the world's a stage .... Next we see this octogenarian couple chatting over breakfast clearly comfortable with each other in the manner that only two people who have shared decades together can become.A trip to the hospital confirms Anne has had a stroke. And then another. The rest of the film revolves around Georges keeping his promise to Anne that she won't be put back into the hospital. It's a real life situation that so many face yet the answers remain cloudy. So Georges proceeds to become caregiver to the increasingly incapacitated Anne. First wheelchair bound with paralysis on one side. Next she's learning to operate a motorized chair. Then it's speech therapy. Finally she' bedridden and devolving into someone who can't express simple emotions. No this is not typical Hollywood entertainment. This is life's realities through the expressive acting of two of France's best.It would be easy to say not much happens in the two hour running but in fact it is filled with the daily moments that make up life. The moments become an obstacle course when we must assist a loved one in the performance or if we are the one being assisted. Nurses who may or may not be caring friends who are struck helpless and even family played here by Isabelle Huppert The Piano Teacher who feel the responsibility to help but are caught in the responsibilities of everyday life.Death is a common occurrence in movies. Dying is actually quite rare. Haneke doesn't shy away from any aspect of this sorrowful and difficult journey. He forces us to consider the multiple sides of so many questions and he certainly feels no obligation to provide us with simple solutions or happy endings. Georges walls off society from doing what is best for his wife. He prefers to honor her wishes.These are two extraordinary performances from two of France's alltime best actors. Ms. Riva was rewarded with an Oscar nomination and Mr. Trintignant was just as deserving. Mr. Haneke has been nominated as Best Director and the film is up for both Best Foreign Film and Best Picture. Don't mistake any of that recognition as a sign that this is a mainstream movie. It's exquisite filmmaking but many will find it difficult or impossible to watch. You best be ready to analyze death versus dying.".

	schema:reviewBody "The fact that Amour is an instant classic in the arthouse world is perhaps one of the most bewildering phenomena to present itself to me lately. It's difficult for me to even begin to criticize it.Firstly some will say that this film is a mightily expressive homage to love which shows the feeling's overpowering force and heartfelt nature. This boggles me. It's simply baffling that this is an opinion people come away with after having viewed Amour. The focus of the movie is to present a couple's relationship in its twilight years however it does nothing to round out this relationship. The viewers of this movie witness a mechanical formal and unnaturally polite relationship between two old people. We are never presented with images of their past nor any obvious sense of devotion they feel towards each other. In fact we never understand very much about them beyond the fact that the wife is dying and the husband is burdened with taking care of her. The plot starts off shallow and deepens only marginally.The fact that the couple's relationship is not well presented undermines every other aspect of the movie. I found it impossible to feel any deep connection or pity for these people who were strangers to each other as well as myself. The only emotion present for the duration of the movie is concern. This becomes unbearable to watch after the first halfhour.Some will say that the director has a visionary directorial hand. This was not apparent to me. This movie has no vision and presents nothing that cannot be found outside of a resthome. Is it visionary to show an old woman urinating in her bed? Or slowly becoming senile? Or receiving assistance to go to the washroom? It takes no insight or vision to show these things and I cannot imagine why such displays enthral viewers. A truly good filmmaker would have insinuated the trials of old age and the oncoming of death without needing to display them explicitly. A good filmmaker would create emotions that hit home without the tactics that Haneke employed.The old man eventually makes a point that these characteristics of old age are the things no one wishes to see. Why would the director ignore advice given in his own movie's script? Did he think he could create something profound and artistic by simply going against the norms? Did he think he could create a masterpiece by presenting unconventional uncomfortable scenes which do nothing but cause the audience to feel queasy or inclined to look away? Such empty shockvalue will never be a benefit to a movie. It is not a tool which a good director implements. Do the people who endorse this movie also stand behind movies containing graphic violence? Or extreme sexual scenes? Do other criticallyacclaimed movies rely so heavily on shock to produce emotion?The plot of Amour is simple and could be fully explained within a paragraph of writing. The director inflates this plot to the point that it runs for over 2 hours. This is accomplished by inserting countless long lasting shots of dull scenes. I watched a man cut the head off of every flower in a bouquet for 3 minutes when I had gotten the gist of it after 2 seconds. I gazed at an open window for 2. I watched a woman turning her head to resist being given drinkingwater for 3. Again I ask is such a reliance on fillercontent the sign of a good filmmaker?Overall it strikes me as profoundly odd that a director can create a movie lacking any and all instances of characterdevelopment drama or intrigue a welldeveloped thesis and only containing bountiful amounts of shocking imagery scenes that any person avoids witnessing in their daytoday life and drawnout still camera shots and become critically acclaimed. It is simply baffling. Haneke is really on to something.This movie is meant for the type who likes to go to a theatre watch a piece that is intensely artsy and then give a standingovation afterwards without thinking beyond the artsiness of the movie and without considering the fact that it may be deeply flawed in any or perhaps even every aspect of filmmaking.".

	schema:reviewBody "I didn't like Michael Haneke's 'The White Ribbon' as it was a fable that had little basis in reality. Haneke is on much more solid ground with 'Amour' as the story is based on experiences Haneke observed with one of his own relatives. A story such as 'Amour' which involves the deterioration of a stroke victim and her husband's valiant efforts to care for her becomes problematic when truelife events are reproduced almost verbatim. Fortunately Haneke mixes things up enough to keep our interest and then throws in a twist ending of sorts which will come as a surprise to most viewers who likely won't be expecting such a turn of events.The stroke victim in question is Anne who lives with her husband Georges both retired music teachers. When Anne blacks out at the breakfast table one morning Georges knows something is wrong but Anne doesn't seem to have any memory of the incident. It turns out she has a blocked carotid artery but after undergoing surgery Anne ends up paralyzed on one side.The first half of 'Amour' involves Georges' efforts to help Anne with her rehabilitation. He holds her up out of her wheelchair and she takes feeble steps using her one good leg and dragging the other. Eventually Anne has another stroke which reduces her to a childlike state often she talks in gibberish. Georges becomes more frustrated as there are moments when Anne refuses to swallow the soft food Georges is trying to spoon feed her.Outside visitors occasionally impinge on Anne and Georges' depressing world. Early on before the second stroke one of Anne's students a wellknown classical pianist pays a visit and asks Anne what happened to her. She understandably doesn't want to discuss her situation merely stating that her condition is a result of 'old age'. Later Anne and Georges' daughter Eva pays a visit and argues with her father recommending that she put Anne in a home. Georges' reacts angrily and considers Eva's suggestion callous. It eventually comes out that the relationship between daughter and parents is not good primarily due to her Britishborn husband who apparently the parents did not care for too much.After Georges decides to hire a second nurse he discovers that this particular woman has been mistreating Anne in a particularly upsetting scene the nurse pulls Anne by the hair lifting her face to a mirror and mocks her to the effect 'don't you want to see your pretty face'?. Georges fires the nurse but she indignantly claims that she's never had a problem before with any of her employers and rudely curses the old man before leaving.It's interesting that the family doctor is never seen during the entire film. The visitors to the apartment however serve to break up the monotony of Anne's deterioration not only for Georges but for the audience as well. While Haneke has managed to hold our interest until the second act crisis he's treading in dangerous waters as it's at this point in the film when the audience's patience is tested. Just how much more of this chronicle of Anne's downward spiral can anyone take?SUPER SPOILERS AHEAD. DO NOT READ FURTHER UNLESS YOU WANT TO KNOW ABOUT A TWIST ENDING! 'Amour' suddenly morphs into a crime drama of sorts when the caring Georges suddenly decides he can't take it anymore and smothers Anne with a pillow. He prepares the body so that when the police finally arrive Anne appears in a dignified state. He also seals the door with masking tape presumably to prevent the foul odor from permeating the apartment. Then Georges pens a final note and while it's not entirely clear it appears he commits suicide to join his wife in death. Right before the note Georges captures a pigeon that has flown into the apartment but lets it go perhaps symbolizing that he finally has let Anne go by effecting the mercy killing.If you've ever read any newspaper articles about mercy killings where the spouse who does the killing ends up committing suicide 'Amour' pretty much explains why these things go on. The mercy killing also provides food for thought by bringing up the issue of keeping a comatose patient alive while in a vegetative or extremely debilitated state. It's easy to take a 'holier than thou' attitude but when you're in a situation like Georges do you completely condemn him for 'snapping'? And would you have been so selfsacrificing for a family member as he was? Many of us would probably have went along with the daughter's advice to place the debilitated relative in a home thus leaving the care to others who might have ended up as caring as the second nurse who Georges was forced to fire. Veteran actors Emmanuelle Riva as Anne and JeanLouis Trintignant are excellent as the tragic couple. I understand that Trintignant came out of retirement to play this role he hadn't been in a film for 14 years. 'Amour' is not an easy film to watch but it's important to remind people that illness in old age is a reality and it could happen to anybody. With its jarring ending Haneke has managed to raise this documentarylike feature to the higher realm of true art.".

In the midst of all this just parts of the crowd two older faces a man with receding hair cautiously interested an older woman with a glowing expression Their eyes are on the stage but in reality their focus is on each other. They are what they have and that one can glimpse from this long shot near the opening is quite a lot. In the end so the beginning of the film has told us at least one of them will be gone and it is this long process of death and the most ultimate of all separations that Michael Haneke puts in front of us for the next two hours and he does so in the most unsentimental of ways. What he shows is love when it matters most love that turns into pain and loss but is worth so much more than what these can take love that is strongest when it destroys and which destroys because it is so strong. Amour is both a devastating portrait of what cannot be avoided as well as Haneke's warmest and most humanistic film. For those who only want to see one film this year this should be the one.Amour has all the hallmarks of the Haneke cinema. The long stills the quiet camera movements which always keep a distance and hardly ever move into closeup the laconic sound the slow pace the quietness without any dramatic outbursts the absence of music the subtle acting the sense of mystery. The look at old age is harsh indeed there is no mitigating factor to the relatively rapid decay and dissolution of a human being and the helplessness of the one left behind. Those long camera shots are relentless they conceal nothing neither externally nor internally. Indeed it is the very distance Haneke creates that does not allow the viewer to hide behind sentimentality or shock that throws what is happening straight in our faces.And above all it is the normality that hits hardest for this is the normal way of life this is how it must end it is what we know will eventually happen to all of us and yet which none of us is prepared for. JeanLouis Trintignan and Emmanuelle Riva play the longmarried couple with astonishing dignity and warmth a stinging tenderness and a subtlety that makes them almost painfully real. We can see the life the enthusiasm the knowledge gradually disappear from Riva's character and we are left as helpless as Trintignan's.There is a constant sense that he cannot survive this loss of so much that he has been and yet again Haneke does not employ any dramatic tricks and techniques he just unfolds the growing emptiness in this large and aged apartment in which the film which the exception of the concert scene never leaves. And as the life gets sucked out of it it is filled with a stifling heavy emptiness which makes the big space feel somewhat claustrophobic the absence getting stronger and stronger and swallowing all there is until there is nothing else left.As hard as Amour is to bear at times it also carries more love and warmth and affirmation of life than most of his other films combined. For the loss only feels so unbearable because it is so much that is being lost. In a way Amour is a relative of Andreas Dresen's Halt auf freier Strecke a totally unsentimental portrait of death and loss that is first and foremost also a celebration of love and life.httpstagescreen.wordpress.com".

	schema:reviewBody "It was bound to happen. A film encompasses the soul and meaning of love and executes the physical and emotional demand it requires to be told effectively and correctly. That film is Michael Haneke's Amour. Haneke steers the film effortlessly as if he were telling a shotforshot story of his own experiences. He constructs and creates two real and authentic people Georges JeanLouis Tringnant and Anne Emmanuelle Riva. It's wonderful to see Haneke allow the powerful leads to feel and interpret these people of their own accord. It's one of his finest writing efforts of his career. Tringnant's heart is visible and available for all the viewers to see. He's fearless as he walks through the film frail and broken yet confident and composed. He challenges the audience to empathize and question our own reactions and reality. Same goes Riva who does everything right that was wrong with similar performances like Hilary Swank in Million Dollar Baby 2004. Riva goes above and beyond the call of duty wearing Anne on her skin with vulnerability. It's one of the great performances of the year by any woman in any category. The two leads together is even more brilliant than when they're apart. Adding in the talents of Isabelle Hupert as Eva the daughter of our married couple who finds her own love tested is wonderfully operational. While many will chalk this film up to depression and elderly inevitability I don't share the same sentiments. The film is front to back about love pure and simple. The events circle a morose and saddened sequence but Georges and Anne is the great love story of the year. The film dares you to find someone you love that much in both perspectives. Haneke focuses on the couple with no outside stories of their neighbors life before these events or extra characters. He puts them in the spotlight front and center. Amour could be the best film of the year and is the best film of the New York Film Festival so far.".

	schema:reviewBody "You've heard the hype about Amour right now. Not only one of the most critically acclaimed films of the year but a foreign film that gets a Best Picture and Best Director film has to be great right? Not so fast. This film to me is a colossal failure and misstep. Let's start with the most obvious reason. The film is called Amour translated to Love in English. As a film about a man holding onto his mentally and physically fading wife one should expect a lot of love shared from him. But the opposite is true. Amour is a totally emotionally detached and COLD film. In fact part of me wonders if Haneke intended for his title to be ironic by making his characters NOT have much love between them as emotionally disconnected souls. Certainly their weak relationship with their daughter would fit into this theme. Regardless though the two principle characters being cold and clinical made this a very unenjoyable watch to me. I did not like these people very much and I did not feel a strong relationship between them. Obviously in a film with this plot a strong emotional relationship between its characters would seem critical and this film misses in that area.But as a whole my main problem with Amour is how clinical it feels. I always felt the presence of Michael Haneke in this film and I don't mean that in a good way. I always felt like I was watching the film being directed and filmed. The dialog felt rather forced and unorganic to me as well a major problem in a film that aspires to realism. To give an example of a microcosm of the film's problems a few times in the film the JeanLouis Trintignant character George has a pigeon fly into the apartment. The first time he chases it away but when it comes back after his wife had died he catches in a blanket and embraces it. Get it  the pigeon represents George embracing his wife's and his future death first he doesn't want to accept it then he embraces it! If this sounds forced and eye roll worthy to you it's because it is. Now the pigeon scene doesn't hurt the film that much in fact it's kind of fun to see JLT chasing it around but the entire film is made with the mindset of that film. Haneke calculating his cinematography and dialog to try and force his 'relationship' between the leads on you and his messages about embracing death. Despite great performances by JeanLouis Trintignant and Emmanuelle Riva it never gets past the less than natural way Haneke films this But as a whole my biggest gripe with the film comes down this IT IS BORING. IT IS VERY VERY BORING. In part because of the lack of emotional resonance I suppose I did not feel involved with the story much. I'll even admit that as someone who watched it on a screener on my laptop at times during the film I was surfing websites online just to make the film go by faster. That's the sign that the movie failed. Amour could've been a great film but in the end it's a calculated on the nose bore that I have no interest in ever seeing again.".

	schema:headline " Cold Clinical and Heartless";
	schema:reviewBody "Michael Haneke's wildly overrated and misunderstood Amour may be his cruelest joke to date right down to the film's sarcastic title. I am a huge Haneke fan. His icy emotionless almost sadistic approach to filmmaking is perfectly suited to black hearted thrillers like Cache Funny Games Benny's Video and The White Ribbon. But when he applies his surgeon's knife to such human subjects as aging illness and death it comes off so sour so meanspirited and so surprisingly  boring  that it's difficult to sit through. Having recently experienced the illness and death of my own parents my mother was halfparalyzed after a stroke much like Amour's heroine I was afraid this film would be too unbearably painful for me to watch. I shouldn't have worried. I felt nothing but boredom. The characterizations are so thin and shallow the Old Man and Old Woman such ciphers that they barely seem human. They're symbols or archetypes. Having the woman's mind gone felt like a copout too a way to avoid emotional truth as did the clinical portrayals of caretaking. Everything feels so distant and calculated that I can't help feeling the title Love is the director's idea of a joke. Many critics and viewers however seem to find Amour to be deeply emotional compassionate and devastating. But I think they may be filling in the blanks of Haneke's bonedry script with their own experiences and issues  which may be Haneke's real intention here. I believe he is once again playing the scientist and we the audience are his test subjects. He shows an audience at the beginning of the film it's us. So while I must congratulate Haneke for pulling off another interesting experiment I have to scold him this time for being even more heartless and manipulative than usual.".

	onyx:emotionText "Michael Haneke's wildly overrated and misunderstood Amour may be his cruelest joke to date right down to the film's sarcastic title. I am a huge Haneke fan. His icy emotionless almost sadistic approach to filmmaking is perfectly suited to black hearted thrillers like Cache Funny Games Benny's Video and The White Ribbon. But when he applies his surgeon's knife to such human subjects as aging illness and death it comes off so sour so meanspirited and so surprisingly  boring  that it's difficult to sit through. Having recently experienced the illness and death of my own parents my mother was halfparalyzed after a stroke much like Amour's heroine I was afraid this film would be too unbearably painful for me to watch. I shouldn't have worried. I felt nothing but boredom. The characterizations are so thin and shallow the Old Man and Old Woman such ciphers that they barely seem human. They're symbols or archetypes. Having the woman's mind gone felt like a copout too a way to avoid emotional truth as did the clinical portrayals of caretaking. Everything feels so distant and calculated that I can't help feeling the title Love is the director's idea of a joke. Many critics and viewers however seem to find Amour to be deeply emotional compassionate and devastating. But I think they may be filling in the blanks of Haneke's bonedry script with their own experiences and issues  which may be Haneke's real intention here. I believe he is once again playing the scientist and we the audience are his test subjects. He shows an audience at the beginning of the film it's us.

This is a film of quiet sophistication and respect and will likely stand as one of the greatest love stories ever placed before the public in a film.Georges JeanLouis Trintignant and Anne Emmanuelle Riva are a couple of retired music teachers enjoying life in their eighties attending concerts where Anne's pupil Alexandre Alexandre Tharaud is performing the Schubert Impromptus. In their comfortable home they enjoy each other's sensitivity and pleasures but one morning at breakfast Anne suffers a TIA from which she seems to recover rather quickly.

The couple's bond of love is severely tested but then breathtaking conclusion radiates the power and durability of true love.Both JeanLouis Trintignant and Emmanuelle Riva offer impeccable performances and Isabelle Huppert adds a superlative supporting role as the daughter who does not seem to fathom her parents' love.

As someone about to turn the corner into what some consider to be old age and perhaps overly daunted by the subject matter it took me some time to build up the courage to watch this film. As a good friend said after he'd seen it Amour is a film that you must see but that you will probably only want or need to see once. But see it you must.The genius of this film lies in the fact that it doesn't rely on any cheap cinematic or emotional shortcuts. We see this elderly couple for what they are refined often distant from one another and from their daughter and their star pupil perhaps a bit smug even snobbish. Their relationship is not the stuff of tearyeyed sentimentality.For virtually the entire film we live with Georges and Anne in their comfortable but decidedly stuffy Paris apartment. The claustrophobia that they must feel confined to a small space by Anne's deteriorating health is reinforced by the fact that we never even see out their window though the window does play a pivotal role in the film symbolic motif. Contrast that with another one of cinema's greatest apartmentbound films Rear Window in which we spend virtually all of our time looking out onto other people's lives. Here we're forced to look relentlessly inward.

	schema:reviewBody "Amour is a film for filmmakers and is a film student's dream. It is the kind of movie that demands analysis over and over for its dense symbolism and wonderful structure. It makes some really odd choices but overall writerdirector Michael Haneke knows exactly where he's putting the camera and why and every shot on the screen oozes purpose. Foreign films don't often gets nominated at the Oscars outside of the best foreign film award let alone for best director and a best actress nomination for star Emmanuelle Riva but Amour is moving brutally honest cinema about love life sacrifice and death. NOTE Spoilers to come. A lot of them.The aforementioned Emmanuelle Riva stars in the film as Anne along with costar JeanLouis Trintignant as Georges a couple of retired music teachers in their eighties enjoying their quiet little life together. The film takes a turn when Anne suffers a stroke paralyzing her right side and forcing Georges to take care of her. The attack puts a strain on their relationship with Anne falling increasingly ill and wanting more for her husband than to take care of her and with Georges everloyal and willing to do anything to make her well again.The performances by both Riva and Trintignant are simply spectacular. There is a love and devotion between these two characters that goes beyond words and it is bright and alive in the air between them at all times. Most enjoyable are the scenes between the two just looking at one another such as Georges attempting to feed Anne and give her water the look on Anne's face is one of such excruciating pain. The real crime is Trintignant being overlooked at the Oscars for his amazing performance he is every bit as spectacular as Riva is and their performances compliment one another perfectly. Truly one would not have been possible without the other.The film costars Isabelle Huppert as their daughter Eva a far smaller role but a character just as large as the other two. It is fantastic to see her evolution as a character and how her mother's deteriorating health commands more and more of her attention as the film goes on. Alexandre Tharaud plays Alexandre a former student of the couple's who has gone on to great success and fame.The amazing acting however is only a small portion of the very large picture that is Amour. It owes everything to the script from Haneke and to his careful direction. The camerawork is a bit jarring at first shots remain steady for quite a long time looking at characters from behind or from the side keeping things out of focus and keeping its distance an interesting choice that serves to truly isolate Anne and Georges. In some scenes the camerawork is deliberately meant to make the viewer almost uncomfortable others it serves to illustrate the slow stagnant lives that the two of them live. The viewer is only allowed certain access to these moments the minutes that make up these lives. Georges and Eva have a discussion about her relationships and career Georges has his back to the camera while all the viewer can see is Eva. Haneke closes the audience off emotionally from Georges forcing them to wonder with him at what happened to Anne in the prior scene.Amour also uses beautiful symbolism in many ways but most specifically in the form of a pigeon twice arriving at Georges and Anne's home. The bird finds its way in through an open window popping about the apartment the first time through Georges shoos it away chasing it back to the window and out of the apartment. The second after Anne has already passed away he captures and cradles closely in his arms. In both of these instances the pigeon represents death passage into the afterlife he wants more than anything to keep his wife alive and make her well again and chases the bird off. Once she has passed however there is little left on Earth for Georges and he embraces death to join his beloved Anne.There is too much to say about a film so richly layered and this review barely touches the surface. Amour is a moving film about real love and real life and the struggles that love must endure. It certainly isn't a blockbuster it can be a bit slow and a bit jarring at times the camera is unforgiving and the characters grow more and more haggard as the movie goes on. Yet it is to its core a testament to the beauty and unending power of love that transcends this or any other life. Its performers simply live and breathe these characters for two hours but I promise they'll stay with you for a very long time after.".

	schema:headline " A spontaneous reaction to Haneke's Amour without the words 'boring' 'overrated' and 'pretentious' ...";
	schema:reviewBody "I've just watched the most acclaimed foreign film of the year and when I say watched I mean endured for even the word experienced is too weak to describe Amour's effect. Michael Haneke the Austrian director tunnels our senses into the cruel world of old age through the story of Anne and Georges an elderly couple octogenarians like the actors who play them JeanLouis Trintignant who bares a strange resemblance with Laurence Olivier and Emmanuelle Riva.And speaking on her Oscarnomination it almost undermined my personal enjoyment of the first act. Knowing that the actress gave one of the best performances of the year I put my expectations so high they were sadly deceived in one scene or two. Riva is generally terrific her body language her eyes communicate something deep and sincere until she speaks. During the heartbreaking breakfast scene when she suddenly froze into catatonia while Georges was telling a story she was perfect but then when she regained her emotions I felt she was 'reciting lines'. I had to check the scene again same feeling  needless to say that her performance as soon as she sat on the wheelchair redeemed this one flaw but still. While watching Emmanuelle Riva many other performances came to mind Ellen Burstyn in Requiem for a Dream Gena Rowlands in A Woman Under the Influence both women victim of their own good nature and gradually descending into a hellish madness. I thought of them maybe for the realism to a slapintheface level of their performances. I looked for this 'truth' but found some bleak coldness in Riva's delivery that confined to unnaturalness the feeling didn't last but it was painful not to feel the emotion when she was in a 'normal state'. I saw the film with my wife and she felt the exact same thing and we both agreed that Trintignant was more credible and absolutely incredible. At the end Riva's performance was in the same vein than Hillary Swank in Million Dollar Baby and Harriet Anderson who played an agonizing bedridden woman in Cries and Whispers and I guess the level of pathos she admirably transcended justified the nomination. And while Swank could walk after the film and Anderson didn't suffer from cancer Riva's performance is the bravest because she doesn't cheat while playing an old woman devoured by senescence and handicap when she's naked while the nurse showers her or puts a diaper her eyes don't lie. She might end up like that and her eyes reflect our own fears being dependent belittled by careless nurses treated like children or be patronized by ours.I'm sorry to fill the review with Oscar considerations but since they are giving the film the very publicity it deserves they fatally affect people's expectations if not opinions. And while we're talking 'awards' I sincerely believe Trintignant didn't get the credit he deserves because when you think about it what does the title refer to? The titular Amour is the driver of George's life a man who dedicates his efforts his focus to make the last days of Anne more comfortable being more than caregiver for there is more than care to give there is love but also respect attention and consideration. I also referred to Cries and Whispers because Bergman's influence is striking through Haneke's constant static shots on domestic interiors and sober direction one of the Swedish master's trademarks. A tactful editing took enough time to show the pathos but cut it at the right moment before it would lead to a damaging reverse voyeurism. Haneke's influences are obvious but at times when all the movies rely on homages I can't complain when it's the style of Bergman or Cassavetes that is imitated and not without the substance. The power of Amour is to to explore the soul of a man torn between the true love he feels for Anne and the devastation he witnesses watching her body her mind slowly degenerates. George's torment reflects what life is all about conflict and since Anne can't defend herself she's virtually dead. In a very satisfying scene Georges dismisses an incompetent nurse by telling her I hope that you have the misfortune to be treated exactly the way that you treat your patients when you are helpless. Helpless that's exactly the state of Anne and Georges is the only one to understand that she needs someone who treats her like an adult. One of the most devastating scenes occurs when Anne refuses to drink George's reaction is shocking but realistic. Indeed we'd never harm those who love except if they try to harm themselves. The slap Georges gave is a sort of defensive mechanism he applies in the name of Anne's soul because she can't respond for herself. Literally Georges embodies Anne's agony. And he's in such a symbiosis with his wife's soul that he embraces her suicidal impulses and suddenly grabs the pillow to  like One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest the ending elevates the film to another dimension. Amour is about sparing someone we love the pain and the agony just like Haneke who spared us the same torment to follow Anne until the very last breath. The film reminded me of my grandmother she lives with her unmarried daughter who approaches the 70's. My aunt truly loves her mother but can't stand her repetitive cries for help like those haunting Hurt! she wishes God would allow her to live the world in peace but the cruelty of life doesn't rely on the imminence of death but on its uncertain delay. Haneke chronicles the conflict inhabiting a man who waits for things to come naturally and does the best to ease the pain par Amour but wonders as time goes by if it's really worth waiting and suffering still par Amour. I'm not sure which of Anne or George's state is the more enviable ".

And while Swank could walk after the film and Anderson didn't suffer from cancer Riva's performance is the bravest because she doesn't cheat while playing an old woman devoured by senescence and handicap when she's naked while the nurse showers her or puts a diaper her eyes don't lie. She might end up like that and her eyes reflect our own fears being dependent belittled by careless nurses treated like children or be patronized by ours.I'm sorry to fill the review with Oscar considerations but since they are giving the film the very publicity it deserves they fatally affect people's expectations if not opinions. And while we're talking 'awards' I sincerely believe Trintignant didn't get the credit he deserves because when you think about it what does the title refer to? The titular Amour is the driver of George's life a man who dedicates his efforts his focus to make the last days of Anne more comfortable being more than caregiver for there is more than care to give there is love but also respect attention and consideration. I also referred to Cries and Whispers because Bergman's influence is striking through Haneke's constant static shots on domestic interiors and sober direction one of the Swedish master's trademarks. A tactful editing took enough time to show the pathos but cut it at the right moment before it would lead to a damaging reverse voyeurism. Haneke's influences are obvious but at times when all the movies rely on homages I can't complain when it's the style of Bergman or Cassavetes that is imitated and not without the substance. The power of Amour is to to explore the soul of a man torn between the true love he feels for Anne and the devastation he witnesses watching her body her mind slowly degenerates. George's torment reflects what life is all about conflict and since Anne can't defend herself she's virtually dead. In a very satisfying scene Georges dismisses an incompetent nurse by telling her I hope that you have the misfortune to be treated exactly the way that you treat your patients when you are helpless. Helpless that's exactly the state of Anne and Georges is the only one to understand that she needs someone who treats her like an adult. One of the most devastating scenes occurs when Anne refuses to drink George's reaction is shocking but realistic. Indeed we'd never harm those who love except if they try to harm themselves. The slap Georges gave is a sort of defensive mechanism he applies in the name of Anne's soul because she can't respond for herself. Literally Georges embodies Anne's agony. And he's in such a symbiosis with his wife's soul that he embraces her suicidal impulses and suddenly grabs the pillow to  like One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest the ending elevates the film to another dimension. Amour is about sparing someone we love the pain and the agony just like Haneke who spared us the same torment to follow Anne until the very last breath. The film reminded me of my grandmother she lives with her unmarried daughter who approaches the 70's. My aunt truly loves her mother but can't stand her repetitive cries for help like those haunting Hurt! she wishes God would allow her to live the world in peace but the cruelty of life doesn't rely on the imminence of death but on its uncertain delay. Haneke chronicles the conflict inhabiting a man who waits for things to come naturally and does the best to ease the pain par Amour but wonders as time goes by if it's really worth waiting and suffering still par Amour. I'm not sure which of Anne or George's state is the more enviable ";

	schema:reviewBody "I wouldn't exactly call YOU CAN'T TAKE IT WITH YOU YCTIWY Capra's forgotten movieafter all it did win the Best Picture Oscar in its year. And I have heard of this film by word of mouth previously though perhaps not as frequently or with as much ubiquity as some of Capra's other films. Compared to IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE and MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON for example YCTIWY distinctly has the status of a 'minor classic'. I don't believe this is deserved even if themes and costars are shared between these movies YCTIWY should definitely be far better known and remembered than it actually is.First of all the storytelling is flawless. It very cleverly sets up the two very different families the VanderhofSycamores an offbeat family trading most importantly in happiness and the Kirbys a stiff up tight banking family trading mostly in weapons. To complete the biggest deal of his career Anthony Kirby Sr Edward Arnold must buy up the last house in a neighbourhood and of course this house belongs to Martin Vanderhof a delightful Lionel Barrymore. The movie pleasantly surprised me in not having young Tony Kirby James Stewart be assigned to get Vanderhof to sell his house and thereby falling in love with Alice Sycamore Jean Arthur and her zany family. Rather he was in love with her to begin with and loved her regardless of what he thought of her family. Though it would be impossible to hate any of them I feel! The story really is simple Tony loves Alice no matter what and doesn't want her or her family to put on a show to impress his own family. When he surprises her by turning up a day early for a dinner engagement the Kirbys meet the VanderhofSycamores for who they truly are wind up in jail and along the way learn a little bit about being real human beings. There are several delightful scenes in the film as well all beautifully filmed and connected such that the story is a coherent whole. I'm especially partial to practically any scene with James Stewart wooing Jean Arthur those two quite seriously make the cutest couple imaginableI love it when he sort of proposes to her. Scratch hard enough and you'll find a proposal. Or that lovely intimate scene in the park where he directs her to a seat like he would at the ballet or when they start dancing with the neighbourhood children. The scene in the restaurant was also amusing when Tony kept warning Alice that there was a scream on the way building it up so perfectly that she wound up screaming before he did. It's hard to beat the scene in night court too when Capra foreshadows pretty much the exact same scene and sentiment in the forthcoming IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE when all of Vanderhof's friends chip in to pay off his fine. It's sweet it's real and it's something you really do wish could still happen in this world. Even the littlest things like Grandpa Vanderhof's dinnertime prayers are enough to remind the viewer of what a world could be like if we kept our values simple our wants satisfied and ourselves happy.Second of all the acting is superlative. How could it not be with a cast like this? Evidently I was completely charmed by James Stewart and Jean Arthur who are both incredibly believable both as real people and movie stars and who together make Tony and Alice an utterly credible truetolife couple. Edward Arnold was great as the stuffed shirt Anthony Kirby Sr toohis eventual 'thawing' was something that could easily have been played in too exaggerated a fashion but both the actor and director I suspect are too good to have allowed that to happen. I also had great fun watching Ann Miller in her secondary role as Essie Sycamore Alice's dancing sister. I sincerely hope that every person making this film had just as much fun as I did watching it because the whole secondary cast was excellent and I loved all the characters we were introduced to particularly the entire Sycamore family with their attendant friends the exiceman DePinna or the toymaker Poppins and even their servants Rheba and Donald who were treated almost as much as part of the family as could be expected at that time. But my greatest praise would have to be reserved for Lionel Barrymore as Martin Vanderhofa sweeter lovelier old man you just couldn't imagine and a complete change from his muchbetterknown Mr. Potter in IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE. He really does make Grandpa Vanderhof very much a real person from his reminiscences about Grandma Vanderhof to his messing around with the IRS agent to his harmonicaplaying and evident love of life and people. I really could not say enough good things about this movie which I prefer to IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE. It'll make you laugh it'll make you cry and quite frankly it'll make you glad to be alive. Not many movies can do that. And it's most certainly true that you can't take your money with you... but what you can do is take this movie and its message to heart. 1010 without a doubt.".

He is so warm and funny in this movie it's hard to believe he's the same man who played the evil Mr. Potter in It's A Wonderful Life. Edward Arnold who was known for playing slimy villians is great as Stewart's very wealthy and totally stuckup father.";

Looking at it now it is firmly anchored in the decade that spawned it and the Oscar is a tribute to authors Kaufman and Hart and their popularity in that time. You Can't Take It With You came off a Broadway run of 838 performances for the 19361938 Broadway seasons. It's a tale of two men and their families. Edward Arnold plays Anthony Kirby millionaire banker and industrialist who is obsessed with both making money and his social position though the latter is more in deference to his snooty wife Mary Forbes. Their son James Stewart is preparing uneasily to step into his father's world. What really is Stewart's main interest is the romance he's got going with the only normal member of that other family Jean Arthur.Her grandfather is the second man with a family. A very extended family that all lives under one roof because that's how Lionel Barrymore as Grandpa Vanderhof likes it. He's got a daughter who writes unpublished plays a soninlaw who likes to experiment with fireworks a granddaughter who aspires to be a ballerina her husband who is a xylophone virtuoso and an iceman who was so taken with the house he just quit his job and stayed there. I can't really blame Halliwell Hobbes the iceman. If I was being supported by Jean Arthur's salary as a secretary and Lionel Barrymore's investments I'd quit working myself.In fact I can understand Barrymore's sentiments. I had an opportunity to retire early myself and took it and don't regret it. Of course I'm not supporting a whole extended family either. Let Sanuel S. Hinds Spring Byington Ann Miller and Dub Taylor go out and earn a little and then become bohemians.Both Arnold and Barrymore are extreme in their philosophy and the play and film are weighed heavily in Barrymore's balance. But looking at it objectively Barrymore has a more realistic outlook for most people. There are a couple of dinner scenes at the Vanderhof house and it looks like quite a feed. Who's paying for it?This was James Stewart's first and Jean Arthur's second film with Frank Capra. Next year they would do their second and last in the much acclaimed Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. In doing the screen adaptation Capra and screenwriter Robert Riskin created a whole new character in Mr. Poppins played by Donald Meek. Poppins is an inoffensive little bureaucrat who would rather make little toys than add columns of figures all day. One meeting with Lionel Barrymore persuades Donald Meek to follow his dream. He blended so well into the Vanderhof household that Kaufman and Hart praised his creation.Though You Can't Take It With You is dated it is still funny as all get out. And you haven't lived until you've heard Brahm's Hungarian Dance Number 5 done as a xylophone solo.".

	schema:reviewBody "One message. Nothing is worth doing if you can't enjoy it and when it's over you can't take it with you!Do any of Capra's works actually speak 'that' one particular message? Perhaps the closest to the above is It Happened One Night. Lost Horizon is about rediscovery and peace of mind. Mr Smith is politically and small town oriented and Mr Deeds deals with the same except without some political yawn.  George Bailey should have had a better dosage of the You Can't Take it With You policy in It's a Wonderful Life.Here is a play that exercises Frank Capra's famous adage with all humour already built in. Why shouldn't it work? The stage version was a phenomenal success written superbly by George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart. If their story is slightly lacking look no further than the delightful cast of characters. Mr Poppins toy and mask maker. Alice's Father who meddles with fireworks. Essie the ballerina Penny the playwright and the wonderful Russian ballet teacher. The uptight Kirby banking corporation. Then there's the Mr Smith duo Tony Jimmy Stewart and Alice Jean Arthur. The stand out performer here is naturally the lovable Lionel Barrymore as Grandpa Vanderfhoff. Although the first film in which the damaging effects of his arthritis began to show Capra had his leg put in a cast and had him move around on crutches. He relishes his performance. I have heard of complaints which discuss the fact this film fails to address corruption and greed in a similar manner to Mr. Smith Goes to Washington which successfully played its part going against the American capital. Once again Capra emphasises his favourite theme of the little guy up against the world and succeeds but You Can't Take it With You basically does not even make a mild attempt to criticise the American system of government past or present even though I know very little about it. On different levels look at this film in the light of discussing heavier issues as the aforementioned greed and corruption. I just don't think Mr Capra would have liked it as much for one of his works to be remembered like that especially with the basic message staring at us right in the face. Nevertheless it is another of Capra's life saving feel good movies. All it is encouraging us to do is to have a little fun. Rating 810".

This is the first of three collaborations between Frank Capra and Jimmy Stewart. I doubt I have to tell anybody what the other two were since they're wellknown classics. Well this one deserves wider praise because it's simply magical. The four leads are all perfect. Stewart and Arthur have amazing chemistry that they would repeat the following year in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.

Two immensely talented actors that never gave a bad performance that I've seen. You always get your money and time's worth with these two. As with Stewart and Arthur both of these gentlemen would return for future Capra classics. Aside from the four stars we have great support from Donald Meek Spring Byington Samuel S. Hinds Mischa Auer a 15 yearold Ann Miller Halliwell Hobbes and Eddie 'Rochester' Anderson. Dub Taylor also makes his film debut here. What a cast! It's one of those films like Sullivan's Travels or Lady for a Day that just gets better and better each time I see it. The first time I saw it was probably close to twenty years ago. I liked it then but I love it now. This movie leaves a huge smile on my face and I think unless you're an extreme cynical type it will do the same for you. It's a warm uplifting comedy with romance drama and lots of little bits for people who like windows into the past. Just a real treat for anyone who loves getting lost in classic films.".

Hinds Mischa Auer a 15 yearold Ann Miller Halliwell Hobbes and Eddie 'Rochester' Anderson. Dub Taylor also makes his film debut here. What a cast! It's one of those films like Sullivan's Travels or Lady for a Day that just gets better and better each time I see it. The first time I saw it was probably close to twenty years ago. I liked it then but I love it now. This movie leaves a huge smile on my face and I think unless you're an extreme cynical type it will do the same for you. It's a warm uplifting comedy with romance drama and lots of little bits for people who like windows into the past. Just a real treat for anyone who loves getting lost in classic films.";

	schema:reviewBody "Unjustly forgotten screwball comedy about class differences marred only by a sappy antiquated message that money won't buy happiness. Having no money and playing the harmonica apparently will. But then again this was made for Depressionera audiences so the notion of money as the root of all evil and being happy derived without benefit of money must have been a sure crowd pleaser in its time. Very populist right down to repeated crowd shots of everyday folks in a courtroom scene. Jean Arthur lives with an eccentric extended family that does not worry about money although its is made plain early on that family patriarch Lionel Barrymore earned quite a bit of moolah in his time so no one in this crazy family need worry about where their next meal is coming from or whether they will have a roof over their heads. Heck they even have a pair of black servants! Arthur falls in love with her boss at the bank played by rising start Jimmy Stewart. Stewart's stuffy old dad bank president Edward Arnold is all about money and status nothing else. A plot element has Arnold trying to buy Barrymore's house for some nefarious project. Arthur insists on Stewart's family meeting her family before they tie the knot. You can imagine what transpires when they finally gather collide might be a better word for dinner at the Barrymore household. We get a little bit of A Christmas Carol thrown in when an old tycoon and crony of Arnold's now destitute confronts Arnold about his greedy and sinful ways. For this scene the camera is stationed behind and to the left of the old tycoon with Arnold standing several feet away intently and silently listening to him. We never get thee expected reverse shot as the tycoon delivers his sermon. Only after he finishes his speech and turns to leave do we see him plainly. In this way the fellow seem almost spectral and unreal like Marley's ghost and this makes his speech all the more powerful. Or maybe it's just me. A stellar supporting cast includes Donald Meek Spring Byington Mischa Auer Eddie Anderson Harry Davenport and several others. By today's standards the film is much too preachy and dated. But it is still lots of fun. Wait until you see the wildly improbable jail sequence about halfway through.".

They're humorless driven and arid. All except Jimmy who falls in love with his peppy blond secretary Jean Arthur.She's normal but her family and their friends are outlandish.

	schema:reviewBody "In a time where It's a Wonderful Life is known now as one of the greatest films of all time I think a lot of people forget about the greatness that is You Can't Take it With You. Capra's films often deal a lot with the essence of community and family that trumps all. This film does just that and does it to perfection.It stars James Stewart but the entire cast is incredible. Stewart is very young and in the early stages of his career so the rest of the actors really nail each and every scene they are in. In particular Lionel Barrymore has about as good as of a performance you can have and the entire Vanderhof family gets their time to shine. Much like It's a Wonderful Life this film is not only very enjoyable but it's highly rewatchable. Capra does a great job of directing his actors to some of their best performances of their career along with creating a unique household full of what is probably one of my favorite families in film history. Everyone loves the Vanderhof's and so do I.The film is very light hearted and I can understand if people think it could be corny much like It's a Wonderful Life but I don't think there's anything wrong with having a story that everyone can enjoy. It's the classic tale of Romeo and JulietCinderella but it's told and structured in a unique way that really hits home. It's a predictable but really sweet script that plays out just that way on screen. I love everything about You Can't Take it With You.Sweet storyEveryone in the family is interestingTwist on the RJ storyBarrymore carries the film1010".

	onyx:emotionText "In a time where It's a Wonderful Life is known now as one of the greatest films of all time I think a lot of people forget about the greatness that is You Can't Take it With You. Capra's films often deal a lot with the essence of community and family that trumps all. This film does just that and does it to perfection.It stars James Stewart but the entire cast is incredible. Stewart is very young and in the early stages of his career so the rest of the actors really nail each and every scene they are in. In particular Lionel Barrymore has about as good as of a performance you can have and the entire Vanderhof family gets their time to shine. Much like It's a Wonderful Life this film is not only very enjoyable but it's highly rewatchable. Capra does a great job of directing his actors to some of their best performances of their career along with creating a unique household full of what is probably one of my favorite families in film history. Everyone loves the Vanderhof's and so do I.The film is very light hearted and I can understand if people think it could be corny much like It's a Wonderful Life but I don't think there's anything wrong with having a story that everyone can enjoy. It's the classic tale of Romeo and JulietCinderella but it's told and structured in a unique way that really hits home. It's a predictable but really sweet script that plays out just that way on screen. I love everything about You Can't Take it With You.Sweet storyEveryone in the family is interestingTwist on the RJ storyBarrymore carries the film1010";

And he does a better job mingling comedy with his pathos for in my opinion a better more human film.  And doing that with an ensemble cast is no mean feat.".

	schema:reviewBody "Directed by Frank Capra You Can't Take It with You won the Oscar for Best Picture of 1938. With a screenplay by Robert Riskin based on a stage play by George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart it involves two conflicting families the wealthy Kirbys the father of whom is a tough nononsense banker and munitions tycoon and the carefree VanderhofSycamore family a bunch of eccentrics who spend their days passionately imbibing on their own little childish whims. In his opening scene the kind lovable Grandpa Martin Vanderhof Lionel Barrymore rescues Mr. Poppins Donald Meek from his dull day job and brings him to his wacky home so that he may spend his time doing what he loves to do the most. This becomes one of the central attitudes of the picture.Frank Capra was a genius when it came to casting. Grandpa Vanderhof is my favorite character in You Can't Take It with You and who better to portray him than Lionel Barrymore? The sweetnatured Vanderhof is the most lovable and delightful character in the picture always encouraging his family and friends to do the things that they really want to do and believing that money should be spent on all things enjoyable since it cannot be taken with you when your time comes. This is entirely opposite of Barrymore's Scroogelike Mr. Potter character in Frank Capra's classic 1946 film It's a Wonderful Life. The heavyset Edward Arnold was perfect for the stern role of munitions industrialist Anthony P. Kirby. The superwealthy moneyconscious Kirby learns from Vanderhof that there is more in life than business deals and that if he is not careful he shall become a failure because of the eventual loss of all his friends. My favorite actor James Stewart even though his role is not nearly as flashy as Barrymore's or Arnold's seemed to be just right for the part of Mr. Kirby's son Tony. The shy warmhearted innocence and the light touch of humor that Stewart brings to his role indicates that he was maturing as a young actor with only a few years of experience in Hollywood. Not to mention Jean Arthur as the friendly Alice Sycamore Tony's secretary and perhaps the only sane member of Grandpa Vanderhof's clan Mischa Auer as the pompous Russian choreographer Mr. Kolenkhov Spring Byington as Grandpa's daughter Penny Sycamore who writes plays that are never produced Samuel S. Hinds as Penny's husband Paul who spends his time in the basement with his friend Mr. DePinna Halliwell Hobbes lighting firecrackers Ann Miller as ballerina Essie Sycamore daughter of Penny  Paul and sister to Alice Dub Taylor as Ed the vibraphonist husband to Essie Donald Meek as the eccentric toy maker Mr. Poppins and the two funloving AfricanAmerican servants of this wacky family named Rheba Lillian Yarbo and Donald Eddie Anderson.Here are my favorite highlights from You Can't Take It with You. During their first scene together in Tony's office Tony tells Alice that he could always get what he wanted if he yelled loudly enough and he gives her a sample. Vanderhof shares a quiet moment with granddaughter Alice before her date with Tony and later on Vanderhof has a little fun with an IRS agent Charles Lane who tries to confront him about owing the government years and years of back income taxes. While sitting on a park bench during a quiet evening Tony tells Alice of a solar energy experiment that he took on with a friend. At the posh restaurant Tony comically describes an impending scream rushing from his feet up to his head Alice is so frightened that it is she who does the screaming. An overwhelming mass of fireworks blows up prior to everyone getting arrested. At the jail Vanderhof tries to console Mr. Kirby but soon loses his temper and confronts him about his accumulated wealth and power later on in the courtroom Alice very loudly confronts both Tony and Mrs. Kirby Mary Forbes for similar reasons and chaos erupts as photographers invade the premises. Mr. Kirby's business competitor Mr. Ramsey H. B. Warner warns him that he will have a crackup if he's not careful and shortly after that Tony tells his dad that he wants no further part in his business ventures. And finally the song Polly Wolly Doodle accompanies the final merrymaking at the Vanderhof home celebrating Mr. Kirby's reformation.One particular author wrote that nothing could be more tiresome than having to sit through You Can't Take It with You in its entirety but I strongly disagree. As a screwball comedy it is wonderful and its message is quite clear enjoy your life to the fullest and as long as you have friends you will never be a failure. As if to prove the point Grandpa Vanderhof says one line in the play that regrettably never made it in the film Never take life seriously. No one's lived through it yet.".

The movie opens with music lifted straight from the game itself  in fact the entire movie contains original tracks from the game as well as some remixed score. Just as it was a fantastic and brooding background when playing the game it works very effectively on screen.As for the film itself the story is a composite of story elements from the first and second games but the final act is a monstrous and highly original thirty minutes that kept me guessing as well as being completely grossed out. Indeed the violence is pretty gruesome.. clever mixtures of CGI and fully madeup monsters which really add to the foreboding atmosphere.At first I felt nervous watching this.. not because of the visuals which are absolutely SPOT ON.. I've never seen ANY movie adaptation that is this close to the source material.. all the comic book movies from the past few years still stray furiously.. but because of the weak opening. After I'd resigned myself to the fact that the movie was going to be disappointing I was pleasantly surprised as soon as the main character Rose gets to Silent Hill itself. If you're a fan of the game you won't be disappointed. If you're a horror hound you'll love the creatures and the visuals. If you're expecting a deep movie about the relationship between estranged mother and daughter.. you're in the wrong theatre.Highly recommended. Best horror movie I've seen in a long time.".

If you're expecting a deep movie about the relationship between estranged mother and daughter.. you're in the wrong theatre.Highly recommended. Best horror movie I've seen in a long time.";

	schema:reviewBody "Horror? Try psychological triller and you might be closer to understanding why is it that I found Silent Hill such an amazing piece of work.With that in mind the reason why Silent Hill worked for me was because it had a story to tell. Granted some of us are already familiar with the storyline and are frustrated with the pace of the film. Others may gripe at how much of a disappointment the movie was because of the lack of certain monsters the lack of development in the characters they liked best the lack of answers to puzzling questions the fact that the storyline was too convoluted and confusing et cetera et cetera.Yet the heart of the film lies mainly on one simple idea  Silent Hill is first and foremost a physical manifestation of a child's mind that is shattered tainted and shackled by an abuse so terrible that one is unable to articulate it into words. Ever wondered why Silent Hill is called Silent Hill in the first place? If you think along the lines of language being an ineffective medium in the expression of truth chaching! You're right!In this light I cannot understand why so many people had a problem with the pacing of the movie because in the first place such apparent meandering is necessary to the entire film. And why not? The inability for any one character to get to the heart of the problem is prevalent during the entire narrative framework of the film No one character dared to talk about it and those who sought the truth are met with an air of secrecy. The truth therefore is oppressed by a complete breakdown of words and all that is left is to show and let the people experience what had happened themselves. Such is the path that Rose must take because she chose to seek out the truth surrounding her daughter's psychological problem and since language fails in Silent Hill can the truth cannot be communicated through words it must be shown.The same rule applies to Christopher. He tried to uncover the truth but was thwarted by people who are reluctant to talk about the town. Everyone who had prior knowledge of the town was unable or unwilling to describe what happened because they 1 are suppressing their guilt 2 are afraid of opening up a can of worms that is best left forgotten. Even Rose and Cybil are faced with a group of people who were so adamant into seeing things in their point of view that they have blinded themselves to the atrocity of what has taken place in Silent Hill. Notice how most of the monsters i.e. Nurses Pyramid Head Janitor are in a state of blindness? Coincidence? I think not.And still at the heart of all THAT a child's horrifying story is desperately waiting to be told. The meanderings are not meant to be a flaw in the plot in my opinion but an attempt to show how the outside world tried to suppress and confine the deepest desire of a little girl  the desire for truth to be known. Therefore the truth cannot be told because words will ultimately fail in Silent Hill. It must be shown. That was why Rose had to go through all the various stages of her journey to seek out the truth. That was why it was crucial the narrative had to be mapped out thus and it reached its summit in the dramatic finale where the fanatics were reluctant to accept the spoken truth but was forced to accept it nevertheless through a physical manifestation of truth  the manifestation of their past deeds.Hence in my opinion this film isn't about monsters busty characters bloodshed storyline or whatever it is that one normally looks out for in a film of this genre. This film is about a little girl's story that is struggling to surface in a world dominated by a viciousness she could not comprehend but fall victim to nevertheless. Think about it. To be thoroughly abused in a world that you never fit in and cannot comprehend. And later to want to seek vengeance for the wrongs that had been done to you but are unable to articulate it into words because there is no one out there who understands or listens to you. The intense hatred due to the complete lack of control that one is forced into the desire to achieve satisfaction at any cost and the obsession with vengence  now that's a scary thought for a little girl of 10 to have wouldn't you say?So was it good? Heck yeah. And I'm going for another round of this when my next paycheque comes in.".

The setpieces with the creatures are even more disturbing than their VG counterparts  I kid you not! The production design is truly superb and you get the feeling that Silent Hill really does exist. If I had to nitpick it would be that they didn't include any puzzle elements in the film as per the game it could have been cool to have Rose solving some mad brainteaser but you can fully understand that they didn't include this sort of thing well apart from her memorizing the hospital floorlayout otherwise it could have slowed down the whole pace of the film.I was so skeptical about this movie as traditionally GameToMovie adaptations are let's face it crap!

Please easily those are the worst movies that should NEVER have been made.However. this movie was excellent. I have a feeling the person who gave this movie one star was someone who did not play the video game maybe even did not realize it was based on a video game. I can see how this movie could present a problem to those who are nongamers. However Most of my friends never played the game either and they still enjoyed the movie very much.I wasn't as disturbed by the changing of the characters as I thought I'd be. Harry Mason to Rose for Example. I totally understand how Harry wouldn't cross over well. while he was a cool character From a girl perspective he was kind of a wuss. lol.the actors they picked to portray the characters were superb. they did a very good job portraying the intensity the scary and sometimes disturbing nature of the movie.I saw a sneak peek where most of the movie goers did a lot of gasping and clutching of their friends or dates covering of eyes... it was a pretty creepy film and the only horror movie that actually got my pulse to race. Normally I hate horror movies because they're more ridiculous than scary.but this movie was scary well acting well written and I loved the monsters. It was much more realistic to use people rather than complete CGI characters. it made it more creepy. I liked that touch. Definitely proves that old school can be more scary than technology. Although they don't completely ignore the modern day novelties. Its a perfect combination of both.Pretty much I miss Harry I can understand why they did away with him I'm glad it wasn't for a stupid reason like them wanting a tough cigar smoking buff man chick thinking that's P.C. but the character changes work the actors in their parts work the script works its creepy its scary its a great movie. Some who have not played or haven't heard of the Silent hill games may not get it... but for the most part I think most should enjoy this movie gamers and nongamers alike.

	schema:headline " Great ideas creepy atmosphere and eerie mood  but the rest is badly executed";
	schema:reviewBody "I remember I sat down to play Silent Hill a couple of years ago because the mystery genre intrigued me and the game had an interesting look to it so I started running through the abandoned town of 'Silent Hill' as the main player. I stopped playing very soon because in truth not a whole lot was happening. It was mostly an uncomfortable experience eerily lit and hauntingly scored. I could feel an intense buildup in that foggy place but I never reached the culmination so I gave up. OK fine  I was scared.Years later this film adaptation is bravely made by Christophe Gans and even though I'd played less than ten minutes of the game I immediately recognised the haunting visuals of the abandoned city. So 'well done' here is an understatement. It is superbly breathed new life into.The plot has been glossed over slightly in a Hollywood fashion but captures the essence of its characters and storyline  which is as a last resort a mother takes her ill daughter to a place she often mentions in her sleep  a place near where she was adopted from. But the hope the mother has for her daughter's recovery quickly shatters and turns into despair when the little girl vanishes in the misty mysterious old town.I truly cannot credit the atmosphere of this film enough. Christophe Gans has successfully captured the eerie mood of Silent Hill and it is a nightmarish place  a fogenshrouded hell that shifts between two modes barren ashen daylight and a gruesome decaying state with fiery ember demons and enhanced by chilling and very sudden sound effects. It's strangely fascinating surreal and above all frightening.The problems of Silent Hill 2006 are that there are not nearly enough buildups. They should have been used not only to stay faithful to the video game upon which it was based but to wield tension in the right way and shock us when the buildup finally culminates. But here we are introduced to horrid creatures early on and often without much foreshadowing devices. Because they are presented to us so generously and clearviewed they are not that scary. At all. Some even manage a raised eyebrow like the crawly CGI cripples.In the end I think this is quality horror entertainment and probably one of the better gametofilm adaptations abut it is much too chaotic  too many monsters and too often and too clearly to be frightening. The mood and atmosphere are what is frightening and so it should have been used even more in Silent Hill but instead the director feels pressured to introduce creatures to satisfy mainstream audiences' need for bloody gorefest and kinetic action.7 out of 10".

I stopped playing very soon because in truth not a whole lot was happening. It was mostly an uncomfortable experience eerily lit and hauntingly scored. I could feel an intense buildup in that foggy place but I never reached the culmination so I gave up.

	schema:reviewBody "OK I have just returned from seeing silent hill. Did I like it? Yes! Did I love it? HELL YES! The movie pretty much has a solid pace. The cinematography is beautiful and the special effects are great. So what about the story? It does get a bit convoluted especially when we have scenes solely there to explain WTF is going on.....Sean Bean is a terrible actor he was bad in LOTR he was bad in that crappy ITV show he was on and he is pretty crappy in this.....I wish they had cut him from the film entirely..his scenes added nothing except some explanation on silent hill and to remind us that Rose is in another reality to them...also I was a bit annoyed that PH was really only in two scenes...HOPEFULLY he will get used more in later instalments. The ending was a bit upsetting I get why it happened...I just got a little chocked up yes I am a wimp so sue me. The score is wonderful I really could listen to it all day....I don't know the names of the songs but I would definitely buy the soundtrack. Rhada is a amazing actress she has a face which can tell a billion tales with just a slight twitch and she is very believable as a mother looking for her child. Cybil actually was my favourite character in the beginning she is pretty much a tough ass bitch but she does become more human towards the end.....what happens to her is pretty graphicwhich leads me to another point.....this movie actually is pretty gruesome in parts a little to gruesome for a silent hill movie. The tension in the film is nail bite ting the nurse scene actually made most of the audience jump and someone screamed LOL! Thats what is so amazing about this film you get the same feeling you got when you were playing the game by yourself complete stillness and fear. Overall this was a great movie the visual and grand scale of the movie is so astonishing to watch. It really has some striking visuals...i.e grey children first attack the first change to alternate silent hill and the final battle which holds much of the gore. A almost perfect horror movie.".

I've eagerly awaited it's release ever since it was first announced.The Silent Hill fan in me wanted me to love this movie and the cinema fan in me told me otherwise so I was quite torn while viewing the film.Cinematically it was a beautiful film. The sets were astonishing the creatures were horrifically gorgeous and the music was haunting however misused in some places more on that later.The films main problem is the script.Oh Avary. What happened? How the mighty have fallen.The dialogue was horrendous. There were only a few lines that I really liked and most of them were spoken by Dahlia. There were a few other lines scattered here and there that I liked 'mother is god in the eyes of a child' was one I really liked. The acting was also quite stiff and over the top but that's mostly due to the poor dialogue that the actresses and actors were given. However I was quite impressed with Jodelle Ferland's work. Quite impressed indeed.Now from the perspective of a Silent Hill fan this film was lacking. The story only took some ideas from the games and then seemed to bastardize them. The whole cult thing didn't work well in the movie and whenever they chanted BURN THE WITCH I could only think of a certain Crusades movie.The film wasn't really boring though. The moment we first see the Grey Children my heart sank. I never feel anything physical during movies but here I did. The Patient Demon was also quite neat as were the nurses.But the best things about the film were the Janitor and Pyramid Head. Wow. That's all I have to say about them.Now let's discuss the music. While I LOVE Akira Yamaoka's works listening to them right now I felt some of it was misplaced during the film. They used the Silent Hill 2 soundtrack way too much especially Promise and True. Music was just weird in certain parts but in others it was completely fitting like Prayer as Pyramid Head approaches the church.Well in a nutshell this film was somewhat of a disappointment. It may have looked great but the plot was jumbled and the dialogue was weak.Overall rating 610".

	schema:headline " Thank god for the return of Rrated horror";
	schema:reviewBody "Wow. Silent Hill marks the return of wellwritten wellacted Rrated ballsout minimal use of CG horror. Did I mention it's Rrated? After months of PG13 crap like Stay Alive we finally got a movie that actually seems to stretch the limits of the R rating when it comes to gore. This movie drips and splatters blood. The use of CG is surprisingly low. Most creatures are really people in costumes but it's so realistic yet strange that you almost think its CG. The movie is wellcasted. Instead of say Sarah Michelle Gellar they went on a limb and casted Radha Mitchell who's biggest role so far has been in a minor Woody Allen movie. She carries the movie and does a fantastic job. They casted someone named Laurie Holden for the role of Cybil the cop and she impressed me. Sean Bean as the husband is pretty much the only wellknown actor in the movie and he's basically a secondary character though he does fine for his role.Did I mention this movie has gore? In one lovely scene Pyramid Head first rips off the clothes of a woman then rips off her entire skin in one piece and hurls it at a closing door which is just open enough that a spray of blood splatter the main characters. Oh yeah...Pyramid Head is awesome. When he first goes after Rose and Cybil shoving that 10foot sword of his through the door I pretty much crapped myself. He really only has those two scenes and they never do explain just what the heck he is but as the movie already breaks 2 hours they probably didn't have the time.The whole movie is kind of like that. Most of the monsters you see just show up for no reason without explanation. And the story does get a little confusing near the end but not too much.The changing of Silent Hill between fogtime and Helltime is really welldone and never fails to amaze and frighten especially when it's preceded by that siren.The movie ends with a bloodbath in a church that will shock all but the Japanese. The amount of blood and the way in which it is sprayed around is really quite nasty.".

I don't think I've ever had as spinechillingly memorable a time doing anything related to the horror genre as I've had playing those games. After the crushing disappointment of the Resident Evil movies I had cautious optimism about Silent Hill. Early interviews with director Christophe Gans seemed to point to a guy passionate about the material and determined to do right by it.Sadly this movie goes down as Just Another Failed Game Adaptation. If the best video game franchise can't even get a good movie made from it I think Hollywood and video games should be kept away from each other for good preferably by restraining order.Gans may be passionate but here he's done the impossible. He's taken Silent Hill  which is not only the most frightening horror video game ever made but quite possibly one of the most frightening horror entertainment experiences in any medium games books or movies included  and made it BORING. The video game is scary as hell. The movie has  I cannot stress this enough  not ONE single solitary scare and indeed a few of the intended scares come off as silly. The movie has the look of the game down just fine. The production designers have replicated the game's foggy deserted streets and dingy derelict buildings perfectly. But Roger Avery's script and here was a guy who took great pains to warn fans he was NOT a huge devotee of the games suddenly feels the urge to EXPLAIN everything in exhaustive detail. So instead of piling on suspense and scares it piles on exposition. And I mean PILES it on. We get endless talky scenes of backstory and history and yet the more the movie attempts to clarify the whole backstory of Alessa and the cult that victimized her and turned her into an evil malevolent force the less coherent it all seems. Gans's devotion to reproducing the game's visuals makes him forget that there will be a sizable audience who see this without ever having played the game. And to them no concessions are made. Nonfans of the Silent Hill games are given no clue as to why the town changes appearance or why it's inhabited by poisonspitting faceless monsters and other weird beasties. To nongamers this will be the most nonsensical movie ever despite Avery's endless infodumping dialogue.But worse than infodumping dialogue is Obvious Dialogue where the writer assumes his audience is suffering from Downs Syndrome and must have everything spelled out no matter how obvious it is. In one scene Cybill the cop from game one who has a much different fate here has just found a drawing by Rose's missing daughter in a slot at the hotel desk.Rose Where did you find this? Cybill Room 111. Rose We have to go to Room 111!Well duh. All of the exposition simply stretches the running time out to over two hours while spending as little time as possible in the Otherworld for which the games are famous. Here's another failing I cannot stress enough where the hell WAS Silent Hill in Silent Hill? Why are we listening to Alice Krige doing her endless Cruella DeVille routine when we should be trapped in terrifying dark corridors or fleeing monsters down misty back alleys? This stuff gets started just fine in act one then stops when the script settles into a talkfest. So much from the video games appears in the movie to please fans but only at the most superficial level. It's as if Gans pored over each game saying Okay we'll use that gotta have that creature okay and how about a Lisa Garland cameo! But that's where the homage stops. The school? The hospital? Yeah they're there but wasted. Radha Mitchell literally RUNS through the hospital which for some reason is about 200 stories underground in the third act until she encounters the nurses...who look great in their prosthetic makeup but move in such an absurd way I kept expecting them to break into a dance routine like some Janet Jackson video. And Pyramid Head? Cripes how do you waste Pyramid Head!?! He has two scenes does one cool thing where he grabs a woman and tears her skin off like a candy wrapper then it's bye bye. He's gone from the movie after that!By the time we're well into the protracted act three in which a mob of mad cultists is threatening to burn Rose's daughter alive any resemblance between the game Silent Hill and this movie is purely coincidental. I saw a post from one guy on Rotten Tomatoes suggesting the filmmakers must have come down with ADHD and thought they were making a Hellraiser movie instead. Couldn't have put it better myself. The movie is just one cheesy line of bad dialogue after another at this point. I just cannot listen to a mob of people and where did this mob come from anyway? shouting Burn the witch! Burn the witch! without thinking of Monty Python and the Holy Grail!I'm hurting. I'm angry. I'm bitter. The video game movie that should have been a masterpiece is just another disasterpiece. I don't know how everything that was so awesome in the game got so badly lost in translation. Is it too much to hope someone someday will do another Silent Hill movie that will nail the whole thing not just the perfect set design? Maybe. I'm going to play the game again to remind myself why I love Silent Hill in the first place.".

	schema:headline " Excellent film meets and surpasses standards in every way.";
	schema:reviewBody "Silent Hill came in with big expectations from video game fans and horror fans alike. Knowing what I do about game based films usually tending to be subpar I was very impressed when Silent Hill not only met my standards for a great horror film but also surpassed them.Ignoring the typical teen horror movie boo factor Silent Hill scares by the creepiness of the backdrops creating hellish environments out of otherwise peaceful but slightly haunting areas. The plot describes the town of Silent Hill that Rose finds herself trapped in as a nightmare world and that is exactly what Christophe Gans does with the film. Buildings actually transform into a caged inferno when the darkness comes. The creatures that come with this darkness the pyramid head the patient demons and the nurse demons all instill a sense of innate fear. But perhaps the best part was the fact that none of the evils of the world are overused. That is what truly separates this film from a zombie movie. The demons with the exception of the pyramid head aren't the true evil of the film but rather work to install a profound sense of fear while they are on screen. Gans was not afraid to get gory in the film either having several scenes with deformed and tortured bodies as well as one where the pyramid head flays a human being with his bare hands. These scenes are also used extremely effectively and nearly always add to the intensity of the movie. The music and sound much like in the game is nearly perfect avoiding the overused and ineffective heavy metal horror approach. The acting was the only part I could find some fault in. Radha Mitchell does a very good job with her part in most scenes but there's a few where she is just way too cool under fire to be realistic. Sean Bean is not very emotional when he is emotional either. Other characters such as Laurie Holden playing Officer Bennett do an amazing job and truly pull you into the plot though so I can't discredit the casting too much.In the end I truly believe this film is the best video game movie I have ever seen. It sticks true to the tales of silent hill and leaves many allusions to the games while not watering down the sheer sense of both mystery and fear that the games instill in its fans. As a horror movie this one also stands out above the rest keeping the audience entertained scared and guessing throughout much of the film. I give it a 10 out of 10 and I look forward to a sequel. I also recommend that any of you who liked the movie try the game they compliment each other perfectly.".

	onyx:emotionText "Silent Hill came in with big expectations from video game fans and horror fans alike. Knowing what I do about game based films usually tending to be subpar I was very impressed when Silent Hill not only met my standards for a great horror film but also surpassed them.Ignoring the typical teen horror movie boo factor Silent Hill scares by the creepiness of the backdrops creating hellish environments out of otherwise peaceful but slightly haunting areas. The plot describes the town of Silent Hill that Rose finds herself trapped in as a nightmare world and that is exactly what Christophe Gans does with the film. Buildings actually transform into a caged inferno when the darkness comes. The creatures that come with this darkness the pyramid head the patient demons and the nurse demons all instill a sense of innate fear. But perhaps the best part was the fact that none of the evils of the world are overused. That is what truly separates this film from a zombie movie. The demons with the exception of the pyramid head aren't the true evil of the film but rather work to install a profound sense of fear while they are on screen.

	schema:reviewBody "Silent Hill is far from a perfect movie. But Silent Hill is also one of the best video game to movie adaptations out there. That's really not saying much. If you were to watch this movie without playing the games you might as well bring your pillow. Fortunately for me I've played all 4 games in the series multiple times and it was for people like me that the movie was made in the first place. The plot of the movie steals familiar elements from the games. But it doesn't tie into the games. They combined the plots of the first two games changed the focus around and ultimately steered away from the MUCH darker and much more confusing plot of the games. The fans will either be smiling with glee or reliving their darkest nightmares as the movie tosses fans a lot of bones. There are EXACT shots recreated on the silver screen that were used in the games. Multiple times I THOUGHT I knew the direction in which the movie was going because it was so familiar and then they'd go in a completely different direction. It was actually irritating at first but once I got over that I just enjoyed it for what it was. Do NOT expect to watch Resident Evil with this movie. While they may share similar genres that's where the comparisons end. MUCH like the game the movie is slow and it's scares rely on a creepy skincrawling feeling rather than jump scares. But the acting is actually what impressed me. Some may see it as annoying but those that played the game will actually feel like they pulled dialogue directly out of it. And Radha Mitchell does a good job acting like a frantic mother searching for her child. I will admit though at times I wanted to pull my hair out in frustration because her character actually hardly does anything. She just runs around chasing after a little girl that she thinks is her daughter. Did no one learn anything from Event Horizon? If they run AWAY from you they are playing a game with you. Apart from minor annoyances with her character the other characters were bland and flat but hey you can't have an R rated horror movie without a high corpse count. Although they did take the survival horror to the extreme with the survival part. It would've been nice to see some of the violence directed at the creatures. C'mon you beat them senseless with lead pipes in the game but that was lacking. Sean Bean could've helped make the movie all that more stellar but he's kind of a sideplot. Without giving too much away there's some closure to the movie but it would be naive to say they wouldn't make a sequel starring Sean Bean unless of course he was only a draw to bring more to the movie. The cinematography and camera angles steal from the game but they are effective and well done. The sound was superb with many sound bytes from the games and a lot of eerie effects for the creatures. The gore was a little over the top and like mentioned earlier needed to be directed more at the creatures. All in all the movie felt like a throwback to the games putting in as many elements that made sense with the movies plot to make the fans happy. Those unfamiliar with the series MAY appreciate it for what it is. Basically this it's a creepy and gory distraction that's pretty boring as is but given that it's based off of a video game that's just a creepy and gory distraction that's pretty boring as well they're a perfect match. Just remember that it's probably the best video gametomovie adaptation out there need I bring up Uwe Boll? but leaves it's fans wanting more. Thankfully the movie industry milks licenses for all they're worth and we'll probably see a sequel sometime in the future.".

Instead I got an atmospheric haunting thriller that slowly creeps into you and doesn't let go.True the game was scarier. Way scarier. And there was something appealing about the vagueness of the story  the fact that it was never fully explained. And some parts especially in the third act could have been edited down and made more intense. And I wasn't fully convinced by Radha Mitchell's acting. But seriously folks this goes above and beyond your standard fare horror flick.Speaking visually the film is breathtaking. Some of the best conceptual designs I've ever seen. The creature's design and effects are top notch. Pay attention to one very creepy scene that revolves around a flashlight. It is brilliant.The score is perfect. Disturbing and melancholy at the same time just like the themes the movie explores. It has depth and its meanings are relevant to our current existence.One thing I wanted to see used more was the radio static that signifies when a monster is approaching. That was to me one of the scariest elements of the game since you knew the monster is close and yet you couldn't see it. Also with such a tightly woven dense atmosphere some boo moments could have been super scary although the movie doesn't use them. That is a plus and a minus. The result is more sophisticated refined working more on psychological horror rather than shock value. On the other hand on a superficial level the film is not as scary as it could have been.To conclude a very pleasant surprise. Hopefully this is not the last we've seen of Silent Hill.".

	schema:reviewBody "I don't play video games so I went into this film with no preconceived notions or expectations. I came away pretty impressed and a little disturbed.Rose and Chris Da Silva are worried about their adopted daughter Sharon. Little Sharon has been sleepwalking and speaking while still asleep of a place called Silent Hill. When Sharon nearly falls to her death during her latest sleepwalk Rose decides to confront the issue headon. She packs Sharon into the SUV and heads for Silent Hill West Virginia. But Silent Hill is a ghost town that the locals don't like to speak of and which is contaminated by an ever burning coal fire deep in the bowels of the earth. After a freak car accident knocks Rose out she awakens to find Sharon gone and a rain of ash falling from the sky. Silent Hill is indeed a ghost town populated by demonic mutants and the ghosts of the damned. Rose is led by grisly clues deeper into the tragic history of the town and a terrible secret which involves her adopted daughter. Aided by police officer Cybil Bennet Rose must face the dark demons of Hell and prevent history from repeating itself if she is to save Sharon.This is quite a freaky film though surprisingly not as gory as I had thought it would be. After a somewhat slow first 20 minutes or so the film descends into rotting horror as air raid sirens warn of The Darkness deformed creatures lurch out of the shadows and the patina of normalcy literally melts away with the approach of evil. Standout characters include the sorrowful Dahlia played by Deborah Kara Unger who looks like the worlds oldest and saddest Goth woman and the hideous creature known only as Pyramid Head who stomps into view with a horde of cockroaches at his command. Radha Mitchell does a great job as Rose playing her as a realistically frightened woman but also as a determined mother who will stop at nothing to save her daughter. Jodelle Ferland is great in her double role of Sharon Alessa a sweet haunted little girl one moment a creepy frightening little monster the next. Sean Bean as the hopelessly lost Chris Da Silva is perfect you can feel his frustration and panic. Alice Krige too is unnervingly chilling as Christabella.The atmosphere of this movie is great  ash covered cemeteries drippy basements abandoned schoolrooms  all very creepy and menacing in their utter stillness. The violence when it comes is quite brutal. Skin is ripped off bodies are roasted limbs ripped away by barbed wire. Pretty gruesome but not overly so. The demons are the real attraction here besides Pyramid Head there are also twisted torsos spewing black acid deformed beings in nurse uniforms wielding scalpels and in the scene which freaked me out the most a man with his body bent double and his feet over his head crawling across a bathroom floor. I've never played the video game so I really can't tell you if this was a faithful adaptation or not. But I can say that it is very original quite spooky satisfyingly bloody and even rather disturbing in several parts...and I don't scare easily. All in all a very good horror movie.".

All the lurid horror clichs are on offer ravens flying round the church witch burning. I don't even know what I just saw. There's no story just one mindless action sequence after another. Sure the beginning is promising and the first half hour it still got my attention but soon it becomes clear that no effort was made to draw characters who have any resemblance to human beings and pretty soon it all becomes an alarmingly senseless excuse for and endless string of computer generated gory effects. This is also a film that takes itself way too seriously some injoke reference could have made this slightly more bearable. We have undefinable creatures that are lurking in some underground tunnel complex where for the last thirty years a coal fire is raging under the ground. At first I was intrigued  a little  but since it is absolutely impossible to grasp what these things are and no explanation is given it becomes nothing more than a videogame sideshow. The final scene in the church where the whole cast suffers from some incredible overacting has some spectacular effects I'll admit that but eventually goes WAY over the top and takes so long it soon becomes downright ridiculous. Going over the top can be fun but not without humor. Former Tarantino video clerkbuddy Roger Avary penned this thing down and assembled some bad Canadian actors. He should be so lucky he got costory credit for RESERVOIR DOGS and PULP FICTION since he clears things for us here. He can't write he's got no idea whatsoever that a motion picture has very little in common with a video game. You need to have actual human beings in a motion picture or present some interesting visual ideas. We get neither.And the dialog...? I can't remember all the mumbo jumbo I've heard. The second half of the film is full of hysterical lines likeThe Truth is clear for those who see. We drew a line in the sand and said Demon do not cross! And I thought THE VILLAGE was a new low in pseudo satanic relicrab.Sean Bean was topbilled but he only has five minutes screen time with  again  mindbogglingly awful dialog.

	schema:reviewBody "You might learn that this supernatural thriller comes from a video game but don't let it stop you from watching it. It's an adaptation that's actually decent and that works very well as a serious horror film. How did they manage that rare feat? It might be because they hired a talented french director he did Brotherhood of the Wolf which you should see who loved the original material and actually found it frightening which it is. He even had to woo the notoriously protective Japanese producers Konami for years to be accepted. The guy was dedicated and he shoots some hellishly beautiful scenes. It might be because the story is engrossing and mysterious. It might be because the mostly unknown actresses mostly a female cast in the major roles play it very well and seriously.It might be because the creatures are genuinely creepy and disturbing. I would say they're original and never seen before but actually most of them are concepts from the games brought to life. They were so good I thought they were computermade but actually it's mostly actors actually professional dancers in suits and makeup. And let me tell you having dancers makes a huge difference in terms of having great creature movements that push them a notch above. It might be because it relies more on unnerving atmosphere nightmarish visuals dreamlike quality than jump surprises and gore for its scares. Mostly it might be so good because Silent Hill changed stuff but kept the spirit of the games yes that's a good thing. Silent Hill is no Resident Evil for those unfamiliar so don't expect zombies or something similar. Some might have issues with the actions of the main character at the start before going into the town. I did too but then I thought about it the day after and realized she was doing this against her husband's will as a last ditch attempt to help her daughter. Still... it's a bit reckless and irrational. The other thing that might bug and confuse viewers is that Silent Hill leaves you with questions unanswered. Personally I like that type of story where they do explain a lot but don't neatly tie up everything. The ending will certainly make you think and second guess. The film itself might even warrant a second viewing for better understanding. Overall I was very pleasantly surprised at the quality of everything here. It should please horror fans whether or not they're fans of the games provided they watch it with an open mind not expecting their standard American slasher fest.Rating 8 out of 10".

Personally I like that type of story where they do explain a lot but don't neatly tie up everything. The ending will certainly make you think and second guess. The film itself might even warrant a second viewing for better understanding. Overall I was very pleasantly surprised at the quality of everything here. It should please horror fans whether or not they're fans of the games provided they watch it with an open mind not expecting their standard American slasher fest.Rating 8 out of 10";

Rose is the main character and she is always looking for her missing adopted daughter in a mysterious city called Silent Hill where a lot of creepy facts had happened in the past. In the night when the alarm rings you should be prepared the dead come to life and there are always some strange creatures really close. You might find it a bit confusing when you realize there are two realities in the movie like a parallel universe where you can see different people in the same place but they don't see each other.

Anyway this really is one of the better video game movies because it honestly does have really good atmosphere. I am at least familiar with some of the characters from the Silent Hill games especially Pyramid Head. Oh come on everyone's heard of Pyramid Head! So this happens to be the longest movie ever made based on a video game...until Ace Attorney came along. This film really was genuinely creepy at many times. Now I think you did have to be a fan of the games to really enjoy it.I would recommend it to people who are. For people who aren't it's just alright. I admit that the CGI is actually pretty bad at many times in this movie. Well there are other shots that are just fine. I do kind of like the characters in this movie even if they're not that great. It actually gets confusing in the middle of the film. It's when all of these other people show up and the tone of the movie starts to change. Again probably something from the games. It's hard to find a video game movie that would appear to fans outside the series. Still a very nice try. 12".

I don't remember the name of Sean Bean's character because it isn't yelled once every thirty seconds. He shouts ROSE's name repeatedly. This is pretty much the extent of Sean Bean's purpose in this film.Whilst Sean Bean is hoping his agent finds him a better role next time ROSE continues to call SHARON'S name. She is interrupted by Miss Havisham who mumbles incoherently. Presumably Pip's benefactor was out of town because he never makes an appearance.At this point in the review I must confess I stopped watching Silent Hill after about an hour. I have better things to do like suicide or making a voluntary tax contribution.Note This film has the Borg Queen from 'Star Trek First Contact' in it although I didn't see up to that point. 'Star Trek First Contact' contains action humour story real characters conflict etc. Go watch that instead or 'Great Expectations'. Just don't have any great expectations if you intend to watch this drivel.110".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie opens on a most impressive intro. Flames and smoke come up from a furnace and as the titles jump on and off the screen we hear a harrowing music theme by Maurice Jarre the melody is close to Dr Zhivago's but played with a frantic rhythm. The EnglishFrench title The Damned  is far more appropriate than the ItalianGerman one which is The Fall of the Gods. As the intro suggests we are entering an inferno and the characters we are going to see are the sort who will not hesitate sell out their soul to the devil in exchange of power and glory. The Damned is certainly a horrific movie but as artfully made as can be.Action takes place in the Ruhr industrial region of Germany just after Hitler's rise to power. The aristocratic family von Essenbeck is the country's leading steelwork owner a fictional equivalent of Krupps or Thyssens. Now this movie is not trying to denounce the fact that big German industrials financed Hitler but instead it focuses on the internal struggle for power inside the family. ThereforeThe Damned is not really a movie about nazism even if it is often regarded as such. It a movie about power. Nazism is only used as an extreme context where the mechanisms of power are made more evident than anywhere else because it is a system that openly legitimates the absolute domination of the strongest. Baroness Sophie Ingrid Thulin is the daughter in law of an aging steel baron. Her husband is apparently dead during WW1 but he left her with a son Martin Helmut Berger who is immediately presented as immature and perverse. Baroness Sophie has an official lover Friedrich Bruckmann Dirk Bogarde and both are acquainted with an influent member of the nazi party called Aschenbach Helmut Griem. Sophie is a modern incarnation of Lady Macbeth. Her schemes are to take control of the Essenbeck steelworks by any means determined to crush anyone who might stand in her way.Sophie doesn't care for anybody. Her lover Friedrich is anything but an angel but he appears as a weaker character whom she adroitly manipulates. She has an obvious contempt for her son Martin which gets obvious right away as she is seen laughing behind a curtain while he is performing a transvestite number at his grandfather's birthday party...The only one who seems to have her esteem is Aschenbach the nazi who is just as devoid of scruples as she is. The steel lady gets both her fatherinlaw and one of her brothersinlaw murdered while her other brotherinlaw is forced to exile and her timid nephew to silence. Her son Martin becomes therefore the legitimate heir of the steelworks but she only intends to use him as a puppet as she plans an official marriage with her lover Friedrich through which she hopes to take control of the family's fortune. The wedding will take place but not the way she expected...The only enemy she did't think about and does she think about enemies! is her own son whom everybody regards as incapable and degenerate. Indeed Martin by the way a pedophile is not interested in power or money. But the blemished love of the boy for his mother has reverted into an infernal hate. Hate is going to be Martin's driving force to become the much unexpected winner of the game as he is really capable of ANYTHING even beyond what his merciless mother ever would have imagined. Ingrid Thulin's performance is stunning probably her best one ever and though Helmut Berger tends to overact you couldn't find a better choice for the satanic role of Martin. The evil figures appear much more intense than the few innocent ones among them a barely recognizable Charlotte Rampling in one of her early appearances. The baroque lavishness of the scenery makes a striking contrast with the ghastly minds of the characters hard to speak of heroes and their equally ghastly deeds. The film makes you wonder if the the already renowned Luchino Visconti deliberately intended to shock by all means since all his other movies before and after this one were by far tamer.But indeed in 1969 all ingredients were there to make it a perfect bomb. Two episodes of nazism are spectacularly rendered  first the public burning of books on the streets then the Night of the Long Knives which is depicted in a very long and shocking scene. A beer drinking party turns into a homosexual orgy and eventually ends in a bloodbath. But even worse is still to come...It can be established that the Damned was the first screenwork to deal with nazism so openly and as such it abruptly broke a longlasting taboo. This film has been a trendsetter in many ways and opened the path to a series of others that hinted to nazism as darkly erotic and fascinating a trend that some called nazi sexploitation of the seventies. True the influence of the Damned can be traced in many vile underproducts but also in leading works such as Cabaret or The Night Porter. A reaction to that trend came with the ensuing wave of holocaust movies which made a point in reminding that nazism was above all sheerly destructive.".

	schema:headline " Rigorous classicism.";
	schema:reviewBody "Pauline Kael famously called this movie  hysterical  she was contrasting it to Bertolucci's  The Conformist which was supposed to be more lyrical.  Well a movie about decadent Nazis is bound to be a little hysterical  what were you expecting something tasteful?  Hysteria is probably the best mode with which to treat the Third Reich.  What's astounding is that director Luchino Visconti forced his sweaty hysterical visuals into a rigid classical structure.  The setup is pure clockwork one betrayal leading to another one devastation opening up an even deeper abyss for another perpetrator.Basically Visconti is taking on  Macbeth here.  Dirk Bogarde plays the Macbeth figure an upandcoming industrialist who's sleeping with an evil Grande Dame of Nazi finance Sophie von Essenbeck  Ingrid Thulin having an absolute ball heiress to a munitions conglomerate.  The von Essenbecks are loosely based on the Krupps but don't take this as any sort of literal historiography.  Thulin eggs on her lover Bogarde to commit a few politic murders and a frameup or two so that he can take over the family business with herself as the power behind the throne.  But she doesn't count on the pathology of her grown son from a previous marriage the hideous little monster Martin  Helmut Berger acting terribly but it sort of fits in an Udo Kiersort of way.  Martin is your typical Nazi  a closet pedophile a drug addict a transvestite a momma'sboy a younameit.  The scenes involving his seduction of a 9 or 10yearold girl who lives in a shabby apartment complex are some of the most disturbing that you'll ever see in cinema . . . and along those lines I seriously wonder about the state of mind of some of the commentators here who find this movie to be high camp to be watched with drinking buddies.  If you think molestation is funny you'd better see a shrink pal.    Anyway.  The plot is so Byzantine that it finally defeats a brief summary. Let it suffice to say that Visconti manages to cram his complicated story neatly within the historical context of the period between the Reichstag Fire and the Night of the Long Knives thereby maintaining a nutty observance of Classical Unities.  All the while he films the thing in Hammerhorror Pop color with intense contrast between shadow and light. The first scene by the way is a shot of the blasting furnaces of the munitions factory  a fitting intro to the horrendous vision of depravity which soon follows.  Everyone's sweating in this movie  drops of perspiration trickle down temples and beads of sweat glisten on upper lips throughout as if the flames of Hell are licking up at the soles of their collective feet.  The Damned  is a feverish masterpiece.  You'll never forget it.  Highest recommendation.A tip for viewing of the DVD  I recommend that you watch the movie with the English subtitles ON.  While everyone speaks English in the film only Bogarde is clearly intelligible.  Owing to the complicated plot you'll need to know what's going on in order to fully appreciate Visconti's thematic design.".

The cinematography is beautiful capturing the decaying elegance perfectly. The score by Maurice Jarre adds to the atmosphere nicely even if it is a little reminiscent of Dr Zhivago.

I truthfully don't believe this film could be made today it's just too perverted.Swedish actress Ingrid Thulin of Wild Strawberries fame is fantastic as a ruthless countess who will do anything and I mean anything to achieve her desires for power. About 44 years old in 1969 Thulin presents a sexy and dangerous screen aura. She's blonde lanky and uses her stunning exotic looks and fit body to get what she wants.This film is very demented but it's symbolic of the fall of normality in Germany as the Nazi Party gains power. Scenes of gay orgies nude men gay cross dressers and child molestation leave a bitter taste in your mouth. However Ingrid Thulin's scene in which her sexually mixedup son strips before her and then tears off her top is even further over the top. Thulin plays the part to perfection and as she lays halfnaked in bed both crying tears of agony and moans in excitement it's an outstanding symbolic scene of the damnation that overtook Germany.Ingrid Thulin's greatest and most controversial scene role.".

Yes it is distasteful in it's perversions but Nazism was pretty distasteful in it's reality and perverted too. I am not gay but the Night of the Long Knives is one of the most memorable bits of cinematography I have seen a cross dressing SA thug by the Wannansee having a premonition of doom at the hands of the SS go figure!

	schema:headline " A Potpourri of Vestiges Review Luchino Visconti's haunting tale of moral and social decadence";
	schema:reviewBody "Italian filmmaker Luchino Viconti's 1969 film The Damned is a haunting work of art that may quite easily be regarded as one of the boldest and most disturbing works in the whole of cinema. The Damned is a testament to the genius of Visconti who at the height of his power produced cinema that not only transcended the conventional boundaries but also had the courage to tackle themes that even today are considered forbidden. The Damned is often described as hysterical but what can a movie that's set during the tumultuous phase of Nazi holocaust be anything but hysterical? The movie adorns a stellar international cast led by Ingrid Thulin and Dirk Bogarde and it does take sometime to get used to their different accents. A casual viewer can be further unruffled by movie's convoluted plot. But patience does have its rewards and in this case tenfold. Those who have already watched another of Visconti's masterpieces Death in Venice would be greatly surprised to witness the Italian maestro's range as an auteur. The subtlety and timidness that underline Death in Venice are completely absent here at least in an explicit sense and are replaced by the expressions of brusqueness and chutzpah in full effect. Dirk Bogarde plays a Macbethlike character with religious fervor. While his remarkable performance in Death in Venice is easily his best ever arguably one of the all time best performances in the history of cinema his portrayal of an insecure usurper in The Damned is nothing short of outstanding. But the real star of the show is Ingrid Thulin. Anyone who has seen her in Ingmar Bergman's Winter Light will get the shock of hisher life. As the imperious glacial ravishing Sophie Von Essenbeck in The Damned Thulin is a sight for the sore eyes an elixir for the perturbed souls a poltergeist for the envious. Helmut Berger as Sophie's effeminate son Martin Von Essenbeck is equally chilling. The Damned is replete with homosexuality incest gore and endless grotesqueries and even makes most contemporary holocaust films like Schindler's List and The Pianist appear ridiculously juvenile. The Damned is a profoundly disturbing work of cinema that captures the pervasive insanity of the holocaust days as an irrefutable proof of the diabolical debasing animalistic character that defines the dark side of human psyche. The Damned is not meant for the fainthearted and can only be savored by eschewing bigotry prejudice and conservatism. httpwww.apotpourriofvestiges.com".

Look how depraved these incestuous crossdressing Nazis were apart from one pious voice the whole nation it seems is condemned with one broad stroke and we are given no contrast against which to compare such depravity.The characters of the Von Essenbach family are each representative of a facet of 30s German character all joined in a desire for power or the need to be protected beneath its wing prone to making strident and unyielding demands and dismissing the rights of those who stand in their way. This leaves us with a morally repugnant lot none of whom we can empathise with and also tempts the cast to overact at times. Ingrid Thulin is particularly guilty and even the usually laconic Dirk Bogarde becomes overwrought at times.For all these faults the film is shamelessly entertaining and fascinating to watch. It plays like a Shakespearian tragedy at times and you feel compelled to see it through to the end just to find out the fate of each character.".

Where Kurasawa adapts Shakespearean themes and transposes their themes as farreaching and relevant to different worlds Visconti takes elements of Macbeth and Hamlet bludgeoning them into his tale of a dynasty seemingly aware of drastically uncertain times and powerless to do anything but react in outlandishly vicious and selfprotective defence. The storyline embracing fullblown homosexual orgy incest transvestism and paedophelia as portrayal of Nazi depravity is never subtle but always magnetic. A piece so verbose is of course massively flawed. The dialogue although delivered in English is at times illegible and the discrepancy between actors enjoying themselves a resurgent Ingrid Thulin an ecstatically hammy Dietrichimpersonating Helmut Berger and actors sweating and morose in their discomfort a visibly hardworking Dirk Bogarte is noticeable. Visconti's zoom lenght shots to portray very obvious evil have long been rendered obsolete by television and simply add to the general sense of chaos.In truth however it remarkably adds to the joyous uncertainty of events and as the movie sinks almost overwhelmed to its conclusion it ultimately survives for its hypnotic splendour.".

It is quite in explicable. The acting is bad the dialogue often truly awful and the direction is flat and uninspired. At times the film is lifeless. On paper it will have looked quite promising show how a ruthless employee in league with the boss's daughterinlaw schemes and murders his way to the top of German steel company. Set it all in the Thirties as the Nazis are consolidating their grip on power to reflect the nature of the regime. Nothing wrong with that except that the moral  goodness weren't the Nazis quite awful  is about as unoriginal as you might get. But something many things went wrong in the realisation the collection of English German and I don't know from where else actors does not work and I for one have never bought that Dirk Bogarde is even half as good as everyone else likes to say. The man is often a ham. They seem to be acting in different films. It occurred to me that were the actors all Italian the direction might have just about worked  no I'm clutching at straws. The dialogue is often so utterly banal and 'audience informing' that it could have been written by bad student director. I'll give just one very telling example of how illconceived it all is how wrongheaded yes the Nazis were thugs as the welldocumented Night of the Long Knives murderously demonstrated. But Hitler and the rest of his gang were essentially lowerclass mediocrities who gained power through a bizarre set of circumstances. And they had a doginthemanger attitude to German nobility high finance and industrial grandees. So when the authorities come to arrest Herbert they would not arrive in a battalion of guntoting steelhelmeted blackuniformed soldiers banging on the door to be let in  especially so early on in the regime when their grip on power was still untested and shaky. That whole scene can serve to sum up just how bad this film is. This gets one star out of ten only because the system doesn't allow for awarding no stars.".

The documentary with the DVD insists that Visconti was a perfectionist but I have to say the special effects are very shabby even by 1969 European standards. Maybe it's all meant to be a state of mind which people often argue about the effects in Hitchcock's Marnie but it just doesn't apply here.Nevertheless there are things to admire in the movie. The decor the clothes. The physical beauty of Charlotte Rampling Helmut Berger Helmut Griem. The Maurice Jarre score. Ingrid Thulin's hat! Ingrid Thulin's vampireish makeup! But what a pity the movie isn't great as it should have been.I have a friend who has pointed out that Hitchcock and Wilder lost their touch once they had to no longer imply certain sensitive ideas and images after the end of censorship. And one could apply that to Visconti here. The incest the drug addiction the pedophilia the homoeroticism transvestism etc. They're all there for the world to see.

In other words The Damned is a Days of Our Lives episode set against the backdrop of Nazi Germany and just as uninteresting a multiplicity of plot threads none of which are explored satisfactorily doesn't help nor does the overly pretentious 'mood lighting' that punctuates every scene. The film moves along quickly enough but the fact that we care nothing for the characters or events that transpire negate that lone positive aspect.

What is fascinating is the fact that the story is set during the rise of Nazi Germany and that each member of the family stands for German history. The old baron Essenbeck symbolizes the old civilized Germany of Bach and even of the Kaiser. When he dies the power falls in the hands of one of his nephews a brutal and ignorant man who stands for the SA. But he is soon killed and the power is taken by Sophie and her lover who accept to work with the Nazis against the promise that they will become rich and powerful. These wicked lovers may be bad but they are only human wicked people who are ready to use all means to gain power. The real symbol of Nazism in the movie is Martin a mentally unbalanced young man who is a murderous pedophile and has an incestuous relation with his mother. Martin stands for the total evil of nazism an evil which is no longer human. At the end of the movie he controls the whole industrial Empire just like the nazis rule over Germany.

After some deliberation and after this new happening in the country Josef decides to step away from his duties as president of the company passing it to one of his relatives Konstantin Ren Koldehoff. From this point on all we're going to see a battle for power that slowly destroys each member of the Essenebck family. Murder betrayal fight for a higher status in this new Germany and other things will be decisive to unscrupulous people like Martin Helmut Berger great actor one of the troubled and young members of this aristocratic family and the one who'll be decisive in the way things move in the country and with his mother Ingrid Thulin and her husband Frederick Bruckmann Dirk Bogarde who are also trying to make their way in the family business helped by Aschenbach Helmut Griem who carefully builds the web of deceptions in this game joining one side at one time then the other in a more appropriate time depending of the circumstances.This year it appeared in my hands a book of the script from this film plus an interview with the creators of it where they justify the film and the things they wanted to evocate with it by dealing with the seeds of Nazism and the way this was spread on a fragile Germany. What I saw in there was amazing the thoughtful interviews and the greatly written script drastically reduced in the filmed version. But what I've seen in the completed cinematic form was a little bit confusing with few unexplained things the presentation of the characters weren't so good just like the one of the written work just an example but a majestous work of art and history. Its grandiosity was beyond anything I've seen in a while here's a spectacular tragedy of limitless dimensions that even if part of it is not real just looks and sounds a lot real to many of us. It's an accomplished and tragic epic full of blood perversions twisted personalities insanity greed lust and other torments of the body and soul.For all I've seen and all the relevant things it had to show and say I consider La Caduta Degli Dei a very good film on the pre WWII subject with outstanding acting by the cast impressive art direction and impeccable costumes. A story to be seen multiple times to be fully comprehended and absorbed. 910".

	schema:reviewBody "Whenever I see this film I always feel like tucking myself away in bed wishing the weather outside would be Grey windy cold and rainy so as I could feel safe in my home and lazy. I'm not saying 'Arctic Blue' is mediocre  on the contrary.....This is one of the few films I've seen where I feel completely relaxed. Even with the violence that fills it this film has such a relaxing gentle beauty about it  not to mention the exhilarating Alaskan scenery this film showcases.Peter Masterson the director delivers an authentic feeling of isolation and paints a picture of the enormity of the location to the viewer. This is a good base for an original story  In an isolated town in the middle of nowhere anything can happen....even murder! The atmosphere was built very well and you get a touch of what it would be like living there.The cinematography was splendid. It constantly gave me the urge to want to be there  still tucked in bed though. The film painted such a brilliant picture of just how far the nearest town could be by utilizing the treacherous yet beautiful landscape.The music was nothing special although at times I could say it added well to the wilderness and action scenes well.I couldn't say much about the story either  also nothing special  although it is original. Nevertheless it does hold your attention for all duration. The dazzling scenery adds most to the experience though.Rutger Hauer was an excellent choice for the misunderstood individual  the same role he played masterfully in Blade Runner. His commanding presence always gives films great credibility. Here he plays a sad individual who feels he has nothing to lose and that nature is his home after losing his wife years earlier. It is for this reason he and a band of friends murder rival trappers on a hunting trip without remorse. Dylan walsh plays his role convincingly as an ecologist for an oil company who's responsibility being the only pilot in town is to transport Rutger Hauer to the nearest town to be trialled for his crimes.In general I found the film quite entertaining  like a 1.5 hour portal to Alaska. And it is so relaxing and beautiful that you forget about its shortcomings and plot holes. It isn't a classic but in my books a definitive escapist experience and a must for all the wilderness film fans out there.".

	schema:reviewBody "Anything with Rutger Hauer is better than average thanks to his presence and no exception here. In this one he's the bad guy but good guy character meaning the misunderstood individualist. However this aspect of the story is left unexplored. Hauer's a trapper in Alaska with a gang of moronic sidekicks who stumble upon a group of hunters and threaten to take some of their pelts. Hauer kills with a thrown knife one of the hunters who draws a gun then his gang leave the others in the wild after destroying their truck motor and of course the hunters die from exposure. So the local lawman is determined to get Hauer. In a situation where self defense could have been shown the trappers let matters get way out of hand then are determined to free Hauer from the grips of the law. During the escapades of getting Hauer to jail in Fairbanks Hauer protests that he is only a misunderstood individual who's one with the wilderness. And the young man who takes the duty to deliver Hauer is conflicted about doing this. It seems that there were plot elements cut out because it would have been much more believable if Hauer had told his side of the killing to the lawman which he never did. No explanation and no remorse just make him a bad character and it's tough to see why the lawman feels sympathy towards him. There's a whole subplot about evil oil company dealings that is unexplored and tough to figure out and that's more of what was probably cut out and somehow Hauer is involved against the oil company but that's also a missing plot piece. The producers needed to have had somebody with fresh eyes look at the film before they cut out certain plot developments that left the story less coherent than it should have been. Still it's above average and if you can fill in the holes yourself as I did it will be a fine evening of viewing and there's some really beautiful scenery.".

Indeed instead of a straight up action adventure they've gone for something a little more meandering and amusing sort of like Midnight Run under the midnight sun. In a sea of direct to video flicks that Rutger Hauer has done it's tough to weed the gems from the turds but this one is gold especially if you're a fan of him as well as gorgeously photographed scenery. As Ben he's not quite hero not quite antagonist a wildman of a trapper who functions on instinct and has no use for the rule of law. When an altercation with a park ranger leads to murder at his own hand Ben is set to be escorted to judgment by a local sheriff Dylan Walsh. Walsh is green around the ears though and Ben is determined to escape aided by his familiarity with the land and climate as well as his bawdy fellow trappers who are hot on their trail. what follows is almost genre defying it's just this side of adventure with the slightest hint of buddy comedy and even a few mournful notes to Ben's backstory that give it that dramatic weight. I love an ambiguous character one who makes real choices and has capacity for both compassion and viciousness in their spirit seemingly free from the constriction of conventional plot development. Ben is his own man and approaches both his environment and his fellow man on his own terms which granted can lead to trouble but is an endlessly attractive character trait to have. I think having grown up in such a rugged untethered corner of the globe people like Ben run on their own clock and hum with the delirious atmosphere of such a far removed existence. The entire film has that going for it too like everyone involved is running off of no sleep and whatever is in the water way up there in the north. A true undiscovered gem of a film if you can find it anywhere.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm serious I learnt a lot from Boa Vs Python  Bulgaria looks a lot like 24 miles outside Philadelphia.Multimillionaire businessmen with their own private jets spend their free time at amateurlevel wrestling matches where the wrestlers dress up in coloured masks. The businessman is more than willing to pay 500 US dollars for a seat though.You have to show a beautiful girl disrobing three times and stepping into the bath three times before the audience can understand that she is taking a bath. Some of the shots are in slow motion to allow the even slower audience members to catch on in time.Multiple sticks of dynamite causing an explosion roughly 80 feet high and 15 feet wide is not quite enough to blow up two cars and a truck but it will partially destroy one of the cars leaving it on fire. Police the FBI and the Fire Brigade will make no attempt to put out such fires even 812 hours after the explosion.The television will unmute itself when an answer to a rich man's conundrum is on the news.Multimillionaire businessmen watch local news channels from cities that they're not even from while flying 39000 feet in the air.80 feet long snakes that have the diameter of over 3 feet can get through holes in doors roughly a third of that size.Philadelphia sheriffs trip over and fall onto corpses at a crime scene but this presents no problem of any kind.The worlds foremost marine research scientist is a blonde girl in her late 20s with breast implants who likes taking off her bikini underwater to win money.Guys who want to take their singlet off while at the pool don't just take it off. They put it on so that they rip it off and throw it away.Even though you can clearly see the bottom of a pool that's 2 metres 6 feet deep when people stand on the floor of that pool their actions are completely unknown to onlookers.Leading research scientists repeatedly tap on the glass of a snake's cage out of interest as to see what it will do.An FBI agent can't find a 70foot long Boa in a room about 30x18 feet because 70foot Boas find it very easy to hide in medium sized rooms.Leading research scientists who have breast implants just happen to make sensor pads for animals which are constantly referred to as implants by the research scientist. She doesn't appear to realise the cheap gag nature of her comments until a man uses the phrase equipment in which case she suddenly pauses smiles to herself and he has to avert all talk from topics that could be perceived to be relating to her upper chest.One of the world's richest hunters cannot drive properly. Neither can his son. They can't shoot very well at all either. Or throw a grenade more than 5 metres. And despite being overly rich they drive a 90s model Volvo.A girl cannot tell the difference between being licked by a 6ft tall male and being licked by an 80foot python with a mouth about 20 times the size of the male.All sentences in front page news articles are condensed into one paragraph.Newspaper photos do not have captions and are never larger than 6cm by 6cm.Members of the U.S. Army randomly and in a very monotone voice say ReadytokicksomeassSir ... to an FBI agent. No commanding officers are present when national security is at stake.Some people can't tell the difference between a pig and an 80foot long python.Members of the U.S. Army can't find a 70foot Boa in an underground room even when it screams every couple of seconds.When there's not a second to spare leading scientists make jokes about crossbreed snake sex.When the military's best sniper says one shot one kill he means two shots one kill.The best way to save your girlfriend from being crushed by a 70 foot boa is to randomly aim your flamethrower at the boa's face even if it is all of 1 foot from your girlfriend.Wanted fugitives are never handcuffed but they are allowed to easily slip into a tank and drive it away from a military base. With a flamethrower of course.The U.S. military trusted a rocket launcher to one of its soldiers who couldn't hit a tank going at less than 20 miles an hour 32 kmhour from 30 feet distance  directly behind the tank no less.To make sure that the audience knows that the scene has changed to a club show at least one minute of naked bodypainted dancers.When a wanted fugitive starts attacking armed members of the army with a flame thrower they don't shoot him. Instead they run towards the flames even after three have burnt to death.A huge snake can't barge through metal bars being held by two people but it can utterly destroy a concrete wall.After someone one has been killed ripped into two bits and thrown around they can still let out one last scream.Creating subway stations entirely in CGI makes a movie climax so much more interesting.Honestly you should show this movie to aspiring doctors and lawyers. The knowledge they will gain will pay dividends in the future. No other film can teach you the facts about all these things that you didn't previously know were true.".

	schema:reviewBody "A few things I learned from Boa vs Python1. When you get your women naked right off the top and what good film maker wouldn't... make sure that they scrub down with dish soap and a plain orange sponge in as sexy as way as humanly possible.2. To show tension in a forest scene when a large unseen predator is disturbing the local animal life Go to your local pet store and folly in the sound of budgies squawking. This will REALLY pull off the effect that something ain't right in them woods!!! Besides most woods outside Philly are CRAWLING with budgies. Or was it Pittsburg? Okay... if it was Pittsburg... my mistake. Those woods are rampant with pets.2a. Garter Snakes squeak when you chuck 'em around. Bet you didn't know that all you Animal Planet loving people did you! Don't let small things like facts get in the way of the action.2c. People who work with dolphins spend time with dolphins all that jazz... you know... animal people... the first thing they'll do when they encounter a snake in a glass tank is pretty obviously start rapping on the glass. That stuff you hear about never knock on the glass when you're a pet stores and zoos... well they're making that up. It NEVER startles or deafens the animals. That's why people in movies who are supposed to be in the field of zoology do it. They know that it's a madeup rule of thumb. And it's a good setup to a damn funny joke.3. Even multimillionaires who hunt ridiculously large animals for sport have their problems. For example When transporting said large animals rent a truck to do it in. Because when you have your own jet with a BATHTUB!!! you probably don't own trucks. Make sure that you get the truck with the modified ridiculously large animal transport container.3a. When the ridiculously large animal escapes and how could it not??? show the human side of your millionaire by having a customer service rep from the trucking company CALL your millionaire to inform him of the problem. When your millionaire demands answers have the CSR tell him that she'll have to get her supervisor. Hey... when you're globetrotting on your own jet you DO make all these arrangements yourself with your local truck rental dealer.4. Get in touch with those emotional backstories with lines to the effect of Gee to try and find a cure for snake poison... you must have some incredible psychological reason for doing that! Really the audience will thank you for getting straight to the exposition.5. It doesn't matter that the two teens who are making out in a car look like a mother and son making out in a car. No one will notice! Besides they're just snake fodder anyway! Gee... there must be some deep seated Freudian reason for this... Cue exposition.6. SAVE MONEY ON CGI. All you have to do is suggest that a large snake is roaming around peoples feet by showing them reacting to it. So what if sometimes you show a scene where a snake SHOULD be and isn't. As long as you have actors to act like one is there the audience will fill in the blank.7. People don't need to see some actors faces. Especially when they're minor characters... like second in command of an elite group of FBI agents. Minor character... handful of lines... have her deliver them AWAY from the camera. That way we really connect! And it saves time with the ADR.8. Always... ALWAYS... end your movie in a subway station. Even if you have to jump from a rave DIRECTLY AND WITH SOME SORT OF MAGIC to the subway station... ALWAYS end it there...9. Be sure to set up for the sequel! Don't be too obvious. Make sure you give them special fancy snake fighting clothes! It looks tres cool.10. On the cover of the DVD... ALWAYS and I mean always... show a helicopter firing missiles at two large fighting snakes. It doesn't matter if your movie has nothing like that in there. The cover for Citizen Kane shows a guy making a speech or something... and I'm pretty sure that's not in there... oh wait... it is??? FCK!So... all in all... I actually recommend seeing this movie. In the right setting you'll laugh your arse sore. Just keep in mind that if this was SUPPOSED to be a comedy... or if you actually fixed all the stuff I mentioned above... this would be just another gigantic steamy pile of boring crap.".

The plot gets even sillier after that. The effects are cheesy  low budget CGI although the camera work and editing is very good. Characters are mindless and moronic  most of them created just for former playmates to show off their tootsassetts at the expense of a relevant or interesting storyline.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is a great movie if your with your friends and are looking for a good movie to laugh at but if your one of those people with no sense of humor to bad acting bad special effects and major plot holes then you would probably hate this movie and just like the nudity in scene 3.Me and my friends were looking for a good movie to watch at first we thought we would watch a real movie like Friday night lights or man on fire but then we saw some really cheesy movies and thought they would be much better. We eventually narrowed it down to Frankenfish Monster Man and Boa vs. Python. We went with Boa vs. Python we were not disappointed.This movie is basically about a rich guy who has nothing better to do than to hunt giant animals. He has a giant python flown in and in most monster films the snake escapes. The rich guy and his posse of hunters have to hunt the snake on private property now while the government catches wind of his snake problems and tries to kill it with there own equally large snake the boa named Betty. Thats where I'll leave you to rent or buy this movie.I don't know if the director tried to make a real B monster movie or just the amazing comedy it is because some on the action scenes were way over the top and unrealistic. Like in the beginning with the Dolphin lady and mullet marine man or most of scenes with Roddick like his escape from the military base and his flamethrower scene with the cigar.So this would be a good movie to watch with your friends but if your just watching at home alone i don't think you would catch the true beauty of this movie".

After terrorizing the sewers of Philadelphia the FBI enlists the aid of two fellow scientists to remedy the situation. One has been harboring an enormous boa for years while the other one has beautiful 'implants'. Together they work to bring this slithering beast of evil down.Little do they know they are not the only ones hot on the trail. A big game animal hunter named Roddick has recruited some of the best hunters in the world to bring this beast down. The battle royale begins as the lines between man vs. nature man vs. machine and man vs. man are blurred and new boundaries are set. Who will reign supreme? Find out this Sunday Sunday Sunday!!Impressive graphics and an excellent balance between action and gore are what keep this film afloat. This straight to DVD release should have most people laughing but oddly kept my attention until the very end. The story is flawed the characters are unbelievable and the script is amateurish see constant remarks about 'implants' and Monica but there is something to be said about using good CGI. This is no LOTR but for a straight to DVD release I was impressed. Director David Flores has done an exceptional job of giving us exactly what we came looking for with this film. We wanted action some nudity and tons of snakes and he successfully handed them to us on a silver platter. If you do not walk into this film with high expectations you will probably leave impressed. Grade   out of ".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERTI was in contact with the director of Boa vs. Python throughout the process of making this movie. He had emailed me in the hopes that I could shed some light on what monster movie fans like to see in their monster movies. This was his first directing effort and he wanted it to be a good one. I told him that the difference between a good creature flick and a bad one comes down to the creature itself. The monster should be vicious and love to kill people at all times. Ambiguity can kill these kinds of flicks when you have a beast that turns out to actually be a good creature and is just misunderstood. So remember to make the monster EVIL so that the audience can scream with joy when it is blown to bits.A little time went by and he emailed me again. He had a script for Boa vs. Python. Did I want to read it? Sure I said. I received a script right away and was excited about what I had read. There were monster fights and plenty of nudity. I especially liked the subway snake fight scene and suggested some possible fighting shots for it. He thanked me for the ideas and went off to Bulgaria to make the movie. A couple of months later he emailed me again. This time he had a rough cut assembled and was wondering if I wanted to take a look at it. Again I said yes. So he sent me the rough cut and a sweatshirt that had Boa vs. Python written on it. The rough cut was very interesting. All the snake special effects were missing and would be filled in later. Whenever a snake was supposed to be doing something there would just be commands typed into the movie like Snake crawls out of sewer or Snakes fighting. I thought it looked like a solid Bmovie.Unfortunately the one thing I realized as I was looking over the script and then the rough cut was that money was a problem. The whole movie depended on the snake effects. If they were convincing the movie would be good. They could only afford one big snake fight and that was at the very end. They also cut out a crucial scene where the snake attacks some teens in a car and is able to lick the girl's nipple. Giant forked tongue action would have been classic. Instead the snake just shakes up the car. Also as I was looking over the credits the main star of the movie had been in many Playboy videos and yet does not get naked in the movie. This made me sad as well.In a nutshell there is nothing wrong with Boa vs. Python that a few million bucks couldn't have solved. Giant snake goes on a rampage and Dr. Babe hunts it down with another giant snake. It zips right along and gives you as much Bmovie bang as it can afford. I could have gone for some more monster fighting and more gratuitous nudity but that's probably true of most movies I watch. The snake effects weren't the best in the world but I was satisfied. It's worth a look. Just make sure to watch the video version. More breasts and blood. Yeah. That's what it's all about.".

	schema:reviewBody "I had pinned high hopes on this movie for two reasons.1. I'm fascinated with snakes. 2. Jaime Bergman. The movie was worth watching for most of the special effects. Most of the time the snakes looked real and very menacing. I was totally into that but they didn't really show them enough and to be honest they didn't really fight all that much either. The contrast in color between the two snakes was a nice touch too. I would love to have a snake like the red one in the move smaller of course. The movie was missing something however even though I can't quite put my finger on it. Even after overlooking the fact that both Boas and Pythons are constrictors and don't bite off their food like a dog would or leave half a body lying around I still felt something was missing. Wish I could tell you what it was but it felt a little empty. You have to admit seeing a few of the bad guys having the life constricted out of them would have had a longer lasting effect than the quick snaps the snake was taking out of them and then seeing them unhinge their jaw to swallow a human whole would have been great to see as well but oh well what can you do?One thing that was definitely missing as my fellow reviewer Dr. Gore had stated in an earlier review was natural beauty Jaime Bergman's lack of sexiness with her character. Not necessarily missing the nudity although that would have been nice as she has a body better than most in Hollywood but a little more in that area would have been nice. Angel Boris did do more than enough to compensate for Bergman with the TA for this film though so it wasn't a complete loss in that area. Also I was unaware they had movies for both the Boa and the Python previously so I didn't know this was another combination of two movie serpents in separate films. It didn't feel like either one had anything to do with the past at all. Not a bad movie overall it's worth seeing if you got an hour and a half to spare.I gave this movie 6 out of 10.".

And the two giant snakes hunt everything that moves.First let me point out the plot is silly. And unfortunately the computer graphics of the two giant snakes are at some points really bad. The cast neither very famous nor completely unknown is actually better than I expected without really turning in an awesome performance. I guess it is hard in a movie like this. Then there are the other effects which also is better than expected. Also a positive surprise is the effort put into extras and so actually bringing the army to more than a jeep and four soldiers.

Unfortunately an unexpected event occurs along the way which results in the python escaping its cage and getting loose close to a water treatment facility in Pennsylvania. Being somewhat hungry it immediately feeds on a few of the workers there which in turn gets the attention of the FBI. Not wanting to damage the precarious water supply of that particular region of the country the FBI agentincharge Agent Sharpe Kirk B.R. Woller contacts a local herpetologist by the name of Dr. Emmett David Hewlett along with a marine biologist named Monica Bonds Jaime Bergman. It is then disclosed that Dr. Emmett has a 70foot boa constrictor which he has scientifically bred in captivity while Ms. Bonds possesses a stateoftheart surveillance apparatus that she has used on dolphins. The plan they come up with is to put the surveillance equipment on the boa constrictor and somehow lure it towards the python and hopefully kill it. What they don't count on is the presence of the biggame hunters. On that note neither do the biggame hunters count on a 70foot boa constrictor in addition to their intended target. In any case rather than reveal any more I will just say that even though I had hoped it would be worth viewing I honestly didn't expect too much from this particular movie. For starters neither Python nor Python II were really that good. Not bad necessarilybut not that good either. Likewise the film featuring the first gigantic boa constrictor New Alcatraz was even worse. That said combining the two elements of these films didn't seem to be all that appealing. In retrospect while I wouldn't say that this movie was a complete disaster it still wasn't quite as good as it could have been either. The action scenes lacked zest and the general story seemed to plod along at a very slow pace as well. In short if a person enjoyed any of the previous films in this hybrid series then it might be worth a watch. For what it's worth I didn't see anything special or outoftheordinary with this movie and I rate it as slightly below average.".

One of the many positives here is the film's high cheese factor that comes into play here starting immediately and then continuing along throughout here. The idea of tying in the snake's release in a blazing firefight from its handlers with a wrestling match that plays off the two snakes out hunting in the rest of the film which starts this and gives it a great base for the later cheesy scenes in here that is based on a very clever premise about how the two snakes come into the storyline. Instead of having the two snakes being in a jungle and them fighting over territory this one has the python being shipped in for a big game hunt only to have it escape and the government recruits a captive boa to track the snake. This is a pretty clever new idea and makes for a skew of new ideas all from the cheesiness of this one. This also leads into the fun fact that this one contains as much action as it does with creepy and immensely cheesy series of battles out in the woods concerning the hunters trying to track down the giant beast but getting slaughtered pretty handily a slew of rather intriguing oneoff attacks as the snakes are let loose in the forest as well as the powerplant to a pretty chilling underground tunnel encounter that has a lot of creepiness as to when the creature will come out leading to the big battle in the equipment room and then down into the tunnels belowground and a truly cheesy and exploitative sequence in a dance club that really could've only been pulled off in a movie like this one due to the rather dumb nature of what happens overall as well as the resulting chaos that erupts from the scene when it starts attacking the attendees and gets to really up the body count before it gets to the final showdown between the creatures. While the frequent nudity and cheese make it somewhat exciting there's still a few problems to this one. One of the bigger problems here is that the film is mostly bloodless and doesn't have any really creative deaths for the victims and doesn't really have anything really standout for its kills. The film does have a pretty high body count but all are killed in pretty dry situations as there is an almost total lack of gore in the movie. The goriest death is actually that of the losing snake but beyond that this one feels quite dry most of the time. As well the fact that the CGI for this one is quite atrocious and really terrible doesn't help it much with the really standout pixelation used in creating the snakes being quite obvious. These here are what hold this one back.Rated R Graphic Language Brief Nudity and Graphic Violence.".

This film was made in 1945 and the phrase under God was not inserted into the pledge until the mid 1950s under the Eisenhower administration. This was done so as an anticommunist move. It was NOT originally part of the pledge. The producers of this film were by no means trying to be politically correct by not using it nor was it ever edited out. The phrase simply did not exist in the pledge in 1945. Having been raised Catholic I too noticed it right away the first time I saw this film but a little research on my part quickly put that issue to rest.And like her I also notice the grayed out bar at the bottom of the screen during the main title.

The film builds up to quite an emotional dramatic ending. There are some moments when Ingrid Bergman simply shines with a special radiance. Bing Crosby was excellent also although I think he had many better songs to sing in his long career. The direction seems slowpaced at times but in a way this measured pacing gives the audience a better chance to focus on the characters on the screen.The story certainly touched upon some important issues of Catholic education in the 1940's and 1950's. There were always fine attempts to help children from the other side of the tracks to prosper in a private school with assistance of various kinds. The postwar population boom however led to huge numbers of children being educated as cheaply as possible in crowded old unsafe buildings. It was not uncommon to have 70 pupils in one classroom. In this film the nuns are relentlessly polite but in real life they had to be very strict to control large classes. The picture refers to fire traps and the fact that St. Mary's School was about to be condemned. How ironic this was for just 13 years later  on December 1 1958  a fire swept through the antiquated Our Lady of the Angels elementary school in Chicago killing 92 children and three nuns. That tragic fire led to sweeping changes in building code laws and the modernization of thousands of schools across America both public and private.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a classic old holiday favorite and quite deservedly so. It tells the story of a dilapidated parochial school St. Mary's that is facing condemnation. Sister Bendict the Mother Superior and school principal is struggling not only to save the school but expand it with dreams of annexing the neighboring property owned by a shrewd businessman named Mr. Bogardus. She frequently clashes with St. Mary's new pastor Father O'Malley who has his own ideas as to how the school should be run and its fate.First of all I may make some enemies however...I love Bing Crosby but the part of Father O'Malley is not merely to serve as a foil for Sister Benedict but to act much of the time as a veritable idiot! Likable but possibly a tad too clueless to ever have become a priest. For example his opening stunt where he declares a holiday can you imagine any Catholic priest actually doing this without first consulting the sisters? He's unrealistically lenient apparently seeing no need whatsoever for discipline and disregards standards encouraging with no apparent misgivings at all Sister Benedict to pass a student who has failed the exams. However he is kind well intended and nonjudgmental as shown by his touching behavior toward young Patsy and her mother and does sometimes achieve the desired results I admit with his relaxed easy going laid back style. Wonderful singing as always with Bing's magnificent effortless voice. I didn't see Going My Way I confess.This is Ingrid Bergman's movie. She gives Sister Benedict a sparkling inner light here as she portrays the devout and dedicated nun trying to save her school while also ensuring its daily operation with kindness fairness and genuine concern but also meaningful standards and expectations. She appears strict at times but has a genuine love for her students and a concern that they truly learn. She glows with pride at her little first graders' Christmas pageant. I love her method for helping young Eddie protect himself against the school yard bullies! Suffice it to say if I had a child in a parochial school I would want it run by Sister Benedict and not Father O'Malley!Unfortunately these days it's all the negative tales that draw headlines but my own husband grew up with nuns as teachers during most of his Catholic school years and he can't sing their praises enough. This movie is a touching entertaining and uplifting tale something of a tribute to all the hard working dedicated nuns who have taught in parochial schools through the years.".

This film is somewhat dated but one can see why it was one of the favorite movie it became when it was released. It helped a lot that Mr. McCarey had a pretty decent screen play by Dudley Nichols but also the two charismatic stars that were at the height of their popularity among movie fans.The story of what would be considered now an inner city parochial school showed how religious nuns dominated that field as they played a vital role to educate the children of the congregations they were assigned to. Not having had that type of education myself one can say that what comes across is good solid nononsense approach to turning solid citizens out of the children that parents entrusted to those dedicated women. Like them or not those nuns have to be credited with whatever success the kids under them went to achieve.As the Mother Superior at Saint Mary's Sister Mary Benedit ruled the school. She had set principles to go by in treating those in the care of the school. Her love for the children is obvious and her desire to get a bigger building in which to expand consumes her throughout the film.Father O'Malley on the other hand looks things in a different way. He clashes with Sister Mary Benedict because in his way of thinking a little leniency toward the young ones could do much better than with the rigid ways Mother Superior thought was better. Father O'Malley accomplishes more with this attitude than the school director. In fact it's because his inter action with Mr. Bogardus the rich man that has bought part of the school to erect a building that he is able to convince this man to donate it to St. Mary's.Ingrid Bergman and Bing Crosby worked well together or that is the impression one gets by watching them on the screen. These two actors were at the pinnacle of their careers and this film solidified their appeal to their adoring fans. The supporting fans are all excellent. Henry Travers makes a good Mr. Bogardus. Joan Carroll is perfect as Patsy Gallagher and Una O'Connor turns up as Mrs. Breen.The Bells of St. Mary's will bring joy to any viewer that is willing to take a chance with this timeless classic.".

These two actors were at the pinnacle of their careers and this film solidified their appeal to their adoring fans. The supporting fans are all excellent. Henry Travers makes a good Mr. Bogardus. Joan Carroll is perfect as Patsy Gallagher and Una O'Connor turns up as Mrs. Breen.The Bells of St. Mary's will bring joy to any viewer that is willing to take a chance with this timeless classic.";

If The Bells of St.Mary's does not quite hit the heights of Going My Way it's got nothing to apologize for. One thing that I do like about it is that you don't have to have watched Going My Way to get into the spirit of this.Bing repeated his Father O'Malley character and in doing so got a second Oscar nomination. Until Al Pacino was nominated for Michael Corleone in both Godfathers One and Two Crosby was the only performer ever to have been nominated twice for the same role. Because of Father O'Malley Bing Crosby became probably the most well known Catholic lay person on the planet. And for better or worse it's the Crosby that is remembered when the knives came out for him after he died.With Ingrid Bergman the damage was more immediate. Today if you asked the average movie goer to quickly name the part Bergman is best known for it would be Ilsa Lund from Casablanca. Back in the late 40s however the answer would be Sister Benedict. How a Swede who is identified as Swedish in the film could be a Catholic let alone a nun is a mystery to me. But that's how good an actress Ingrid Bergman was. She became the personification of holiness so when Ingrid Bergman announced she was pregnant with Roberto Rosellini's child the reaction of the public was swift and terrible. Banish her from Hollywood and she was. Such is the power of the mass media. Consider folks like Errol Flynn and Robert Mitchum who had reputations as hellraisers before scandal hit them. Such is the power of the silver screen and the images it creates.Bing has some good songs here he sings the title tune with different lyrics for the screen then for his record. It's the school anthem and he sings it with a chorus of nuns to back him. Those nuns do sing well and in key. I wonder if it was the inspiration for Sister Act.Crosby also has two of his patented philosophical numbers Aren't You Glad You're You and In The Land Of Beginning Again. And in keeping with the nature of the film he sings Adeste Fideles and O Sanctissima.Among the supporting cast I would single out Joan Carroll as the girl boarding with the convent housekeeper and Martha Sleeper as her mother. Sleeper had both looks and talent she should have had a bigger career.The Bells of St. Mary's is what we would deem fine family entertainment. It's also how the Catholic Church likes to see itself. It's a milestone movie for the careers of its stars. But what a cost.".

	schema:headline " Where You Lose Nothing But Find Something";
	schema:reviewBody "A special day and a challenge appears at St Mary's convent...a young and inexperienced Father O'Malley Bing Crosby comes to its convent school. He does not know much about how to deal with school administration how to put up with the nuns how to take the biblical advice Be sober and watch! Nevertheless little humor he has in advance gifted honesty imagination and heart are able to make the bell ring out the joy of finding the sixth sense in both pupils and tutors the sense so gloomily rooted in Hamlet's soliloquy  TO BE. In this movie however TO BE reveals a different incarnation a very optimistic face...This sixth sense Father O'Malley memorably reveals to one of his pupils is brought out not only by the leading characters portrayed by wonderful Ingrid Bergman and Bing Crosby but also by vibrant unforgettable supporting characters like Patsy's parents who reconcile after 13 years and once greedy and reluctant Mr Bogardus. Thanks to their optimistic humane subtle contributions to the movie we can still be touched to tears and realize that after all these years we're watching a significant production that has really stood a test of time.Apart from many reviews and viewpoints on this movie the major point of praise is with its genuine depiction of life and the 'simplicity' of its complexities. Drama blending with comedy intense struggle blending with ease sorrow with laughter. Mr Bogardus Henry Travers perhaps best embodies that idea. His life with humorous and spiritual undertones is transformed. He undergoes a unique change of heart both humorous and serious but a far more downtoearth than splendid miracles and loud proclamations. The change is something that he shows in...deeds. The three key concepts of generosity benevolence and dust leave us amused and positively loaded while watching the nice old fellow with a mind filled with quite concrete realizations of good deeds. Note the sweet dog he saves on the road which follows him. The actor's performance is worth noting.Keeping in mind constant humor inserted to many scenes helps view the movie quite distanced from its convent setting and its conventional atmosphere. Spirituality is never too tense nor unbearable for a contemporary viewer but subtly contributes to the plots. That is partly achieved by its school context  we rather see priests and nuns teaching than praying. This 'education context' ranges from class humor pupils' dramatic efforts to boys' fights which are the inevitable part of school life never totally rejected nor severely punished by the most holy nuns. Meanwhile music positively aids the mood of the movie including such classical pieces as a glorious hymn of praise to Virgin Mary O Sanctissima also known as Mariners Hymn a lovely song sung by Bing Crosby In the Land of Beginning Again which beautifully goes with a plot the charming song derived from the title The Bells of St Mary's the famous carol O Come All Ye Faithful sung in Latin Adeste Fideles and the lovely Swedish folk song about the coming of the spring Varvindar Friska sung by Ingrid Bergman. This was the most memorable song from this movie for me. It sounds joyful thrilling and mysterious.Since the movie is deeply rooted in its Hollywood tradition and the specific period of star vehicles the two greatest achievements are most visible through Ingrid Bergman and Bing Crosby. What a pairing!INGRID BERGMAN the Swedish star in Hollywood apart from Garbo and unlike Garbo...not alone is a 'grown up tomboy nun' combines holiness with earthliness being equally captivating at praying earnestly to God with teary eyes and training a young boy Eddie in the art of skillful boxing. Her most unforgettable moments however include the terrific scenes with Mr Bogardus. The touch of these scenes is something you cannot describe but you must see. BING CROSBY supplies the movie with an excellent picture of priest's model  a person of intellect but above all a person of heart. He is ready to LISTEN to people around not PREACH through monologue to help the separated couples reconcile to talk to the heart of young Patsy to sing out his concept of living the life of love. A charming performance!Sister Benedict and Father O'Malley when we consider their characters as a sort of 'couple' differ in their attitudes about how to treat pupils ideas of how to run the school differ in their tempers too  that is the contrast of 'fight your way through' vs 'think your way through' at certain moments. The leading female and the leading male ... Yet with unique 'chemistry' they wonderfully complement each other. The typical old Hollywood farewell scene at the finale proves that assumption about leading couple most effectively.THE BELLS OF ST MARY'S does not only bring sweet memories of Hollywood's heyday but still through its unique depiction of the story proudly inspires this sixth sense. Glad to BE aware of why you are here BE able to lose nothing of yourself but find inspiration that sustains humanity in joyful existence. A wonderful example of a great old classic at which your heart wears a smile...".

	schema:headline " A Beatific Bergman and a Relaxed Crosby Team for a Glowing Film of Yore";
	schema:reviewBody "There are few more beatific images than the youthful Ingrid Bergman framed by her nun's habit looking skyward and glistening by candlelight at the end of this 1945 holiday classic. Director Leo McCarey has Bing Crosby reprise his role as Father O'Malley from their film from a year earlier Going My Way. Both really reflect the type of films that would more likely show up as TV movies on the Family Channel if produced today but wartime audiences were obviously in need of such cinematic salves. What is reassuring is how the films remain affecting today if rather unabashedly sentimental.What sets this one apart is Crosby's natural ease in the role certainly far more muted than he is with Bob Hope in the Road movies and having the incandescent Bergman portray Sister Benedict. The pacing is leisurely as the first part of the film establishes the two stars in their roles before going into the slim plot line which has the sister hoping a rich curmudgeon named Horace P. Bogardus will donate a new expansive building to St. Mary's Academy to take place of the rundown old building that the sisters and the schoolchildren inhabit.McCarey  along with screenwriter Dudley Nichols  both pioneers of screwball comedy focus on the lightheartedness of the story until a couple of sentimental developments occur. The first has to do with a lonely student named Patsy who comes to idolize Sister Benedict to the point of intentionally failing to graduate in order to avoid going back home to her concerned mother and estranged father. The second involves Sister Benedict's medical condition which forces Father O'Malley to make a difficult decision about St. Mary's.There are fewer songs here than in Going My Way  the title tune and another one Aren't You Glad You're You? both sung effortlessly by Crosby and a Swedish folk song performed in a warm alto by Bergman. The softcentered philosophical discussions between the two leads generate some interesting conflict though nothing that feels irreconcilable by the end. There are also some amusing scenes as well for example the kindergarten class unaffectedly improvising the Christmas play and Bergman showing off her pugilistic prowess to a boy beaten up in a fight.While I much prefer Bergman in her more outwardly seductive roles Notorious I can see why people wanted so much to see her as the glowing embodiment of good during WWII even though it is this image that was the harbinger when she was caught in an extramarital scandal with Roberto Rossellini five years later. Crosby always seems to be playing himself which in this case is a good thing. Henry Travers forever Clarence to me from Frank Capra's It's a Wonderful Life plays Bogardus with appropriate stubbornness and compromised regret and Joan Carroll the least prominent of the Smith daughters in Vincente Minnelli's Meet Me in St. Louis gives a solid performance as the conflicted Patsy. This is an understandably wellloved film even if it runs a bit too long.".

The only other ones that comes to mind are Godfather II and possibly Indy III The only thing missing from this sequel was Barry Fitzgerald but the pure grace of Ingrid Bergeman more than made up for the lack of Barry's Irish charm.  Bells seemed to flow more easily had some honest conflicts to resolve social promotion is still being argued today and an ending I felt was just perfect. It's not that I disliked Going My Way on the contrary but to me it was just a warm up to Bells.  Maybe after the tremendous success of the former Bing became more confidant in his portrayal of a priest and was able to play it to perfection. A great movie.".

The unconventional Father Charles Chuck O'Malley Bing Crosby is assigned to St. Mary's parish which includes a rundown innercity school building on the verge of being condemned. O'Malley is to recommend whether or not the school should be closed and the children sent to another school with modern facilities but the sisters feel that God will provide for them.They put their hopes in Horace P. Bogardus Henry Travers a businessman who has built a modern building next door to the school which they hope he will donate to them. Father O'Malley and the dedicated but stubborn Sister Superior Mary Benedict Ingrid Bergman both wish to save the school but their different views and methods often lead to disagreements. One disagreement involves a student Richard Tyler who is being bullied by another. A more serious one regards the promotion of an eighthgrade student Patsy Joan Carroll whom the parish has taken in while her mother Martha Sleeper attempts to get back on her feet.This film is exceptional. I just saw this for the first time last year and I was floored. I loved everything about this film. From the story itself to the casting. The is a little long and people with short attention spans will most likely be bored. If you love Christmas movies and Old Hollywood Movies then put this on your Must See List".

He claimed that Bing was cruel cold remote and both physically and psychologically abusive  such hard words to take in when one can be so deeply moved by his performances especially as a priest.His son Philip disputed his brother's claims writing  I loved him very much. He loved all of us too including Gary. He was a great father. It is Philip's words I prefer to believe for no man could give as much as his father did on the screen and it not come from his soul.Ingrid Bergman's face in TBOSM was very beautiful as though she came from heaven herself.

This time it's to a poor parish with a school that is in jeopardy of being closed. Can Bing charm everyone once again solve all the problems AND manage to make Jews Agnostics and Protestants not feel terribly uncomfortable?! The Bells of St. Mary's is an enjoyable film I am not denying that. However if you look at its score on IMDb you'd think it's about as good as its predecessor Going My Waywell it clearly isn't. There are so many reasons I prefer Going My Way and I fortunately was able to see both films only a couple weeks apart so my memory of each is clear. First the music in the first film is much betterand even had an Oscarwinning tune. While I didn't watch either for the music this is clearly better. Second I think the dynamic between Barry Fitzgerald and Bing Crosby was better as they were such opposite personalities. However apart from a few minor differences Ingrid Bergman and Crosby were practically members of each others' fan clubat least through the first 23 of the film. And finally the heart of my The Bells disappointed me was the unnecessary and completely contrived conflict that was tossed into their relationship near the never end of the filmplus it really made no sense at all. Bergman is diagnosed with TB and the Doctor tells Crosby to move her to an easier job that makes sense and NOT tell her she is sick what?!causing conflict that really should NOT have been there! It was unnecessary and really silly. As a result while I recommend it my recommendation is lukewarm and you do NOT need to see this if you've seen the first film. Good...not great.".

The magic they can make.  The Bells of St. Mary's' directed by Leo McCarey is a prime example a film that seemingly has all of the elements for success and while it's a decent movie with some heart in the story the presentation lacks that spark that would have made it truly memorable.  It's like wanting to settle in on a cold winter's night with a good steaming cup of hot chocolate if the chocolate's only warm tepid at best you're left with a promise of what could have been unfulfilled.  The story is fairly uncomplicated  St. Mary's school is in trouble it's old and facing condemnation and they haven't the money nor the resources to fix it.  There is however a new building being constructed on land adjacent to that of St. Mary's a building that would be perfect for a new school.  And it's the hope of Sister Benedict Ingrid Bergman the nun who runs the school that by some miracle Mr. Horace P. Bogardus Henry Travers owner of the new building will see fit to donate it to St. Mary's.  Toward that end she has been praying fervently.  She has not however contacted Mr. Bogardus who happens to want St. Mary's so that he can raze the school and put in a parking lot.  Enter Father Chuck O'Malley Bing Crosby who has been sent to St. Mary's to weigh the situation and ascertain whether or not it is feasible to keep the school afloat a fact he does not share with Sister Benedict.  As it is once he sees the condition of the school itself it's going to be a tough sell to keep it open.  It just may take that miracle Sister Benedict is praying for.A sequel to the Oscar winner for Best Picture of 1944 Going My Way' for which Crosby earned the Oscar for Best Actor McCarey for Director as well as writer for Original Story this one was greeted with some extremely high expectations.  And while McCarey was obviously trying his best to recapture that same spirit that made the first one so engaging he never quite seems to be able to ignite that same spark.  For one thing he doesn't have Barry Fitzgerald this time around.  Ingrid Bergman takes on the role of Father O'Malley's sparring partner which is another part of the problem.  Their conflict is simply not that pronounced coming down to a slightly different philosophy as to how to run the school and how strict the guidelines should be for the students.  It just seems rather insignificant in the grand scheme of things if even half the problems we face in life were thus we would call this place in which we live Paradise.There's a touch of melodrama to the story but mostly it's just mellow drama.  Even at it's darkest point the situation at St. Mary's still seems comparatively like a lazy day at the park.  And it's the result of McCarey's moderationinallthings approach.  He tries to convey how bad the situation is without wanting to make it too' bad.  The only real spunk in the film comes during a scene in which Sister Benedict gives a boxing lesson to a student named Eddie Richard Tyler who turns out to have a mean right hook in him.  There's also a scene near the beginning in which Father O'Malley introduces himself to the nuns that is mildly amusing.  Other than these the magic lays fairly dormant throughout.Crosby picks up the character of Father O'Malley without missing a beat but in doing so he gives new definition to the phrase Laid back.'  A real pipeandslipper part Bing makes the good Father believable but so easy going that his main purpose seems to be facilitating the progress of the story.  He does manage to work in a couple of songs Aren't You Glad You're You' and The Bells of St. Mary's' but his easy manner and McCarey's diluted approach to the material make this a less than absorbing experience.Ingrid Bergman does a good job of bringing Sister Benedict to life did she ever give a bad' performance in anything? but she has a hard time breaking free of the stereotypical mold of the nun in which McCarey seems bent on placing her especially when attempting to exploit her natural beauty by setting her up in a number of frieze' type shots seemingly meant to establish her purity in all things.  Not a bad ploy perhaps but less than effective consider for example how much more of an impact Lilia Skala's nun in Lilies of the Field' had.  Still capturing Bergman's classic beauty in these shots does provide for some reflective moments even if it compromises the drama somewhat.  Depth of character it seems was not what McCarey was striving for here and unfortunately his methods give something of a superficial sheen to the film.The supporting cast includes William Gargan Patsy's Father Martha Sleeper Mrs. Gallagher Joan Carroll Patsy Ruth Donnelly Sister Michael Rhys Williams Dr. McKay and the always delightful Una O'Connor Mrs. Breen.  A pleasant enough movie but less than involving The Bells of St. Mary's' will be a satisfying experience for those of moderate tastes but for those seeking the kind of drama to which they can really connect it will be less than fulfilling.  Overall coming on the heels of Going My Way' and with stars like Crosby and Bergman on hand it makes a promise to which it never quite lives up.  I rate this one 610.".

	schema:reviewBody "Made first but released after Going My Way! An episodic story about a failing Catholic Elementary School. Father O'Malley Bing Crosby again comes to the rescue as the tireless and optimistic priest sent from the home office to access the situation and get things right. Ingrid plays the tomboyish head sister that runs the school which curiously doesn't appear to be attached directly to a church. It stands alone. All the lower grade Catholic schools I have ever known were always attached or next to a church nearby. The villain in the piece is played by noneother than the actor that played the Angel Clarence in It's a Wonderful Life. He owns the new office building next door and wants to tear down the old crumbling school for his parking lot. The sisters are praying for a miracle that the new building will become their new school. Of course that is exactly what happens when he literally has a change of heart. Very well written but not very different from Going My Way. No real blockbuster songs except that The Bells of St.Mary's was recorded by Bing with entirely different lyrics and became a standard in it's time. Some of the events remind my a lot of other similar films like The Trouble with Angels made decades later. Like Going My Way a bit long but worth it. The ending is a real tearjerker as Ingrid finds out that she is being transferred out not because she failed or upset Father O'Malley but because she is sick and needs to get better. Almost outofprint. It was publicdomain for a while and even colorized but it's just fine in black and white.".

	schema:reviewBody "Although your previous reviewer did a thorough job I have to disagree that the film seems insignificant in the greater scheme of things. What is film for? It is to entertain and not to delve into the meaning of life. This film is powerful! It packs a greater punch if you happen to be a Christian but if you don't it's still going to inspire you. Ingrid Bergman's strong character stamps itself on all her roles and this is no exception. She is not at first disturbed by the arrival of a seemingly harmless new priest. But when she discovers that his mission is to tell the nuns that their school's repairs simply cannot be afforded and that they will have to close the school well then she starts to show her determination. Horace P. Bogardus wants the school site for a car park for his new business building but after Bergman has finished with him with help from prayer of course! he ends up by giving the building itself to the nuns as a new school. It also changes Bogardus from being a selfish angry moneygrabbing man to being a kind generous and loving Christian. Altogether the film is a lesson in true selflessness and shows what it is to have a heart. In this respect it's far better than films that have tried to do the same thing  such as Sound of Music which is horribly treacly by comparison. The nuns in Bells of St Mary's are much more believable. I urge anyone who may be feeling grumpy to see this film! There's also a gem of a scene in which Ingrid Bergman teaches one of the boys how to defend himself from bullies  she buys a book on boxing and tutors him with amazing consequences. Though supposed to be a sequel to Going My Way Bells ended up by being the more remembered of the two and stands alone. For this most of the credit goes to Ingrid Bergman.

The print was a nearly perfect digital copy of the rapidly decaying nitrate negative and the entire experience was a onceinalifetime chance to see a silent film as it was meant to be seen.This was Greta Garbo's first American film.  She was only 20 years old but already had 6 Swedish films in her repertoire.It is somewhat ironic that this is a silent film about an opera star even though the Mighty Wurlitzer added immensely to the miseenscene it was necessary to leave much to the imagination.Modern audiences for the most part do not understand silent films Acting was different then with expansive gestures and broad facial expressions. Therefore audiences laugh at inappropriate times  the acting is seen as hammy' and overdone  but it was simply the style of the period.Garbo with all her subtlety did much to usher in the new age of acting she could say more with a halfclosed eye and volumes could be read into a downward glance or a simple shrug.  She exemplifies the truism that a picture is worth a thousand words.'Even though this is Garbo's first American film it is pretty obvious the studio knew what they had on their hands  This was MGM filmmaking at its best.  The sets and costumes were magnificent.  The special effects  which by today's standards are pretty feeble  were still electrifying and amazing.The script by Vicente Blasco Ibanez from the novel by Entre Naranjos would seem to be tailor made for Garbo it showcases her strengths magnifies her assets and there is no pesky language problem to deal with  a Swedish actress can play a Spanish temptress with no suspension of disbelief on our part.Her costar was MGM's answer to Rudolph Valentino  Ricardo Cortez.  He does an admirable job and did something that few romantic stars of the day ever would have done in a film  allow himself to look unnactractive appear foolish and to grow old ungracefully.There are some fairly good character parts that are more than adequately acted  especially when you consider the powerhouse that was Garbo. Notable among them are Lucien Littlefield as Cupido' and Martha Mattox as Doa Bernarda Brull.'This is when the extraordinary cinematographer William H. Daniels met Garbo  they went on to make 20 films together. He was the cinematographer on 157 films and his career spanned five decades!  He was able to capture her ethereal beauty and it was his photography that was primarily responsible for the moniker by which she became known  The Divine Garbo. Without his magnificent abilities she would not have been the success that she was.Seeing this film is an alltoorare opportunity  if you ever have the chance do not miss it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Garbo's first two films were adaptations of Ibanez novels.  This first TORRENT fares much better than the second THE TEMPTRESS.  The latter was overlong and uninteresting giving Garbo little to do but stand around and look seductive until her last scene when she is finally allowed to act. Here in TORRENT she is in total command from beginning to end and as convincing as a Spanish peasant girl all innocent and loving as she is portraying a famous diva.She and Ricardo Cortez are in love but he is a landowner and his mother forbids the alliance causing the young girl's family to be ousted from their home.  The father takes his daughter off to Paris where her trained voice she had been taking lessons from the local barber is sure to be a hit.  Mother is left behind. Cortez gets his second chance when the famous La Brunna Garbo returns to her home to see her mother and entice Cortez yet again.  He fails to win her and she leaves.  As she is about to depart for America he visits her again but again he fails to have the courage to break his mother's heart and marry against her wishes.The only thing difficult to sustain us through all this is that Garbo still loves him although he is obviously a weakwilled motherdominated man. Garbo is radiant and totally believable throughout.The film holds up well despite some plot problems.  Why did the moneyed and successful La Brunna allow her mother to continue to live in poverty as a charwoman?  Why is everyone in the home town so dim as to not figure out how La Brunna got her wealth until the confrontation scene where even Garbo's mother rejects her for being a bad woman? She does have a wonderful scene when confronted by Cortez she blames him for her state since his initial rejection of her led her to her current path for survival.Despite these bits of unbelievability this tale of lost love and bittersweet romance plays well.  In Garbo's first two films she was paired with latin hopefuls Ricardo Cortez and Antonio Moreno.  Neither could hold their own against her although Cortez is memorable here in the last scenes as an older broken man.TCM shows a tinted print using four tones sepia blue lavender red with a fine orchestral score and sound effects.  The new score is by Arthur Barrow.  There is some obvious deterioration in some of the title cards. The special effects of a dam breaking during a rain storm and the torrent gaining on two characters in a boat are quite well done.  Another dam breaks in THE TEMPTRESS Ibanez was fond of this device no doubt.Garbo wears two wonderful creations  a striped chinchilla outfit and a harlequin outfit.  There is a brief kissing scene where Cortez is prone and she takes the active on top position  this was to be repeated in FLESH AND THE DEVIL with John Gilbert.All in all this tale of honor love and the importance of being true to oneself is well done  the double irony at the end is quite poignant.Recommended for all not just Garbo fans.".

	schema:reviewBody "Greta Garbo's American film debut is an analogy of how our lives can be swept off course by fate and our actions as in a torrent causing us to lose a part of ourselves along the way.Greta plays Leonora a poor peasant girl in love with Ricardo Cortez's character Don Rafael a landowner. Ricardo is in love with her too but is too easily influenced by his domineering mother. Leonora ends up homeless and travels to Paris where she becomes a famous opera singer and develops the reputation for being a loose woman. In reality part of her attitude is bitterness over Rafael's abandonment.She returns to her home to visit her family and eventually confronts Rafael. Surprisingly no one knows that she's the famous La Brunna and Garbo acts up her role as the diva she truly was and re prised with such cool haughtiness in her later portrayals.Ricardo Cortez reminds one a lot of Valentino in looks in this part and he was groomed to be a Valentino clone by MGM though he never thought he could be in reality and he was right. He is believable in an unsympathetic part as a weak willed Mama's boy and allows himself to age realistically but comically at the end of the movie. He fails to win Leonora when she returns home and later when he follows her his courage is undermined.This movie is beautifully shot with brilliant storm sequences and the sets depicting Spain at the time are authentic looking. There are also some fine secondary performances by old timers Lucien Littlefield Tully Marshall and Mack Swain.Although this is a story of lost love and missed chances I don't think Leonora and Rafael would have been happy together as he needed a more traditional wife and she was very much a career woman and I don't think would have been happy in a small village. The ending is true to life and pulls no punches.See this one as Garbo's American film debut and a precursor of things to come".

There is one erotic shot in particular in which leading man Ricardo Cortez lays in the lap of Garbo that clearly provided the inspiration for the now legendary love scene with Garbo and John Gilbert in Flesh and the Devil. The exteriors during the flood scene rival those shot in The Temptress. Altogether great casting tremendous special effects and an actress who captivated the moviegoing public then as now make for an early work in the development of a film icon that surprises and delights.

A native from Sweden with Peter the Tramp 1922 The Story of Gosta Berling 1924 and The Street of Sorrow 1925 and a few others to her screen credit Garbo's introduction to the American screen casts her as a Spanish peasant girl with operatic talent. It is she who makes her screen presence prior to Cortez's introduction wearing beret riding his horse like a dashing hero but by the film's end it would be Garbo whom audiences and critics remembered best of all. With first impressions being vital for newcomers to the screen TORRENT became the turning point for an actress whose name would become legendary.

His mother Dona Bernarda Martha Mattox has other plans for her son none having to do with his proposed marriage to Leonora. Because she holds a mortgage on the Moreno farm Bernarda arranges for Don Andres Tully Marshall to have Leonora and her parents Pedro Edward Connelly and Dona Pepa Lucy Beaumont. Homeless Thank God for tragedy. It forces us to go forward replies Pedro Leonora relocates to Paris with her father while her mother remains behind earning a living scrubbing floors. Before leaving Leonora sends a note for Rafael to meet with her but his mother who doesn't want her to disgrace the family name forbids him to ever see her again an argument that forces Rafael to tear up Leonora's note and throwing it into a pig sty. As for Leonora she learns the truth and leaves without saying goodbye. Years later Leonora whose father has since died has become the renowned opera singer La Brunna the idol of Paris with Salvatti Arthur Edmund Carewe as her mentor while Rafael rises from deputy to a political career with Remedios Matias Gertrude Olmstead a new romantic interest whom mother approves. Longing to return to her old village and see her mother Leonora meets with Rafael once again leading to further developments including a disastrous rain storm a dam burst leading to a severe flood causing destruction to the town and worse the interference of Rafael's mother in keeping the two lovers apart by demeaning her good name.Ricardo Cortez reportedly born Jacob Kranz in Vienna Austria is quite convincing as a Spaniard though one wonders what current heartthrob Rudolph Valentono might have done with his role in this MGM production? There are times Cortez resembles Valentino which was probably intentional. Interestingly as Cortez's character is allowed to age through the passage of time the one of Garbo's does not at least not much. Their characters very much in love equally balanced with ambition to succeed only to realize success means nothing in their separate lives. The flood sequences midway through the story is well constructed for its time but unlike other disaster movies this one doesn't up enough time to turn this 88 minute production into a two hour spectacular.For Garbo's initial Hollywood role her physical presence appears more like the current style of either Norma Shearer or a Carol Dempster. Regardless of hairstyle and trend the Garbo technique is evident especially during its latter part of the story. Others members of the cast include Mack Swain most notable for his work opposite Charlie Chaplin in 1925s THE GOLD RUSH as Olmstead's father the pork king who loves his hogs Lillian Leighton as Isabella and Mario Carrillo as The King of Spain.Seldom shown since its initial premiere THE TORRENT was finally brought back in circulation when cable television's Turner Classic Movies premiered this rare find on June 8 1997 with new score composed by Arthur Barron. The orchestration is fine depicting the culture and background of Spain but not something one's accustomed to by way of organ or piano accompaniment which really isn't a bad thing in this case though. THE TORRENT may not live much to its title but Garbo certainly lives up to her promise as MGM's latest addition to its cavalcade of stars. ".

It was also the last time that someone else was billed above her in the credits that being her leading man her Ricardo Cortez.Torrent is based on the popular Spanish writer's Vicente Blasco Ibanez's work Entre Naranjos. It concerns a pair of mismatched lovers Garbo and Cortez who can't quite get together mostly due to the machinations of Cortez's mother Marta Mattox. Mattox is a wicked woman who has some set ideas about who her son should be marrying. Remember this is Spain and such arranged marriages were still even in those times quite proper. Mattox has Gertrude Olmstead in mind as a daughterinlaw she's the offspring of Mack Swain a man grown rich in hog raising. Swain provides a few moments of comic relief with his tender concern for the piglets before they grow into big old hogs to be butchered.Blasco Ibanez had previous novels The Four Horseman Of The Apocalypse and Blood And Sand previously filmed with Rudolph Valentino in the lead. It might have been interesting if Valentino had done this one with Garbo but he might have been beyond film making when this was done. In any event one of the Valentino wannabes Ricardo Cortez fills in with the male lead.One reason Valentino might not have wanted this film is because clearly the lead character is Garbo's unlike the other two works previously mentioned. When she gets done dirt by Cortez who is doing what Mattox and her 'adviser' banker Tully Marshall tell her she leaves Spain and goes to France where she becomes a great opera star. And leads quite the scandalous life there.When she returns to Spain and tries to rekindle things Mattox is even more outraged. She has a political career in mind for her son. Cortez is now running for the Spanish Parliament which curiously enough is called the Cortes. The title refers to a flood and a dam breaking causing all kinds of havoc in the countryside. Cortez in fact braves the Torrent in a row boat trying to rescue Garbo from harm's way. When they do get together they have a brutally frank discussion the brutality coming from Garbo.The special effects here primitive though they seem now are quite remarkable for their time. They look very similar to the shots used in 20th Century Fox's The Rains Came that came out in 1939 and that won an Oscar for Special Effects. Unfortunately for Torrent it came out one year before Oscar made his debut.I'm not going to give any endings away so you'll have to see the film to find out if Cortez and Garbo get together in the end. Garbo rightly won rave reviews for her performance and in an age when exaggerated gestures was the norm in silent screen acting she was remarkably subtle in her role. So she would be the rest of her career she had a remarkable face for closeups.Although Greta Garbo would go on to do far better work than Torrent this film is still a fitting debut for her on the American big screen and holds up very well for today's audience.".

It simply looks beautifuleven 84 years later.As for Garbo herself like her other very early American films she too looks different. While she's quite recognizable her makeup is much softer than it would become just a year latergiving her a less severe look and a gentleness about her you just didn't see in subsequent films. I kind of wish they'd kept this look but considering how famous she'd become with the trademark look who am I to say they shouldn't have gone that route?! The film is about Garbo and how she and her family are unfairly forced off their land by the landlord. While the landlady the much esteemed Doa Bernarda claims it's because the bank has demanded payment it's because her son has fallen for Garboand what better way to get rid of her than to force them out on the streets! Nice lady huh?! Years pass and by now Garbo has become a new singing sensation who is worldfamous. When she returns to her hometown years later her old boyfriend who HAD promised to marry her but wimped out when his mother Doa Bernarda refused to allow it sees her. His new love for another lady is now testedwill he be content to marry this lady who is the heir to a huge pig fortune or will he want his old flame? And more importantly will Garbo even take him back after he behaved so spinelessly? In the meantime a huge rainstorm hits. The land begins to flood and homes soon are being washed away by the deluge. Cortez and a friend make a mad dash as the dam breaks! In a scene where they obviously superimposed his row boat over the cascading stream he eventually makes it out alive and to the home where Garbo is now staying. She welcomes them inside and they stay with her until the storm passes. Then he admits that he still loves her and had braved the storm to make sure that she was safe. She tells him to get lost! Next you see Ricardo about to get married to his second choice the daughter of the Pork King. He obviously has little enthusiasm for thisand you feel sorry for the lady as she did nothing wrong. Soon Cortez is seen wandering back to Garbo's homehe's lovesick and needs her. In this scene Garbo is quite luminous and can't tell him to leaveas they dissolve in each other's arms. Once again he tells her of his love for her.When Doa Bernarda learns of this she is not pleased. Evidently a Pork Queen is a better catch than an internationally known singer. Because of the meddling of this nasty old lady Garbo leavesunwilling to come between the mother and her wimpy son. But Cortez comes runningannouncing he MUST have her and won't rest until he has her as his wife. Moments after making this proclamation a family friend talks to Cortez and convinces him to give her up for the good of his career and reputation. So much for won't rest until he has her for his wife huh?! Despite Cortez being a wimp through and through for some reason she cannot bring herself to hate him. And so he marries the Pork Queen and lives a very dull life. When years later Garbo meets Cortez again he is a dull looking middleaged manwhile she is as beautiful as ever. And not surprisingly she tells him once again to get lost.At the time this film was made Garbo was not a star in the US and Cortez was. So in light of this it's surprising they gave Cortez such an unlikable character to play. Instead of the usual confident Valentinolike role they'd been giving him here he is an indecisive wimpa HUGE wimp. And from here on his career was on a slow downward spiral. As for Garbo the role helped establish her as a big staras she was THE focus of the film and played a character much like her later personas.As for the film the new music composed for it was very nice though a tad repetitive. The print oddly was nearly perfect throughout except for the intertitle cardswhich could use some restoration.A most enjoyable filmexpertly constructed wistful and worth seeing. And for one of the few times I can think of it I have no real complaints in this excellent film.".

She did not speak a word of English so she must have found it difficult to work also Ricardo Cortez did not make it very easy for her.The torrent of the title is the river Juscar that winds through a sleepy little village in Spain. Leonora Greta Garbo hopes someday that her voice will bring great wealth and happiness to her struggling parents. Leonora and Don Rafael Ricardo Cortez are in love but he is under his mother's thumb and cannot get her to consent to his marriage. Meanwhile Dona Brull Martha Mattox has evicted Leonora's parents from their home and they send Leonora to Paris hoping to give her a chance to further her singing career. Leonora sends a note to Rafael urging him to remember his promise and come with her. His mother is enraged and forbids him to go  so of course he caves in to her request.Years pass. Leonora has a new identity  she has become La Brunna the toast of the Paris Opera. Rafael has turned out just as his mother wished  he is running for office and is courting a safe young girl Remedios Gertrude Olmstead who is a hog heiress. Mack Swain plays her father. Leonora decides to visit her old home and I agree  why hasn't she helped her mother out. Her mother is still living at the family home working as a skivvy and taking in washing. Leonora and Rafael meet but Leonora is full of ridicule. Garbo is so enchantingly beautiful it is hard to believe that he could be happy with Remedios.The dam is bursting and the torrent is flooding the town. Leonora's house is in the path of the raging river but when Rafael attempts to rescue her he finds she is quite safe. They then rekindle their romance. There is a horizontal love scene in this film very similar to the one in Flesh and the Devil.Dona Brull goes spreading gossip about how Leonora really got her wealth and Leonora's mother believes her and tells Leonora to go. Rafael meets Leonora just before she is about to tour America. Again he intends to go with her but again he lets her down. He spends so much time listening to other people destroy her reputation  what will she do for you but drag you down. The irony is she has just secured a top government job for him if he comes with her. They meet again years later  she is as fresh and vibrant as ever  he looks older than his years bowed down by mediocrity.It is certainly a good film with a positive message to follow your heart.Lucien Littlefield does a good job as Cupido the barber and Leonora's old and faithful friend.Highly Recommended.".

The three main characters of the movie have already proved themselves in Turkey but I think the little girl is also likely to hit the big time when she grows up. The incidents are quite realistic and the general setting is fabulous. It's easy to spend loads of money and make an FXoriented film but pretty tough to make a film dealing with social issues. I've hardly seen one single frame that fails to do the second in this one. Some people might find the conversations between the man and the girl a little overextended and that's the only negative thing I can find about the film in general.

	schema:reviewBody "June 1987. Lille in the North of France. Two families live in this big town. On one hand the Le Quesnoy a wealthy family. The father is the manager of EDF the mother stays at home and the children are well brought up. On the other hand the Groseille a poor family who lives in a small flat. The father took part in the Algerian War the mother is listless and the children are delinquents. Apparently these two families have got nothing in common. However twelve years ago two children have been exchanged by a nurse who was left by her lover. They will be given back to their real families..... .....and it won't be easy. It's Etienne Chatiliez's first film and it's very successful. The description of the two families is satirical  and it never falls into the caricature. The Le Quesnoy are never showing signs of conceit or hypocrisy they're even a bit ridiculous. The movie is very strong thanks to its actors who are mostly incredible of course the main actors Hlne Vincent won the Csar for the best actress in 1989. Her portrait and some of her words are irresistible it's monday it's raviolis. Benoit Magimel who fits well in the role of Maurice. He's smart and impish. But the minor actors too Patrick Bouchitey in his role of ecclesiastic The scene in which he sings Jsus reviens etc... during a party is absolutely brillant and funny Daniel Glin a wistful doctor and a wicked lover. At last the screenplay is full of little details or words that score the bull's eye. The best example is when Bernadette's spreading her soup on the table during a dinner which means that she doesn't belong to her family circle. To sum up one of the funniest movies of the eighties.".

	schema:reviewBody "To me this movie was all about how life is not a long tranquil river. Anyone can disturb the peace by a simple action like the nurse did first by switching the children and later writing to the parents about it. To her it was just an act of revenge towards the doctor but the consequences were not limited to the doctor. Etienne Chatillier pokes fun at many different issues throughout the movie which is meant to be a comedy. Americans without knowledge of all these issues as well as the play on words and other humor aimed at the French will not enjoy it to its full extent. Nevertheless anyone will laugh at the doctor swearing scene. La salopeMost of the characters seem to be very stereotypical  the Arab shopkeeper the poor family the policemen the doctor the rich family. In fact the only truly realistic character is Mmo. His many sided character sometimes puzzles the audience. His romantic love for his biological mother his stealing to help his other family his spite in revealing the truth to Bernadette his friendships with the children in both families and his childishness create a curious mlange. In addition to these basic characters there is also the priest. He is used to criticize the church and religion in general. Parenting and upbringing of children is an important theme in this film. The children in the rich family are very polite intelligent religious etc. while the children in the poor family act stupid are rude and naughty. I noticed that this difference in upbringing was not really substantial because when Mmo became part of the family and introduced naughty ideas the rich children just followed along with enthusiasm. The way they were convinced so easily shows that their parents hadn't ingrained their education into the children. The only reason why they hadn't done the naughty things before was that they hadn't heard of such ideas. Once Mmo supplied them they dropped all pretence of a higher education morals etc. and followed along.The rich parents' method of dealing with the problems was heavily criticized in the movie. When Bernadette purposefully spilled the soup at the table they just sat there in silence. They continue using this approach and we see how the children only get wilder and wilder unrestrained and with no solution in sight.I felt that the ending scene fitted in with the movie really well. It summed up the idea that so many problems arise when one person simply pursues their goal not stopping at anything. The satisfied nurse sitting victorious with the doctor completely broken. And this right after seeing how the rich family completely fell apart. A cruel type of humor. La vie est un long fleuve tranquille is not an American comedy. There are few slapstick moments. Nevertheless I think many Americans would enjoy this movie. I would definitely appreciate watching it once more.".

	schema:headline " A very special comedy about family classes and twisted love...";
	schema:reviewBody "Life is a Long Quiet River what a magnificently poetic title it doesn't give much hints about the story except the essential it's about life what happens what is under our control and the bad we take with the good. That a comedy would inspire such profound thoughts says a lot about the 80's comedies were more mature and clever eager to tell a good story with a few laughs rather than a laughriot that falls flat.Etienne Chatillez who showed his talent as a directorwriter of sociologicallythemed movies signed his first little masterpiece about family and clash of classes. Life is a Long Quiet River is about two families that couldn't have been more opposite the Duquesnois and the Groseilles. There's a reality about large families you've got to be either very rich or very poor to afford many children and that's exactly the demographic categories the two families fit in. The Duquesnois are the typical Catholic bourgeois with very straitlaced parents sending their children to private school where they can be taught catechism and good manners. The Groseilles exemplify the 'Beaufs' archetypes people of modest social upbringing loudmouth vulgar crass greedy and no they don't have a good heart the film is above these patronizing clichs. It is true that the Groseilles seem more fun but the Duquesnois aren't ridiculed and that's the first hint of the film's intelligence it doesn't need to make fun of the characters they behave naturally and the comedic situations naturally emerge from the story. One of the most memorable moments is the iconic Jesus come back song that has nothing ridiculous about it but because it's set within the context of a comedy and because the priest played by Patrick Bouchitey is so passionately into the music the scene has become a staple of French comedy proof that it's all about a good timing. And timing is what the main plot is about a Doctor dismisses his mistress also his nurse during his wife's funeral indifferent to her cleavage delicately hidden behind black lace. So she takes her revenge and reveals the truth behind that fateful Christmas night twelve years before where he rejected her one time too many and she switched the two Duquesnois and Groseille newborns. As the doctor said they wouldn't start life with the same chances and I wonder if Chatillez wasn't inspired by that scene in Once Upon a Time in America where the gangsters switch babies and James Woods' character says something like We're better than fate. Some we give the good life others we give it up the ass. That nurse indeed played a dirty trick and the reaction of the doctor Daniel Gelin is a classic he repeats the bitch word several times and it's so cruel we never feel the word is repeated enough it is realistic yet funny. And now let's make a pause here you have the premise two babies switched at birth how are you going to work on that? Any lesser comedy would have gone to the obvious Trading Places format and the film would have gone for cheap gags based on lousy comedy of contrasts between the rich and the poor people overused at the expense of realism and common sense. But Chatillez thinks realistically and doesn't go for the obvious to make the audience laugh he cares for his characters a little more and that's the respect a director owes his audience. So he asks the simple question what would a poor family do if they knew their boy was connected to a rich one? And why would a girl raised in wealth and comfort be transferred to a lesser standard of life? The film reveals its genius in one of its most famous shots.Momo Groseille who should have been Maurice Duquesnois has just been told the truth he's played by a young Benoit Magimel and he's obviously startled by the news he looks at his family staring at him like the new outsider but then he recovers from the surprise and in the most deadpan and natural way says that they can make money out of it. And as to make up for the 'loss' of Momo the Duquesnois give money to the Groseilles the father Andr Wilms is no fool he knows what the Groseilles are into but he does it for Momo's good and this is the best thing about the film it has a sweetness of its own. And it paints a very touching family portrait of the two families and perhaps the most touching character is Marielle Duquesnois the mother played by Hlne Vincent.I don't think I have enough kind words for her but she's a sweet and responsible mother who cares for her children telling them that Momo was adopted not to upset Bernadette who is the Groseilles' daughter. The movie doesn't focus much on Bernadette except on some specially heartbreaking moments where she meets her family and when she tries to escape the film tactfully tries not to make fun of all the situations and reckons the dramatic potential of the story. A similar moment occurs when Momo watches his mother in the bathroom. And he's like hypnotized he feels in love this is not a love of lust but of unconscious Oedipal attraction and it's understandable as long as we accept that she's not supposed to be his mother but the scene shows that Chatillez pushes his concept as far as he can as long as it feels real which it does.Chatillez makes a little rushed out third act concluding with a series of disjointed events showing that the experience changed the two families there's a feeling of unfinished result that might disconcert the viewers but after all the story didn't have to have a proper ending just like a long quiet river doesn't have to end somewhere".

	onyx:emotionText "Life is a Long Quiet River what a magnificently poetic title it doesn't give much hints about the story except the essential it's about life what happens what is under our control and the bad we take with the good. That a comedy would inspire such profound thoughts says a lot about the 80's comedies were more mature and clever eager to tell a good story with a few laughs rather than a laughriot that falls flat.Etienne Chatillez who showed his talent as a directorwriter of sociologicallythemed movies signed his first little masterpiece about family and clash of classes. Life is a Long Quiet River is about two families that couldn't have been more opposite the Duquesnois and the Groseilles. There's a reality about large families you've got to be either very rich or very poor to afford many children and that's exactly the demographic categories the two families fit in. The Duquesnois are the typical Catholic bourgeois with very straitlaced parents sending their children to private school where they can be taught catechism and good manners. The Groseilles exemplify the 'Beaufs' archetypes people of modest social upbringing loudmouth vulgar crass greedy and no they don't have a good heart the film is above these patronizing clichs. It is true that the Groseilles seem more fun but the Duquesnois aren't ridiculed and that's the first hint of the film's intelligence it doesn't need to make fun of the characters they behave naturally and the comedic situations naturally emerge from the story. One of the most memorable moments is the iconic Jesus come back song that has nothing ridiculous about it but because it's set within the context of a comedy and because the priest played by Patrick Bouchitey is so passionately into the music the scene has become a staple of French comedy proof that it's all about a good timing. And timing is what the main plot is about a Doctor dismisses his mistress also his nurse during his wife's funeral indifferent to her cleavage delicately hidden behind black lace. So she takes her revenge and reveals the truth behind that fateful Christmas night twelve years before where he rejected her one time too many and she switched the two Duquesnois and Groseille newborns. As the doctor said they wouldn't start life with the same chances and I wonder if Chatillez wasn't inspired by that scene in Once Upon a Time in America where the gangsters switch babies and James Woods' character says something like We're better than fate. Some we give the good life others we give it up the ass.

	schema:reviewBody "I think we have some sort of record. The steps needed for the criminals in this movie to succeed are1 Jodie deciding to go to the states on the same airplane as her dead husbands coffin. 2 An accomplice at the checkin who deletes any record of the daughters ticket. 3 that jodie chooses to be the first onboard  otherwise some of the other families with children might notice the child when she boards. 4 That the flight attendant doesn't notice the child when they board. 5 That the child stays hidden for three hours of flight. 6 That Jodie decides to sleep in the back of the plane with her child so the kidnappers can whisk her away in the troll. Had Jodie and the child stayed in their seats the kidnapping would have been impossible.Improbable as this seems the plot holes's just getting started. Now we need Jodie not just going amok but escaping to do another feat Remember how an airport security guy at the beginning of the movie tells Jodie she needs to lock the casket with a code for security reasons? apparently in this alternate reality any coffin can get by airport security because 'coffins aren't xrayed'. It seems the criminal actually needs to get hold of and move the explosives hidden in the coffin so he can blow up the child in the front of the plane to cover the fact that she was onboard i guess. So now the scheme of the criminals hinges on 1 Jodie goes to the bathroom crawls up a trap door shortcircuits the lights uses the confusion to get to the basement opens the coffin keeps the lid up and lets her self be caught.I didn't understand this at first thinking that the writers couldn't be that idiotic but why else set up the idea of a digitally locked casket? She it seems has to open it! And when this setup is complete the criminal only has to convince the captain that this crazy mother is a terrorist whos suddenly gotten hold of a detonator for a bomb.I think the writing is in many ways intriguing. I fail to remember any movie with a plot quite so convoluted. Please respond if you can think of any.Yours truly Lars".

The steps needed for the criminals in this movie to succeed are1 Jodie deciding to go to the states on the same airplane as her dead husbands coffin. 2 An accomplice at the checkin who deletes any record of the daughters ticket. 3 that jodie chooses to be the first onboard  otherwise some of the other families with children might notice the child when she boards. 4 That the flight attendant doesn't notice the child when they board. 5 That the child stays hidden for three hours of flight. 6 That Jodie decides to sleep in the back of the plane with her child so the kidnappers can whisk her away in the troll. Had Jodie and the child stayed in their seats the kidnapping would have been impossible.Improbable as this seems the plot holes's just getting started. Now we need Jodie not just going amok but escaping to do another feat Remember how an airport security guy at the beginning of the movie tells Jodie she needs to lock the casket with a code for security reasons? apparently in this alternate reality any coffin can get by airport security because 'coffins aren't xrayed'. It seems the criminal actually needs to get hold of and move the explosives hidden in the coffin so he can blow up the child in the front of the plane to cover the fact that she was onboard i guess. So now the scheme of the criminals hinges on 1 Jodie goes to the bathroom crawls up a trap door shortcircuits the lights uses the confusion to get to the basement opens the coffin keeps the lid up and lets her self be caught.I didn't understand this at first thinking that the writers couldn't be that idiotic but why else set up the idea of a digitally locked casket? She it seems has to open it! And when this setup is complete the criminal only has to convince the captain that this crazy mother is a terrorist whos suddenly gotten hold of a detonator for a bomb.I think the writing is in many ways intriguing. I fail to remember any movie with a plot quite so convoluted. Please respond if you can think of any.Yours truly Lars";

	schema:reviewBody "I have never seen a more stupid plot than in this movie. How to get 10 million ? Very simple just do like thisMake sure you have a job as a security officer on an airplane. Then you find a woman who is an aircraft engineer who has a husband and a child and who lives in a city away from her home country and who when flying home will certainly use an airline that uses the type of aircraft of which she is the expert engineer. Are you still with me? Next you throw her husband from a high building your bribe the local morgue director to put a bomb in the coffin and to write a false declaration that the deceased's child was also in the morgue dead. You get a stewardess accomplish to corrupt the passenger list of the flight that the woman with her child are going to take to bring the husband home. By some kind of hypnosis you prevent all flight passengers to see the woman's child on board. During the night when they are asleep you pick the child from its seat without the child or mother waking up and without anybody noticing it. Simple because everybody sleeps like a log in in the economy class. The woman runs amok when she misses her child whom everybody denies that it was on board. You tell the captain that she threatens to blow up the plane if the airline doesn't wire 10 million  to your bank account. That money transfer of course is done within an hour. Fortunately at the end everything goes well for the good guys the child is saved and the bad guy is blown up in the plane. Interesting to hear that airline staff in a foreign city have the power to arrest morgue directors.I am extremely disappointed that my heroes Sean Bean and Jody Foster take part in this nonsense. If only it had been intended to be a comedy with Leslie Nielsen I could have appreciated it. It is laughable so bad.".

	schema:headline " Flightplan Falls Apart";
	schema:reviewBody "Flightplan is a psychological thriller that takes place almost entirely on an airborn jumbo jet en route to New York from Berlin. Jodie Foster plays Kyle a mother who find that her daughter is missing after awaking from a nap. The jet also carries Kyle's husband who recently died and rests in his casket in the cargo hold below. Kyle becomes increasingly frantic as she searches the plane for her daughter without success. The crew becomes adversarial writing her off as a loony when they check the flight manifesto and find no record of her daughter ever being on board. Thus enters the psychological component of the film. Not only is the audience confused as to what has happened but Kyle after speaking with an onboard psychiatrist also begins to have doubts about her own psychological stability in the wake of her husband's death. No one is sure what to believe until a subtle clue jolts Foster back to reality and back to her MacGuyver like maneuvers to attempt to recover her lost daughter.It's an interesting premise and oddly similar to Foster's previous film Panic Room in which her maternal character is forced into a confined space with no outlet. In keeping with most of Foster's performances she plays a strongwilled intelligent woman who overcomes difficult circumstances. As expected Foster delivers and pulls the audience into the story. I was disappointed however. Foster has more to offer than Flightplan is capable of giving her. Flightplan while entertaining remains among those psychologicalthrillrides that are only as successful as their audience is unsuccessful in knowing the truth during the course of the film. To achieve this the film has to throw a slew of false leads and suspicious looking characters into early shots in order to have the audience questioning.I'm not fond of this technique. It's possible to keep the audience in suspense and guessing without trickery. To me this degrades the integrity of a storyline.I was pulled in by the impressive marketing campaign of Flightplan and went to theaters excited. The film lived up to the aesthetic advertised  a slick blue hue that reminds the audience of the snowfall in Berlin the death of a husband and father and the unfortunate and unforgiving circumstances that have befallen Kyle and her young daughter. And while this makes for a very sleek looking film in the end the fantastical convoluted storyline cannot be realistically reconciled. I left the theater feeling somewhat cheated. While I realize it was a story and therefore ought to be granted a liberal amount of leniency when it comes to plausibility Flightplan went to far outside the realm of conceivability. There were too many factors that had to conspire in favor of one person for the films storyline to hold together.The real problem with Flightplan is that the more you think back the more you become frustrated with how inconceivable the whole charade was the more you become irritated with how often you were lead to wonder about something eventually irrelevant. There are some films that don't give you all the answers and pull you along on a suspenseful ride and leave you feeling fulfilled when you finally figure everything out and everything fits together. Flightplan concludes you know the culprit and then you think back and nothing fits together.".

Ms. Foster really takes off in this entertaining cinematic offering in the sky! A good deal of time has passed since we saw her in Panic Room 2002 but for my taste this FLIGHTPLAN proves itself as an even better vehicle to showcase her talent. The movie demonstrates similitude to a Hitchcock thriller from the golden age of Hollywood both in style and in its storyline development. Guaranteed to keep you in respiratory crisis almost from start to finish! In the role of Kyle Pratt aircraft engine engineer and mother of 6 year old Katerina Foster shows tremendous range of nuanced emotion in a performance that easily could have given her a fifth Oscar nomination. FLIGHTPLAN has a very smooth takeoff but does not take long to encounter serious turbulence.Shortly after boarding an international flight Kyle falls asleep with her daughter alongside her. Upon waking she discovers that Katerina apparently has disappeared without leaving so much as the slightest trace! Progressively Jody Foster shows us an entire catalog of emotions. Concern and nervousness followed sequentially by frustration anguish and despair then confusion and guilt which ultimately give way to stoic resignation and unsettling doubts about her own sanity. The primary secret of FIGHTPLAN's success is that it enables the viewer to experience some of these emotions simultaneously right along with its lead character.Unfortunately there is one black hole in the skies of FLIGHTPLAN. It's the kind of vacuum that prevents a good movie from being an absolutely phenomenal one! Without flying into any spoilers by divulging anything specific as to the identity of the on board bad guys I will share the following with you The team responsible for creating FLIGHTPLAN in an extremely odd and inexplicable decision chose not to reveal the slightest clue as to any of the background history formation training experience MOTIVATION outside of the  previous or present internal conflicts mental state and developmental thought processes of the villains! This lapse is even more striking when contrasted with the background provided for protagonist Jodie Foster's character Kyle whose personality is meticulously constructed with deliberation and great attention to detail. Because of this the bad guys endup projecting a kind of TerminatorLight image seemingly lifted straight out of a comic book thusly rendering the viewer totally indifferent to their intervention or plight in the film! The cast of FLIGHTPLAN in general submit solid and credible portrayals. Peter Sarsgaard a veteran actor who has participated in numerous films but who always has remained a bit under the radar in Hollywood appears in a supporting role. His part is the most important one after Ms. Foster's. Sarsgaard's interpretation of a Marshall a kind of national airways police seems somewhat enigmatic and secretive.Bess Wohl who plays daughter Katerina has not had much onscreen experience but is competent in her role as innocent child victim. As the pilot we have Sean Bean in a refreshing change of pace role. Most certainly recognizable owing to his turns as villain in several high profile films. He is quite convincing as the crew chief who gradually loses patience with a passenger who proves to be simply too problematic.In 2005 few films managed to stay on top of box office for two consecutive weeks. This distinction is welldeserved in the case of FLIGHTPLAN which was assigned a PG 13 rating. It seems a great option for families with children over 8 or 9. For small kids especially if they might feel anxious about a little girl forcibly abducted from her mother do a prescreening 7.5....ENJOYDISFRUTELA!

I can't remember a more convoluted plot in movie. I still can't figure out the bad guy's strategy.The plot is completely illogical contrived and simply defies common logic. The vast majority of movies like this cleverly tie all the threads together in the final surprise climax. This film does just the opposite the story line unravels and become hopelessly knotted and twisted. The viewer is left simply saying huh? What's a shame is that excellent acting cinematography set design and editing is wasted on such an inane story that can only make a shred of sense in the egos of the writers and director.Among the more annoying contrivances 1.Nobody enters an airplane alone literally minutes ahead of the other passengers. Even so as pointed out by so many reviews a young child would not go unnoticed by other passengers.2.It's ridiculous to portray flight attendants as surly as a pretext for them not noticing the girl. Also I really doubt any flight attendant can mess around with the airline company's computers which must track millions of reservations.3. The air marshal comes off as creepy and untrustworthy the minute you see his beady little eyes. There's no surprise here that he turns out to be the bad guy. It's equally obvious that the onboard Arabs cannot be the bad guys.4.Though the flight cabin set design is smart if not overly opulent the acreage used in the storage an avionics area is totally ridiculous. It's as stupid as making the interior of a submarine look a spacious as an enclosed shopping mall. Also patch panels with phono jack connectors went out in the 1960s. I realize artistic license is needed but this is just silly for a computerized stateofart airplane.In summary this is probably the strangest most unsatisfying and poorly conceived film I've seen in a long time".

	schema:headline " Lacking the killer blow";
	schema:reviewBody "Flightplan stars Jodie Foster as a mother whose daughter vanishes on a flight from Berlin to America. The premise is excellent as the audience has to question themselves as much as Foster's character Kyle Pratt.The film begins very well. Kyle Foster and her daughter board the plan with a coffin to head back to America to presumable bury the father. They go to the back of the plane where there happens to be empty seats and have a snooze. Kyle wakes to find her daughter missing and then spends the rest of the film searching for her.Then questions start getting asked. How could she vanish? Was she on the plane in the first place? Is Kyle insane? How come no one saw her? Most of the film is spent with a frantic mother searching for someone who no one believes was ever on the plane while the flight crew attempt to restrain her. 60 minutes of cat and mouse action later and we finally get some answers but a hell of a lot more questions.The spoiler is that an air Marshall in cahoots with a fight attendant has kidnapped the daughter. Unfortunately this is where the film turns into a farce. There is no way that no passenger or flight crew could have NOT seen a little girl.The air Marshall's plot is just ludicrous. It requires him and the flight attendant to be on the same flight as Kyle the daughter and the coffin. The attendant has to be able to delete the files of the daughter off of the flight manifest. They have to go on the assumption that Kyle  daughter are going to be the first ones on the flight that no one else will see the little girl and that the girl can be taken below deck to the storage without being seen.This film is a locked room mystery which are supposed to be puzzles for the audience to try and figure out but there are so many plot holes that for one to enjoy the film you have to switch off your brain which defeats the purpose of a locked room mystery.The ending of the film is just plan awful. To spoil the ending the air Marshall is killed the flight attendant arrested and Kyle finds the daughter alive and well. The problem is that the FBI who arrived to arrest Kyle on hijacking charges let her go free without even questioning her on the events that transpired but are quick to arrest a flight attendant with no physical evidence other than Kyle's word.If a film is to be gripping and well received then it must have a satisfactory ending but this descends into a farce at the end.".

Yes thats right he plays an air marshall that figures out how to get 50 million by kidnapping and hiding Jodi Foster's daughter on the plain after it takes off and he has an accomplice in the crew. Its not just that thats so unbelievable its also the way he acts is so stupid and unbelievable and he's so incompetent as an air marshall AND as a hijacker its stupid! notice a theme here on the word 'stupid' Think how he would have to set this up Kill Jodi Foster's husband find out what plane she is taking somehow hide the bombs in the husband's casket and some how get assigned to her flight oh and also tampering with the passenger manifest list and the fake death notice of her daughter. How the hell is all that possible for him to do? Its not its stupid this is stupid. And the whole thing with the arab guy man STUPID! That did not teach any moral or make any sense or anything.

As the pieces unravel we are presented with a bewildering complexity of background information which without Foster to carry it or Hitchcockian logic to prove it we are tempted to dismiss with Flightplan as overambitious.

Well imagine being on a plane with your child when you awaken from a brief nap only to discover that your offspring is missing.To compound matters further imagine that no one remembers seeing your child on board and all passenger lists and appropriate documentation lead to a conclusion that your child never set foot in the flying tube 30000 feet above the Atlantic.That is the premise behind the new Jodie Foster Nell film Flightplan that delivers just enough thrills and spills to squeeze out a three star rating from his critic.Reprising the claustrophobic atmosphere of her last starring vehicle Panic Room Foster stars as Kyle as recent widower that decides to take her 6yearold daughter back to America from Berlin to escape the memories surrounding her husbands tragic suicide.However after catching a little shuteye at the back of the plane Kyle awakens to discover that her daughter is missing and that no one recalls ever seeing young Julia on board.Is she crazy? Is it a conspiracy? Does Julia exist or is this all some kind of a bad dream Twilight Zone episode that will end with Patrick Duffy lathering up in a shower? The game as we say is afoot and Kyle under the very watchful eye of Air Marshall Carson Peter Sarsgaard runs up and down the AIR E474 jumbo jet in a frantic attempt to try and convince others that her daughter is on board and that conspirators are attempting to conceal her whereabouts for reasons unknown.This is the second thriller set aboard a jetliner in just two months  the other being Red Eye  and Flightplan does just as good a job of instilling fear and tension aboard a vessel where mobility options and hiding places are limited between the nose and tail of the aircraft. Flightplan does find a way to up the ante by putting us aboard a monstrous flying machine. This AALTO Air E474 can seat as many as 800 passengers and has two stories 7 galleys crew quarters and a cockpit larger than my apartment. This allows the characters therefore to run up and down aisles and makes the disappearance of a small girl more believable due to the many small rooms and electrical hardware gadgetry spread out throughout the quarters.Flightplan had just enough good points to out number the bad  but not by much. First and foremost at the front of the line was the incredible performance of Foster in the lead role. Channeling emotions evoked if she had lost her own daughter Foster delivers a knockout performance that was as strong as any female lead in a thriller film since Sigourney Weaver strapped on the weaponry and stood up to the queen alien.Also notable was the support staff that is each believable in their respective roles. Peter Sarsgaard continues to put in one good performance after another and everyone from Sean Bean who finally FINALLY makes it to the end credits of a film without being killed! to Erika Christensen Traffic are provided just enough screen time to advance the story without having anyone go over the top in an attempt to steal the spotlight.That's the good. The bad includes a bad guy who has what I call the Bondvillain syndrome whereas he feels he has to talk out loud revealing more than anyone in the same situation would for the purposes of ensuring us dumb audiences know the who's how's and what's behind the plot and an ending that is kinda bumpy landing after such a long flight.However director Robert Schwentke does a good job of rising above most of the screenplay's shortfalls and delivers a Hitchcockian caper that is well worth the price of admission even if you will hardly remember most of the plot points by the time you see it on the DVD shelves early next year.www.gregsreviews.com".

	schema:headline " Jodie Foster is wasted in something like this";
	schema:reviewBody "Flightplan came out in the same year as Red Eye another thriller set on board an aircraft. When I reviewed that film recently I pointed out that for modern filmmakers the airliner has an appeal similar to that which the train had for Alfred Hitchcock an enclosed conveyance in which a group of randomlyselected strangers are thrown together. Indeed for the makers of thrillers an aircraft is perhaps even better than a train. It might be possible to disappear from a moving train but surely not from an aircraft in flight. The plot of Flightplan has similarities with that of The Lady Vanishes a Hitchcock film set on board a train and also with So Long at the Fair in which a girl's brother mysteriously disappears without trace.Kyle Pratt is a female American aircraft designer living in Germany. The role was originally intended for Sean Penn but the name was kept when it was decided to make the main character a woman. I supposed they could have changed it to Kylie but this name is rarely used in the Northern Hemisphere. After the death of her husband in a tragic accident Kyle flies back from Berlin to America with her young daughter Julia. During the flight Kyle falls asleep and when she wakes up Julia has disappeared. Kyle with the assistance of the flight crew search for her but the little girl is nowhere to be found. To make matters worse and to add to Kyle's evergrowing sense of panic noone can remember ever having seen Julia. She is not listed on the official passenger list and even her boarding pass has disappeared from Kyle's pocket. When Kyle complains to the captain of the aircraft he shows her a message he has received from the mortuary in Germany apparently confirming that Julia died in the accident along with her father. Kyle realises that she is the victim of a sinister plot and begins to fight back using her knowledge of the aircraft's design to thwart the villains. Fortuitously the aircraft she is flying on is one of a type she helped to design.This was a film which disappointed me. I was expecting to enjoy it for a number of reasons. The Lady Vanishes is one of my favourite Hitchcock films. Jodie Foster is an actress whose talents I have admired ever since I first saw Taxi Driver. The captain is played by Sean Bean an actor who can normally be relied on to deliver a good performance.The opening of the film is well done. Foster and Bean do indeed play their roles well with good support from other members of the cast. There is a sense of gathering tension heightened by the claustrophobic setting and the film's melancholy look. The action takes place in winter and the flight at night the predominant colours are dark blue black grey and white. As the film progresses however it starts to deteriorate. There are clumsy attempts to mislead the audience with false clues about Julia's disappearance. The initial suspects are a couple of Arabs but it must be clear to the viewer that they are innocent if only for reasons of political correctness. Arab villains? On a plane? Post 911? There is also an attempt to suggest that Kyle may be mentally ill refusing to accept that her daughter is dead but that is equally obviously a red herring. It is I suppose possible that a film might be made about a deranged woman who boards an aircraft believing herself to be accompanied by her daughter when that daughter is in reality lying on a mortuary slab but if such a film were ever to be made it would in all probability be an independent arthouse movie would not star Jodie Foster and would certainly not be billed as a thriller.What really kills the film however is when we learn who the villains are and what their scheme involves. I won't give away their identity here although any connoisseur of hackneyed plot twists will have spotted at least one of them beforehand. Nor will I set out their plot in all its intricate detail largely because I don't understand it. I certainly didn't understand it while watching the film and even with the assistance of other reviewers have not grasped all its ramifications. Overelaborate schemes which no reallife criminal would ever entertain for a moment have become something of a clich in crime thrillers but the baroque complexity of the one in Flightplan ought to earn the scriptwriter a special Oscar or more likely a special Razzie in the Criminal Conspiracy Most Obviously Doomed to Failure category. For those wanting to know more I recommend the helpful and witty review by Paulpensom.Jodie Foster played a similar role in Panic Room. In both films she plays a widow or divorce who has to protect a young daughter against ruthless criminals. As a thriller however Flightplan is inferior to either Red Eye or Panic Room. Those films had their plot holes but at least the villains' schemes were relatively straightforward and comprehensible and both maintained the tension without ever descending into silliness in the way that Flightplan does.It is a shame to see Foster's talents wasted on something like this and I would like to see her taking the lead in weightier films like those Taxi Driver The Accused Sommersby Nell in which she first established her reputation. It has been suggested that because of her sexuality audiences might be unwilling to accept her in romantic roles and that her choice of films is therefore limited. The whole art of acting however consists in pretending to be something one is not it should be no more difficult for audiences to accept Jodie as a heterosexual woman than to accept her as an aircraft designer when she has never worked in that profession. If that suggestion is correct Hollywood should be ashamed of itself. 510".

	schema:reviewBody "Flightplan seems to have affected IMDb contributors like no other film in recent memory. Mostly is bad. We didn't catch up with this picture until recently. Frankly we are puzzled as to why the hatred. Granted the film had the potential for being better but it's not the total failure as some of the comments in this forum will make one believe. It appears there's an agenda to mark Flightplan comments as not useful.Director Robert Schwentke working with Peter Dowling and Billy Ray's screen play hasn't added much to the film in order to make it a thriller to be reckoned with but in general the film is not a total waste as seems to be the perception among contributors.In a way Flightplan plays with the viewer's perception as to who is behind the disappearance of Julia the six year old girl traveling with her mother Kyle to New York. Kyle has suffered a great tragedy in her life when her husband was found dead in her building's courtyard. The fact that Kyle hasn't been able to accept the death is clear in the first sequence when we see her sitting inside the Alexanderplaz metro station in Berlin.Kyle an aircraft designing engineer is a good mother. One can imagine her panic when she wakes up from a nap to find Julia's gone. No one seems to have noticed the little girl there is no record of she ever been on board. Kyle meets resistance from the crew of the flight. Even the sky marshal Carson is no help at all. What's a mother to do? If one is in Kyle's shoes one starts taking matter into her own hands.Jodie Foster does a good job portraying Kyle. She is a mother who doesn't take no for an answer. In fact she is the one that unravels the mystery surrounding her daughter's disappearance. The climax sequence is perfectly set as one would expect it to be.Peter Sarsgaard is Carson the sky marshal traveling in the economy section. He is in charge of the safety of the passengers on the flight. In an unusual role for him Mr. Sarsgaard has some good chances in the movie. Sean Bean plays the pilot of the jumbo jet. Kate Beahan is seen as one of the flight attendants. Erika Christiensen is also part of the crew.The best way to enjoy the film is not to compare it to anything else and just go for the entertaining value in it because we know this is not a ground breaking film but thanks to Mr. Schwentke and his cast it offers us a bumpy ride of a film.".

Frankly we are puzzled as to why the hatred. Granted the film had the potential for being better but it's not the total failure as some of the comments in this forum will make one believe. It appears there's an agenda to mark Flightplan comments as not useful.Director Robert Schwentke working with Peter Dowling and Billy Ray's screen play hasn't added much to the film in order to make it a thriller to be reckoned with but in general the film is not a total waste as seems to be the perception among contributors.In a way Flightplan plays with the viewer's perception as to who is behind the disappearance of Julia the six year old girl traveling with her mother Kyle to New York. Kyle has suffered a great tragedy in her life when her husband was found dead in her building's courtyard. The fact that Kyle hasn't been able to accept the death is clear in the first sequence when we see her sitting inside the Alexanderplaz metro station in Berlin.Kyle an aircraft designing engineer is a good mother. One can imagine her panic when she wakes up from a nap to find Julia's gone. No one seems to have noticed the little girl there is no record of she ever been on board. Kyle meets resistance from the crew of the flight. Even the sky marshal Carson is no help at all. What's a mother to do? If one is in Kyle's shoes one starts taking matter into her own hands.Jodie Foster does a good job portraying Kyle. She is a mother who doesn't take no for an answer. In fact she is the one that unravels the mystery surrounding her daughter's disappearance. The climax sequence is perfectly set as one would expect it to be.Peter Sarsgaard is Carson the sky marshal traveling in the economy section. He is in charge of the safety of the passengers on the flight. In an unusual role for him Mr. Sarsgaard has some good chances in the movie. Sean Bean plays the pilot of the jumbo jet. Kate Beahan is seen as one of the flight attendants. Erika Christiensen is also part of the crew.The best way to enjoy the film is not to compare it to anything else and just go for the entertaining value in it because we know this is not a ground breaking film but thanks to Mr. Schwentke and his cast it offers us a bumpy ride of a film.";

The credits list first names to the characters but the movie didn't use them. It was like nobody even bothered to develop this film past the very early stages of script construction and yet the film somehow got through all the stages of film production and distribution.All the best lines are spoken off screen by random extras that only exist in ADR. Some zingers come from any number of stereotypical angry passengers who portray a particular class or race. My favorite was a man in first class who says about a woman looking for her daughter It's not like she lost her palm pilot. PALM PILOT! What year is it? Who wrote that at the turn of the century and then kept it for safekeeping until 2005. As if the main characters weren't shallow and underdeveloped enough the filmmakers decided to add some 2D extras just in case. Don't even get me started on the Arabs or the guy with the mustache.Seriously do we need someone to bring up racial profiling in such a surface level way. A film that almost has to tackle our racial stereotypes about terrorism skirts over this pitfall by eliminating terrorism at all. White people can hijack a plane spoiler oh by the by the plane is basically hijacked spoiler but then it's whitecollar crime not an act of terrorism. Every race has its flaw.Just an awful film. How anyone talked Jodie Foster Peter Sarsgaard or even Sean Bean into this plane wreck is beyond my comprehension.".

When I first saw the looks of this film I was very intrigued and thought it was going to be a The Forgotten 2....i was very wrong.What starts off is with Jodie Foster playing a mourning mother after the death of her husband. Her and her daughter catch a flight to go stay with Foster's grandparents however after Jodie's character falls asleep the daughter is gone....and to make matters worst she is told that she never existed...Sounds like a good premise eh? Well that's what infused me to go and see it. It starts off well but once the daughter goes missing it went downhill. Jodie's performance throughout is good not Oscar worthy but it is one of the highlights of the film as well as the evercool Sean Bean. Unfortunately I can't go into great depth of anything else of the story because of spoilers but I will say that the ending plot is horrible totally impossible and so therefore ruins the impact of the film and its good beginning.There are also a lot of other things that annoy me about the film to cut a long list short here are some examples  a brilliant new state of the art plane...and there's hardly anyone on board.Foster's character although confused and frustrated does get annoying after a bit and seeing as w're meant to identify and sympathise with her is not a good thing.The overall twist  ending plot is ridiculous as I stated before.My vote is 610....go see the film for the enjoyment of Jodie Foster and some thrills. however do not expect a masterpiece..because this is FAR from great.".

I've never seen two people arrive before everyone else without others similarly situated frequent fliers extra care etc. It's easy to take shots at plot problems in thrillers I find one usually does it only when a film is failing in character and momentum as here. The plot depends on Jodie Foster falling asleep? On the two of them moving to seats where the daughter wouldn't have to be carried over her from the window seat? And poor Peter Saarsagrd! He was wonderful  the movie still resonates in my mind  in Shattered Glass. I don't know whether to say he's miscast or just did a poor job. He may be a candidate as successor to Bill Murray for the lowest energy leading man but he's no action hero or villain.

And where did her daughters'boarding pass go? Did Carson Peter Saarsgard take it from her pocket without her knowing it? Sounds likely... The only entertaining thing in this movie is the man who pisses and moans about the Arabs at that moment the thriller becomes a comedy and I guess that was not the intention. Credit though to Saarsgard at least he tries to do something of the script. I also would have liked to see more of Erika Christensen she does a good job too and she is beautiful! Jodie Foster is obviously a great actress but something went wrong when she chose to do this one. Stay away!".

	schema:reviewBody "Just when we thought we had enough suspense this year with the airline thriller Red Eye along comes another that brings some heavy competition. Hitchcock fans will be delighted to know that German director Robert Schwentke has made a movie with a story just about as good as some of Hitchcock's  one that keeps them on the edge of their seats and seems to keep the guessing game going until the end.Jodie Foster Panic Room plays Kyle Pratt an airplane designer whose husband apparently fell off their roof and died recently. She and her daughter Julia Marlene Lawston are relocating from Germany to New York City having to transport her deceased husband with them on board a massive doubledecker airplane she designed. Kyle has been having a few delusions of her husband still being alive but she always comes to her senses and realizes that he's not. But when she falls asleep during the flight and wakes up to find her daughter missing she becomes alarmed and proceeds to look for Julia.How many places could she be right? That's the question everyone on board is asking. But when the Captain Sean Bean finds out that no one saw Kyle's daughter on board that she's been through a lot of stress and her daughter's boarding pass cannot be accounted for  he starts to think Kyle is mentally disturbed. As the flight goes on he is informed that Julia apparently died along with Kyle's husband  pointing to what looks like a troubled marriage and a suicidal husband taking their daughter with him off the roof. Is Kyle imagining her daughter is still alive too? The entire crew and all the passengers seem to think so particularly one man named Carson Peter Sarsgaard The Skeleton Key who proceeds to ask all the hard questions that she doesn't want to hear.Even though 99 of the movie takes place on board an airplane the film never ceases to entertain. Foster gives us a riveting performance making sure we can see the passionate look in her eyes that she is absolutely convinced her daughter is alive and that she's willing to go to great lengths to find her. She tackles an Arab man breaks airline rules enters restricted areas etc. She drools she claws...well not really. But she's definitely one mother you don't want to mess with.This film does a good job at depicting the post 911 atmosphere one gets when riding an airplane everything from undercover air marshals to passengers being wary of Arabs. It also reminds us of how annoying airplane flights can be with hyperactive kids acting up right in front of you or snobby passengers who say things like It's not like she lost her Palm Pilot. By the middle of the film most of the passengers are just as patronizing as they clap when Kyle is escorted back to her seat after causing a stir.It has its share of unique cinematography with obscure camera angles like a sideways shot beneath an airplane landing but other seemingly pointless slowmotion shots that don't add much to the scene. But most of that doesn't really take away from the story and the wonderful performances the actors give.The movie does raise a few unanswered questions ones I can't ask here without spoiling the plot but they're easily forgivable. Is the film really that good? Well it depends on how one views it. If one is expecting an original story heshe will likely come out disappointed. However it remains enjoyable if one just sees it simply as a story that while not original is a story welltold.Dan Geer MovieLegacy.com".

However there is actually a method to his madness for unlike many paranoiacs Sean has a valid reason to be fearful and suspicious of those around him. About ten years prior to the time of the story Sean was falsely arrested for the brutal slaying of a woman and her two young daughters  a crime for which he was eventually acquitted although the experience has left him emotionally devastated and psychologically damaged. His reputation ruined Sean has since devised an elaborate system whereby he can videotape himself 247 so that he will always have an alibi if someone ever attempts to accuse him again of a crime he didn't commit. Unfortunately Sean soon discovers that even the latest in modern technology can't guarantee his safety if the forces out to get him can figure out how to beat him at his own game.This quirky and original Irish film suffers a bit from the constraints of its budget and the amateurishness of some of the performances. Director John Simpson's split screen technique though intriguing at first becomes a bit trying after awhile and the storyline is not always as cleanly and clearly developed as it might be although the drab colorless look of the film perfectly reflects the drab colorless life of its protagonist.The movie overrides most of its flaws thanks to one element that is the real thing Lee Evans' searing and uncompromising portrayal of an innocent man driven to the brink of madness by his obsessive need to prove that innocence. With his nervous softspoken demeanor and constant look of terrified submission Evans makes what could have been a creepy repulsive character into a thoroughly sympathetic figure. We find ourselves so drawn to his predicament and so involved in his fate that even at those moments when the movie itself falls flat we stick with it anyway.".

Since he believed he was being set up the police he started videotaping every single thing he has done since then 24752 believing the cops were trying to hang other murders on him he's turned into a real paranoid. And for good reason because a dying sick detective is trying to get him for anything he can before he dies himself. Bring into this a forensic crime writer who keeps giving lectures and writing books about guilty criminals that get off because of technicalities. So our guy even has a camera mounted on his torso pointing towards his face whenever he leaves his bunker like home which has cameras everywhere possible. Along come the cops who accuse him again of a murder five years ago and when he goes to find that particular tape it is missing. YEEKS!!!! Then things get really complicated for him and we get into a bunch of twists and turns towards the climax of the story that made this a great Saturday night flick that's a little off center and somewhat disturbing. Great movie and I hope some of the rest of you have a chance to see it. Very very original and quite creative with excellent performances.

My vote is eight.Title Brazil A Cena do Crime The Crime Scene";

The great novelty of this film is its main character which is a peculiar guy that to prove his innocence from the accusation of a family's murder records every second of his life on videotape. He says there's a conspiring plan against him and to protect himself from false allegations he tapes his life to prove his innocence. I liked the dark cinematography and the strangeness that dwells all over the film. The final twist is not so surprising as I had heard from other users but it's a nice ending anyway. I score it 710 mostly because of its cinematography.".

	schema:reviewBody "I usually prefer the entertaining to the artistic in movies but Freeze Frame is the first film that I think would have been better if it had been less commercial and more idiosyncratic.Almost 10 years ago Sean Veil Lee Evans was accused of a horrible triple murder he didn't commit. The case against him was thrown out of court because of the media grandstanding by lead detective Louis Emoric Sean McGinley and forensic psychologist Saul Seger Ian McNeice. Since that day Sean has been consumed by paranoia fearful of the authorities framing him for another murder. His response to his fear is as obvious as it is disturbing. For nearly a decade Sean has been videotaping every single second of his life. He has multiple cameras stationed throughout his dungeonlike home. When he goes outside he straps a camera to his chest. Sean has created a visual record of every step every meal every night's sleep every bowel movement everything in his life for 9 years 11 months and 28 days and stores all of those videotapes in a vault to provide him with the perfect alibi if he's ever wrongly accused again.Sean might have gone on with his fearful and compulsive existence forever but then a TV crime reporter named Katie Carter Rachel Stirling tells Sean she thinks he's innocent. That's what Sean has wanted more than anything in the world but he barely has time to enjoy it when the police burst in and accuse him of killing a woman 5 years ago. When Sean goes to get the tapes proving his innocencethey're gone. In a panic Sean flees from the cops and tries to come up with another way to deflect this unjust charge but in doing so he sets in motion a chain of events that not only reveal who's framing him now but who framed him for the massacre of the Jasper family 10 years ago.This is a nice little film that's quite visually interesting. Some of it is shot like a normal film and some of it is footage from the many cameras Sean uses to record his life. It's a very good effort at utilizing the emotional and personal realism of the handheld video genre while freeing the story from the limitations of that style.Lee Evans does a fine job portraying a man whose obsession for control and protection has warped his personality. Sean McGinley gives the right air of desperation to a cop who is fighting off his own death long enough to catch Sean Veil and make him pay for something. Ian McNiece is also perfectly selfrighteous as the psychologist who catapulted himself to fame on the Jasper murder case. Rachel Stirling's character is more of a plot device than a real person but she handles well everything the plot needs Katie Carter to do.Freeze Frame however doesn't do enough with its own concept. The idea of a man so paranoid that he voluntarily lives under perpetual video surveillance of his own design suggests an awful lot of emotional and logistical ground to cover but almost all of those details or possibilities are shoved aside because the film is more about being a clever mystery caper. The story only touches on Sean Veil's elaborate construction of his observation system in the most basic and shallow way. We also never get a sense of what kind of man Sean was before his initial arrest and the following years of obsessive personal vigilance so there's nothing to compare to his present paranoid state. It limits the ability to sympathize with Sean because you don't really know how screwed up he is compared to his original self. I think the story would have been more effective if it had chucked most of the mystery and instead concentrated more on the way Sean lives his life and how it's changed him as a person.There are also a couple of significant twists in the story that don't add up. There's one element that couldn't exist in the American media and justice system but this is an Irish film and I'm not sure if Irish laws on crime reporting are different enough to make the twist plausible. The climax is also too pat and neat and requires a character's behavior and mental state to flip 180 degrees for absolutely no reason.You won't be disappointed if you watch Freeze Frame but you may feel like you've just seen a good idea that went largely unexplored.".

On the day that Vail was set free the husband and father of Susan Moira  Maggie the bereaved Sam Jasper Martin McSharry who survived the massacre overcome with grief hung himself.Vail becomes ultraparanoid of him being set up by the police since they felt that he was guilty of the Jasper murders an got off Scotfree. It's then that Vail has every movement that he makes recorded on tape to prove where he is just in case he's to be framed by the police for another murder like that of the Jasper family that he didn't commit.This plan of Vail keeps the police off his back until one day just two days before the 10th anniversary of the Jasper killings he's hauled into the local police station for the murder of Mary Shaw Rachel O'Riondan who was killed outside a London Pub on the night of October 1516 1998. It turned out that with all the tapes that Vail had recorded of himself since his acquittal of the Jasper murders that ones covering the time of Mary Shaw's murder were strangely and mysteriously missing from his film vault! Was Vail set up in Mary Shaw's murder by the police with the only piece of evidence that can clear him the October 1516 1998 video tape cassettes stolen by the cops themselves! And if so was Miss. Shaw murdered by the very people the police who are now using her death to frame the innocent Sean Vail!A lot like the innovated from the end to the beginning thriller Memento the movie Freeze Fame strengths lie in its use of its camera angles as many as four in one frame and zoomlike flashbacks then its very complicated storyline. The story itself is your usual man trying to prove his innocence against overwhelming odds type movie but with a twist. A twist that turns the entire film upside down with its unveiling the reasons just why the Jaspers were murdered. And why those murders had to be covered up to the point of having to frame an innocent man Sean Vail for committing them.Even though he's in fact absolved by a judge not a jury of the crimes that he's accused of Vail is certain that his life will never be the same again. Vail is soon proved to be right with the persons who were in charge of the Jasper murder case Det. Louis Emeric Sean McGinley together with police forensic profiler Saul Seager telling the public after Vail was acquitted that they'll do everything to have him rearrested for the Jasper murders being that in their minds the case was still active. Both Emeric  Seager are so sure that Vail is guilty that they predict that he'll murder again!With the Mary Shaw murder hanging over his head Vail with the tapes that can exonerate him missing is now in danger if convicted of being sent to prison for 30 years. This in another murder like that of the Jaspers he didn't commit! It now becomes apparent to Vail at least that the Jaspers murders and that of Mary Shaw are somehow connected!SPOILER The film Freeze Frame builds up to a really powerhouse ending that has all those involved in the Jasper killings the cops Sean Vail and even the reporter Katie Carter Rachael Stirling trying to prove Vail's innocence having deep and dark secrets in just what their involvement in them really were. Vail who's recordings of himself was to be his alibi in any future murders that he feels he's to be framed for turn out to be his own undoing in leaving them open for someone like the vindictive police to heist. It's in the end that not only the real reason for the Jasper as well as Mary Shaw murders surfaces but also who used them to frame Vail! And possibly with the help of his fellow convicts have Vail murdered while behind bars in order to keep that socking truth from ever seeing the light of day!".

It's then that Vail has every movement that he makes recorded on tape to prove where he is just in case he's to be framed by the police for another murder like that of the Jasper family that he didn't commit.This plan of Vail keeps the police off his back until one day just two days before the 10th anniversary of the Jasper killings he's hauled into the local police station for the murder of Mary Shaw Rachel O'Riondan who was killed outside a London Pub on the night of October 1516 1998. It turned out that with all the tapes that Vail had recorded of himself since his acquittal of the Jasper murders that ones covering the time of Mary Shaw's murder were strangely and mysteriously missing from his film vault! Was Vail set up in Mary Shaw's murder by the police with the only piece of evidence that can clear him the October 1516 1998 video tape cassettes stolen by the cops themselves! And if so was Miss. Shaw murdered by the very people the police who are now using her death to frame the innocent Sean Vail!A lot like the innovated from the end to the beginning thriller Memento the movie Freeze Fame strengths lie in its use of its camera angles as many as four in one frame and zoomlike flashbacks then its very complicated storyline. The story itself is your usual man trying to prove his innocence against overwhelming odds type movie but with a twist. A twist that turns the entire film upside down with its unveiling the reasons just why the Jaspers were murdered. And why those murders had to be covered up to the point of having to frame an innocent man Sean Vail for committing them.Even though he's in fact absolved by a judge not a jury of the crimes that he's accused of Vail is certain that his life will never be the same again. Vail is soon proved to be right with the persons who were in charge of the Jasper murder case Det. Louis Emeric Sean McGinley together with police forensic profiler Saul Seager telling the public after Vail was acquitted that they'll do everything to have him rearrested for the Jasper murders being that in their minds the case was still active. Both Emeric  Seager are so sure that Vail is guilty that they predict that he'll murder again!With the Mary Shaw murder hanging over his head Vail with the tapes that can exonerate him missing is now in danger if convicted of being sent to prison for 30 years. This in another murder like that of the Jaspers he didn't commit! It now becomes apparent to Vail at least that the Jaspers murders and that of Mary Shaw are somehow connected!SPOILER The film Freeze Frame builds up to a really powerhouse ending that has all those involved in the Jasper killings the cops Sean Vail and even the reporter Katie Carter Rachael Stirling trying to prove Vail's innocence having deep and dark secrets in just what their involvement in them really were. Vail who's recordings of himself was to be his alibi in any future murders that he feels he's to be framed for turn out to be his own undoing in leaving them open for someone like the vindictive police to heist. It's in the end that not only the real reason for the Jasper as well as Mary Shaw murders surfaces but also who used them to frame Vail! And possibly with the help of his fellow convicts have Vail murdered while behind bars in order to keep that socking truth from ever seeing the light of day!";

	schema:reviewBody "Lee Evans best known as stand up rubberyfaced comedian in the UK pulls off an astounding performance and not just for leaving behind the relative comfort zone of comedy. Any 'serious' actor would be similarly lauded I think. I won't rehash the plot  there are more than enough summaries on here  but what I will say without spoiling anything is that the film drives on its plot twists. It's just that at a certain point about 34 in there is almost a twist too many and the characters appear to be taking longer to work out what the hell is going on who did what to whom and why and then they realise that they were really lying about one thing and not the other which drags the film down with some rather tedious explanations  that still remain thoroughly necessary  which grate after a while. The sense one is left with is that the filmmakers are almost learning the plot along with US and there isn't a sense of control in the narrative. I mean obviously they knew what happened but the tone was of constant uncertainty about how to end it and who to make the bad guy. So instead of making choices they choose instead to make EVERYONE the bad guy at one time or another until they hit upon a convenient enough resolution that will satisfy the most amount of people. It is however beautifully lit a scene with Evans leaving his housewarehouseprison which is backlit with multiple shadows is extraordinary and the CCTV footage style is never excessive or derivative. The one feeling I was left with having bought it online second hand for about 2.50 was cool but I doubt I'll watch that again. At least a year's time before I consider it. It would only be worth it for Evans' performance as unfortunately the makers just couldn't get a classy enough backup cast the Rachel character is a particular weakness when her role is critical to the narrative yet she remains the weakest performance here verging on high school incompetence at times. The notion that British law would ever allow such a blatant miscarriage of justice when the evidence is SO SO flimsy against Sean further upsets things. You tend to let it go though thanks to Evans brilliant portrayal as a man condemned to fight for his right to innocence. Worth checking out but don't go out of your way.".

	schema:reviewBody "I hadn't really heard of Oblivion before I watched it but I'm a big fan of Tom Cruise and his films as he is such an excellent actor. Right from the start the film doesn't disappoint. It has a real depth that a lot of actionSci Fi films don't have. A beautiful ambient soundtrack is matched perfectly to the pace of the film and in it's own right is a work of excellence that I now listen to on my iPod.The characters are believable and as expected Tom Cruise plays his character really well. Morgan Freeman also plays an excellent role here and I feel was perfectly cast for his role.The special effects are very good. The creators went to great efforts with many of the sets and props constructing full size ships and massive screens to project backgrounds rather than just use blue screen and CGI which I feel responsible for ruining many modern films. The Star Wars prequels comes to mind! Where CGI is used it's not over the top and blends well with the live action and real sets. The tower set is a work of pure beauty and helps add to the bright and wide open feel of the film if that makes sense.As I said previously the soundtrack is fantastic and allows me to watch the film over and over without getting bored of it. The sound effects are excellent as well. Specifically the drones make excellent noises at various stages of the film.The overall plot is very good. It has a good amount of twists and real depth. It is all played out at a pace that seems to adapt perfectly to the story. Action sequences are fast and deeper more emotional sequences get the slower pace they deserve.It's funny but it's one of those films that maybe didn't win any awards and maybe didn't break box office records.. but I find myself watching it again and again as it's just so watchable and enjoyable. There very few films I own that I can watch go back to the beginning and watch again right away. Black Hawk Down is one of them and now so is Oblivion. In fact I only watched it last week but after writing this review I'm tempted to watch it again tonight.I hope you enjoy it as much as I did and continue to do so!".

In fact all the actors portray their characters very well.There is mystery action a little bit of love and some adventure. The beginning is good there is a high point and the ending of the movie is satisfactory in my opinion. The special effects are executed in a way not to take away from the story or the plot and the story does not revolve around them but rather they are just a part of the story.

There are many ways to describe Oblivion but the softly spoken afterword by Tom Cruise's character really makes you feel the human heartbeat of this scifi epic. As always the trailer is full of explosions and set pieces. Oblivion the movie is an entirely different beast that values a human story and characters that are driven by common purpose. While the cast is tiny I found much to enjoy from Cruise Riseborough Freeman and that Nordic guy from Headhunters who is showing up more frequently in Hollywood blockbusters. Aside from unusually limited screentime Morgan and other supporting cast are effective and memorable. The threads of the plot are wellwoven and I won't give anything away so what I will tell you is to prepare for a powerful journey into the unknown where nothing is what it seems. Explosive set pieces take a backseat for scifi philosophy with twists to spare. Oblivion ticks all the boxes for correct use of literary devices and establishes enough original cannon to stick in your mind long after the credits start rolling. It is a distinct success among the largely abysmal offerings of 2013 so far don't miss it.".

Also like TRON the soundtrack is excellent and very well used throughout enhancing the action and adding depth to some  at times  distinctly average acting performances.Tom Cruise plays Tom Cruise but that's not a bad thing in this case in fact his natural charisma carries the movie through some of its slower sections. Morgan Freeman plays Morgan Freeman though he's really not on screen for long enough to influence the movie one way or another. Olga Kurylenko's statuesque profile is unfortunately not matched by her acting ability and I often found it difficult to believe in her character's actions and emotions. Andrea Riseborough turns in maybe the best performance convincing as the sad and confused Victoria unwilling  or perhaps unable  to confront the disturbing truth.At over 2 hours I think that it's too long by about 20 minutes. A shorter cut would tighten up the story and eliminate some of the slower sections which I think hurt the movie's overall rhythm and flow.Overall I would definitely recommend going to see this movie in the cinema on the biggest screen that you can find. It just won't be the same on TV. The visual appeal alone is reason enough but combined with a clever if not entirely original script a thumping soundtrack and some exciting action you should be entertained.".

	schema:reviewBody "I really wanted to see this movie from the first time I saw the movie trailer a long time ago. I came up with all sorts of fun endings in my own mind based on the trailer and eventually my curiosity caused me to read too much and I read some spoilers that I wish I hadn't. I still enjoyed the film immensely but wish I hadn't read the spoilers and suggest you shy away from all potential spoilers reading as little as possible before seeing the movie. So when you're done with this review don't read anymore just go see the movie.I had the good fortune of watching this movie at an advance screening on a smaller IMAX screen and I really enjoyed it as did the huge audience judging by the lively and jovial banter as people exited. The movie follows Jack Harper who is a drone repair tech in a future earth that has been ravaged by an alien invasion. He has a bythebooks eyeinthesky literally assistant named Victoria nicknamed Vika who watches out for Jack and reports to Central. They live together in a sky platform to avoid the alien scavs who come out at night. Jack is keeping the drones repaired to defend huge energy machines from being attacked by the scavs. Once enough energy has been stored up from the world's oceans by the energy machines the remaining survivors of earth hope to leave in a few short weeks for the safety of a new base on Saturn's Titan. To protect certain things Jack and Victoria's memories have been erased before their present situation. Jack is confused about why they have to leave earth whereas Vika is ready to go but they both cherish and respect each other. Then Jack meets Malcolm Beech who tells Jack that things are not exactly how they seem which sets off a series of events that eventually lead to the end of the movie.Some critics have mentioned something like we've seen these ideas before in other movies. While it's true that there's nothing totally new in this movie per se that doesn't make the movie less appealing IMO. Thinking back to when I was much younger and saw the trailer for the movie Independence Day in the theatre I remember thinking that the movie looked really fun despite the fact that there've been a zillion alien invasion movies before but I still hoped they'd do a great job with it because the trailer for the movie was awesome. Was there anything earthshatteringly new about the movie? Not really but it was still excellent entertainment. That's how I feel about Oblivion. To me it's great entertainment.The only minor complaints I had was that the volume of the music while Jack and Vika were in the pool was too much and sometimes things dragged ever so slightly between action sequences. Overall though this movie was definitely a remarkable treat.".

Jack is confused about why they have to leave earth whereas Vika is ready to go but they both cherish and respect each other. Then Jack meets Malcolm Beech who tells Jack that things are not exactly how they seem which sets off a series of events that eventually lead to the end of the movie.Some critics have mentioned something like we've seen these ideas before in other movies. While it's true that there's nothing totally new in this movie per se that doesn't make the movie less appealing IMO. Thinking back to when I was much younger and saw the trailer for the movie Independence Day in the theatre I remember thinking that the movie looked really fun despite the fact that there've been a zillion alien invasion movies before but I still hoped they'd do a great job with it because the trailer for the movie was awesome. Was there anything earthshatteringly new about the movie? Not really but it was still excellent entertainment. That's how I feel about Oblivion. To me it's great entertainment.The only minor complaints I had was that the volume of the music while Jack and Vika were in the pool was too much and sometimes things dragged ever so slightly between action sequences. Overall though this movie was definitely a remarkable treat.";

Tom Cruise is the perfect man for the lead role and does not fail to deliver a good performance. If you are a relatively simple person with a short attention span you may become a bit dazed and confused as to why certain components of the film are occurring but it adds up in the end beyond measure. Although 'Oblivion' forces you to work slightly harder than usual in understanding the plot and each twist that it takes it all comes together very well in this thrilling yet slightly confusing film. No doubt one of Kosinski's best so far.".

Even after the real human faction is revealed and a group of drones rampage around massacring everyone you just don't feel anywhere near the amount of sympathy as you should do.When the super villain is finally revealed anyone who has seen 2001 A Space Odyssey will have immediately recognised a blown up version of Hal. The fairly predictable clone twist is reminiscent of Moon although it is accepted by the characters after only a couple of seconds of conflict.The first twenty minutes however were very good minus the lightning scene. The setting of the post apocalyptic time frame was laid out beautifully with a collection of scenes which almost reminded me of a futuristic version of I Am Legend.Yes underneath the film is a very generic amalgamation of various scifis that came before and it is definitely not a masterpiece in itself but to the open minded viewer it provides more than enough to give you an easy two hours of mild entertainment and pretty landscapes.Does anyone else question Tom Cruise's morals in stranding his wife alone in a valley for three years thus forcing her to give birth by herself?

The effective background music makes them feel even grander. I think Kosinski's creative process starts basically from the music. It's essentially an orgasmic audiovisual fair just like Kosinski's previous and debut film TronLegacy. He's more ambitious here and more passionate. Although you can't help but recognize the influences behind the storywhich are some scifi epics I won't name hereand feel dejavu it still never stops being exciting and interesting. Oh BTW I suggest to listen to Oblivion OST by M83 amazing shoegazeelectronica band before going for the film. Really! M83's soundtrack feels like Hans ZimmerDaft PunkM83 all together at once.

A long preamble sets the dystopian background it is the year 2077 and  the earth has been devastated in a war with aliens who destroyed the  moon thus destabilizing the earth causing earthquakes and tsunamis.  Nuclear annihilation followed and as the earth became inhabitable the  surviving humans moved to Titan a moon of Saturn while alien  scavengers still roam the irradiated habitat. They still mine the  earth's resources through giant reactors which are in turn protected by  drones which are maintained by a pair of technicians residing in a  stylish minimalistic floating facility in the clouds with wiped out  memories Jack Harper Tom Cruise and Victoria Olsen Andrea  Riseborough who are counting their days to their return to Saturn. Is  this the truth? Who are Jack and Victoria? Why does Jack still have  haunting memories of his past? Are there humans left on earth? Who won  the war?  Is it possible to miss a place you've never been? To mourn a time you  never lived?  Oblivion doffs it cap to gems such as 2001 A Space Odyssey I am  legend Independence Day Moon Star Wars Total Recall The Matrix  and of course WALLE to create a striking visually resplendent  feature. Fresh from his Oscar for Life of Pi film Claudio Miranda  creates an another unforgettable integration of cinematography and  visual effects an arresting landscape of desolate beauty pockmarked  with craters and fallen signposts of humanity as we know it and lush  unspoiled green valleys. The action is sporadic and effective not  overpowering and there is a love triangle that is sensitively dealt  with. Cruise here is playing one of his more affable characters a  dreamer trying to find out the meaning of his existence taking direct  inspiration from Sam Rockwell's stellar turn in the Moon. As  revelations unravel he gets into superstar mode with minimal  fussiness cool vehicles check. Weapons check. Beautiful babes  check. Mission to save the world check. Risenborough is superb as the  icy cool rule following partner Olga Kurylenko gives grace to an  essentially damsel in distress role while Morgan Freeman is his usual  solid self in a cameo.   Director Joseph Kosinski gives a graphic novel flair to the  proceedings and like his previous effort Tron Legacy gives a solid  bonus in the form of a surging musical score by French band M83.To sum  up Oblivion may not be terribly original but it is stylish well  written and got performances to boot especially Cruise who is in red  hot form. It may not be a puzzle to solve but in the immortal words of  Roxette it's got the look to warrant a trip to the theaters! Go on and  enjoy a summer spectacle.".

	schema:headline " A Hopeless Plot";
	schema:reviewBody "Let me start by saying that the visuals in the movie are great acting is reasonable and although the general story is slow it has a lot of potential. That is where the positivity ends. For me the abundance of plot holes  inconsistencies completely ruined the film. Whilst some of these might seem like nitpicking when you add them together it really detracts from what could have been a great movie. I was asking questions likeThe machines seem to have amazing technology except being able to keep consistent radio transmission.How did Jack and Victoria figure that their control centre  home was built with no humans? If by the machines then surely the machines are capable of handling drone maintenance themselves making their roles totally redundant?Why does the machine mother ship's communication go offline constantly?Why are the machines always short on drones?Jack has an obvious disposition toward protecting humans yet the other humans constantly wear armor that make them seem nonhuman? There is ample opportunity to approach Jack whilst he makes repairs or is on his own.Despite Jack  Victoria's control center  home being somewhere in the stratosphere it seems to have swimming temperature and calm wind conditions.Why does Victoria's character have her head completely in the sand whilst Jack appears to be quite freethinking?Why are the drone cameras not visible to the machine control? This would have exposed significant intelligence about the humans numerous times. It is standard even with drone technology today.How can the flight log still hear what the NASA flight crew are saying whilst they fly into the white light?

	onyx:emotionText "Let me start by saying that the visuals in the movie are great acting is reasonable and although the general story is slow it has a lot of potential. That is where the positivity ends. For me the abundance of plot holes  inconsistencies completely ruined the film. Whilst some of these might seem like nitpicking when you add them together it really detracts from what could have been a great movie. I was asking questions likeThe machines seem to have amazing technology except being able to keep consistent radio transmission.How did Jack and Victoria figure that their control centre  home was built with no humans? If by the machines then surely the machines are capable of handling drone maintenance themselves making their roles totally redundant?Why does the machine mother ship's communication go offline constantly?Why are the machines always short on drones?Jack has an obvious disposition toward protecting humans yet the other humans constantly wear armor that make them seem nonhuman? There is ample opportunity to approach Jack whilst he makes repairs or is on his own.Despite Jack  Victoria's control center  home being somewhere in the stratosphere it seems to have swimming temperature and calm wind conditions.Why does Victoria's character have her head completely in the sand whilst Jack appears to be quite freethinking?Why are the drone cameras not visible to the machine control? This would have exposed significant intelligence about the humans numerous times. It is standard even with drone technology today.How can the flight log still hear what the NASA flight crew are saying whilst they fly into the white light? If it was in the crashed ship then it must have been disconnected with the sleeping passengers this is a clear error?The machine mothership didn't consider that maybe Jack was smuggling something into the ship? Especially after it was clear he knew that they were not human?Broken drones are easily repaired with chewing gum.How did Jack build an entire home on the lake with no obvious access to building equipment or resources?The machines could scan Jack's ship upon entry presumably by some sort of infrared and see that there was another passenger but were not able to distinguish a male from a female?

For example Tom Cruise's character is a human technician that must somehow be required to repair machines that were originally built BY machines to destroy humans. How does THAT make any sense? So imagine an unimaginative Tom Cruise movie that took a dab of 2001 A Space Odyssey a pinch of the Borg from Star Trek a bit of post apocalyptic mankind from Mad Max a smidgen of pod racing from Star Wars a bit of The Matrix and a dash of Independence Day. Mix well let steep until rotten project on a screen at 8 or more a pop. Trust me you've seen this movie done better. Avoid until it's on Blue Ray for 1.50.

The way the Earth looks the vehicles the bubble ship where Jack lives all just looked brilliant. The special effects were amazing too. I really am struggling for words to describe just how good it did look.The cast all done a great job Tom Cruise was pretty much perfect in the lead role and then there was Morgan Freeman who I wish could have had more screen time. Then there was two lesser known actresses Andrea Riseborough and Olga Kurylenko who both gave very good and believable performances.I thought the plot was good and as I said before it got your attention right from the start. The action scenes were breathtaking and extremely fast paced when they happened. Some have said that they felt the film was too long I personally felt it was the right length because it enabled the characters to develop. It was a little bit predictable at times and did get a bit confusing when there was a twist although it all made more sense in the end.Overall this was a very enjoyable film that is just simply stunning on the eye.810.".

Sunny becomes a national heroine and media celebrity and as a reward is offered a job working for the Protocol Section of the United States Department of State. Unknown to her however the State Department officials who offer her the job have a hidden agenda.A map we see shows Ohtar lying on the borders of Saudi Arabia and South Yemen in an area of barren desert known as the Rub alKhali or Empty Quarter. In real life a state in this location would have a population of virtually zero and virtually zero strategic value but for the purposes of the film we have to accept that Ohtar is of immense strategic importance in the Cold War and that the American government who are keen to build a military base there need to do all that they can in order to keep on the good side of its ruler. It transpires that the Emir has taken a fancy to the attractive young woman who saved him and he has reached a deal with the State Department they can have their base provided that he can have Sunny as the latest addition to his harem. Sunny's new job is just a ruse to ensure that the Emir has further opportunities to meet her.A plot like this could have been the occasion for some hilarious satire but in fact the film's satirical content is rather toned down. Possibly in 1984 the American public were not in the mood for trenchant satire on their country's foreign policy this was after all the year in which Ronald Reagan carried fortynine out of fifty states in the Presidential election and his hard line with the Soviet Union was clearly going down well with the voters. If the film had been made a couple of years later in the wake of the IranContra affair its tone might have been different.The film is not so much a satire as a vehicle for Goldie Hawn to show off her brand of cuteness and charm. Sunny is a typical Goldie character pretty sweetnatured naive and not too bright. There is however a limit to how far you can go with cuteness and charm alone and you cannot automatically make a bad film a good one just by making the leading character a dumb blonde. Actually that sounds more like a recipe for making a good film a bad one. Goldie tries her best to save this one but never succeeds. Part of the reason is the inconsistent way in which her character is portrayed. On the one hand Sunny is a sweet innocent country girl from Oregon. On the other hand she is a 35yearold woman who works in a sleazy bar and wears a revealing costume. The effect is rather like imagining Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm grown up and working as a Bunny Girl.The more important reason why Goldie is unable to rescue this film is even the best comedian or comedienne is no better than hisher material and Protocol is simply unfunny. Whatever humour exists is tired and strained relying on offensive stereotypes about Arab men who apparently all lust after Western women particularly if they are blonde and blueeyed. There was a lot of this sort of thing about in the mideighties as this was the period which also saw the awful Ben Kingsley Nastassia Kinski film Harem about a lascivious Middle Eastern ruler who kidnaps a young American woman and the miniseries of the same name which told a virtually identical story with a period setting. The filmmakers seem to have realised that their film would not work as a pure comedy because towards the end it turns into a sort of latterday Mr Smith Goes to Washington. Sunny turns from a blonde bimbo into a fount of political wisdom and starts uttering all sorts of platitudes about Democracy and the Constitution and the Citizen's Duty to Vote and We The People and how the Price of Liberty is Eternal Vigilance blah blah blah but in truth the film is no more successful as a political parable than it is as a comedy.Goldie Hawn has made a number of good comedies such as Cactus Flower Overboard and Housesitter but Protocol is not one of them. I have not seen all of her films but of those I have seen this dire comedy is by far the worst. 310".

Apparently that scene was cut from the movie which is too bad but really doesn't cut down on the movie's enjoyability.Protocol focuses on Sunny Davis Goldie Hawn a young woman who is barely scraping by working as a cocktail waitress in Washington DC. She drives an old clunker of a car that breaks down more than it runs and rents a small room from a gay couple Joel Brooks and Jerry Haines. One day fate intervenes when Sunny is part of a crowd watching the arrival of the Emir of Otar Richard Romanus. Sunny notices a man pulling out a gun to shoot the Emir and she immediately acts to stop him ending up with a bullet in her rear end. Of course she immediately makes the news and comes to the notice of the US government who immediately installs the now national heroine in a job at the state department. While there she meets Michael Ransome Chris Sarandon a man who is impressed by her honesty and charmed by her naivet and sparks fly. Sunny also comes to the notice of the Emir himself who decides he wants her to be part of his harem. The ambassador to Otar Gail Strickland who is also Sunny's boss arranges for Sunny to go on a diplomatic mission to Otar a fictitious country whose name is a combination Oman and Qatar two very real countries on the Arabian Peninsula. While there Sunny discovers what her intended fate is which doesn't exactly thrill her however she has more pressing concerns when the Emir is overthrown in a coup. Upon returning to the states Sunny is called upon to testify before congress about her role in the newly revealed scandal. She is advised on what to say to protect both herself and the state department but Sunny has a few ideas of her own and with Sunny it's always best to expect the unexpected.It's a rather cute movie and pretty believably put together. Sunny certainly lives up to her name and her bubbly personality hides a pretty impressive brain  she actually memorizes the code of conduct for State Department Employees and recites the paragraph that tells her what she should do when the Emir tries to give her a car. And Sunny's annoyance at being treated like a pawn or worse a prostitute in relations with the Emir is quite believable. But of course the most fun in the film is all the mayhem Sunny gets herself and those around her into due to her lack of understanding how diplomatic protocol works. In the end her naivet is a refreshing change for almost all who deal with her.The acting was also quite good. Hawn easily carries the film and is believable both as the bubbly airhead and as the woman who finally grows up and learns to take accountability for her part in the scandal. Sarandon makes a nice romantic lead and his chemistry with Hawn is excellent. Strickland also does a nice job as the cynical Washington operative who is continually foiled by a young woman who continually exceeds her expectations.It's definitely a product of its time especially in its attitudes towards the Arab world but in terms of giving us a story where a downtrodden person finally reaches their potential it's a fun movie and one well worth watching.".

The ambassador to Otar Gail Strickland who is also Sunny's boss arranges for Sunny to go on a diplomatic mission to Otar a fictitious country whose name is a combination Oman and Qatar two very real countries on the Arabian Peninsula. While there Sunny discovers what her intended fate is which doesn't exactly thrill her however she has more pressing concerns when the Emir is overthrown in a coup. Upon returning to the states Sunny is called upon to testify before congress about her role in the newly revealed scandal. She is advised on what to say to protect both herself and the state department but Sunny has a few ideas of her own and with Sunny it's always best to expect the unexpected.It's a rather cute movie and pretty believably put together. Sunny certainly lives up to her name and her bubbly personality hides a pretty impressive brain  she actually memorizes the code of conduct for State Department Employees and recites the paragraph that tells her what she should do when the Emir tries to give her a car. And Sunny's annoyance at being treated like a pawn or worse a prostitute in relations with the Emir is quite believable. But of course the most fun in the film is all the mayhem Sunny gets herself and those around her into due to her lack of understanding how diplomatic protocol works. In the end her naivet is a refreshing change for almost all who deal with her.The acting was also quite good. Hawn easily carries the film and is believable both as the bubbly airhead and as the woman who finally grows up and learns to take accountability for her part in the scandal. Sarandon makes a nice romantic lead and his chemistry with Hawn is excellent. Strickland also does a nice job as the cynical Washington operative who is continually foiled by a young woman who continually exceeds her expectations.It's definitely a product of its time especially in its attitudes towards the Arab world but in terms of giving us a story where a downtrodden person finally reaches their potential it's a fun movie and one well worth watching.";

	schema:reviewBody "I have no doubt that Protocol is intended as a silly comedy with Goldie Hawn playing her usual role as the ditzy blonde. However this is one of those movies intended as a silly comedy that now looks more serious. After Hawn's loopy waitress saves a Middle Eastern emir from an assassination she becomes the national sweetheart. Her relatable charismatic demeanor endears her to almost everyone and she gets a job in the State Department despite having barely any idea what the job entails. This reflects the tendency to turn any likable person into a celebrity regardless of qualification or intelligence. Elia Kazan's 1957 movie A Face in the Crowd starring Andy Griffith as an average Joe who becomes a demagogue also looked at this. The mess that we've made of the Middle East only adds to the movie's newfound seriousness.Or maybe that's just my interpretation. On its own the movie is pretty silly with lines like Washington DC is the best place to get shot in the ass. Among the more toecurling aspects of the movie is the casting of pasty white Andre Gregory of My Dinner with Andre fame as a functionary from the Middle Eastern country.Other than that the movie's OK. The party in the restaurant looked fun. The rest of the cast includes Chris Sarandon Prince Humperdinck in The Princess Bride Ed Begley Jr and Kenneth Mars the police chief in Young Frankenstein.As for Hawn's character's speech to congress it poses one question can we the people act as guardians of democracy?".

Goldie plays the part of Sunny with her usual plucky charm. She is surrounded by a sharp cast but she carries the film as she does most of her films.

There are so many good things about this delightfully expensive and expansive movie that I prefer to concentrate on aspects like the marvelous performance Goldie Hawn delivers and indeed the astute playing of the whole cast. The script provides a tremendous lineup of socko characters and intriguing situations which are splendidly directed by Herbert Ross of all people. Frankly I thought that a movie with such a huge cast and so many powerful scenes would be a bit beyond Herbert's capabilities but he has risen to the challenge magnificently. Even the extras play their two or three seconds roles with remarkable charisma and yet they don't steal anything from Miss Hawn. True Buck Henry and others have provided a great script with plenty of laughs and a huge lineup of characters  plus a few critical ploys and stings that put our politicians in a far less favorable light than the usual cow towing Hollywood movie. I also thought the music score surely deserved recognition as one of the best of the year. In fact all the credits were magnificent in this comedy that delivers plenty of stings.

However I thought this movie brought the spirit of the original Lassie to kids who never got to experience Lassie when it was at it's best. The main actor Thomas Guiry who played the troubled Matt Turner truly carried this film. He was also quite fortunate to be surrounded by other great actors such as Michelle Williams and Charlie Hofheimer.I really loved this story because it expressed the true values of family and unconditional love. I recommend this film to families children and adults alike. I still love this movie and probably always will. I give it a 9 out of 10.".

Without Robert Weatherwax's training the amazing things that this Lassie does would not be possible. As a dog trainer myself I recognize the difficulty that accompanies training dogs to do even simple behaviors so I think that he should be acknowledged.One thing that made me laugh though was the kid's comment about getting another kind of dog for sheep dog a German Shepherd or EVEN A LAB.

I'm sure that the problem was that the writer didn't want to say border COLLIE or Bearded COLLIE or Australian SHEPHERD but why not Corgi or Sheltie or Tervuren?

However this is a modern version of 'Lassie' and the children in this film enjoy the types of activities that children enjoy at this time in 1994. Lassie is able to convert them however to a more oldfashioned and slower paced lifestyle. The film did little to engage me and I do not think it worked well as a modern story. I cannot see older children wanting to see this film and it seemed that is was targeted more to older children because of the age of the children in this film. If you want to watch a 'Lassie' film then I suggest the classic 'Lassie Come Home' or watch the old series of 'Jeff's Collie' or 'Lassie'.".

It doesn't have many similarities with the famous TV show. They were made in very different times. The TV series has the feeling of its era as well as this movie version has a typically 90's feel to it well it was made in the 90's!. But still this motion picture preserves some of the popular TV show's spirit. This movie brings a 50's legend to the 90's and updates it.The dog that portrays Lassie is of course a great fourlegged actor being the Lassie of always very elegant and beautiful owner of an exceptional intelligence heroic and very friendly with everything and everyone. Tom Guiry has a winning performance as Matt.Matt is at first a spoiled and rebel teenager in every way and as such his interests are very specific. But once he starts changing he changes radically his attitude and learns to appreciate the most beautiful things in life. And all of this after Lassie stealing his headphones forcing him to chase her until a swimming hole complete with a tree rope.Now a personal observation and comparison just like in Disney's 'Old Yeller' the character Travis isn't minimally interested in the dog at first but ends up becoming more attached to it than anyone else the same happens in this film to Matt on Lassie.Lassie as always senses and responds to dangers as they occur. In this movie there is a scene that particularly fits this description when Lassie saves Matt from a fierce wolf.The movie also has beautiful settings and landscapes typically country scenario that only make it better.".

I don't have to go to the tape it's burned in my memory for all time. Some films how should I put this some films come straight down from heaven written directed and produced by GOD! This MIRACLE of modern art that is cinema has the potentialI think to change the world. Ok maybe you think I'm some nut who just really likes dogs well far from it. In fact dogs terrify me. I have to cross the street even if it's one of those tiny ones old ladies carry in their purses. But this movie allows me to get past that absurd phobia. I like to watch movies with my kids I like to make sure they don't see violence and sex and stuff like that at least not till they are older in the double digits. This movie is perfect to watch with your kids. I'm lucky cuase ever since the plant got shut down I've had tons more time to watch tv with them. Now I said that this was a teaser review and it is. Here's what I'll give away CLAYTON BARCLAY JONES is the next BRAD PITT. I mean it's like I'm looking at his younger brother. CBJ lights up the screen my oldest daughter is obsessed with him. She even has his POPS cereal comercial on tape. I'm a family man I got kids and I got a wife who loves me. But that Mr Jones makes me feel things for a man I wasn't sure I was capable of. He's that good. Listen go watch this movie. Savour it. If you feel like watching it two times through I'll understand. Plus there are rumors in the works for a sequel FINGERS CROSSED!!!!

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Pretty Persuasion";
	schema:reviewBody "I kinda liked this film for almost all the wrong reasons. It's politically incorrect and doesn't make any apologies for doing so but yet demonstrates a notion that we can be bigots and yet not be consciously aware of it. After all it's what has already been internalized but it becomes exposed quite naturally through our actions and dialogue.Evan Rachel Wood is the star of the movie. As Kimberly Joyce she's the high school frat girl like Alicia Silverstone's Cher in Clueless but in terms of character she's on the other side of the spectrum. Way on the other side. She's looking for fame and would do absolutely anything to obtain her 15 minutes worth. She's a temptress a seductress highly intelligent and so manipulative she can stab you in the back while smiling in front of you with you none the wiser and probably still worshipping the ground she treads on.Which brings us back to the title and makes you wonder if beautiful people can get away with almost anything. I guess it's probably almost human nature to be enchanted by the pretties and anyone would most likely be lapping up at anything they say. It doesn't take much for a beautiful bitch to realize the power she wields on men who are drunk in her aura and then to exploit this weakness of people around her.There are two more key reasons why I enjoyed the movie besides being enchanted myself by the Kimberly character. The first is the dialogue in the movie  there's so much wit and it's fast and laced with plenty of double entres and satire delivered in a deadpan manner by Rachel Wood no less you would likely need to rewatch it again to grasp them all. The second is having Kimberly chaperon a newbie in school an Arab girl called Randa Adi Schnall raising some eyebrows as the religious girl gets exposed to pop culture and blatant insensitive racists remarks and inevitably too becomes a pawn in the whole scheme of things as does Kimberly's best friend Brittany Elisabeth Harnois discover that it's not always fine and dandy being the hunter as there is always something or someone else higher above in the food chain.The host of supporting characters raised the movie to another notch. James Woods shines as the foul mouthed father of Kimberly who sprouts words of wisdom peppered with colourful vulgar racist remarks. Jamie King completes the household as the long suffering trophy wifestepmother in the Joyce household constantly bearing the brunt of insults hurled at her by Kimberly. At school we have Ron Livingston as Percy Anderson as the meek and mild mannered school teacher who indulges in roleplaying games with the wife at home Selma Blair and inadvertently becomes the target and public enemy 1 of Kimberly and friends. And Jane Krakowski in a bimbotic role stars as a news reporter who finds it increasingly difficult to stay objective when covering possibly the juiciest scandal to hit town.There's a sub theme running that touches on saving face which is an issue to the successful in ensuring that their reputation does not get tarnished in the face of scandals and is a trait that most Asians are familiar with. It's important that face is not ruined easily by careless actions as face is something that is most difficult to build in an environment of shame. Having lost face and losing the faith to rebuild it can lead people to an untimely sad demise.So if you're up for some scheming betrayal and plenty of slimy tactics if you want to observe how seemingly good intentions are actually poisoned barbs that kill slowly then I hope I've already persuaded you enough to watch this flick.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you don't like films with unnecessary graphic language you may want to put Pretty Persuasion on your films to avoid list. There is so much exploitive language and perversions mostly discussed rather than demonstrated that I was regretting my purchase 2025 minutes into the story even though I was laughing fairly oftenespecially at Kimberly's Evan Rachel Wood comments about the relationship between her stepmother and her dog. I was amazed that Wood had agreed to do this thing and felt that in a few years she would regret having it on her resume. But after about 30 minutes I was either hardened to the dialogue or had begun to understand that most of it was there for a legitimate purpose. And to enjoy Pretty Persuasion you have to be willing to accept a fair amount of what first seems needless exploitation. It used to be that teenagers went to the movies to see adults making love now adults go to the movies to see teenagers making love or at least speaking and behaving suggestively. This black comedy and parental neglect social statement comes 50 years after Ed Wood featured it in The Violent Years. Instead of a gang of privileged girls robbing gas stations 15 year old Kimberly and her two classmates best friend Brittany Elisabeth Harnois and shy Muslim girl Randa Adi Schnall bring sexual harassment charges against one of their teachers. And Pretty Persuasion introduces a lot more dark wit into the equation a function of Skander Halim's screenplay and Marcos Siega's direction. The most intriguing thing about Pretty Persuasion is the way it embeds a complementary theme about Hollywood hypocrisy in the very structure of the film. Promiscuous teenage girls and lesbians are established titillation elements in exploitation films. And during viewing you are subtly persuaded that you are watching a fairly graphic exploitation film. It is only upon later reflection that you realize that you have actually seen nothing everything was implied by the dialogue or staged partially offcamera. A prudish viewer is not offended so much by the images as by the implications that they have supplied themselves. As a response to the growing sexual exploitation element in films beginning in the 1930's Hollywood selfregulated itself through the Hays Code. Its provisions stated that pictures shall not infer that low forms of sex relationships are the accepted and common thing scenes of passion should not be introduced when not essential to the plot and seduction or rape should never be more than suggested. The tone of Pretty Persuasion is disapproving of the sexual relationships that are taking place its scenes of passion are essential to the plot and the seduction takes place off camera making it at least technically in compliance with the old code. The story is told from Kimberly's point of view and Pretty Persuasion is a good example of the power of POV in fostering identification and sympathy for the character through whom we are witnessing the main events. By the end most viewers are perversely hoping that Kimberly will be successful. Few actors could elicit sympathy for this character but Wood manages to do so you work to resist her but ultimately you lose. You are further won over at the end when you realize that Kimberly's cynicism is largely justified even if her actions are not. Were she able to choose Kimberly would not elect to so cynical it is simply a reflection of a world that is a major disappointment to her. So the character Wood brings to the screen is one that you go from hating to sympathizing with to admiring. The theme of cynicism as well as its cause and effect has never been better dealt with than in this film. Using sex as her commodity and insightful analysis of other's weaknesses as her weapon the disillusioned Kimberly is pretty much able to manipulate the world to suit her designs. Wood is becoming the Tuesday Weld of her generation but is treating us to stuff in her mid teens that Weld did not do until her mid20's. Think of Pretty Poison and I Walk the Line. Or even more appropriately Weld''s portrayal of Abigail in The Crucible because at its core Pretty Persuasion is a modern version of Arthur Miller's classic an intriguing blend of The Crucible To Die For and Heathers. After watching Wood in Pretty Persuasion you realize that it is not something to be purged from her resume but something she should highlight. Then again what do I know? I'm only a child.".

Ron Livingston of office space fame is teacher and drama coach Percy Anderson a seemingly nice guy who also acts a bit suspicious.

	schema:headline " It's Election meets Heathers in this incredibly dark comedy";
	schema:reviewBody "Quit possibly the 2000s version of Heathers or Election and to a lesser extent the teenage version of To Die For with Nicole Kidman. Pretty Persuasion is a cynical and darkly twisted teenage comedy with a razor sharp plot! This film is nothing short of brilliant Evan Rachel Wood who proved audiences she was talented alongside Holly Hunter in Thirteen was a perfect choice for the role of Kimberly Joyce a trash talking acid tongued manipulative and devious teenager who is determined to win the role of Anne Frank in a school play.Hoping she will achieve fame through her role as Anne but after Kimberly's naive best friend Brittany Wells gets the role Kimberly incites chaos in her Beverly Hills community by accusing her English teacher of sexual harassment. Kimberly also asks her best friends Brittany and Randa a shy and harmless Arab girl to accuse him of sexual harassment...to make her unbelievable story believable. But little do they know Kimberly has her own agenda to pretty much everything.Pretty Persuasion is a tough and cynical genre film with a twist taking the female highschool satire further and deeper than such predecessors as Heathers Mean Girls and Election. Skander Halim's sharp satire employs the most sexually explicit dialog to be heard in an American teen movie indie or Hollywood over the past decade. When a father addresses his daughter as a dirty little whore who gets it up her ass you know you are witnessing a feature that many viewers will perceive as shocking excessive and totally jaw dropping. The whole movie may be too much for the more conservative public.Starting of as a black comedy Kimberly is a girl beyond her years similar to Tuesday Weld in Pretty Poison that boy Sammy in the novel What Makes Sammy Run? and Tracy Flick in Election. In looks and conduct Kimberly may be a younger version like I said above of the equally amoral and immoral TV weather reporter Nicole Kidman played in Gus Van Sant's underestimated satire To Die For. You'll either be offended by this film or love it death and me well I love it to death although teen mean girl films are getting predictable these days Pretty Persuasion however changes that!! Especially with the perfect performances to top it off Evan Rachel Wood is an amazing acctress and well deserves an Oscar someday.Overall Pretty Persuasion is a perfect black comedy teen film and certainly not for the light hearted you've been warned and it's not your average teen comedy. But pure perfection.7.510".

When a father addresses his daughter as a dirty little whore who gets it up her ass you know you are witnessing a feature that many viewers will perceive as shocking excessive and totally jaw dropping. The whole movie may be too much for the more conservative public.Starting of as a black comedy Kimberly is a girl beyond her years similar to Tuesday Weld in Pretty Poison that boy Sammy in the novel What Makes Sammy Run? and Tracy Flick in Election. In looks and conduct Kimberly may be a younger version like I said above of the equally amoral and immoral TV weather reporter Nicole Kidman played in Gus Van Sant's underestimated satire To Die For. You'll either be offended by this film or love it death and me well I love it to death although teen mean girl films are getting predictable these days Pretty Persuasion however changes that!! Especially with the perfect performances to top it off Evan Rachel Wood is an amazing acctress and well deserves an Oscar someday.Overall Pretty Persuasion is a perfect black comedy teen film and certainly not for the light hearted you've been warned and it's not your average teen comedy. But pure perfection.7.510";

Quite frankly I was rather worried about what I had let myself in for but as it transpired all my doubts were misplaced. I found the film intensely funny gripping and wellacted.The main character of Kimberly is puzzling. Some of her remarks are bizarre e. g. about her friend's masturbation. As the movie progresses you learn the sheer scale of her manipulation. I have to admit I found it deliciously wicked and so perfectly orchestrated that I couldn't help but feel a little admiration for this devil wearing a grey skirt. It's so funny to watch as she copies dialogue from porn movies and uses the same lines with different lovers. I also felt sympathy for her anal sex encounter. There was something feministic here where the female is blamed for the desire of the male as in the story of Adam and Eve. My complete lack of knowledge of the film also ensured that I wasn't sure whether the character of Mr. Anderson had perpetrated the crime of which he was accused and the structure of the movie added to this effect. After all there was that scene with his wife. Nor does Kimberely's manipulation make her happy. At the end of the film she is lonely and has deigned to the level of some awful soap which she appeared uncomfortable with and demeaned by in the film's first scene. But for Kimberly nothing can get in the road to success.".

This one was also very good but relied more on conventions at the story level.Here the screenplay is clever clever work both at the narrative and metanarrative levels which asks all the right questions which is probably why it seems to upset people  who wants to be asked pertinent questions nowadays? and uses a terrific very mature cinematic vocabulary which any genuine Cinema lover will recognize as such. Come on guys if you can't see that this is GREAT cinema you've missed the train entirely.SPOILERS AHEAD In case you didn't think this is intelligent work at the moralsocial level... ask yourself what could have prevented Randa's suicide? Think of all the missed opportunities miscommunication from her parents the other girls the teacher's attitude... think about the motivations.. ever asked yourself the same questions about the crime in Heavenly creatures?

As shocking and comical as Pretty Persuasion was it did deliver a powerful message. People are flawed. Not everything in this world is wholesome and good. When it came to manipulation and intelligence Kimberly Joyce had everything in spades but when it comes to deception sometimes getting what you want is the easy part realizing what that says about you and what it all means is the difficult part. Pretty Persuasion is one of the better dark films i've seen come around since Ghost World. Although shocking and sexual there is no real nudity or graphic sex scenes in the whole film.

After touring Hollywood Video going around in circles a million times a cute guy that I just had to flirt with recommended Pretty Persuasion and said that it was a huge recommendation. Well I had to look cute and like I was interested so I rented it I watched it this morning just expecting a good movie but I have to say that this was a good recommendation because it was a great movie. I just love dark comedies even if they push the edge this was just a meaner version of Mean Girls in my opinion it's a mixed version of Mean Girls and Cruel Intentions to sum it up. Pretty Persuasion is a great film with good acting a twisted story and has some of the funniest dark scenes I have seen in a while James Woods was the show stealer for me but the whole cast did a fantastic job pulling the story together well.Kimberly Joyce is a student at high class Beverly Hills High School she has two friends pretty and popular Britney and a new Arab student Randa. Kimberly and Britney want to be actresses and just live the high life. Kimberly's family life isn't all glam though with her gold digging step mother and neglectful racist alcoholic father who is all about image. But the girls take a giant leap in accusing their English teacher of sexual harassment to get famous. Or at least that's the motive that Kimberly has led the girls to believe.Pretty Persuasion is a great dark comedy I don't think it's for everyone though it is flawed in some ways. Some of the messages are sent the wrong way and the direction was just alright but I thought it ended brilliantly and for some sick reason I really liked Kimberly's sadistic side her way of stabbing people with a smile on her face she was wicked but so cool in the way she did everything. The best performance besides Wood was James Woods he was just dead on with his character and as much of a jerk as his character was he was in some sick way still likable. I don't know why I knew I was supposed to hate a lot of these characters but I found them to be so human a the bored rich people who have nothing better to do than complain. I would recommend Pretty Persuasion if you like dark comedies this is right up your alley.810".

You'll find the script to be just as moronically cartoonish as the acting however if you haven't seen very many films and have a very watereddown sense of humor then you'll probably like it. The film offers a bland attempt at oversexualized camp from moment to moment which should be appreciated as an interesting attempt while blindly becoming formulaic satire in a cloak of edgy indie tragedy. The film just yells EDGY INDIE BLACK COMEDY and I would think that we'd be done with this by now.James Woods is over the top as usual and his performance is not interesting in the least. Woods and Wood are both confusingly irritating spouting off humorous and cheaply written pieces of dialogue. Lines such as Do you Fk dogs? are funny I suppose and might lure a smile but overall it's pretty amateur in its delivery and concept. The film is just a bit full of itself or unconscious of itself either way...it reminds me of the goofy teenaged local TV projects I would try with my other 15 year old peers. It makes sense that most people compare this to Election or Heathers for a few unimportant and easily relatable reasons however it should be more appropriately compared to a TV movie. Don't get me wrong I love oversexualized vulgarity and cheap black comedies that actually take you somewhere stimulating but this film is just cheap and it's sad that it requires so little effort to gain a recommendation these days. It's a film that a lot children will love because they don't know any better.".

	schema:reviewBody "Pretty Persuasion Reviewed by Sam OsbornRating 2 out of 4Let's get one thing straight I was not in any way offended by Pretty Persuasion. Many critics have disparaged the film for its aggressive subject matter but I simply didn't find the film to be the least bit entertaining. I rarely take offense at the subject matter of a film as long as it is necessary to the proper telling of the film's story. With Pretty Persuasion the socalled offensive material is quite imperative for the telling of the story. That's not to say however that I enjoyed the story. Instead of striving for a slick intelligent and provocative film Pretty Persuasion lapses into cruelty and absurdly misaimed satire that rarely evokes more than the sound of crickets from the audience. It seems to want to reside in a Napoleon Dynamiteesquire world where normality was a disease cured centuries ago. But don't hold your breath Napoleon fans these aren't the quasilovable characters of middle America from the Sundance cult phenomenon but precocious snooty Beverly Hill caricatures that would rattle the nerves of even the vainest of Hollywood celebs. There are of course the film's delightful little moments of hilarious shock factor take for example Kimberly's dialogue with her stepmother and some strangely impressive performances but the screenplay hits its balls so far into left field that most of us are left shaking our heads in disappointment. The film follows the devious scheming of Kimberly Joyce Evan Rachel Wood through her early years of high school. Teaming up with her newfound Arab friend Randa Azzouni Adi Schnall and boyfriend stealing bombshell Brittany Wells Elisabeth Harnois the three set out to come forward with accusations of sexual assault incriminating their easily distracted History teacher Mr. Anderson Ron Livingston whose interest in young ladies has even reached into his marriage to Grace Anderson Selma Blaire. Picking up the story is the stunning lesbian reporter Emily Klein Jane Krakowsi. Back at home Kimberly's father played outrageously by James Woods worries only over the reputation of his wholesale electronics business. Divorced and remarried with a girlfriend on the side Woods' character wanders about the house in robe and boxers spouting ignorant and prejudiced comments and insisting he isn't being a racist but simply telling the truth. Woods' performance is nearly worth recommending the film for. He steals scenes like they were candy from a baby demanding the audience's concentration and truly earning the attention comically. This is Woods at his best however ignorant his dialogue may be.Evan Rachel Wood has rapidly become my favorite young female actor in Hollywood. Coming off impressive work in Samuel Bayer's Green Day music video When September Ends with Jamie Bell Wood continues with her streak of phenomenal independent work in Pretty Persuasion. Despite the film's creative crutch Wood takes her virtuoso bitchy role by storm. It's a daring provocative and hilarious performance by one of the industry's most intriguing actresses. But despite all my raving of the film's performances I still find myself bored with Pretty Persuasion. There's great potential here to make an intelligent and provocative film that could possibly pose as a comic version of American Beauty. Instead director Marcos Siega takes the low road for scatological and lowbrow goofiness sacrificing all that could be satisfyingly funny. We're left alienated by Siega's quasinormal world and not allowed to reconnect. The jokes range from sexist to racist attempting to offend any and all the least bit interested in women's rights. Instead of achieving satire the film finds itself wallowing in gross immaturity.".

	schema:reviewBody "Pretty Persuasion crosses Mean Girls with an updated slant on Lillian Hellman's The Children's Hour but its social and political satire feels in too many scenes like an extended Saturday Night Live sketch.The film is heavyhandedly based on the sociological findings that instead of doing Columbinelike violence teen age girls lash out with spiteful aggression in social situations. The film makes the extended case that teen girls are more like Machiavelli than Carrie or as in Heathers. The male debut writer and director can't resist adding in dollops of male fantasy about girls and women. Even under the guise of examining how ambiguous maledriven media messages from Britney Spears to Lolita to TV shows etc. create confusing role models of appropriate behavior for girls in their real lives males are seen as clueless pawns of younger females.One effective touch is to replay scenes in flashbacks from different angles to show how miscommunications and misunderstandings can occur and be manipulated.Individual scenes and caricatures are very funny particularly James Wood doing a comic take on his Ghosts of Mississippi role. Adi Schnall is touching as a naive Muslim student thrown in with the sharks of the American Dream. Jane Krakowski enjoys making fun of the ambitious bombshell roles she usually plays. Elisabeth Harnois is the most affecting as the best friend but she is so natural she almost seems to be in a different movie. Selma Blair has a brief funny scene as a wife mocking her husband's fantasies though a notable episode of TV's Angel did the exact same scene with more dark bite as well as the general theme taken up more effectively by Joss Whedon's Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Ryan Murphy in Popular. But most of the rest of the broad scatter shot attacks on ethnic racial and sexual PC clichs end up just wooden and go on repetitively for too long. Individual lines like I can sympathize with the immigrant experience because I'm Canadian. are amusing as are ongoing jokes about putting on the story of Anne Frank as the high school play but pile up in dialog that even the commanding Evan Rachel Wood has trouble making seem real.The closing montage ties all the disparate themes together in a sudden shift of tone but it was a long time getting there in moving from the obvious to the touching to twists in using high school as the usual metaphor for the world at large.The cinematography is all appropriate bright pink. The set design is full of visual jokes more than the can be picked up quickly.For a film set in the world of teenagers there are few songs on the sound track perhaps due to budget limitations but more music might have helped the pacing.".

An utter failure. To achieve true offense you must be either really crude and stupid or really bold and revolutionary. To achieve truly wicked wit you must be really smart  and of course witty. Pretty Persuasion almost achieves the former qualities but not quite. It's pretty stupid and rather crude it certainly isn't revolutionary see below. The second goal  truly wicked wit  requires logic and intelligence in the script. And that is far far away from what the makers of Pretty Persuasion have shown themselves capable of in this truly lamentable effort.The fault indeed is not in the acting which is at best accomplished and confident and at worst able and serviceable. It is in the writing directing and editing which are all astonishingly inept. Evan Rachel Wood as Kimberly Joyce is the alpha female who does it all wrecking lives left and right for a boy. Hey that's not hip that's not cool! It's hard to see where this badly written story is meant to be going. It leads up to a jury trial in which Kimberly persuades two of her classmates including Randa a Middle Eastern i.e. Arab girl in hijab who is totally passive and commits suicide  thus fulfilling several false stereotypes to go along with her in accusing an English teacher of sexual harassment  not a good idea for the alpha female given that when she isn't listening to her obscene racist father James Woods who should be ashamed is manipulating people by granting them oral and anal favors or watching porn. Kinberly is in no position to present herself as sexually innocent and it is not ironic but simply illogical for her to bring forth such a case. The private Beverly Hills high school is mere wallpaper. There's no portrait of school life here and no sense of real personalities or social groupings or up to date lifestyles. Thus one of the most essential elements of this kind of comedy  a highlighting of current teenage social patterns  is missing.How very unsophisticated and unclever it was of Skander Halim the screenwriter to think this poorly organized series of mindlessly cruel and tasteless scenes whose sole aim  at which it fails  is to cause outrage would turn out to be somehow sophisticated and clever. Halim has almost no sense of the sophisticated schoolgirl sensibility or of current language.Pretty Persuasion is bad bad bad. And given the promising trailers full of seemingly outrageous moments it was a huge disappointment for anyone lured into theaters to see it this fall.After this disaster and with nothing else but a trail of minor TV behind him it'll be very surprising if the director Marcos Siega ever does anything on film that is beyond mediocre. The high point of his career thus far may have been his role as a post production assistant for Sleepless in Seattle. Good luck Mr. Siega. Start out by finding another writer.".

	schema:reviewBody "People rush over themselves to praise Al Pacino and Robert De Niro so much that some other great actors who made an impact in the 1970s get overlooked. James Caan is one name that immediately springs to mind and James Woods is another. Both have appeared in some substandard stuff over the years as have Pacino and De Niro for that matter but at their best they wereare as good as anybody working today. Twenty years ago Woods starred in one of my all time favourite movies David Cronenberg's stunning 'Videodrome'. He'd already been around for years getting solid character parts but I thought after 'Videodrome' and subsequently costarring with De Niro in Sergio Leone's 'Once Upon A Time In America' he was going to be recognized as one of the greatest actors of his generation. Sadly for some reason this just didn't happen. Even so I highly recommend underrated 1980s Woods movies like 'Cop' 'The Boost' and this one 'Best Seller' for some of his greatest performances. The movie itself occasionally gets a bit cheesy in an 80s kind of way especially the synth score from Jay Ferguson but overall it's a cut above a lot of similar movies from the period. Director John Flynn had previously made the seriously underrated revenge classic 'Rolling Thunder' and the movie was scripted by exploitation legend Larry Cohen 'Black Caesar' 'Q' 'Maniac Cop' 'The Stuff'. 'Best Seller' isn't quite as good as 'Rolling Thunder' but it's a must see because of Woods who is just terrific. Noone can play intense like Woods with the possible exception of Christopher Walken. Brian Dennehy is also very good and Paul Shenar Sosa from 'Scarface' makes a great villain. Also keep an eye out for a blink and you'll miss it cameo by Seymour Cassel 'In The Soup' as a hired goon. I can't say that 'Best Seller' is one of the greatest thrillers I've ever seen but it's definitely worth your time and James Woods playing misunderstood psycho hitman Cleve is an experience not to be missed!".

Director John Flynn's 'Best Seller' which was written by Larry Cohen who makes a crackerjack combination is actually a stark stinging and darkly witty and violent crime caper with an outtheshadow concept. Novel writing mainly the sharp exchanges and character inserts and its zesty tempo couldn't be faulted. Even with its talky core Flynn keeps it gustily hardboiled and rancorous with its occasional action sequences and lean suspense. Knowing that it heavily relies on the performances to be successful Flynn setsup the film around the pairing of James Woods and Brian Denneby. Woods effortlessly vivid and unbalanced performance frighteningly commands attention and Denneby is sensationally rocksteady. The two worked off each other impeccably and build a sympathetic but also conflicting edge that never feels forced. Cohen's biting script illustrates and develops quite a stimulating random and unusual relationship between the two. While his usual social commentary quite a familiar one and plot devices playing second fiddle to the complex arrangement. The rest of the support cast don't quite have the same impression but Paul Shenar and Victoria Tennant are good in their roles. The weak points would have to be that of Jay Ferguson's ugly sounding synthesiser score and a mishandled conclusion. A solidly rewarding crime thriller drilled home by two tremendous lead performances.".

Woods is cold and calculating as the hit man and Dennehy is torn between his sworn duty as a cop and his desire to get to the truth. Best Seller is not for the faint of heart.

	schema:reviewBody "Best Seller is directed by John Flynn and written by Larry Cohen. It stars James Woods Brian Dennehy and Victoria Tennant. Music is by Jay Ferguson and cinematography by Fred Murphy. Cop Dennis Meechum Dennehy survives being shot during a robbery at the police evidence storage and writes a well received book about the events. Years later he's widowed raising his daughter on his own and suffering from writers block as he tries to write another novel. Into his life comes Cleve Woods a mysterious man who saves Meechum's life and announces that he is a paid assassin and wishes Meechum to write a book about his work for a top name in industry......Only in America Dennis.It's a lovely hook is this a cop and a killer paired together their relationship explored via an uneasy buddy buddy formula where the fruits of their partnership will bring very differing rewards. Along with the crackerjack turns from Dennehy lovable burnout and Woods coldblooded calm it's the smart screenplay from Cohen that makes Best Seller worthy of a rental at least. How it is going to pan out always keeps one interested in the tale while there's clearly some snarky observations on America's lust for capital gain. Violence flits in and out to add some bloody pulp to proceedings but ultimately it's the dialogue the suspicious mood crafted by Flynn and characterisations that give the film its vitality.Released in the same year as Lethal Weapon it appears that Best Seller got lost in the slipstream of that higher octane fuelled picture in fact Dennehy gets to say the same too old for this line that Glover trademarked in Lethal Weapon. It's not on a par with Donner's movie and it's far from perfect the ending is a bit tamer than we would perhaps like and Paul Shenar's villain is a standard suit job but there's good craft here on the page and on both sides of the camera. 710".

	schema:reviewBody "Writer Larry Cohen concocts this interesting entertaining movie that mainly hinges on the often antagonistic relationship between two strong personalities. Brian Dennehy stars as Dennis Meechum a cop who also writes books based on true crime stories who is approached by Cleve James Woods a professional hitman for an unscrupulous businessman David Madlock Paul Shenar. The hitman feels inadequately compensated for his years of service and is now an incredibly disgruntled exemployee enough to approach the cop  author to propose writing a book that reveals all the ugly details of the businessman's rise to the top. Capably directed by action specialist John Flynn Rolling Thunder Lock Up Out for Justice Best Seller tells a pretty good story in slick enough fashion with some effective moments of very nasty violence. It also has very strong subtext about portraying a dark side to capitalism and corporations as well as Cleve's own very dark version of The American Dream. It's well paced with some potent scenes that establish what kind of man Cleve is. Yet for a man who most of the time comes off as pure scum he has definite intelligence and a real presence and in the end does have a redemptive quality it's the kind of role meant for an actor of Woods's abilities and he plays it for all it's worth. But Dennehy is equally his match as the dedicated cop both disgusted with and intrigued by his new associate. Appealing Allison Balson plays Dennis's daughter although supporting players Shenar and Victoria Tennant ultimately end up with not that much to do and Shenar's character is not what you'd call subtle. Other fine players in the movie include George Coe Anne Pitoniak Mary Carver Sully Boyar Kathleen Lloyd and Charles Tyner with a too brief uncredited appearance by Seymour Cassel as one of the bodyguards. Reasonably engrossing with an ending that at least isn't 100 predictable although some viewers may not find it terribly satisfying. But the interplay between two experienced and reliable movie stars makes it all worthwhile. Seven out of 10.".

A powerful corporate businessman had CleveWoods on his payroll removing anyone who stood in his way towards amassing an empire and power.The idea of a cop and criminal joining forces certainly intrigued me which is why I got hooked by the premise. Planted in my mind was how trustworthy could a man such as Cleve be. He's been a hired killer for a considerable amount of time and thanks to a supposed falling out with the boss all of a sudden he wants this cop to write a best seller about their notorious business relationship. Cleve spends time trying to convince Dennehy' cynical cop Dennis Meecham that he's a legitimate killer for MadlockPaul Shenar..of course Dennis has a right to be skeptical. When cigarette burns and a knife wound reveal Cleve as the man who shot him in '72 Dennis decides to punch him in the chops a few times before writing the novel. This will be the chance to stare into the abyss and pen the memoir of a bonafide assassin.Woods and Dennehy are quite a pair and could make any material worthwhile and we have a chance to see the complex relationship of two men on opposite sides of the law no matter how unrealistic such a story might seem. Woods is at times scary and charismatic and we see his dark side emerge on more than one occasionsuch as the scene where he visits Dennis' publisher particularly when he's at what he does best killing..and he does so unflinchingly without batting an eye. As is often the case Dennis' daughter HollyAllison Balson is pulled into the whole mess her life in possible danger.What's interesting to me is how Cleve so desires for his image to be portrayed differently not as a cold blooded murderforhire but as a hero. He may just get the chance when Madlock kidnaps Dennis' daughter in order for the novel to be put out of commission. I think Woods is so electrifying that the movie even if it has flaws is worth seeing for him alone. Dennehy is just fine as the honest cop with a true moral code who often conflicts with Woods' abrasive methods. I dug their friction and eventual if maybe a bit illogical friendship. This partnership truly I think adds a compelling ingredient to BEST SELLER because of the unusual alliance of such totally different people with completely opposite ideals. Truly bizarre is the scene where Dennis meets Cleve's family. It ends as expected with Madlock offering to return Holly in exchange for his name not being muddied by a scandalous book with Cleve bound and determined to kill his former employer once and for all. As I had mentioned before when Cleve confronts Dennis' publisher we see two sides to him how convincing he can be in order to make an impression and his passion in the way he's viewed in the novelhe was initially in the house to secure Dennis' manuscript but decides to leave the publisher with a little reminder of why he's the best at his job the tearyeyed mascara and torn dresses from her closet are more than enough for lasting impact as to his seriousness regarding how the novel relates him to the readers.".

He asks Dennis to work with him giving him his people on a platter while also giving him heaps info for him to write a book on him and the baddies. Dennehy also grasping an opportunity to gain revenge. It's no holds barred Woods even pestered by Dennehy to meet his parents. As you know to write non fiction a lot of research is involved. Somehow I found this movie utterly enjoyable from beginning to end on the account it's different although I enjoyed Wood's other film at the time Cop more. They're are some unpredictabilities in the characters which I found engrossing with an end I found tragic on Woods's behalf. Wood's character especially is a dangerous guy you don't underestimate as you really don't know what this dude's capable of. And as I'll reiterate Wood's excessive use of violence by gun kind of spoils it. It was fun watching Cleve itching to know or being suggestive of how the books going it's overused title a bit of a let down. One scene that really didn't make sense was Woods barging into Dennehy's agents bedroom and tearing up her wardrobe getting fresh and dangerous with her. Check out the fitting song too. It's not bad.

And speaking of the daughter played by Allison Balsonher performance can only be described as unbelievable and not in a good way either. Victoria Tennent's relationship with Dennehy is another loose end that is really never explored. Best Seller is nothing more than a very contrived script with two good actors mostly wasted.  MERK";

So when the shadowy Cleve approaches him with an offer he at least listens. Cleve suggests that he has been a hitman for years on behalf of a large corporation and wants to use the book to hit back at his former employers. Dennis is convinced after an attempt on Cleve's life and begins to spend time with Cleve to interview him and get material for the book however the relationship is never an easy one.Kudos to the film for trying to have a talky character driven script at its core but sadly it never really works. The central character dynamic is interesting but never really convincing because I didn't feel that the characters had sufficient drawn between them to counter the repulsion and using Dennis' debts was a lazy device in my opinion. This leaves the following relationship on a level that is never much better than solid although as such I did still find it engaging. Not as interesting as I would have liked though which did somewhat take away from the tension at the end of the film because I didn't get the feeling that there was a head of steam built up. The action sections also undermine it they are not that well done but nor do they fit into the narrative that well and they just seem to be another force holding the film from being smarter than it was.The central performances don't really help much either although they are both good enough to hold the interest. Woods occasionally suggests he will go deeper into his character but mostly he is happy with hitman cool with a touch of twisted humanity in him. As per normal Dennehy gives a solid rock of a performance but never does anything that remarkable or interesting with it. Small supporting roles for Tennant and Shenar don't really do much and the film is carried in the safe hands of the lead pair.Overall then a solid enough film that is distracting. Occasionally it seems to have the chance to do more but then it never really does settling instead just for an average approach that is OK but nothing that memorable.".

	schema:headline " Enjoyable twist on the buddy cop film";
	schema:reviewBody "What would you do if a selfproclaimed hit man came to you and demanded you write an expose on his former employer? If you're like Brian Dennehy's Officer Dennis Meacham naturally you would be suspicious of these claims. In this underrated action thriller the unlikely partnership of Dennehy's Meacham to James Woods' brutal former hit man Cleve provides an unusual take on the traditional buddy cop film. Woods' performance as the brash snarky and revengeseeking Cleve contrasts with the methodical and ethical performance of Brian Dennehy as Dennis Meacham keeping the polar opposite clich of past buddy cop movies intact. However as the film carries on the dynamics of the partnership between Meacham and Cleve begins to form a strange almost symbiotic bond between the two men. Meacham still does not approve of Cleve's lethal tactics but respects the necessity for offing the dangers that shadow them. The majority of the film's entertainment value belongs to the dynamic performance of James Woods as he steals the scene in nearly film he is a part of. As Cleve Woods mixes brutal unflinching violence with his trademark charm and sarcastic wit but he does not make Cleve one dimensional instead he endows the hit man with emotion an ability to reach out and attempt to connect with the cop he shot at years earlier. Cleve's most prime example of human emotion features prominently in the film's final act as Meacham and Cleve confront Cleve's former boss and Cleve has to choose whether to risk an innocent life or his own. His ultimate sacrifice in the end shows the former killer as a hero who does get the redemption he seeks saving the innocent daughter of Meacham while giving up his own life.The story itself is pretty generic for an '80s thriller with shootouts and a bit of a body count. However there is enough humor thrown in to get the viewer to connect with the characters and if you're an action fan the chase scenes and the gun battles will keep you in the game. So give this movie a shot if you want something different instead of your run of the mill action thriller.".

Sure Dennehy and Woods work well with what they are given. But it is what they are given that is the problem.Best Seller is filled with that would never happen moments which is fine if the premise is not to take it seriously. But there is every indication that this film wants to be a believable thriller.Cleve's James Woods story would best be told from behind bars but for some reason Dennis Brian Dennehy allows Cleve to drag him all over the country in an attempt to prove that he was once a hitman working for David Madlock so that Dennis can write a book about it. And along the way Dennis discovers that Cleve is the one who shot him and a couple of his fellow officers in a robbery of a police evidence room 15 years earlier. Despite his knowledge that Cleve is indeed a dangerous killer the fact that Dennis proceeds to share a hotel suite visit Cleve's parents home where Cleve puts a gun to Dennis' head in the middle of the night or generally has anything to do with him outside of a jail cell is really absurd. Of course the book will reveal the criminal empire of David Madlock. So naturally Madlock is doing everything he can to prevent Dennis from publishing it. So while he is out of town doing additional research would Dennis be so foolish to leave the mostly finished manuscript with his teenage daughter alone at home? Apparently so.There are many other examples but my main point is that Best Seller is a cheesy 80's thriller with its share of plot holes along with decent performances by most of the cast with the exception of Allison Balson  her acting was fine for Little House on the Prairie  but not so much here.So if you sit down to watch this movie don't bring your disbelief or high expectations with you.

No I wasn't. I later found out that the director John Flynn had heavily rewritten the script. It felt like it. This movie did not feel like a Larry Cohen film. This felt like a generic action film from the 80s with a very genial performance from James Woods. He was fairly good in this movie. This is hokey and then it takes a meta moment where James Woods asks Brian Dennehy to make him sympathetic in the book and eventually he becomes a more sympathetic person in the movie itself. I imagine there are moments here that clearly came from Larry Cohen's mind. That is probably one of them. The other performances in the movie leave a lot to desired including Brian Dennehy. He was a dull main character and he paled in comparison to James Woods even when they start to go for those odd couple moments.

To get the story right they travel around the country to gather statements and evidence while strong forces use any means they can to keep the story untold.Larry Cohen wrote the original script inspired by the film Strangers on a Train 1951 and wrote it with Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas in mind for the lead roles. The project was in development at a number of studios for years before Orion decided to make it. Of course by then Lancaster and Douglas were getting a bit old.Apparently Cohen has mixed feelings on how his script translated into the finished product. That is his right but really this is a strong film and really deserves much more acclaim than it generally gets. Not perfect but still a darn good film with two wonderful leading men.".

	onyx:emotionText "Hit man Cleve approaches writer Dennis about a story for his next book how he made a living working for one of the most powerful politicians in the country. To get the story right they travel around the country to gather statements and evidence while strong forces use any means they can to keep the story untold.Larry Cohen wrote the original script inspired by the film Strangers on a Train 1951 and wrote it with Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas in mind for the lead roles. The project was in development at a number of studios for years before Orion decided to make it. Of course by then Lancaster and Douglas were getting a bit old.Apparently Cohen has mixed feelings on how his script translated into the finished product. That is his right but really this is a strong film and really deserves much more acclaim than it generally gets. Not perfect but still a darn good film with two wonderful leading men.";

These are the kinds of film experiences I thrive on that I live for and Best Seller was that kind of experience a film that just took me completely by surprise.

First and foremost the film is only as strong as it is for 2 important reasons James Woods and Brian Dennehy. It's as if this film and better yet the script was specifically written with them in mind. They're just fantastic in this both bringing their very unique brand of toughguy machismo to their roles. It's perfect casting if there ever was such a thing.Mid 80's grittiness brought to life. John Flynn's impeccable direction serves the film extremely well and after seeing this it's no surprise he would follow this up with films like Stallone's Lock Up and Seagal's Out for Justice. His particular brand of gritty gives the film an overall sense of dread and bravado almost as if the film's style serves as another character of the film. Even watching this in full frame on VHS didn't take away from it's visual impact.Razor sharp intensity. Genre writerdirector Larry Cohen Maniac Cop Q The Winged Serpent It's Alive writes the film as he's writing a hardboiled detective novel. It's a detective story in a sense but a different one altogether. Instead of a cop investigating a series of crimes or murders you have a copauthor who's investigating a supposed hitman and his past deeds to basically call bullshit to his claims of high profile murders yet Cohen plots the film in such a way that it feels like you're watching an old school detective thriller about a cop tracking down a serial killer. It's brilliant and intensely effective.The score packs a punch. Jay Ferguson delivers one helluva brilliant synth score for a film who's score would normally be the last thing you would notice. But much like John Flynn's direction Ferguson's score serves as yet another character to the film giving it a moody atmosphere that screams 80's synth but in the best possible way. I loved it so much in fact that I immediately set out to try and track it down only to discover that it may never have even gotten an official release as a soundtrack. I could be wrong though and if I am please feel free to correct me. I need this soundtrack in my life because it's that good. HELP!The Bad There is no bad. Much like my experience watching Shoot to Kill this is another solid example of the perfect 80's thriller. I didn't find a single thing I would change with this film.

	schema:headline " Surprisingly Good Tom and Jerry Movie";
	schema:reviewBody "This review contains some spoilers. I cringed when I heard that a new Tom  Jerry movie had been made and released to video. The cat and mouse's track record since William Hanna and Joseph Barbera left MGM hasn't been very hot. Chuck Jones and his animators were okay but only made a few standout shorts  there were some awful T  J cartoons made in the 1970's and there was the unpleasant Tom and Jerry Kids. Oh and don't forget the disastrous universally panned Tom and Jerry The Movie.' With this uneasy mindset I sat down to watch The Magic Ring' with my fangs bared and claws ready to shred. But to my surprise The Magic Ring was actually good giving us new things while honoring what fans love about the duo's past. The plot is so simple it is hard to believe they managed to stretch it to a whopping 62 minutes. Tom is ordered by his owner who happens to be a wizard to guard a ring until he gets back from a trip. As Tom is standing guard Jerry gets his hands on the ring and jokingly fits it over his head. The ring gets stuck and Tom naturally chases Jerry to get the ring back. They wind up taking the chase into the city where various characters come out of the woodwork and join in wanting either the ring Jerry or Tom. And that is everything. What's interesting is that while the gags aren't nearly as good as most of the classic shorts they aren't at all groaninducing. Many are actually quite funny seeing as how whenever the ring is nudged a magical beam of light will emit and cause a mishap. Even better is the appearance of a bunch of familiar faces. Spike  Tyke Droopy and Nibbles all show up in the film. They even threw in a likeness of Jerry's cousin Muscles here a different character named Freddie. The best added character is Butch the Irishaccented dog that vied with Droopy in some great MGM cartoons. He's voiced by the wonderful ManofaMillionVoices Jim Cummings one of the best vocal performers ever. Just to let you know The Magic Ring' isn't all magical. While its simplicity is majestic it is also a problem. Development in the beginning would have been helpful for instance. The wizard is interesting. They deck him in an outfit and give him a voice that are so silly no one would fear him. It is the perfect touch except that his face is never visible. But it never really makes sense why he gave Tom the ring instead of taking it along on his trip. And I also could have done without seeing a carbon copy of the ending of the1949 Tex Avery classic Bad Luck Blackie.'  But kids won't care about these things and most older people won't mind them much either. There is one major gripe I have though. The makers of The Magic Ring' were wise to avoid the huge mistake of Tom and Jerry The Movie' when it came to letting our silent duo speak. However we do get to hear Tom and Jerry make some sounds. Tom voiced by Jeff Bennett was perfect usually restricted to cries of pain or laughter reminiscent of the Chuck Jones era. Jerry however makes far too much noise. Whenever he sees Tom he lets out an annoying shout. Frank Welker is another one of the alltime great voice actors and I love hearing him in cartoons but his Jerry cries get old very fast. The worst comes in the film's only terrible scene where Jerry is sitting on a curb looking at various stores to generate ideas on how to get the ring off his head. Not only are the ideas in this thought balloons unfunny but he ends the thought by saying No no no no!' in a very annoying manner each time. Still I was impressed that someone managed to pull off a good updating of Tom and Jerry with the past history being studied to see how not to make Tom and Jerry come to life. I am glad I watched The Magic Ring' and I welcome more from this production team. Just as long as Tom and Jerry don't start talking again. Score 8 out of 10.".

But to my surprise The Magic Ring was actually good giving us new things while honoring what fans love about the duo's past. The plot is so simple it is hard to believe they managed to stretch it to a whopping 62 minutes. Tom is ordered by his owner who happens to be a wizard to guard a ring until he gets back from a trip. As Tom is standing guard Jerry gets his hands on the ring and jokingly fits it over his head. The ring gets stuck and Tom naturally chases Jerry to get the ring back. They wind up taking the chase into the city where various characters come out of the woodwork and join in wanting either the ring Jerry or Tom. And that is everything. What's interesting is that while the gags aren't nearly as good as most of the classic shorts they aren't at all groaninducing. Many are actually quite funny seeing as how whenever the ring is nudged a magical beam of light will emit and cause a mishap. Even better is the appearance of a bunch of familiar faces. Spike  Tyke Droopy and Nibbles all show up in the film. They even threw in a likeness of Jerry's cousin Muscles here a different character named Freddie. The best added character is Butch the Irishaccented dog that vied with Droopy in some great MGM cartoons. He's voiced by the wonderful ManofaMillionVoices Jim Cummings one of the best vocal performers ever. Just to let you know The Magic Ring' isn't all magical. While its simplicity is majestic it is also a problem. Development in the beginning would have been helpful for instance. The wizard is interesting. They deck him in an outfit and give him a voice that are so silly no one would fear him. It is the perfect touch except that his face is never visible. But it never really makes sense why he gave Tom the ring instead of taking it along on his trip. And I also could have done without seeing a carbon copy of the ending of the1949 Tex Avery classic Bad Luck Blackie.'  But kids won't care about these things and most older people won't mind them much either. There is one major gripe I have though. The makers of The Magic Ring' were wise to avoid the huge mistake of Tom and Jerry The Movie' when it came to letting our silent duo speak. However we do get to hear Tom and Jerry make some sounds. Tom voiced by Jeff Bennett was perfect usually restricted to cries of pain or laughter reminiscent of the Chuck Jones era. Jerry however makes far too much noise. Whenever he sees Tom he lets out an annoying shout. Frank Welker is another one of the alltime great voice actors and I love hearing him in cartoons but his Jerry cries get old very fast. The worst comes in the film's only terrible scene where Jerry is sitting on a curb looking at various stores to generate ideas on how to get the ring off his head. Not only are the ideas in this thought balloons unfunny but he ends the thought by saying No no no no!' in a very annoying manner each time. Still I was impressed that someone managed to pull off a good updating of Tom and Jerry with the past history being studied to see how not to make Tom and Jerry come to life. I am glad I watched The Magic Ring' and I welcome more from this production team. Just as long as Tom and Jerry don't start talking again. Score 8 out of 10.";

	schema:reviewBody "One of Robert Aldrich's classic war movies explores pyschological pressure and just how war effects men mentally. Even the good guys have their bad sides and the bad guys are so screwed up you either sympathize with them or hate them. During the fall of 1944 Captain Cooney Eddie Albert commands a weary infantry company. Lt. Costa a young Jack Palance realizes that Cooney is unfit for command when he freezes in combat. Costa and close friend Lt. Woodruff Bill Smithers try to inform their superior Colonel Bartlett Lee Marvin sporting a southern drawl of Cooney's incompetence instead White wants to stay out of the way and hopes for the best. He owes Cooney a chance to become a hero so he can look good back home. Well as you might have expected Cooney again freezes in combat this time costing the lives of several of Costa's men  and Costa goes looking for vengeance in an awesome climactic sequence. The supporting cast is dotted with familiar faces including Robert Strass from STALAG 17 as an oafish emotional dogface the late Buddy Ebsen BETWEEN HEAVEN AND HELL as Costa's loyal platoon sergeant and Richard Jaeckel who's appeared in at least a dozen war flicks as another young soldier. Kudos to Bill Smithers who does a fantastic job in an early role as Costa's rational friend. His final scene will leave you stunned and reeling. The movie features a number of memorable scenes which combine physical action superb dialog and emotion perfectly. One scene in which a mortally wounded Jack Palance prays that God will let him live long enough to kill Cooney is gutwrenching. Interestingly both Cooney and Costa have lost their grip on sanity. It's clear from the beginning that Cooney is a whackjob and Costa is perfectly sane. But he becomes madly no pun intended obsessed with killing Cooney that he forgets everything else  including his own men which is fighting to save. Instead of focusing on thousands of troops and big explosions Aldrich delivers enough punch in his smallscale story to knock you down. Interiors and exteriors are beautifully shot confining the action within small spaces to deliver maximum intensity and efficiency. ATTACK! is an honest film  yes this type of thing did happen read or see BAND OF BROTHERS particularly episode 7 to witness a brutally accurate account of flawed leadership resulting in disaster. I give an 1110.".

	schema:reviewBody "Above average war film with Jack Palance's snarling ferocity as a revengeful officer along with Eddie Albert as a coward captain both of whom give excellent performances along with the remaining cast . 1944  Belgium  Battle of Bugle  during the closing days of WWII a National Guard Infantry Company is assigned the task of setting up artillery observation posts in a strategic area . Lieutenant Costa splendid Jack Palance as platoon leader knows that Cooney Eddie Albert in real life he served in WW II was a war hero in one engagement having braved heavy enemy fire to rescue 70 wounded Marines is in command only because of his friendship to a colonel Lee Marvin and other connections he had made with Highcommand . As captain Cooney is ordered to move one of his platoons into a forward position . They  then are slowly surrounded by a Nazi army . As Costa has serious doubts concerning Cooneys' ability to lead the group . Lt. Costa calls headquarters for reinforcements but Cooney won't commit his reserves even as the platoon is decimated  then Costa swears vendetta .This is a bitter war drama that packs thrills  chills  intense battle of wits among two officials and many other things . This has an antiwar argument  though not the usual 'war is hell' but the terribly corrupting influence that war can have on the most normal average human beings  and the terrible things it makes them capable of that they wouldn't be capable of otherwise . Interesting picture with excellent screenplay by James Poe based on a play titled Fragile Fox by Norman Brooks  dealing with an expert portrayal of men in war under pressure . It is a war movie as frankly good that when it was shown as the Venice Festival a U.S. ambassador walked in protest for its unAmericanism and antipatriotism  in fact  US Department of Defense and the US Army refused to assist with the production of this movie based on its film script . After reading the script the military flatly refused to allow any cooperation with the production  that meant no tanks no uniforms no troops  they didn't even allow director to view any Signal Corps footage .

Very good acting from Jack Palance who dominates the picture with a tremendously acting  though sometimes overacting  and Eddie Albert as cowardly captain Cooney who refuses to reenforce him . Two of the lead cast in this Robert Aldrich war film of the Second World War Richard Jaeckel and Lee Marvin would go onto appear in the same director's later hugely successful World War II war movie Dirty Dozen .

Well made on the RKO lot in only 35 days for a minimal budget of 750000 . The motion picture was stunningly realized by Robert Aldrich who gave a tense and brilliant direction . Aldrich began writing and directing for TV series in the early 1950s and directed his first feature in 1953 Big Leaguer 1953.

Jack Palance always seems so suited for sinister type roles but here he gets a chance to play a character you can sympathize with even though there is a still a dark edge to his character. He is very good in this film and here is my spoiler no one in the history of film making has ever played a corpse better than Palance in this film.Eddie Albert is so effective as the cowardly weasel Capt. Cooney that it took years for me to enjoy any other roles that he had later on. He made that much of an impression. It took a couple of years of Green Acres to wipe the association of Albert's Capt. Cooney from my mind whenever viewing him.Lee Marvin delivers just what you would expect from his role. Nasty fellow that Colonel. Totally selfserving.The rest of the squad form up a great little ensemble. I don't think that people realize just how talented Buddy Ebsen really was. While everyone else gives an edgy performance here he balances the whole thing with a subtle low keyed approach. Robert Strauss probably best known as Animal in Stalag 17 has little room to yuk it up in this film although he does have a couple of zingers. He is still one of those people that any time you see them you can't help but smile. And what can I say about Richard Jaeckel? Was there A WWII film made from the mid 40s through the 60s that Jaeckel WAS NOT in? A fixture in the genre. I wonder what the play that this film is based upon was like.".

Eddie Albert one of the most likable actors normally known for playing lovable goodguys her he delivers a character you will just love to hate.3. Lee Marvin no comment necessary one of the very few screen actor from the raw school of coolness where his only competition was that of Steve McQueen James Coburn and Charles Bronson.4. Robert Strauss who like in the classic Stalag 17 again gives us some welcomed comic relief well mixed with drama and first rate acting.5. Buddy Ebsen excellent and always abovepar whether it was as 'Doc' in Breakfast at Tiffany's or TV's 'Barnaby Jones' and 'Jed Clampett' of The Beverly Hillbillies.6. Richard Jaeckel who's fine career spanned from this through hits like The Dirty Dozen and all the way to uhm... Baywatch!7. William Smithers who despite this starmaking film debut as the REAL main character of the movie oddly enough never seemed to top this role somehow he is credited last here on the IMDb probably because his name is the last to show up during the opening titles with an And introducing attached to it.The whole shabang is directed by the great Robert Aldrich who really deserves credit for this one as I am sure this story of a US Army officer struck by cowardice during WW2 was hard to stomach for some people just 11 years after the big one ended. Aldrich would go on the direct one of the granddaddy's of guysonamissionmovies the before mentioned The Dirty Dozen 1967. Not surprisingly Aldrich would work with many of the above listed actors on several occasions which is another testament to the sturdy cast of Attack.All these forces combined  in front off and behind the camera  results in a memorable ride through the darkest corners of the human soul mixed with some thrilling battle scenes. As this is originally based on a play it might seem a bit talky to some but wait for the first hour to pass and then it will suddenly explode in drama and firstrate acting. The many confrontations these characters have are all so intense they actually make you forget all the solid action scenes!Definitely one of the most important Hollywoodcontributions exploring the drama of war worth adding to your WW2collection!".

That's the movie supposedly set during the Ardennes campaign in Belguim but instead of seeing snow shrouded forests we're led to believe the conflict took place on dusty desert plains . Unfortunately with ATTACK director Robert Aldrich makes a similar error in geography and weather conditions . There's no snow to be seen  Apart from some fake snow in one scene  there's no forests and you do get the feeling the movie was filmed on a hot summers day no matter how the cast try and convince you other wise . In fact I felt rather sorry for the actors dressed in heavy greatcoats jumping up and down trying to get into character and it's interesting to note that by half way through the movie everyone has stopped in their vain attempts trying to convince the audience it's a very cold day That said ATTACK is a very impressive war drama  and please note I used the word drama in the last sentence . It's based on a play but unlike a lot of movies based on plays that often use flashback to tell the tale the roots of the source is hidden  this actually feels cinematic . The movie centres around the conflict Lt Costa who blames his commanding officer Captain Cooney for getting his platoon wiped out . The human drama of cowardice and command and the motive of revenge feature very heavily . It should also be pointed out how well Captain Cooney is written and played by Eddie Albert  he's relatively sympathetic as a weak man who seems caught up in things outside his control though at the end he does become a sort of melodramtic carichture . The whole cast do a good job and the scenes with Lee Marvin and Eddie Albert together are superb . It's such a pity no one seems to make war movies this intelligent anymore".

	schema:reviewBody "Having liked a lot of Jack Palance and Lee Marvin's work and after hearing Attack described as one of the best films for both actors I watched Attack with high expectations...and fortunately was not let down at all.Attack may not fit the definition of visually stunning but it's very professionally photographed is shot in crisp black and white that still looks good now and the claustrophobic production values are entirely appropriate for the atmosphere and setting of the film and come off very effectively. The score drives the action well and doesn't feel out of place or cheesy.The script is poignant hardhitting and remarkably honest without trying too hard it gets a touch melodramatic towards the end but not dreadfully so just in comparison to the rest of the film. Attack also has a very compelling story with actionwar scenes that pulsate with intensity and suspense emotional moments that are genuinely heartwrenching rather than overwrought and Palance's climatic scene has got to be one of the most harrowing in a war film. While Attack may have unpleasant characters it doesn't neglect to make them interesting and in the end these unattractive characters are also ones that are easy to care for and relate to ones where it is also easy to understand their actions. It's very skilfully directed by Robert Aldrich who never lets the tension slip and makes the story constantly engrossing while avoiding the dangerous traps it could easily have fallen into.Lastly to say that the cast are very strong is an understatement the acting is topnotch and there are a few careerbests here. Coming off particularly well is Jack Palance who has never been better in an unforgettably gutwrenching portrayal and while Lee Marvin has had meatier characters in his career he still gives his role here his usual steely intensity. Eddie Albert is skincrawlingly good too while his character is a weasel and malevolent at times in the second half of the film it was surprising at the amount of sympathy I felt for him. Buddy Ebsen is impressive and William Smithers plays one of the film's most sympathetic characters very believably to the extent that one wonders why he didn't do more films.To conclude an unforgettably powerful film that has the acting and its emotional impact as its main strengths. 910 Bethany Cox".

What is undeniable is that Robert Aldrich brought out the best of Jack Palance this is one of two films they made together back to back in 1956 and both are outstanding. Coincidentally both were adapted from stage plays though Cliff Odet's 'The Big Knife' enjoyed by far the highest profile of the two in theatrical terms. It's fun trying to speculate which of the several interiors Brooks used in his play but what Poe has done is to weave together seamlessly 'action' and dialogue and the result is a nearperfect movie. War of course is only a convenient backdrop for the exploration of human nature in extremis with at one end of the spectrum Costa's Palancecourage and humane love of the men under his command and at the other Cooney's Eddie Albert moral bankruptcy and cowardice. Approaching the centre of the spectrum from either ends are Lee Marvin's Clyde Bartlett overall commander of the company who is more than aware of Albert's failings but needs his clout Cooney's father is a judge back home to further his postwar political aspirations and William Smither's Woodruff in complete accord with Palance and it must be said the entire platoon in both contempt for and hatred of Albert but much prefers to approach things through channels and 'by the book' rather than take a confrontational 'handson' stance like Palance. This is a great film on any level in which you care to judge it and in tandem with The Big Knife marks the apex of both Adrich's and Palance's careers.".

War of course is only a convenient backdrop for the exploration of human nature in extremis with at one end of the spectrum Costa's Palancecourage and humane love of the men under his command and at the other Cooney's Eddie Albert moral bankruptcy and cowardice. Approaching the centre of the spectrum from either ends are Lee Marvin's Clyde Bartlett overall commander of the company who is more than aware of Albert's failings but needs his clout Cooney's father is a judge back home to further his postwar political aspirations and William Smither's Woodruff in complete accord with Palance and it must be said the entire platoon in both contempt for and hatred of Albert but much prefers to approach things through channels and 'by the book' rather than take a confrontational 'handson' stance like Palance. This is a great film on any level in which you care to judge it and in tandem with The Big Knife marks the apex of both Adrich's and Palance's careers.";

	schema:reviewBody "By the mid 1950's many of the men who had fought on the front lines in World War II had reached an age where they could look back on their service in the war and honestly discuss some of the very unheroic things they had experienced. This new maturity manifested first in literature like Herman Wouk's THE CAINE MUTINY and James Jones's FROM HERE TO ETERNITY both made into excellent movies. ATTACK which came out in 1956 is based on a stage play and it dealt with the enormously corrupting effect the brutality of war has on the men who fight it the movie turned out to be tough stuff for its time and more than holds up after all these decades.The main reason ATTACK still resonates is because it was directed by the great Robert Aldrich a master film maker who knew how to make great entertainments while never pulling his punches when it came to the brutal aspects of his stories and was equally at home directing war movies like ATTACK melodramas like THE BIG KNIFE westerns like VERA CRUZ and ULZANA'S RAID or psychological horror films such as WHATEVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE and HUSHHUSH SWEET CHARLOTTE. The man knew what he wanted and how to get it all up there on the movie screen. ATTACK is not an epic on the same level as BATTLEGROUND or the much later SAVING PRIVATE RYAN its scope is small mainly because Aldrich's production company could not procure cooperation from the Pentagon because they had understandable problems with the script. But this ground level view of the war in Europe perfectly suit's the story of an infantry unit saddled with a cowardly commander whose incompetence is as much a threat to the men he leads as the German Whermacht. When orders compel the badly fatigued soldiers to advance into an enemy held town the ensuing carnage causes long held back tensions to explode as one Lieutenant turns upon his Captain with murderous fury. It all ends in a gripping final scene set in a basement as the GI's hide from the advancing Germans where men pushed to their limits do what they have to do.ATTACK is filled with some to the finest tough guys and character stars of its time starting with Jack Palance as Lt. Costa a brave soldier on the battlefield who is tired of suffering the ineptitude of his immediate superior and Lee Marvin as Colonel Clyde Bartlett an officer with his eyes already fixed on a post war political career. In between them is Eddie Albert's Captain Cooney the useless son of an important Kentucky politician a man so utterly unfit for the responsibility placed upon him that he curls up on his bed when the German's attack. This is one of Palance's finest performances worthy of an Oscar nomination it is notable in that Palance one of the great scenery chewers really underplays it here until his final agonized confrontation with Albert in the cellar. Eddie Albert had a long very versatile career often playing nice guys and sidekicks to bigger stars but he had a knack for portraying unsympathetic characters as well and his Erskine Cooney was one of his best examples of the lattera man who won't even try to over come his weaknesses who would rather surrender to the Germans than face the risk of combat. Palance Albert and Marvin were decorated veterans Albert winning a Bronze Star for bravery at Tarawa. It's obvious their wartime experiences infuse their work here.The supporting cast include a lot of familiar faces such as Buddy Ebsen as a capable Sergeant gravelly voiced Robert Strauss playing a variation of the character he played in STALAG 17 Richard Jaeckel playing essentially the same soldier he played in at least a half dozen other war films. Strother Martin turns up briefly and German born Peter Van Eyck playing an SS officer was a naturalized American citizen who served in the US Army during the war. William Smithers plays Palance's fellow Lieutenant who ultimately faces a difficult choice in the end between doing what is expedient or doing what is right.The BW cinematography by Joseph Biroc who worked often with Aldrich is superb there is also some terrific dialog that hits with effect of a bullet Captain down around where I come from we dearly love our whiskey. But we don't drink with another man unless we respect him. A few years later Ebsen and Albert would be starring in The Beverly Hilbillies and Green Acres two of CBS's top rated rural comedies material about as far from ATTACK as they could get. Marvin would go on to work with Aldrich several times most notably in THE DIRTY DOZEN interestingly his Colonel Bartlett swaggering in his spotless uniform gives us the only hint what his PATTON might have looked likehe was the producers first choice for the role but Marvin passed on the part. Smithers would go on to do a lot of work on TV most memorably a decade later on a classic episode of Star Trek where he played a Star Fleet officer who unlike his officer in ATTACK does not do his duty. Albert and Aldrich would reunite when he played the Warden in THE LONGEST YARD.Many of the reviewers for ATTACK on IMDb mention how they first saw this movie as a kid on TV and how it made a strong impression on them. It has some of the strongest scenes in any war movie of its time especially the part where a German tank roles over a screaming Palance's arm and pins him there. I can attest that this stuff not BAMBI was what we wanted to watch when we were young boys. It has been called a forgotten film but not by anybody who has seen it.".

Compare that with the sitation in the '60s when the film was made and with the situation now in the western democracies.Anthony Eden was another major surprise. The popular image of him now is of a buffoon the man who screwed up Suez but in the extended interview here he displays immense charisma intelligence and humanity. And if they make a film of his life Jeremy Irons is a shooin for the role.The Nazis meanwhile are clearly cut from the same cloth as the neofascists presently enjoying something of a resurgence in most of Europe. All the same arguments made in exactly the same way by the same sort of people. This plus the smugness of the former Wehrmacht officer still wearing his medals was probably the most chilling thing about the film.The final obvious resonance is with Iraq. From the German soldiers baffled and outraged by the fact that some French were trying to kill them to the French establishment referring to the Resistance as terrorists yes that was the exact word they used to the initial acceptance of the Occupation turning to hatred as reprisals against the Resistance grew many testimonies throw a radically new light on the present situation. To draw direct parallels would be a mistake  even the Gaullists were not as reactionary as Zarqawi or Muqtada al Sadr  but nonetheless there is a lot to learn from then about now and about the difference between how events are perceived at the time and by History.Another user comment complains about the amount of politics in the film. It's true that some knowledge is presupposed and the film would obviously mean more to those who lived through those times. However Ophuls has said that one of his main motivations was to show that the idea that you can divorce politics from everyday life is exactly what made collaboration possible.These are just a few of the thoughts provoked by the film which holds many more insights and surprises and I am sure repays as many viewings as Alvy Singer gave it. It's perhaps not as shocking or affecting as Shoah on which it's surely the strongest influence but then it's a different story. It shows us the best of humanity as well as the worst and neither are always where you might expect to find them.Incidentally it looks like the reportedly poor quality of the DVD may be down to the original film stock rather than the transfer.".

	schema:headline " The Greatest Documentary Film Ever Made";
	schema:reviewBody "The Sorrow and the Pity is not only the greatest documentary film ever made but also one of the greatest films of any kind. A straightforward description of the film seems to promise limitless boredom more than four hours of talkinghead interviews in at least three different languages blended with old wartime footage and occasional clips from the likes of Maurice Chevalier. But Ophls' mastery of film technique allows him to create a thinkingperson's masterpiece from these seemingly mundane parts. He interviews people who experienced the Occupation in the late 60s when the film was being made many of them were still alive. Some are famous big names of history such as Pierre MendesFrance imprisoned during the war Premier of France later in life and Sir Anthony Eden a British prime minister in the mid50s. But even these men are noteworthy more for their actions as regular folks than as statesmen and the true stars of the movie are the various common men who tell their personal stories. The Grave brothers for instance local farmers who fought in the Resistance are as far as one might get from JeanPaul Belmondo but their pleasure with life and their remembrances of friends and foes during the Occupation establish them as real life heroes.Thirty years down the road Ophls' methodology is as interesting as the history he tells. Merely claiming that Ophls had an argument seems to work against the surface of his film for he disguises his point of view his argument behind the reminiscing of his interview subjects. The film is a classic of humanist culture in large part because Ophls in giving the people the chance to say their piece apparently puts his faith in those people and in the audience that watches them to impart truth. However the filmmaker is much cannier than this he is not artless. The editing of the various perspectives in the movie allows the viewer to form conclusions of their own that don't always match those of the people who are doing the talking in the film. In fact The Sorrow and the Pity makes great demands on the viewer not just because of the film's length Ophls assumes you are processing the information he's providing and so the film gets better as it progresses with the viewer's attention being rewarded in direct correlation with the effort you put in.And Ophls is himself the primary interviewer in the film you don't often actually see him but he's there asking the questions leading on his subjects and his audience only partly hidden visually and philosophically from view. The movie might look easy there are none of the showy flourishes of a Kubrick or Stone here or of Max Ophls for that matter. But the viewer is advised to remember that Ophls' guiding hand is always in the background constructing the film's version of the truth just as the characters do in their stories.".

	schema:headline " The Best World War II Film I've Seen";
	schema:reviewBody "I bought the DVD version of THE SORROW AND THE PITY not so much because I wanted to watch it but because as with many other classic films I felt I should.  At 4 hours long I could never quite muster the will to screen it with the end result that this film sat on my shelf for months before I finally gathered the courage to watch it last night.  My original plan had been to screen the first disc one night then watch the rest after a decent interval of recovery.  I quite frankly expected to be bored to death watching hours on end of interviews in French.Boy was I wrong.  This turned out to be one of the most engrossing films I've seen.  Yes it is too long.  But you're willing to forgive it that. This is simply the best film I've seen on World War II.  Numerous interviews with French politicians teachers shop keepers peasants hoteliers and more along with ones of Germans and Englishmen gave one of the most revealing and human portraits of World War II  and of the French people  I've seen.  Combined with included archival footage from the war this made for what is clearly one of the great all time documentaries and greatest WWII films I've seen.TSATP draws you in right away and really never lets up.  Almost every interview enlightens in some way.  Everybody talking has their own agenda  spin in modern parlance  but the director is able to combine these in a way that exposes the most blantant of falsehoods and also paints a realistic composite portrait.  The Nazi propaganda films were also chilling.  One early example is a film of black and arabic French soldiers captured by the Nazis with the implication that racial impurity led to the French demise.I could go on and on about this but I think I'm running out of room and need to talk about the DVD.  I highly recommend this film for anyone who  wants to go beyond history book versions of the war.As for the DVD version itself there are several flaws starting with the 50 price tag.  Beyond that the print used was a poor one.  The quality of the interview scenes was not much better than that of the archival footage spliced in.  The subtitles were also not that great.  Interestingly much of disc two appeared to have a remixed soundtrack.  For interviewees in English and German the director dubbed over a partial French translation with the original language reduced in the background.  This partial French translation was then subtitled in English and not always well.  On disc two quite a few of the English sections did not have French dubbing or subtitles which is where I suspect the sound remix comes in.  The ending was also quite abrupt and choppy Maurice Chevalier in English? and didn't have the feel of being original though let me stress I've no real knowledge to substantiate this.".

The Sorrow and the Pity makes it clear that such was not the case.  This stunning documentary includes interviews from people from all shades of the spectrum politically philosophically and socially.  The interviewers did a great job of coaxing the truth from these people by being friendly rather than confrontational.  Some of the most amazing footage is from German newsreels with the ghastly pure race prejudices being illustrated with a very sarcastic commentary on some of the French prisoners of war.  I think that every high school student in The United States should see this film so that they understand that you can't always just  go along to get long.  Of course with the average high school student's attention span it would have to be shown in shorter installments.  This film is completely worthwhile and never boring!".

	schema:reviewBody "I think this is a masterpiece. It's a movie that'll linger and stay with you It's long but it's hardly as inaccessible and foreboding as it's seeming reputation although some knowledge of French history is probably helpful. The Occupation after all isn't really a highbrow subject Ophuls charts it's effects up and down the line and is particularly taken with a couple of crusty old farmers and a fasttalking traveling salesman and they're both characters and worth meeting. The length allows for all sorts of fascinating anecdotes from an aborted plan of French housewives to plant roses on the Maigont Line to a Vichy squadron that actually fought in German uniform on the Eastern front I never knew about this to a prison break postponed because of two lovers dallying outside. There's also all sorts of fascinating archival footage I didn't know existed from German propaganda newsreels that are fullbore racist to Vichy propaganda an antiSemitic movie that's pretty amazing.I don't know if you could make a film like this today. Not that people aren't ready to talk for the camera  they're probably a lot more ready now than they were in 1969. But the men and women here speak with a kind of openness a lack of performance thought that I think is probably gone. Many of the people here talk to the camera like it's some kind of combination therapistconfessional very unselfconsciously.There's definitely a theme here about history and memory and why France as a nation forgot the truth of what occurred. But I was far more interested in who rebelled and the moral truth of the movie how we should judge things. It's memorably pointed out for instance that the members of the resistance were mostly working class joes or misfits the outcasts of bourgeoisie society. I thought that was a fascinating insight  actually I'm still sort of processing it. As was the story of the aristocratic Frenchman who took collaboration to such a level that he actually sort of went through it to the other side  by donning a SS uniform and fighting in the East he became an outcast from the Vichy world too.As for judgement while I don't think the basic argument of the movie is that hard to figure out  the myth of the glorious French Resistance in WW 2 is mostly that a myth  Ophuls leaves the question of judgement up to the viewer. And it's not simple at all with a couple of exceptions mainly thinking of the fat smug exNazi officer most everyone gets a fair shake. The aristocrat so easy to caricature turns out to be exceptionally rueful about his experience in no way the man he was. There are heroic Resistance fighters but they're not all noble and we see archival footage of Communists urging for a cleansing of the Fatherland that sounds eerily similar to earlier footage of an antiSemitic French politician urging a purge of Jews. Etc. There's no easy answers here probably the point. Just a rueful acceptance of man's capacity for evil and a recognition of the stumbling ways we try to do good too. I respect that immensely I respect Ophuls willingness to steer away from simpleminded agitprop.Probably would repay multiple viewings but how many times realistically are you going to watch something like this? In a few years I might invest another afternoon in it though.".

	schema:headline " Fine though unsystematic look at French in city during German Occupation";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a fine documentary. Marcel Ophuls the interviewer and director is never too intrusive never too opinionated  like a Ted Koppel or Jim Lehrer he doesn't try to censor the views of those he interviews but to ask questions to help elucidate them. The documentary selects a few dozen people to interview  virtually all with different roles and attitudes during the Occupation. I found particularly interestingthe French doctor with 7.5 children ? who was concerned primarily with feeding his family throughout the Occupation and was thrilled when hunting began after a two year moratorium the champion bicyclist who began against great competition in 1943 because of the number of French riding bicycles due to the absence of gas to run their motorbikes or cars and who said he didn't see many Germans around ClermontFerrand in Vichy Francethe extraordinarily gentlemanly and rather shyseeming Resistance chief who refused to cooperate with the Communists in his ferocious antiNazi workthe British transvestite singer who became a secret agent for the British in occupied France and broke up with his German soldier lover for fear of compromising himAnthony Eden's extraordinary tact and intelligencePierre MendesFrance's wonderful restraint objectivity humor andabsence of recriminationthe German father of the bride at a wedding reception whose attitude toward his undoubtedly brave service in the War is wholly uncolored by the fact that the country for which he fought was the aggressor totalitarian and vigorously persecutor of groups  I actually suspect that if one were merely a soldier and had not personally acted dishonorably in the War this is the attitude that most would have whether a German or Russian soldier  despite extending one's own horrible system into the rest of Europe.For one such as myself who does believe the Communist Party especially in those days of Stalin to have been as great a menace to the world as the Nazi Party the documentary's failure to ever ask the Communist officials interviewed about their beliefs about substituting one horror for another is disappointing. I could not forget as I watched the interviews of Communists the 14.5 million recently killed by the Russians in Ukraine as the result of the terror famine imposed on that region  or the Great Terror that killed more millions and concluded just as the War began. In fact M. Ophuls discomfits the Resistance leader who defied Orders from the Free French in London to cooperate with the Communists against the Nazis  I felt like applauding his behavior!I'm sure for most the most fascinating character is M. de la Maziere the extraordinarily candid intelligent disarming and charming aristocrat and former Fascist youth who at the end of the War volunteered to serve on the Eastern Front in the German Waffen S.S.  from which only 300 of the 5000 survived. He was quite remarkable to hear  he'd obviously spent a great deal of time thinking about what he had done why and although regretful was unsparing in his description of what he knew and what he had done. However in interviewing him in a German castle used between the Wars by the Kaiser and in 1944 for Petain and Laval the documentary makes it appear as if the castle somehow relates to de la Maziere  as if he owned it  when in fact Ophuls simply took him there for the interview. It's the one dishonest seeming moment in this wonderful documentary.I strongly recommmend that others see it  you will wonder how you would react and think about what those in your own country would react to foreign occupation.".

I found particularly interestingthe French doctor with 7.5 children ? who was concerned primarily with feeding his family throughout the Occupation and was thrilled when hunting began after a two year moratorium the champion bicyclist who began against great competition in 1943 because of the number of French riding bicycles due to the absence of gas to run their motorbikes or cars and who said he didn't see many Germans around ClermontFerrand in Vichy Francethe extraordinarily gentlemanly and rather shyseeming Resistance chief who refused to cooperate with the Communists in his ferocious antiNazi workthe British transvestite singer who became a secret agent for the British in occupied France and broke up with his German soldier lover for fear of compromising himAnthony Eden's extraordinary tact and intelligencePierre MendesFrance's wonderful restraint objectivity humor andabsence of recriminationthe German father of the bride at a wedding reception whose attitude toward his undoubtedly brave service in the War is wholly uncolored by the fact that the country for which he fought was the aggressor totalitarian and vigorously persecutor of groups  I actually suspect that if one were merely a soldier and had not personally acted dishonorably in the War this is the attitude that most would have whether a German or Russian soldier  despite extending one's own horrible system into the rest of Europe.For one such as myself who does believe the Communist Party especially in those days of Stalin to have been as great a menace to the world as the Nazi Party the documentary's failure to ever ask the Communist officials interviewed about their beliefs about substituting one horror for another is disappointing. I could not forget as I watched the interviews of Communists the 14.5 million recently killed by the Russians in Ukraine as the result of the terror famine imposed on that region  or the Great Terror that killed more millions and concluded just as the War began. In fact M. Ophuls discomfits the Resistance leader who defied Orders from the Free French in London to cooperate with the Communists against the Nazis  I felt like applauding his behavior!I'm sure for most the most fascinating character is M. de la Maziere the extraordinarily candid intelligent disarming and charming aristocrat and former Fascist youth who at the end of the War volunteered to serve on the Eastern Front in the German Waffen S.S.  from which only 300 of the 5000 survived. He was quite remarkable to hear  he'd obviously spent a great deal of time thinking about what he had done why and although regretful was unsparing in his description of what he knew and what he had done. However in interviewing him in a German castle used between the Wars by the Kaiser and in 1944 for Petain and Laval the documentary makes it appear as if the castle somehow relates to de la Maziere  as if he owned it  when in fact Ophuls simply took him there for the interview. It's the one dishonest seeming moment in this wonderful documentary.I strongly recommmend that others see it  you will wonder how you would react and think about what those in your own country would react to foreign occupation.";

The documentary worths the watch as some of the interviews are really interesting former S.S De La Mazire the English diplomats and the German soldiers in particularly and it also gives a good idea of the radical political divisions between the French at this time. However everyone should admit that the film is not strictly neutral. As a Frenchman I have been interested in the subject for a little while and know quite a bit about this period. The interviews of Resistance members are unfortunately much more numerous than those of collaborators and there is not a single interview of any former member of the Milice which had more than 30000 members! while it seems to me it should have been unavoidable for such a documentary since they were very involved in the war against partisans. The jewish question sequences last for too long and are not focused on ClermontFerrand while the black market quite important at this time is just slightly mentioned. There is nothing about the STO compulsory work in Germany although it drove quantity of young men to join the Resistance! Nor is mentioned the fact that communists have been collaborators before the war between Germany and USSR and that some have even volunteered to work in Germany. Tortures by members of the Milice which have been numerous are mentioned while tortures of collaborators and German soldiers by communist partisans which have been numerous too are not mentioned at all. Communism in France was in 1969 too powerful for Ophuls to go onto this slippery slope I guess... The documentary is about ClermontFerrand however Ophuls sometimes jumps to how life was in Paris or Vichy at this time it's a bit annoying because we don't get a really good picture of ClermontFerrand then. I have watched the French version with English subtitles and although my English is far from being perfect I found them rather below average some meanings are twisted it is a shame for people not knowing French language because they might understand a different version of the witnesses interviews. I think the documentary is interesting not from its purpose nor its editing but rather for the historical value of some of the interviews and also to get a general picture of the people feelings at this time keeping in mind the film in itself is still an incomplete and slightly orientated summary of occupied France however much more complete and less orientated than most of modern documentaries.".

It's a rather straightforward documentary blending interviews with archival footage and contemporary scenes from France and Germany.The French filmmakers took care to interview French both in support and opposed to the government of France who collaborated with Germany after their swift defeat as well as Germans both Nazi and otherwise and British officials who were involved in the war. With three languages present the dialogue is spoken over in French although in the English cut that I viewed the English was mostly left alone.It's not a stunning film as a documentary in terms of presentation but some of the stories that the film brings out of its sources are quite amazing and document a lot of details that a basic study of the WWII era during a history class might not bring out. Even more notably the individual stories of those involved at the time highlight much of what's going on while also providing an emotional connection to a person or groups of people and making the situations easier to imagine. I think The Sorrow and the Pity remains a valuable film simply because there aren't many of its kind from its era and for how personal it chooses to be in telling the stories of the men and women that lived during this terrible moment in history. But it's really long and people who don't care about history or about people's stories probably would find much in here to like. 810.".

We start at a German wedding in 1969 but before you know we are elsewhere talking about the French resistance then watching Maurice Chevalier perform before a French audience of soldiers in 1939 and suddenly we are in the French countryside walking with two framers. Without missing a beat we have an interview the Pierre Mendes French PM then German documentaries including one that focuses on captured black French soldiers that makes fun of the British claim to be defending civilization. It blames the Jewish warmongers and the British Lords for starting the war and for escaping with their suitcases filled with gold. The topic of the resistance comes up now and again as does the war but it's difficult to know what this film is about and where it's going.About 30 minutes into the film it seems that the film is about the Vichy Government and the behavior of the French people during the occupation. Anthony Eden poignantly points out to Marshall Petain that there are worse things in life than having your beautiful cities destroyed but to the French capitulation was the greater need. To the French people it was also an opportunity to settle petty quarrels and to reignite antiAnglo feelings. Hitler knew that the French of 1939 were not the same people he fought in World War 1 and by 1941 everyone else knew it too. Eden says If the French can no longer fight that's one thing. But if they make it easy for the enemy that's quite another.As the film wanders on and on it gets no better in the focus. Seemingly with neither rhyme nor reason the documentary explores antisemitism anglophobia German influences on French cinema business practices German propaganda etc. Half a century after it was made and from another country much of the background is lost so many of the comments are not easily understood when certain names dates and places are mentioned. The lack of focus of the film makes this even more difficult. The translations themselves are random. Sometimes the German is translated into French in the film and then subtitled in English but often not. Sometimes even the French is not subtitled.All told this is a very poorly done documentary. It lacks focus. The filmed interviews are of poor quality considering it is 1969 and the sound is marginal. Are there pearls of wisdom and fascinating sections within this mess  Yes. Absolutely. It could profit from being redone shortened and given a new voice over.".

Fortunately as it was made in 1969 it has interviews with several who participated in that era. These are survivors with many different points of view which is why I used the word remarkable. Many of these interviews are not only penetrating and revealing some are quite disturbing. This is also coupled with film footage taken during those years both French and German which gives additional insights into the thought processes of the era. We vividly experience how the French were thinking during those years  a time period where many felt that the Nazi reign was supreme and neverending. It is easy in hindsight to say that the Allies were to be victorious  but from 1940 thru 1943 this was not evident. Only after the Allied landing in North Africa in November 1943 did it start to occur to many in France that German hegemony over their country could come to an end. This film takes us through the shifting moods of that turbulent time.There is a wide spectrum of people interviewed. There is one with a French person who joined France's version of the SS most of whom were killed on the Eastern Front. There is another with the soninlaw of Pierre Laval seldom have I seen a man so speechless after he is interrupted by the interviewer who corrects him on the number of French Jews rounded up with the full collaboration of the French police and later murdered. Pierre Laval was executed by France after a trial in 1945  this gives an indication of the tremendous soulsearching and vehemence that goes on in France to this day. Prior to 1940 Pierre Laval had served in many French government ministries and was even its Prime Minister.There are a wide assortment of statements from French resistants  some communist some rightwing British commandoes and pilots sent over a German officer who served in France. There are people from the same village who said they saw no German soldiers and others who saw too many. There is an uncomfortable interview with an elderly woman who was tortured after the liberation as she was suspected of collaborating with the enemy. It is made clear by some that the enemy could be both French and German. Others call the resistants' fighters terrorists.As the British foreign minister Anthony Eden under Churchill said towards the end of the documentary If one hasn't been through the horror of an occupation... you have no right to pronounce upon what a country does which has been through all that. It's a long documentary over 4 hours  but essential for understanding this period of history. It is a tribute to France that it made such a revealing film of that epoch.".

I saw this move over 30 years ago and it still haunts me. It is a painstaking examination of the temporary debasement of a proud freedomloving nation. In context it is to remember that at the time of the Nazi invasion of France the French had still not recovered from the Great War of 20 years earlier. Over one million of its young men had been killed. The nation had not recovered physically or psychologically. Still the film showed stories of great courage great cowardice and great indifference in the face of great evil. It is the nonpolemic story of a low point in the 20th Century. The movie provides excellent insight into the depths of human experience and the resurgence of a national spirit. It's a wonderful documentary. In two days it will be Bastille Day 2004. Vive la France!".

	schema:headline " As a film it is rather flawed but the detail is superb and the subject is engrossing";
	schema:reviewBody "In 1940 the army of Nazi Germany invaded and occupied France. This was done with the collaboration of France's Vichy government and thus the direct or indirect support of the majority of the populace. This documentary uses interviews archive footage and films released at the time to uncover the truth about what happened at the time and why it happened. In two parts the first looks at the political manoeuvring that led to the occupation and the second looks at the actions of the population during the occupation including the informers and those involved in the underground resistance.Like many viewers I taped this film and had it sitting for almost a month before I finally got round to just watching it. It wasn't the subject or anything that made me delay it but it was the four hour running time that made it almost impossible to watch on a week night and pretty much required me to be doing little else for the afternoon and evening of a weekend! Girlfriend away I took my chance to spread this film out over most of a Sunday afternoon and evening. Needless to say that the subject of this film is engrossing and shocking but let me just deal with my comment that this is flawed as a film because I know some may be surprised by this description of a film that is listed on this site as the greatest documentary ever made.For my money the film could have been a better film. First off it is too long  even for such a worthy subject it could have lost a half hour or so to make it a little more accessible. A look at the number of people who have voted on this film on IMDb gives you some idea of how inaccessible this film is. The bigger problem though was the structure of the dialogue in terms of presentation. The film is in French but many people being interviewed speak in Germany or English. This is OK but sometimes when the people speak in say English they are verbally translated into French while the subtitles turn it back into English. This is a problem because the translator's voice is Ophuls and we therefore hear him ask the question then answer it  and his voice is a little droning losing the benefit of hearing the person's own voice. Another problem with this is that at times the English and German is delivered without translation or subtitles. Once of twice I was able to hear the English and I noticed that sometimes the subtitles are very very summarised versions of what they were saying.So basically I thought that this film could have been better in these regards. However as a documentary it is utterly engrossing and the subject is delivered with such detail and balance that it is hard not to make it to the end of the fourth hour. The first half of the film is very interesting and manages to do a very good job of reconstructing the political background to the well lets call it 'surrender'. It would have been easy for the film to really prejudge those involved or class them as 'cheeseeating surrender monkeys' as many lazy commentators do nowadays but this film allows everyone to have a say and put their case across. Of course it is easy to be shocked and disgusted by the political actions taken but as Anthony Eden diplomatically states it is hard to judge what was done because we have been lucky enough never to be put in that situation. The second half continues to be balanced but to be honest some of the stuff in it is practically indefensible and the film is right I think when it puts forward the idea that France has not recovered decades later from this very public shame.The level of detail in the film is impressive and it is hard to keep up with the number of interviewees involved at times. However the core seven or eight contributors are very good detailed balanced discussions that are incredibly insightful and interesting. In fact a lot of the material is shocking  either in terms of being graphically violent or being just surprising that the decisions were made. Whether it be a man talking about how his wife was killed or a politician shamelessly hiding behind statistics of people killed to justify decisions saying only 5 of French Jews died whereas really this stat didn't include those Jews who had their citizenship revoked  of those 95 died it is all shocking. For an idea of how shocking the story was thought to be and still is consider this  the film was made in the late sixties but was not shown on French television until 1981.However for all the very easy moral lines to draw the film doesn't rant like that supposed documentarian Moore easily does and it makes interesting viewing for those of us with a basic understanding all I knew was that the French had given up with only an underground resistance. Any less than a basic knowledge may leave you stranded a little bit with the names and role of the people involved but to be honest it is very unlikely you'll plan to watch this four hour film unless you are already interested in the subject.Overall despite its minor flaws in delivery this is still a great film that is worth the four hours invested in it. It takes the occupation of France and shows it for what it was  morally complex destructive wrong cruel and very hard not to judge. However despite the fact that it is hard for one not to conclude that their surrender was wrong kudos to Ophuls for taking a situation that we still make sweeping judgements about eg jokes about how a French tank has 6 gears  all backwards and gives it a fair treatment and allows all those involved to reflect on the situation. Not a fun way to spend an afternoon but a memorable impacting and rewarding one.".

I've been a big fan of The History Channel which could be called the World War II channel for about fifteen years which has given me a great deal of information about WWII that I did not get in school. But this movie went to depths I'd not seen before on how the French behaved in the war.It's commonplace nowadays to hear about how the French hate us Americans or how France is filled with cheeseeating surrender monkeys. But I was really unprepared to learn just how badly France caved in to the Germans. A great deal of the country turned into German collaborators and worse. The French antiSemitism almost outdid the Germans.It's interesting to note that no French companies would finance this film. The filmmaker had to go to Switzerland and ironically Germany to get funding. It's easy to see why when you watch this film. I don't know how well this film was accepted in France but I can imagine there are many French folks who would just like to forget that whole portion of their history. Amazingly to me the same people that caved so quickly then became fervent nationalists upon liberation and started publicly hacking off the hair of French women who dated Germans and put collaborators on trial with gusto. Damned if I can figure their actions out. Then again I've never had a Nazi tank in my front yard.This movie is not for every taste. I myself am not a fan of films that require subtitles although The History Channel has broken me down in that area when it comes to documentaries. At four hours long I taped it and watched it in two chunks. It was very interesting to get an inside look at what happened from a diverse group of people that lived it. That included the resistance. Yes there were some that stood strong against their enemies.For anyone that would like an insider's view of that portion of French history this movie is a must see.".

Some very interesting interviews with former members of the Resistance and also former German officials. It let me see a different side of war I hadn't seen before. In one of the most absurd moments a former French official tells the story of how a group of upperclass women collected a fund to plant rosebushes along the front lines so the soldiers wouldn't have to look at dirt and concrete while they were fighting. A line from Annie Hall in which Woody Allen's character Alvy Singer kept going to see this film an indefinite number of times to the disapproval of Diane Keaton's Annie kept repeating itself in my head Those guys in the French Resistance must have been brave having to listen to Maurice Chevalier so much.".

Back in 1969 however it must have come as a bit of a shock as the messages in the film were a sharp contrast to the prevailing view that 'we' beat the Nazis.

And in many ways these attitudes were still strong 25 years after the war ended. As for me this is an excellent portrait of human nature. We tend to see what we want and the film shows the many different views about the war and collaborationmany of which are very selfserving such as the German soldiers who felt that they were good to the French or proVichy folks who made a variety of excuses for not doing more to fight the Nazis.

It isn't an expose but rather a slice of life about a country that quickly buckled under to oppression.

We get to know common people people in the resistance politicians former Nazis and a host of others. What could be dull and tedious is four hours of absolutely amazing storytelling.

This film gets closer to the truth because there were no winners French German British. Even Rake's heroism came across as faintly treacherous. The fat smug German was an archetypal caricature Boche Caboche Kraut or Cabbage. It was quite odd that noone really seemed to blame Petain. I don't think anyone had a truly bad word to say about him. Here today gone tomorrow. What a fate.I remember once asking a normal middleclass Roman Catholic British friend what he would have done if he'd been born an average German circa 1920. He told me he would have resisted Hitler with every fibre in his being. Like hell he would I thought. No imagination. Unable to face the truth. Propaganda is met with counterpropaganda.There may be other documentaries as good or even better than this one but if so I haven't seen them. It's only had 32 reviews so far on this site so it's quite easy to read them all. Takes much less time than watching the film's 4 plus hours though that wasn't at all difficult. I can't say I disagree with any of them although I don't personally give the production less than ten stars. Charity begins at home. Not too many saints and genuine martyrs around. Not counting the current wave of brainwashed suicidal kids and patsies.".

Its strength is the semireal and overcharged atmosphere created by the cinematography the sets and Ortolani's excellent music.  It is somewhat debatable whether it was a good move to cast Clio Goldsmith in the lead as she does not manage to radiate any innocence as her character seems to demand and she generally appears a wee bit bland.

	schema:reviewBody "In the frame story a female author Catherine Spaak holds a publisher Fernando Rey at gunpoint and forces him to read her novel which is the basis for the rest of the movie. Unlike the publisher I have no excuseI watched this totally voluntarily. Seriously though it's not that bad. The storywithinthestory is kind of an erotic Alice in Wonderland. A naive virginal girl Clio Goldsmith checks into a pensione inhabited by all kinds of weird employees and guests. The voluptuous female concierge insists on her taking a bath immediately and then ends up GIVING her a bath. The concierge's sister works as a maid because she likes serving people like one of the older male guests who she sexually services in a room while the naked heroine hides under the bed. Another guest Nieves Navarrois kind of a cross between a school marm and a dominatrix. There is also a surprisingly heterosexual male ballet teacher and his gaggle of young female students. Finally there is an oiledup muscleman who all the women can't help spying on as he constantly works out in his room.This movie is more weird than erotic. The scene where the concierge bathes and uh swaddles the protagonist is the second female adult baby scene I've encountered in a European movie in the last few months. I don't know if this particular fetish is more silly or disturbing but it sure isn't very erotic. Other scenes are just too tame. In one promising scene the schoolmarmdominatrix orders the heroine to strip and kneel down but then does absolutely nothing else. One of the male characters ties up the heroine in another scene but then the movie shyly cuts away before turning into the Story of O. Goldsmith is naked a lot and the maid has one sex scene but the rest of the female cast stays dressed. Spaak and Navarro were probably a little over the hill although they both still look good but you would think they would have done SOMETHING with the nubile female ballet students at least.Still this movie was kind of interesting. It kind of reminded me of Roman Polanski's film What? another offkilter erotic Alice in Wonderland type film. The ending of the storywithinthestory is very lame but the ending of the frame story is actually really good. I didn't entirely waste my time watching this at least.".

	schema:headline " Good Erdogan movie but not as good as an Erdogan movie";
	schema:reviewBody "Organize Isler is a decent comedydrama that is sometimes clever but occasionally loses its charm. The name Yilmaz Erdogan always guaranties a good film as his writing talents and the exemplary BKM troupe work smoothly in every project. Erdogan always creates clever plots that the audience could discover another layer with every screening which is my opinion a characteristic only the best movies have. However 'Organize Isler' has less layers or at least less interesting layers compared to his earlier works.Casting seems to be a problem Erdogan has to deal with with every project. Since BKM troupe's long roster of talented actors generally outnumbers the necessary characters in a movie the danger of 'overcasting' or 'miscasting' looms large. One can see the effects of this issue in Organize Isler for example the appearance of Iclal Aydin is totally unnecessary in my opinion without any real contribution to the story told.The movie is good clever and entertaining. All actors are good dependable experienced and they work with each other well. Cem Yilmaz who commands more and more respect as an actor with every movie he is in enhances the value of the movie tremendously and it seems his special relationship with Erdogan adds to their productivity. The production values are high with wonderful aerial shots of Istanbul  which like a constrictor python seems more beautiful than it really is if you look from far above.Another personal criticism of mine which has little to do with the artistic side of the production is the way the movie puts a human face on the gangsters who ruthlessly rob kill and terrorize the streets of Istanbul. Although the film watches like a lighthearted antihero flick I find it hard to feel for the poor good hearted robbers with BMWs who would drag an old lady to death if she wont let her purse go.".

I don't think anyone really doubted this but Yilmaz Erdogan hasn't come up with a winner again.Now Yilmaz Erdogan fans will hate me for this but I hate the fact that so many people think Organize Isler is a 'perfect' 'flawless' flick because it really isn't. Yilmaz Erdogan was fine as was the rest of the cast to be honest. The acting was very good from everyone no complaints there.A problem was that these bunch of shysters live in the middle of Istanbul  obviously for years and heck no police notices it! My next biggest problem was the way they cheat the people. Come on folks where do you live ? Aside from these there were a few other smaller problems too. The Istanbulshooting from the air and all the Istanbulhelicoptertours from the sky was cool at first but dragged on for too long for me. After every scene being up again in the air sucked really. Other than this unfortunately this film lacks of plot and the most abrupt ending ever. This film doesn't have any new ideas whatsoever. The story could have been better. Neither thrill nor excitement during the film. No really laughedmysocksoff moments. Definitely lacks the humour we had expected. What the hell ? You go out of the cinema and wonder huh ? was it a comedy I've just seen ? or an action flick ? crime ? what ! Yea comedy then why can't I remember any memorable laughoutmoments ? OK there were some but nothing that really stuck in the mind.Too bad these kind of movies make money anyway because of the director and the actors that are in it. Below average........ 410".

	schema:reviewBody "Bravo to Erdogan excellent movie. Directing is excellent with emphasis on cinema. There are some holes in the plot but the witty comedy makes up for them. Casting is quite good but has important minuses.At the beginning right before Erdogan Asim starts banging on Cevik's Samet door to let him in notice the minaret and the church bell tower. The camera angle is peculiar The excitement of the pursuit is captured but also the monuments of two religions in mutual symbiosis. Also beneath the monuments two people find salvation in the next scene. Coincidence? Serendipidious symbolism? Hard to tell nevertheless the capturing camera use is prevalent throughout the film Yilmaz in front of the plasma gang going to Yilmaz's hideout last overview of Istanbul beginning from Cukurcuma and ending in Sarayburnu. The director Erdogan uses the setting as a powerful theme for the movie.One important achievement of Erdogan is the brave disappearance of moral speeches a traditional element of Turkish cinema. It had been almost of sin to create a movie without at least one character staring into the space and delivering a moral monologue flavored with left wing ideals and even Erdogan himself had been using this in his previous works Vizontele series. Gone is that direct embarrassing speech whatever message is delivered it is delivered through camera and directing. Notice how the audience observes the rich and poor environments coming right after each other with each scene sometimes even in the same scene. So much more mature than direct expression.Plot has its problems. How come Nazli Berfin Erdogan returns to Asim Yilmaz Erdogan? How did they meet in the first place or how did she meet with the despicable dentist? These questions are neglected. How come Samet accepts Umut's apology? Sorry I have used your honesty in the most heartless manner and delivered you and your companions to the criminal lord but I do truly love you? Huh? Samet's gullibility seems to know no limits!However comedy is a difficult genre and the jokes  I must admit I had my laugh of the year. Better than Hirsiz Var better than the Vizontele series and comparable to internationallyacclaimed comedy movies. I keep comparing it to Analyze This and Whole Nine Yards Philology? 1 hour golf? Safe within safe? I don't feel cold I am high? Byebye hepiniz? We are left with little time to catch our breath. Jokes keep following each other just when you think you heard the punchline the next line take it to a new level. Plus we have another set of jokes going on in the background. I'll watch again just for these.Casting and Acting Cevik for Samet? Excellent. Erdogan for Asim? Couldn't be better. Yilmaz for Muslum? What an unexpected surprise! Gone is the loony comedian enter the mafia boss putting hundredmilliondollar mafia movie actors to shame. I had underestimated Yilmaz until now. How much of this is correct casting and how much is superior acting? I believe it is strong combination of both. Another surprise is Silvio Who is he? Did I watch the actor or the character? I want to know! The final surprise for me is the rising star Namal. Comparing to her previous performance in Anlat Istanbul which was much shorter she acted out a totally different role with natural ease. I will not be surprised if we see her in some lead roles in the near future.Always a pleasure to watch Akbag fits into her role almost like hand in glove. With Erkekli they create the eversquabbling couple. We have the pleasure of seeing a large spectrum of mimics from Akbag. However I can't help but ask myself Why Physics? Why not philology or some other verbal study that she knows so much better? The class scene in the beginning is terrible It is difficult to imagine that scene being written by the same person who wrote the rest. Sun is the largest mass in the galaxy?!?! What a factual mistake by a professor of Physics! And ball on stretched sheet is the way to explain gravity to college students? That is kindergartenlevel physics. What a failure for such a movie.And just where does the casting fall short? Berfin Erdogan. Although a small role it is crucial. She is not too bad but not the caliber of Yilmaz and Akbag. She is insufficient for the role.".

Samet's gullibility seems to know no limits!However comedy is a difficult genre and the jokes  I must admit I had my laugh of the year. Better than Hirsiz Var better than the Vizontele series and comparable to internationallyacclaimed comedy movies. I keep comparing it to Analyze This and Whole Nine Yards Philology? 1 hour golf? Safe within safe? I don't feel cold I am high? Byebye hepiniz? We are left with little time to catch our breath. Jokes keep following each other just when you think you heard the punchline the next line take it to a new level. Plus we have another set of jokes going on in the background. I'll watch again just for these.Casting and Acting Cevik for Samet? Excellent. Erdogan for Asim? Couldn't be better. Yilmaz for Muslum? What an unexpected surprise! Gone is the loony comedian enter the mafia boss putting hundredmilliondollar mafia movie actors to shame. I had underestimated Yilmaz until now. How much of this is correct casting and how much is superior acting? I believe it is strong combination of both. Another surprise is Silvio Who is he? Did I watch the actor or the character? I want to know! The final surprise for me is the rising star Namal. Comparing to her previous performance in Anlat Istanbul which was much shorter she acted out a totally different role with natural ease. I will not be surprised if we see her in some lead roles in the near future.Always a pleasure to watch Akbag fits into her role almost like hand in glove. With Erkekli they create the eversquabbling couple. We have the pleasure of seeing a large spectrum of mimics from Akbag. However I can't help but ask myself Why Physics? Why not philology or some other verbal study that she knows so much better? The class scene in the beginning is terrible It is difficult to imagine that scene being written by the same person who wrote the rest. Sun is the largest mass in the galaxy?!?! What a factual mistake by a professor of Physics! And ball on stretched sheet is the way to explain gravity to college students? That is kindergartenlevel physics. What a failure for such a movie.And just where does the casting fall short? Berfin Erdogan. Although a small role it is crucial. She is not too bad but not the caliber of Yilmaz and Akbag. She is insufficient for the role.";

It's got every aspect of a cinema movie nice plot good detailed characters telling the story by acting and good direction not by direct dialogs.You might see critics or news about the movie that're saying it's a movie about Istanbul or it's no more than beautiful airvideos of the city but this is not true it's just an illusion that our media likes to create on everything valuable in order to make it look less than actually it is what a devil act.I might call it as a funny love story adventure.Of course there are some flaws with the movie. It's hard to grasp what kind of relationship Erdogan's character has got with his exwife and his daughter and why he has to spy his own daughter and need to kidnap her from her school. They are the scenes that Erdogan felt the story gets weak and he used direct dialogs.Place selections although being diverse it's sometimes confusing to audience exwife and her dentist husband seem to be neighbors of the other mafia group? I think there is only one condition in Erdogan's mind for being rich and it is living in Degirmenkoy! Last but not least no character represents common Turkish people in this movie I'm not saying this because I think every movie should do it but from boring professor to mafia boys they are not like majority living in this country and movie doesn't actually tell anything important while claiming it does. So after a couple of months nobody will remember this movie ever existed.I hope Erdogan's next projects will be more strong and closer to real people's real lives...".

	schema:reviewBody "A very good example of how a director is helpless. You cannot pull a good movie out of a script this bad. Yes the plot is a disaster. It's too sad to say this because I know Erdogan is a talented writer.NARRATIVE First of all things are resolved without any powerful conflicts.Even fairy tales have to have conflicts to qualify as a story. For instance how come Nergis leaves her husband and runs back to Asim? What did Asim do to deserve this?.. Kidnapped her daughter? Another leak in the script is about inconsistency. If Umut is that upright honest person how come she gets help from the Mafia? And when did she even got acquainted with them? Oh well when they first met at the job interview... but Umut did not seem so happy even about being there. Did she ever get the job? And what is going on with this gang? What is organized about them? What is original in their methods? How are they different from all the people gangs we see on TV everyday? If they are not then why the title? why the movie?ACTING The cast consists of very talented actressesactors including Yilmaz Erdogan but the problem here is that they had nothing in hand in terms of story to give the audience something new. Except for Cem Yilmaz. He is in fact a comedian and famous for that in Turkey but in this movie he outdid himself as a gang leader. I liked him more here than his latest movie G.O.R.A.Yilmaz Erdogan uses almost the same cast in all his movies and I believe this is starting to make the audience feel selfconscious in the theater and lose the magic of the carpet.NARRATION Yes It's good to have a helicopter. The first scene with the flycam I see the city view from the sky. I think is it an establishing shot? Will we focus on something here? Minutes later again I see the city in a long shot then I think I should connect this narration to a meaning... What meaning? Hmm.. Yes this is a shot of an organized city. The title... Third time... Now what? repetition? Forth time... What a beautiful city... Istanbul... Fifth time... Am I hungry?Too colorful because what... Funny?.. Do they gangs really live like that? Or was that a contrast? But where are the shadows? ABOUT the TITLE When I saw the English title Magic Carpet Ride here on IMDb for the first time I was shocked. The original title of the movie is Organize isler which in English sounds like Organized works business but in the movie it is used as organized works  meaning being organized works. The ironic thing is that the Turkish word isler also covers both meanings. OK I'm not saying you have to translate the title directly into another language but if you've caught an irony this nice why would you ruin it? Let me tell you why to cover some meaningless narration. The annoying flycam repetitions would now gain meaning you'd think.. OR maybe this is a more attractive title that would sell the movie abroad... and as a result disappoint more people... Magic what? What carpet? What ride?!FINALLY I'm not saying Erdogan is an untalented director the direction of Vizontele was good indeed but this one... well I didn't like it a bit. hayirli isler ".

	schema:headline " Good Civil War Adventure From Ford.";
	schema:reviewBody "John Ford's THE HORSE SOLDIERS is something of an underrated cavalry epic from the great director. Produced in 1959 for a United Artists release by John Lee Mahin and Martin Rackin it was nicely written for the screen by Mahin and Rackin and colourfully directedif a little less auspicious by Ford. Beautifully photographed in widescreen and colour by William Clothier the picture also benefited from an atmospheric score by David Buttolph which was made up from an array of rousing cavalry songs. Once again John Wayne was the star and making his one and only appearance in a Ford picture is the surprise casting of William Holden who it has to be said is much less flamboyant here than usual especially if you consider his marvellous Captain Roper in the excellent cavalry western six years earlier Escape From Fort Bravo. His role in THE HORSE SOLDIERS as the noncombatant regimental doctor is almost totally overshadowed by the arrogant and irascible troop commander as solidly played by Wayne. Never reaching the lofty heights of Ford's memorable triptych of cavalry epics Fort Apache She Wore A Yellow Ribbon and Rio Grande THE HORSE SOLDIERS is nevertheless an engaging Civil War adventure.The story of THE HORSE SOLDIERS is based on a real incident during the Civil War in 1863. Under orders from General Grant a division of Union cavalry under the command of Colonel John Marlowe Wayne are to cross over into Alabama and Mississippi in the South and destroy the railway line at Newton Station deep in enemy territory which is the main supply depot of the Confederacy. On completion of their mission they are to make their way to safety via Union held Baton Rouze. The mission starts out and proceeds with little difficulty until disagreements erupt between Col. Marlowe and the regiment's doctor Kendall Holden who has been sent with the division against the wishes of Marlowe who distrusts and dislikes the medical profession. And then there's the beautiful Southern Belle Constance Towers who eavesdropping overhears the Union's plans and must now be taken along with the regiment lest she informs the enemy. The picture ends with an exciting battle between the two sides  the Union army routing the Confederates and making their escape to Baton Rouze.Performances are splendid from all concerned. Wayne is especially good bringing great authority to his role. His Colonel Marlowe is arguably his best cavalry portrayal. Wayne's presence gives the movie a certain sheen and actually makes the film better than it really is. Holden is good too if somewhat more tempered than in anything he did before He never handles a weapon throughout the film. But the antipathy between the two men makes for some engaging confrontations the usually reticent Holden throwing a drink in Wayne's face squaring up to him and yelling OK section hand  I've had it  strip your blouse. Regretfully though and despite appearances by Ken Curtis and Hank Worden there is a noticeable absence of Ford players. Particularly missed are Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jn. But there is a nice bit of casting for General Grant at the beginning of the movie who is played by cavalry song writer Stan Jones. Jones composed the movie's featured song I've Left My Love. And it was Jones also who three years earlier had written The Song Of The Searchers the stunning ballad sung by The Sons Of The Pioneers over the titles of the FordWayne classic The Searchers. Also of note is the casting of Althea Gibson in the role of Tower's coloured servant. Gibson was a champion tennis player. She was the first African American to win the Grand Slam in 1956 and was the first African American to play Wimbledon in 1951 and to win it in 1957.Ford's picture is a handsomely mounted adventure with some blazing action from time to time. Not as good as some of the director's previous cavalry epics but thanks to Duke Wayne for being around and contrary to general opinion THE HORSE SOLDIERS is an enjoyable ride.".

	schema:headline " John Ford's Civil War";
	schema:reviewBody "John Ford probably did more to glorify the old American Cavalry of the 19th Century than any other major Hollywood Director. But while the Civil War is an element that keeps turning up in his movies he never actually did do the Civil War film he wanted to do  a biography of the career of Ulysses Grant. In his career he tackled the Civil War three times. In PRISONER OF SHARK ISLAND he dealt with the story of Dr.Samuel Mudd who was sentenced to life imprisonment for involvement in Lincoln's Assassination. In HOW THE WEST WAS WON Ford did the segment dealing with the battle of SHILOH with Harry Morgan as General Grant and John Wayne as General Sherman. This film was the nearest that Ford ever got to his dream film. THE HORSE SOLDIERS was the only film that was devoted to a full study of the effect of the war in the South on both Union and Rebel soldiers. While not perhaps the best that Ford could have achieved  he was in the twilight of his master career  it is a fine film nonetheless. The story is based on an incident in 1863 known as Grierson's Raid. Cavalry leader Benjamin Grierson was sent by Grant into Alabama and Mississippi on a raid to attack a railway junction supposedly to destroy it for strategic reasons. While it was important to knock the railway junction out of effective work the real purpose was to tie up Confederate forces in these backwaters. Since December 1862 Grant was struggling to capture the city of Vicksburg Mississippi the last major Confederate stronghold on the Mississippi River. But try as he did Grant kept losing to the Confederates under Joseph Johnston and John C. Pemberton the commander in Vicksburg. But Grant had noticed how Confederate cavalry men like Earl Van Dorn and Nathan Bedford Forrest had forced him to use men to protect his supply lines and took valuable time away from him trying to fight off or track them down. He decided that Grierson a first rate Cavalry leader could do the same thing to Johnston. A very intelligent Confederate Commander Johnston was nervous at unexpected difficulties. Grant reasoned that Grierson's men would panic Johnston and cause him to waste time chasing him down. As it turned out Grierson's Raid worked. The pinning down of large numbers of Rebel troops in Alabama and Missisippi was wonderful for Grant's Vicksburg campaign. It was the beginning of the successful conclusion of the campaign as Johnston's attention was now split between trying to help support Pemberton and trying to reassure frightened southern populations in the hinterlands. Grierson got most of his men back to Northern lines. Vicksburg was able to hold out until July 4 1863. It's fall the day after Lee's defeat at Gettysburg really marked the beginning of the end of the Civil War.This incident is the basis for THE HORSE SOLDIERS. Ford concentrates on what the experience of the war must have been like in the Southern countryside. Certain things are taken from other incidents and battlefields. When a military school's cadets are brought into the field to try to catch or slow down John Wayne's men Ford is really picking up on an incident in the war in Virginia when the young cadets at the Virginia Military Institute came out to fight the Union troops under Sheridan in 1864. One can forgive the transition of the incident. It has been pointed out that one of the characters Colonel Secord Willis Bouchey is a splendid type  the political officer. Men like Secord usually in the position of General bedeviled both sides because of their usually normal level of mediocrity or idiocy. A few rose to the job well  the best of the Northern political generals was Black Jack Logan who would be a valuable associate of Sherman in the battles around Atlanta. But for every positive General Logan there were thieves like Benjamin Spoons Butler who feathered his nest as military governor of New Orleans he supposedly stole even the silver spoons of the citizenry. Actually Secord is normally intelligent and follows Wayne's strategy. But he is constantly looking ahead at postwar elections. Towards the end he even wonders if the White House beckons.Another lovely moment shows the fraying of the Southern cause. Wayne and his men come across two Rebel deserters Strother Martin and Denver Pyle who have tied up the local sheriff Russell Simpson. Wayne thanks Martin and Pyle for their unofficial assistance to the Northern causetelling them which way they plan to go. While Martin chatters away mentioning the strength of Rebel forces in the area Wayne carefully knocks out Pyle and then Martin and then unties Simpson and assists in tying up the two deserters. William Holden is watching this and later asks why he helped Simpson. Wayne explains that he decided to feed the deserters false information about his own movements as they would probably give the information to the Confederates later on anyway.All the performances are fine with Wayne in particular as a man who hates doctors and medicine for a valid personal reason. Holden is in a subordinate role but he gets some nice moments. So does Constance Towers in a rare leading part as a passionate Confederate supporter who gradually gets to like Wayne. Carleton Young as a former friend of Wayne has a moment trying to rally Confederate forces at the railway depot. It is a good Ford film and makes one wish that Ford had made his Ulysses Grant biography.".

The biggest error though was the replacement of the fascinating Colonel Ben Grierson with Wayne's railroad man character. Grierson was a music teacher who was afraid of horses because one kicked him in the head as a child. Joining the Union army to fight slavery he was a staunch abolitionist he wanted infantry duty but was assigned to the cavalry by mistake. He turned out to be good at it and stayed in the cavalry after the war becoming the first Colonel of the 10th Cavalry Buffalo soldiers. It'd have been nice to see Grierson on screen.Historical inaccuracy aside though the movie did quite well. The film showed multiple viewpoints and a fair degree of respect for most of them. It showed aspects of the war that were generally ignored in other films of the period  the bloody horror of battlefield amputations the desire of people to give up on the whole thing I can't think of an earlier film that talked about deserters and the way they disrupted the southern home front and the pain of the sheer physical destruction of the war  a pain that affected the destroyers as well as the victims something Gone With the Wind never quite admitted.Some posters have complained about southern belle Hannah Hunter's overuse of sex appeal to spy on Union soldiers  while there was no historical Hannah Hunter there were plenty of southern women who did just that including Belle Boyd Rose Greenhow and others. Some posters have complained about the way the film trivializes slavery  this is unfair. It underplays slavery but never trivializes it. It shows conflicts within the Union army about the institution and addresses the issue of personal loyalty between some slaves and masters without glamorizing the institution as a whole. Does the film go far enough by modern standards? No. But it goes much farther than its contemporary and treats the slavery issue more honestly than modern travesties like Gods And Generals.One poster actually complained about how inaccurate southern snipers were  this is completely unfair. There was no indication that the snipers were specially trained men with Whitworth rifles or anything like that. They looked more like ordinary troopers out skirmishing or perhaps the even more poorly trained militia. Ordinary soldiers fired more than 100 rounds for every hit they scored so poor shooting on either side is nothing to be surprised about.8 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "General critical consensus seems to feel that John Ford's The Horse Soldiers is a bit of a letdown at least by the dizzyingly high standards of the director. However it's quite liberating if you try to forget that you're watching a John Ford movie and just treat it as an American Civil War movie like any other. Then the film's qualities become more apparent. Yes The Horse Soldiers is inferior to many of the other John Ford movies. But Ford working at halfspeed is still better than most directors working at the peak of their powers. And The Horse Soldiers is still a fascinating exciting and expertly told war film.Colonel John Marlowe John Wayne is ordered by the Union generals to lead his army 300 miles into the Confederacy where they are to sabotage and disrupt the vital railway supply town of Newton Station as much as possible. After a disastrous few months of lost battles and heavy casualties the Union generals are determined to swing the battle back in their favour before the arrival of winter. Marlowe is unhappy to learn that his orders include allowing army surgeon Major Kendall William Holden along on the mission. Since the death of his wife at the hands of two blundering surgeons Marlowe has had little respect for those in the medical profession. To further complicate matters a feisty Southern belle Hannah Hunter Constance Towers with Confederate sympathies overhears Marlowe informing his men that Newton Station is the target and that once the town has been raided the Union forces plan to head for the safety of Baton Rouge. In order to secure her silence Marlowe has to take her prisoner and suffer her sharp Southern tongue plus escape attempts during the trip.The Horse Soldiers is filmed in loving detail with gorgeous autumnal backdrops. Its story is very interesting especially the volatile relationship between Wayne and Holden and the mission itself provides excitements along the way. In particular a street battle at Newton Station is memorable as is a scene later in the film when the Union soldiers come under attack from an army of Confederate army cadets still at schoolboy age. Towers' character is written as a very cunning and feisty woman who disguises her attributes by coming across as a melodramatic gossipy airhead. Towers plays the part well but because of how she's encouraged to handle the role she becomes rather irritating too. One disappointing moment in the film comes when Wayne and Holden reach breakingpoint with each other and ride off to a secluded glade to slug it out. The sequence is set to be a real humdinger but is curiously cut short by the arrival of the enemy forces. On the whole though The Horse Soldiers is a good solid Civil War entertainment well worth a look.".

	schema:headline " Possibly Ford's most underrated work";
	schema:reviewBody "The fields woodlands and rivers of Tennassee drenched in summer sunlight are in stark contrast to the horrors of civil war as depicted in John Ford's The Horse Soldiers. John Wayne's mission to lead a troop of Yankee soldiers behind Confederate lines to destroy a railway base vital to the South's supply lines is fraught with danger. Skirmishes inevitably result in injuries and death the former often giving rise to amputations. Although made well before the time that the full appalingness of warfare come to be depicted in films such as Saving Captain Ryan from Drums Along the Mohawk onwards Ford never shirked the unpleasant. Incurable romantic that he was he gave his work a hard edge whenever it was needed. Although the term road movie to categorise films based on journeys was not then in general usage this fascinating work with horses replacing cars stands as one of the genres finest examples. And yet judging from many of this site's user comments it remains one of Ford's most under appreciated films. I find this rather strange as it contains most of the ingredients that are the hallmarks of those generally regarded as masterworks westerns such as The Searchers The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance and My Darling Clementine not forgetting his glorious Irish romp The Quiet Man. A shrew is tamed there is a measure of drunken knockabout and the soundtrack pulsates with rousing cavalry tunes and bugle calls. I have no quarrel with the fact that it is episodic rather than tightly knit. This somehow makes it all the more compatible with its journeying structure. Each episode on the way is brought out in sharp relief be it the Southern belle's false hospitality and attempted betrayal the central climax at the railroad station or the delightful interlude of the attack by the boy soldiers from the Confederate military academy one of my favourite sequences from any Ford film. John Wayne plays what is almost a variation on his Ethan role in The Searchers his anger here not vent on Indians but on the medical profession which he holds responsible for his wife's death. His embittered relationship with his company's medical officer played by William Holden gives this otherwise picaresque film a strong dramatic unity. I can only advise those who consider this one of Ford's minor works to see it several times. From my own experience I find it emerges stronger on each viewing.".

	schema:headline " The Section Hand and The Croker";
	schema:reviewBody "John Wayne's been given a critical job to do by none other than General Ulysses S. Grant. He's been ordered to take 3 brigades deep into Confederate territory and destroy a critical rail supply station at a place called Newton's Station and then get his troops out the best way he can. He's ordered to take along an army surgeon played by William Holden. Wayne's got what appears to be an unreasoning dislike of Holden and their rivalry professional and personal is what drives the plot of the Horse Soldiers.John Ford always disparaged the films he made after Wings of Eagles but in my opinion The Horse Soldiers is one of his finest films. Also in my humble opinion he managed to get one of John Wayne's finest film performances. Wayne's a volunteer officer in civilian life he rose from section hand on a railroad to an construction engineer. Holden calls him section hand as a term of derision after Wayne consistently refers to him as croker.Wayne and Holden were very close personal friends and friendly rivals at the box office. That's part of the reason that The Horse Soldiers is so good the chemistry between them. In fact when Wayne died in 1979 Holden was said to have gone on one legendary drinking binge. Who would have suspected we'd have lost him as well two years later.Holden as the doctor has a less flamboyant part than Wayne but he makes the most of what he was given. I suspect knowing the relationship between Wayne and John Ford he knew going in his part would be less but he did it anyway.Anyone who thinks John Wayne incapable of acting should see the scene in the saloon at Newton's Station after the Union forces repel a Confederate attack and are about their business destroying the railroad property. In a great drunk scene he reveals to Constance Towers the reason for his hatred of the medical profession. I won't reveal it but it's something we can all understand. Wayne did this scene so well that Ford used an abbreviated version of it in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance.Ford makes marvelous use of music in there weaving traditional Civil War era songs with the song written by Stan Jones for the film I Left My Love. That is one catchy and infectious ballad one of the best things written for a John Ford movie. Incidentally Stan Jones makes a brief appearance in the film as Ulysses S. Grant and does well by him.There are two in the supporting cast that deserve mention. During the Civil War Lincoln had to deal with volunteer political generals most of whom were a flop. Willis Bouchey playing John Wayne's cocommander in the expedition captures the phenomenon to perfection. He's argumentative arrogant and a general pain in the butt to Wayne. It's probably Bouchey's finest screen performance.And Carleton Young also gives what I think is his finest screen performance as the one armed Confederate colonel who tries in vain to stop Wayne from completing his plans. It's a role that requires dignity and strength and Carleton Young is marvelous. In fact the contrast between Bouchey and Young as soldiers is pretty obvious.The relationship between the Section Hand and The Croker evolves during the running time of The Horse Soldiers. It's a relationship well worth seeing develop.".

The only flaw seems to be the casting of Constance Towers as the flirtatious spirited Southern lady who becomes the unwilling captive of Col. John Marlowe John Wayne when he discovers that she is a Confederate spy. She goes along for the ride and provides the film's love interest. While she's certainly a capable enough actress it's the sort of role that cries for a hottempered Maureen O'Hara who must have been busy in another role to pass up this choice romantic lead.It's the sort of Ford film that must have been hard on the actors riding through swamps on horseback and engaging in fierce battles when pursued by Rebel forces. William Holden has some wonderful moments as a doctor who is constantly bickering with John Wayne. Their exchanges provide plenty of tension and humorand both actors are at their best under Ford's direction.A good Civil War western combining magnificent photography good performances and some rousing battle scenes. The horrors of war are not ignored and there are some sentimental moments that never strike a false note.".

	schema:reviewBody "Union cavalry officer John Wayne leads his men through Confederate Mississippi hoping to reach Baton Rouge. Along the way he has to deal with Rebel soldiers and spies as well as clashing with doctor William Holden. While not one of director John Ford's best this is an interesting movie for a few reasons. First it's a film about the cavalry's role in the Civil War which is rarely discussed. Second it takes place largely in Mississippi. Most Civil War movies that take place in the South generally focus on Georgia Tennessee Virginia etc. This is one of the few that I can think of to deal with the war in Mississippi. Third this is John Ford's only Civil War film. He did direct a small segment of How the West Was Won that took place during the war and he certainly had many characters affected by their Civil War experiences in his westerns. But this is the only full movie of his that actually takes place during the war itself.Duke is fine. It's not one of his more memorable roles though that's more the fault of the script than his performance. William Holden plays an army surgeon Duke is forced to take along with him. In all honesty Holden's character seems completely tackedon to the plot. He could've been removed entirely without upsetting the film much. It might have even improved it. Constance Towers is fun as a Southern belle the soldiers have to take with them on their march. At first she seems flighty but soon shows there's more to her. She also has one of the most provocative scenes from any Ford film where she bends down in front of John Wayne with her cleavage exposed offering him some chicken and saying Would you like a leg or a breast? She's probably the only standout in the film. It's not one of Ford's best. It's watchable and interesting enough but also overlong and familiar in tone to other cavalry movies I've seen despite the change in locale. Obviously Wayne and Ford buffs will want to check it out.".

I think it's one of Ford's best films ranking with his Cavalry Trilogy. The action scenes are the best in any Civil War films and John Wayne's performance is perhaps the best of his career. I don't have any problem with the love story. William Holden is the same cynical character he is in so many films this was just two years after The Bridge on the River Kwai and here he is back in a war movie one that ends with a bridge blowing up!. The sequence with the military academy is great. In the real battle of New Market the Union forces did not spare the VMI cadets who would have been older than these boys and were part of a larger Confederate force. One of the last scenes in the film contains tow forgivable historical errors. Dr. Holden is seen boiling his utensils. He tells Wayne that he is staying behind to care for the wounded even if it mean capture. Wayne asks Even if it means Andersonville? Holden answers yes. Pasteur didn't determine the cause of infection until 1879. More Civil War soldiers died of their wounds after battle than during the battles precisely because Civil War doctors did not take the precautions Holden is shown taking here. The Andersonville prison camp was founded in February 1864 to alleviate overcrowding at Libby Prison in Richmond and to remove the captees from the front lines. It didn't exist at the time of the Grierson raid. Obviously Ford and his writers felt Andersonville would raise an image of horror in the viewers that underscored the sacrifice Holden is making by staying.".

	schema:reviewBody "In The Horse Soldiers John Ford returns to the theme of the US Cavalry which he had immortalised in his Cavalry Trilogy made around a decade earlier. As in all three films of that trilogy the leading role is taken by Ford's favourite actor John Wayne although this film is not set in the West but in Mississippi during the American Civil War. Despite being set in the eastern half of the USA it is nevertheless occasionally referred to as a Western.The story is a fictionalised version of the reallife Grierson Raid of 1863 in which a unit of Union Cavalry penetrated deep behind Confederate lines in order to destroy a strategically important railroad junction being used by the Confederates to supply their garrison at Vicksburg. Wayne plays the raid's commander here called Colonel John Marlowe who ironically was a railroad building engineer before the war. Apart from the battle scenes much of the drama in the film arises from the clashes between Marlowe and his politically ambitious secondincommand Colonel Philip Secord and between Marlowe and the regimental surgeon Major Henry Kendall. Kendall makes little secret of his dislike of war and sees himself as a doctor first a soldier second. He considers that his main duty is to relieve human suffering wherever it may occur rather than to further the military aims of the Union armies.An additional complication occurs when the unit stops at a plantation house and Marlowe discovers that the plantation's attractive young mistress Hannah Hunter and her black slave Lukey played by the tennis star Althea Gibson have been spying on them. To prevent them from betraying his mission to the Confederate forces and unwilling to shoot two unarmed women in cold blood Marlowe is forced to take them with him.Ford does not really attempt to explore the causes of the war or the moral issues involved. Three years earlier he had made The Searchers in which he analysed the nature of racism in the Old West but here he does not take up the challenge of analysing racism in the Old South in the same way. Doubtless however he was well aware of the economics of Hollywood filmmaking. The most commercially successful films were those that could appeal to audiences both north and south of the MasonDixon Line and in the fifties a film which took too hard an antiConfederate line would be likely to alienate Southern sympathies.Although the film is essentially a war film it combines action with other elements including psychological analysis and occasional humour. There is even an element of romance something not generally found in films of this type as Marlowe falls in love with Constance Towers's Hannah something I did not find particularly element in the film it struck me as an unsuccessful attempt to import into an action drama that hoary old convention of the romantic comedy whereby two characters start off as bitter enemies and end up falling in love. As had had shown in films like A Man Betrayed Wayne was not the world's greatest exponent of romantic comedy. Wayne is however very good when he concentrates on being a tough soldier rather than a sentimental lover and William Holden is also good as the nononsense medic Kendall. The Horse Soldiers is not perhaps quite in the same league as The Searchers or Fort Apache but it is a good actiondrama and one of the better FordWayne collaborations. 710".

Thus giving Confederate General John C.

It gives the film a real sense of believability the characters may be at odds as the ideological conflict between the military and the medical professions shows its hand but a respectful almost friendly rivalry shines thru from the two icons of machismo.

The lead song is a rousing one as Stan Jones warbles 'I Left My Love' and the piece is chocked full of interesting characters fleshed with Ford thematics. Respect strength a love of your country all given an observational and customary sheen from the master director. Ford even takes time to vent his spleen at cowards courtesy of an engrossing sequence involving Strother Martin while a running theme of surgery particularly the legs gives the piece a dramatic and honest historical core. The battle scenes are as to be expected handled with skill with a poignant moment as Confederate Cadettes are sent out to fight by the besieged superiors being as sad and indicative of the War as it is important in the context of Ford's story telling.Off camera the shoot was not without problems Ford was battling the bottle and was making everyone's life a misery particularly The Duke. Things were further darkened when Ford's friend Fred Kennedy a retired stuntman asked for a job in the film on account of being broke financially. Reluctantly agreeing he allowed Kennedy to perform a basic stunt of falling off a horse but tragically Kennedy broke his neck during the stunt and was dead before reaching the hospital. Ford was shattered closing down the location site and returning home.

	schema:reviewBody "Just a few comments to add to the very knowledgeable preceding discussion. This is an excellent Civil War film with fine personal touches. The biggest failing I believe is on the matter of race. The Southern belle's faithful slave follows her without question and there is a very unfortunate shot of a sleeping Black man being pushed out of a wagon before a battle. The physician played by William Holden does treat contraband historically a term used for freed slaves but all in all they are ignored. Perhaps Ford realized his error because in the 1960 film Sergeant Rutledge racial issues are faced head on and Black soldiers get full and honorable treatment. And it is fascinating to watch some of the same actors in both films.".

	schema:reviewBody "Let me state first that I love Westerns  Civil War stories. I also consider John Ford as an excellent director. I also have the same high feelings for John Wayne  William Holden's acting ability.I cannot remember if I saw this film when it first came out in 1959. Last night was the first time I saw it since then.As per my 4 rating one can say I did not like the movie.I now will attempt to tell some of its shortcomings.John Lee Mahin who wrote the screenplay from Harold Sinclair's novel was a very gifted writer  wrote many fine scripts This script is poorly written  badly researched. They make mention of the awful conditions of the Andersonville prison At the time of the movie Andersonville was not in operation. They also use rifles that were not used at the time.John Ford was directing films for over 40 years  won 4 Oscars. He must have been ill during the making of this.His usual style was missing. It could be that this was film in the south  east and not in Monument Valley.He normally had a stock company of players he used in nearly all his film MOST were missing this time. This time only minor cowboy stars Hoot Gibson  Ken Curtiss have roles  of course Anna Lee has a small role. There were no other familiar faces except for the 3 stars. see below Mr. Fords stock company made most of his films the classics they were sadly missed here.Now we come to the main stars John Wayne  William Holden. The Duke also must have been illhe seemed out of place here. This sort of role usually fit his style perfectly he was just adequate here. Wiliam Holden did the best he could but nowhere as good as he usually was.It was required that there be an actress in this type of movie. Here in her first major role second film is Constance Towers a very beautiful person But not really an actress She is still having roles on Television. Let me be kind and say she has had a long careermore based on her looks than acting talent. Also in caas as Ms. Towers servant is Tennis Star Althea Gibson.I am glad she stuck to tennis.The rest of the production credits were far from the usual high standard of other John Ford films There were a few military type songs supposedly done by the marching cavalry not good at all. The action scenes were good but come at the end of film.Ratings 12 out of 4 47 points out of 100 IMDb 4 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "The last FordWayne cavalry flick The Horse Soldiers is the darkest in mood of the whole cycle.  Colonel John Marlowe Wayne leads a Shermanstyle cavalry raid deep into Confederate territory in order to lay waste Newton Station a vital railway junction supplying the rebel garrison at Vicksburg.     Marlowe was once a labouring man who helped furnish the growing nation with its sinews of rail tracks.  Now his task is to destroy railroads  a symbolic comment on the evil of civil war.  He takes two 'problem' characters with him on his odyssey because a story like this needs internal conflict if there is to be dramatic tension.  One is army surgeon Kendall William Holden whose West Point background and insistence on the primacy of medical ethics antagonise Marlowe ceaselessly.  The other is Hannah Hunter Constance Towers the Southern belle who cannot be left behind because she will pass on intelligence regarding Marlowe's cavalry column.     There is plenty of the usual stuff on display.  Wayne has to contend with a sergeant who is fond of alcohol.  His irritation with Hannah gradually turns to love.  Kendall is the naysayer within the otherwise harmonious military unit a function performed nine years later by David Janssen's character in The Green Berets.  We get a rousing manly marching song I Left My Love and Ford's brand of endearing macho humour bashing heads on the tent lamp and such.  There is even a dying boysoldier to tug at our heartstrings.     The character of Hannah is not handled satisfactorily.  She has to be there because in a formula movie such as this the fighting is meant for the young male cinema audience and the love interest is builtin so that the girls taken along on dates will keep from getting bored.  That's the theory anyway.  The trouble with Hannah is that she has to be sexy AND a Southern lady of 1863.  Thus she wears a spectacularly decollete gown at dinner and shows her legs during escape attempts in a way that simply would not have happened in real life.  As for her dressing and undressing in the presence of soldiers  comment is superfluous.  Even the 'leg or breast' doubleentendre is going too far.     Kendall took an oath when he accepted a commission in the United States Army but as he is quick to point out his Hippocratic Oath is an older and more binding one.  He treats 'contrabands' displaced negroes in direct violation of Marlowe's instructions.  The clash of the two temperaments is well done  Marlowe elemental and irresistible Kendall urbane and ironic. The film has us assume that Hannah will choose Kendall he sits opposite her at the meal and holds back from the banter  he even enters her boudoir. When she makes a different choice we see Kendall sluicingdown a table with a bucket of water symbolically washing her from his mind.     As one would expect from a director of Ford's quality the film contains some fine things.  The arrival of the fateful train is seen by the viewer in a windowreflection as Miles looks on conveying the forlorn irrationality of Southern hopes.  The lookingglass image denotes selfawareness on Hannah's part.  She shakes hands with each of Marlowe's staff officers in turn carefully enunciating each name outwardly polite but secretly memorising them for espionage purposes.  When Marlowe kicks open the door of Greenbriar this is the righteous confident North reclaiming the South.  In contrast when Kendall kicks open the shack door he represents the arrival of scientific enlightenment to help poor humanity. Marlowe's shadow is cast across the sitting Hannah growing as he strides towards her signifying his increasing influence.  We see two heroic Southern charges against Marlowe's men both admirable but utterly futile  a comment on the South's cause.     There was a poor edit from the uncasing of the regimental colours to the cavalry charge.  And as for the Confederate artillery pieces Peter and Paul  shouldn't they be firing solid shot rather than exploding shells?     The raid ends with Marlowe's men wrecking a bridge behind them and wandering off into Southern emptiness.  Something at the core of the movie remains dissatisfying and we carry away an uneasy feeling that this expedition and by extension the film itself was a worthy but unnecessary effort.".

I'd love him even more as a war leader if he hadn't dodged real service in WW2 sorry Duke fans just keepin' it real.Great story even greater since it is largely true.William Holden does a nice job with a not very glamorous role of the antiwar physician.I've read a lot of criticism of Constance Towers as the female lead but I fell for her character hook line and sinker. Very sexy and believable.Fabulous Ford military fetishism. The silhouetted columns of cavalry are macho poetry. Typically wonderful Ford soundtrack full of authentic period marches and folk songs.Nice balance struck between portraying the Union soldiers in a positive light yet remaining respectful of the Confederates.Now here's what kept it from being betterAs mentioned above I have problems with Wayne playing a war hero. Jimmy Stewart Duke's peer volunteered for combat in WW2 and flew dozens of almost suicidal bombing missions over Germany. He survived and vowed never to star in a movie that glorified war. In fact on several occasions he played a peacemaker Broken Arrow for example. By comparison Duke's legacy is embarrassing. Out of respect to veterans like Stewart he should have refused war roles.As is typical with Duke movies after 1950 he's way too old for the woman playing against him in the romantic subplot. He didn't start playing characters his real age until well into the 1960's.There's no well defined heavy. This can be a problem when retelling real events. Also Ford wasn't out to demonize the South.Unusually for Ford there's no effective comic relief. Guess Walter Brennan and Andy Devine were busy.".

In the late 1970s Erik is accepted by the Danish National Film School where he enters a world of angry and unhelpful tutors weird fellow students and unwritten rules. In this both exhilarating and angstprovoking period for him Erik feels increasingly like a foreigner in the film industry. Frequently he is merely an observer of the absurdities that surround him. He encounters trade union disputes falls in love and experiences selfassured empowered women who refuse to make a commitment. The film is a drama full of comedy  a sharp portrait of a conceited but entertaining world of film which we suspect our dogged young director will eventually conquer with his vision.";

Iskender has a great idea leave Istanbul and do a small tour in Anatolia. For that they need the caravan of his brotherinlaw and that caravan is currently occupied by Iskenders father the grumpy and seemingly senile Sait. There's no other choice than to bring him along. Luckily Sait is a good bargainer and he lands Iskender a job on a wedding in a village where they are stranded with car trouble. Reluctantly he agrees but it isn't going as planned.

	schema:reviewBody "Ardh Satya is an excellently made film. Govind Nihalani leaves no stone unturned in his portrayal of the trials and tribulations of the main character Anant Velankar. He never wanted to be a policeman but he reluctantly accepted the job because circumstances forced him to as his domineering father did not give him any other option. Now as a policeman Anant is honest hardworking and justiceseeking. No not at all what we get to see in mindless action films with their exaggerated portrayals of policemen going all nuts over their profession and their fake patriotism being the main issue. Here you will not see any of the silly action sequences or the caricature villains. Ardh Satya is a realistic film its authenticity is more present than anything else in it. It's a true depiction of the life of an Indian cop and it does not submit to stereotypes which could have been the easiest way to go.As Anant Om Puri plays a man who tries to fight criminals and those who break the low but ends up having to fight against injustice within the system itself. This movie is just his story not necessarily as a cop. It's about his dedication to his job his frustration his deterioration and fall from grace. Nihalani directs this feature with great integrity and Vijay Tendulkar's script and dialogues are fantastic. Anant's relationships with those who surround him are aptly portrayed. The sequences showing his interaction with Jyotsna a young lecturer of literature are stupendous and are of the best in the film right from their first meeting which opens the film to the time when they are already considering a future marriage. There isn't a lot of romanticism about it but there's a lot of humanity and respect. Even the portrayal of his relationship with his parents in spite of the minimal screen time it is given is spot on and is very troubling.Ardh Satya is a oneman show and needless to say it is Om Puri who dominates the proceedings with his heartfelt brilliant performance as Anant. Puri is an actor who has very rarely delivered something unworthy although he has been given stuff unworthy of his talent. This performance ranks amongst the finest works of his illustrious career. He captures Anant's honesty determination anger and devastation with sheer intensity and is always moving credible and convincing. The acting in general is very good in this film but the rest of the cast are just here to support him and they do it well. Amrish Puri as the tough violent and authoritarian father is unsurprisingly excellent. He manages to convey a lot of his character's essence through just a few scenes. The same can be said about Sadashiv Amrapurkar who does a lot with so little. Shafi Inamdar is also pretty good as Anant's boss.Last but certainly not least Smita Patil is firstrate in a role that was totally in need of someone with her intellectual capabilities and would have turned into inconsequential by a lesser actress. This is not at all one of those powerful authorbacked roles she was known for playing but it's still a very special one in her career. She does not try to impress or steal the show. As Jyotsna she is natural pleasant and exudes a certain warmth that is missing in the film. Above all she had the ability to listen. I highly recommend you to observe the scene in which Anant shares with her his deep devastation towards the end. This scene devoid of clichs is one of the finest in the film showing Om Puri's highpoint but at the same time Patil's wonderfully unconventional reaction of just being there quietly listening and ultimately lending him a hand of support. The film's climax is most unexpected and Ardh Satya is overall an excellent involving movie that is highly recommended.".

Nihalani directs this feature with great integrity and Vijay Tendulkar's script and dialogues are fantastic. Anant's relationships with those who surround him are aptly portrayed. The sequences showing his interaction with Jyotsna a young lecturer of literature are stupendous and are of the best in the film right from their first meeting which opens the film to the time when they are already considering a future marriage. There isn't a lot of romanticism about it but there's a lot of humanity and respect. Even the portrayal of his relationship with his parents in spite of the minimal screen time it is given is spot on and is very troubling.Ardh Satya is a oneman show and needless to say it is Om Puri who dominates the proceedings with his heartfelt brilliant performance as Anant. Puri is an actor who has very rarely delivered something unworthy although he has been given stuff unworthy of his talent. This performance ranks amongst the finest works of his illustrious career. He captures Anant's honesty determination anger and devastation with sheer intensity and is always moving credible and convincing. The acting in general is very good in this film but the rest of the cast are just here to support him and they do it well. Amrish Puri as the tough violent and authoritarian father is unsurprisingly excellent. He manages to convey a lot of his character's essence through just a few scenes. The same can be said about Sadashiv Amrapurkar who does a lot with so little. Shafi Inamdar is also pretty good as Anant's boss.Last but certainly not least Smita Patil is firstrate in a role that was totally in need of someone with her intellectual capabilities and would have turned into inconsequential by a lesser actress. This is not at all one of those powerful authorbacked roles she was known for playing but it's still a very special one in her career. She does not try to impress or steal the show. As Jyotsna she is natural pleasant and exudes a certain warmth that is missing in the film. Above all she had the ability to listen. I highly recommend you to observe the scene in which Anant shares with her his deep devastation towards the end. This scene devoid of clichs is one of the finest in the film showing Om Puri's highpoint but at the same time Patil's wonderfully unconventional reaction of just being there quietly listening and ultimately lending him a hand of support. The film's climax is most unexpected and Ardh Satya is overall an excellent involving movie that is highly recommended.";

Govind Nihalani creates a very practical Outlay with real life approach of Mumbai Police Environment.Amongst various Police officers  colleagues the film describes the story of Anand Velankar a young hotblooded Cop coming from a poor family. His father is a harsh Police Constable. Anand himself suffers from his father's ideologies  incidences of his father's Atrocities on his mother. Anand's approach towards immediate action against crime is an inert craving for his own Job satisfaction. The film is here revolved in a Plot wherein Anand's constant efforts against crime are trampled by his seniors.This leads to frustrations as he cannot achieve the desired Jobsatisfaction. Resulting from the frustrations his anger is expressed in excessive violence in the remand rooms  bars also turning him to an alcoholic.The Spirit within him is still alive as he constantly fights the system. He is aware of the system of the Metro where the Police  Politicians are a inertly associated by far end. His compromise towards unethical practice is negative. Finally he gets suspended.The Direction is a master piece  thoroughly hard core. One of the best memorable scenes is when Anand breaks in the Underworld gangster Rama Shetty's house to arrest him followed by short conversation which is fantastic. At many scenes the film has Hairraising moments.The Practical approach of Script is a major Punch. Alcoholism Corruption Political Influence Courage Deceptions all are integral part of Mumbai police even today.

	schema:reviewBody "The performance by Om Puri Smita Patil and Sadashiv Amrapurkar and the whole chemistry comes off nicely along with the minimalist approach to story telling and direction by Govind Nihlani. The dialogues by Vijay Tendulkar is also great. I have not seen another movie like this. It is one whole each piece so nicely fit in the plot. You cannot not be impressed by this movie. Amrish Puri comes off as the bossy husband and 'baap' of Om Puri. Om Puri is the young man caught between his sense of duty and his inability to fight the system. Sadhashiv as Rama Shetty gives just about the right touch to the movie with his smiling and soft speaking villain. The first meeting of Anand Velankar with Rama Shetty's at Sadhashiv's place is absoulely stunning. Smita Patil does not play a main role but her part is also not distracting from the main plot. And to add to this all Kafi Inamdar plays the role of a cop who has come to terms with the system and its workings. Saying right things in the right places and knowing how to keep himself away from trouble. He is also the 'guru' of Om Puri and helps him whenever he gets into trouble.The movie not only brings to focus the difficulties faced by a police officer trying to do his duty but also the other side of brutalities in police custody. Om Puri captures hopelessness and the burning desire to break free in this exceptional performance in Ardh Satya. A treat to all avid fans of Indian cinema.".

The filming is really tight and modern the writing is sharp and the leading role the sexually liberated executive woman played by Ruth Chatterton is spot on perfect. When George Brent appears after half an hour he matches her in a subtle convincing performance that shows why after having made twenty films already he still had his career ahead of him. Chatterton by contrast made few films later which is our loss.The astonishing thing about the plot of course is how racy it is. Even today with no holds barred just some letters in a rating system to have a leading woman sleep around with every handsome young man she wants without any down side no backstabbing no violence no disease no remorse nothing at all is bold. These days of course she'd be a poster child against sexual harassment on the workplace. But really the movie is about strength and romance and is remarkably modern and alive. The director is Michael Curtiz who made such a huge number of films some of the gems like this one get lost. Some of his other gems of course are not lost at all like uh Casablanca or Mildred Pierce. Give this its due. Worth every frame.".

That good character trait is what wins over the tough executive Miss Alison Drake who's hardboiled veneer is stripped by the end of the film. Feminists will dislike much of the last 10 minutes of this movie. Ruth Chatterton as Alison Drake is good.as the head of a car company. She makes the tough decisions and makes them in a hurry. She doesn't stand for any baloney. As for her men she's only interested in onenight stands and if the guy gets romantic the next day he's shipped off to Montreal! One guy turns out to be gay so that night was wasted for her.Almost stealing the show in a supporting effort is the diminutive Ferdinand Gottschalk as Pettirgrew. He was over 70 years old when he made this film and was looked less than five feet tall. He was a wonderful actor who did a over 70 movies in the 1930s!.Other things of note in the film were some cool sets including one fantastic one of a very Art Deco room with an incredible staircase. Also some of the clothes worn by Chatterton were pretty wild.Normally this is not my type of story but it was so well done that I thoroughly enjoyed it.".

A step forward for women right.Wrong! More like a step backward. Despite her position and prestige Alison Drake truly has no identity of her own. Why? Because she's ayou guessed it FEMALE. Love men children are in the end what she is all about. And she must view these pursuits as being in direct opposition to work career success. The private realm is the true place for a female and when it is not her personal self must subsume her public self. So in the end Drake's singular capacity to rule a big motor company is not only not acknowledged but becomes downright superfluous. Nine children and a prestigious family will be her legacy not nine million automobiles and a place in history .For with Miss Drake fulfillment trumps leadership feelings and emotions counter her incisive authority fluff is better than gruff an adorable winning weakness is preferable to the gallantry of strength and neediness and conventionality are so much more appealing than independence and passionate activity. Wholesome wifehood is really the thingso much more rewarding than dating an array of men while the hobbyhorse of family is ridiculously superior to the ugliness of business. Ask any man right? Yes guilt and the potency behind the female role carry the day with President Drake. And all the reciprocity involved in her business and social relations will never be recooped in the love and marriage which are her final lots. Nor will her forcefulness and challenging cleverness ever again find its natural rhythm in worldly affairs.And poor Ruth Chatterley too. For despite her many triumphant and funny moments so much of her excellent performance is plainly wasted as it spins from the height of womanhood into the male orbitand back toward adolescence.".

The private realm is the true place for a female and when it is not her personal self must subsume her public self. So in the end Drake's singular capacity to rule a big motor company is not only not acknowledged but becomes downright superfluous. Nine children and a prestigious family will be her legacy not nine million automobiles and a place in history .For with Miss Drake fulfillment trumps leadership feelings and emotions counter her incisive authority fluff is better than gruff an adorable winning weakness is preferable to the gallantry of strength and neediness and conventionality are so much more appealing than independence and passionate activity. Wholesome wifehood is really the thingso much more rewarding than dating an array of men while the hobbyhorse of family is ridiculously superior to the ugliness of business. Ask any man right? Yes guilt and the potency behind the female role carry the day with President Drake. And all the reciprocity involved in her business and social relations will never be recooped in the love and marriage which are her final lots. Nor will her forcefulness and challenging cleverness ever again find its natural rhythm in worldly affairs.And poor Ruth Chatterley too. For despite her many triumphant and funny moments so much of her excellent performance is plainly wasted as it spins from the height of womanhood into the male orbitand back toward adolescence.";

As Alison Drake the head of an automobile manufacturing company that was started by her now deceased father the actress plays a confident decisive woman that surrounds herself with good looking male secretaries and assistants that she can invite to her home after business hours for sexual liaisons. If any of the men get too chummy she has them fired or transferred by her only older assistant a trustworthy fatherfigure type Ferdinand Gottschalk named Pettigrew.But Alison tires of the routine realizing that everyone wants something from her and she doubts the authenticity of the compliments and a marriage proposal from Douglas Dumbrille not looking very suave in a bathing suit she constantly receives. Desiring to be 'just a woman' Alison escapes to a common part of town where she sees and pursues a man George Brent that she meets at a shooting gallery. They dance have hamburgers and a good time together but at the end of the evening he declines Alison's offer to take her home claiming he has a strict rule about pickups.Of course the man turns out to be Jim Thorne an engineer that her company just hired to design a car with an automatic transmission. However Alison learns that her regular routine doesn't work with Jim the vodka her butler serves doesn't make him amorous and he spurns her advances.Predictably this causes her to revert to being a more typical female one who's willing to chuck everything just to win him.Originally directed by William Dieterle and then William Wellman the only screen credit was given to Michael Curtiz who was brought in to reshoot the scenes with Johnny Mack Brown per some comments Robert Osborne made when the film aired on TCM who plays one of Chatterton's pawns.

	schema:reviewBody "I can't decide if this is so bad it's good so dirty it's clean or so serious it's funny. But whichever one of those this is I can't deny I still like it! She who must be obeyed is Ruth Chatterton the heiress to an automobile factory who is ruthless in the boardroom and calculating in the bedroom. She does one of three things with each lover she vodkas up after she's done with themSends one to her Montreal office to avoid future harassment or perhaps a lawsuit! gives another a bonus while ignoring them and most positively sends another off to Paris to continue his art education. Now that's financial aid! But each of these young men have one thing in common they aren't willing to accept this one night stand from the other mainly because this isn't allowed when it's a woman! The aging Chatterton she was 41 when this came out is an odd choice to play this sexcrazed C.E.O. But she obviously is enjoying this hardhearted working girl who declares I'm not fond of sweeping. I'm not at all domestic. Of course she's referring to being swept off her feet when answering an unwanted marriage proposal but when heman George Brent comes along her typical games do not come off. He's wiser to her intentions and doesn't mince words to let her down gently. Her aging righthand man Dudley Digges sees right though her and he knows that it is only a matter of time before the tables are turned.To tell the truth this isn't really a very good film but as far as precode drama goes it is certainly fun to study and at only an hour in length flies by. Chatterton is rather mannish in her demeanor and her actions so her way of seduction is right on as if never having been given feminine guidance. Of course she knows she's a woman deep inside so it comes off that she has been lying to herself for years a predictable turn to take during a prefeminist era. There's no middle ground here even when the head of an automobile retail outlet Douglas Dumbrille offers to double each of their profits through their joining in marriage. She has to be in charge. What do you think the changes of that happening with macho minded Brent will be? Art deco sets including the outrageous location of an organ being played in her home and a constant repeat of Footlight Parade's Shanghai Lil in the background as seduction music plus the use of the same swimming pool utilized for the By a Waterfall production number in that film. Delightful character performances by Ruth Donnelly as a shy secretary being romanced by Digges Rafaela Ottiano the rather severe looking maid who all of a sudden breaks into Shuffle Off to Buffalo and Charley Grapewin as a 14th Street drunk are fun touches while Lois Wilson has a nice small role as Chatterton's college chum who gets the earful of how this female lives her life.".

Ruth Chatterton the selfish wife in Dodsworth is wonderfully game as Alison while the usually bland George Brent her reallife husband at the time complements her well as Jim.

She has her way with just about every even moderately good looking man in the joint inviting them over to her house for dinner and to discuss business only to halt the shop talk midway through and throw a pillow suggestively on the floor while the camera discreetly fades to black. All of this changes when she meets George Brent an engineer hired by the company who is completely immune to Chatterton's dubious charms. Once she realizes that Brent isn't buying what she's selling she revamps her product opting instead to act like a typical woman which means asking Brent's help in starting fires and speaking in a highpitched singsong. By the end she's decided to chuck the business and hand it over to Brent so that she can be his dutiful wife.This film is absolutely absurd even by 1933 standards and you'll have to sit through about 40 feminist film seminars to wash the taste of it out of your mouth but it's rather fun to see just how backwards it can possibly be. Chatterton is a likable actress and she's got a lot of spunk. The car manufacturing setting means that the screenwriter can create all sorts of double entrendes using car part lingo and the whole thing's only about an hour long anyway so it breezes right by.Grade B".

Some just won't admit it as doing so would contradict their socialpolitical views.Those who have certain cultural expectations either relating to yesteryear's order of films or to present day will most likely be sorely disappointed in this movie. It will hit them on the head like a ton of bricks. This movie is truly one of a kind. Not to be missed!!I gave it a 710 which seems like a high score but actually falls in the middle of my bell curve for about 2000 different older movies which I have collected thus far. I rarely ever score 1010 and many classicera B movies get a 510 to 710 from me.".

It is about all women the nature of women.We are introduced to Allison Drake head of Drake Motor Company who wields power with authority and a swift precision. As it turns out she is a female version of the prototypically corrupt male boss. She uses her power to seduce those under her authority. She surrounds herself with attractive men and beds them routinely. Afterwards she shrugs them off like used toys. A man playing this role would be despised and so should she be. But it is a novel reversal of roles so it is interesting.However Allison laments that she has never found a real man. If she could only find a man who had the strength to stand up to her she might actually be able to fall in love. Cue the new male employee Jim Thorne a gunshooting pipesmoking heman who she meets accidentally outside the company. She is intrigued. He puts her in her place. When she finds that Jim is an employee of her company Allison puts the usual machinations in motiondinner for two at her house in a library replete with hunting trophies a shaker of vodka throw pillows at the ready. Jim of course remains all business confusing Allison. The remainder of the plot is rather predictable except for the disappointing ending.Released in 1933 this is a preCode production with the usual suggestions of nudity. It also features some amazing art deco sets and some beautifully sexy gowns.Besides the ending the film's only failure for me was the casting of George Brent as the heman. Someone along the lines of Clark Gable could have portrayed Jim as he was meant to be.In the end this film is interesting for its depictions of its era including the roles of both genders in business and in society.".

Basically Female qualifies as a PreCode film because it was produced between 1929 and July 1934 before the Production Code Administration in Hollywood could enforce the rules that it imposed on Hollywood film studios. What distinguishes Female from many films is that the heroine can do a man's job far better than a man.Alison Drake is the president of the Drake Automobile Company because when her father died she was the only person who knew everything about how to run the factory. Since then our heroine has immersed herself in the business and takes advantage of all the men who work with her. When she decides to discuss an issue with an employee who triggers her lustful emotions she schedules a time for them to visit her palatial residence and she plies them liberally with vodka somewhat like Catherine the Great did to fortify her armies. Naturally she has to deal with some of these same men on the job.

Eventually Alison decides that she has to beat the competition by marketing a new car unlike any before in history. She hires Jim Thorne George Brent of Jezebel to help them. The night of the day before Thorne shows up at the factory Alison leaves one of her own diner parties and runs into Thorne in town while he is at a shooting gallery. They dine on hamburgers and he takes her dancing but he refuses to take her home. Imagine his surprise when he arrives at the factory and discovers that Alison runs the place. Unlike all the other men that Alison has had at her beck and call Thorne refuses to let her take advantage of him.

	schema:reviewBody "This weird overacted psychological melodrama is a convoluted mess of a movie that takes forever to reveal any reason for being. Christopher Lee tries to develop an interesting troubled character but falls flat due to the messy script he's forced to deal with. As the quietly sinister titled character he spends the first three quarters trying to keep a hidden face behind the title character's obvious madness but it all explodes when he begins to see psychiatrist Alexander Knox a friend of his fiancee Betta St. John. Lee tries to explain frightening dreams that he's been having and what comes out indicates that these dreams involving murder and a possible second personality responsible. By the time all is revealed it's too little too late for the audience to care but fortunately the film is short so that the audience won't feel cheated by wasting their time.".

	schema:headline " Terrible Danziger rubbish that survives only as a curiosity...";
	schema:reviewBody "Wellknown to the actor's fans as one of Christopher Lee's first starring roles but not particularly widely seen this threadbare Danziger Productions thriller is pretty awful stuff even by its' makers' very low standards. Lee plays a standoffish businessman and WWII veteran who fetches up in a small Home Counties industrial town and starts investing in failing factories and is before long accepted as a leading member of the community and prospective husband for local beauty Betta St. John. Unfortunately he turns out to have a pretty murky past which only comes to light when he's probed by Alexander Knox's psychoanalyst...From the description above you'd be forgiven for thinking this might be a worthy British variation on Shadow of a Doubt but you'd be wrong. It is not only crummily made and largely badly acted this is the most midAtlantic sounding English village I've ever heard of as the Canadian Knox as well as the American St. John and some useless pinhead called Peter Grant as her disgruntled exsuitor all make no attempt to sound British whilst Lee himself for some reason adopts an American accent of his own that is far less polished than the one he managed for The City of the Dead a few years later  and let's not even get started on Patrick Holt's attempt to sound French it makes hardly any sense and describing it as a thriller is actually a massive cheat. Lee might be a disturbed murderer but aside from losing his rag a bit with a waiter and being a dick with several other people a la Franklyn Marsh he doesn't actually do anything hugely unpleasant before voluntarily wandering into Knox's office and pretty straightforwardly revealing everything certainly there's no indication that St. John is ever in any physical danger from him  he never even raises his voice to her. Even the final twist falls flat because though it was presumably meant to have some kind of Outer Limitsstyle ambiguity to it it just seems badly scripted and inexplicable. Also the YouTube version I watched was in terrible shape very blurry and crackly it looked and sounded like someone had spent decades using the reels for makeshift dustpans in the basement of the BFI and I'm not sure if a better print is even available these days.Horror fans may want to check this out because Lee is of course worth watching in one of his earliest starring roles trying hard to be a compelling onscreen presence even though you can see the film draining in the life out of him with each subsequent scene. Quatermass 2's Lomax John Longden gives easily the best performance as St. John's father but as he's surrounded by almost complete ineptitude on every side that isn't saying much.".

A low budget quota film that proceeds along without creating much excitement or thrills.In a starring role Christopher Lee is unfortunately saddled with an odd accent which diminishes his effectiveness somewhat but does look appropriately confident or haunted when necessary. Dr. Walton is played well by Alexander Knox but he only appears later on in the film which is a shame as the few scenes between Lee and Knox are the best in the film.
