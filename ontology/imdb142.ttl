I like her stormy relationship with a jaded bachelor cop almost past his prime. All of this was told and played brilliantly. I wish that they'd just left the thriller aspect out and concentrated on these two believable real and interesting characters. That was the movie to make.

BLINK uses these familiar conventions but becomes a powerhouse suspense flick with its convincing characters ominous camera shots and beautifully written script. Madeline Stowe stars as a blind violinist for a clubhouse band who is given her sight back with a fortunate or unfortunate corneal transplant. She has difficulty adjusting to the seeing world having recurring images flashed back at her at inopportune times. Even with this handicap she believes she has been an eyewitness to an escaping murderer but her biggest feat is to convince the police department of her credibility. Aidan Quinn an underrated talent plays the Chicago cop who believes her claim and falls in love with her in the process. What really stands in BLINK is the honesty in the leads' emotions afraid to care again after the conventional onenightstand. The atmosphere is most suspenseful using Stowe's actual eyesight as a mystery in itself. Amidst all the crap that has been radiated from these types of films BLINK delivers something credible for a change. Rating Three stars.".

The terrifying experience that she goes through together with the fears and insecurities that she feels as she starts to see again for the first time in twenty years are very effectively conveyed as a high proportion of her experiences are shown from her own pointofview. This creates a heightened sense of empathy for her character and a strong level of admiration for the gutsy way in which she deals with her unusual ordeal.Emma Brody Madeleine Stowe is a blind violin player in an Irish folk band whose ophthalmologist offers her the opportunity of an operation which could enable her to see again. After having a corneal transplant her vision is restored but it's often blurred or distorted and she suffers from a sideeffect called perceptual delay which means that the images she sees don't register until many hours later. When she wakes one morning in the early hours and hears a disturbance coming from her upstairs neighbour's apartment she opens her door and sees a man going down the stairs. Her vision is blurred at this time but later in the day she sees his face much more clearly.The murder of Emma's neighbour is investigated by police detective John Hallstrom Aiden Quinn who doesn't regard Emma as a credible witness. He's an abrasive character who openly ridicules her but later comes to realise that she's his only witness and also he's strongly attracted to her. The affair that they then embark on provides a temporary diversion but when Hallstrom regains his focus his investigation unexpectedly leads him to a suspect whose motive for carrying out a series of killings is extremely unusual.This movie features a number of sequences that are beautifully photographed. One in a train station another in the early morning mist and a third in Emma's room when her reflection is seen in the window are just a few examples. These moments add greatly to the visual appeal of Blink and also contribute enormously to the marvellous atmosphere of the piece.Blink is well directed by Michael Apted who takes time to show some of the issues that are preoccupying Emma as she adjusts to regaining her vision. Her memory of how she lost her sight when her abusive mother smashed her face against a mirror is deeply disturbing and seeing her own face in the mirror for the first time since she was 8 years old is understandably shocking. She also realises that she's unable to recognise what people regard as conventional beauty and so reflects on whether or not she's actually beautiful. The psychological turmoil that these issues cause isn't made any easier to cope with by the fact that her life is in danger and also her affair with Hallstrom is a particularly turbulent one.Madeleine Stowe does extremely well in what must have been one of her most demanding roles and the supporting cast is also very good.".

The irony is she only sees the killer in a sort of surreal way with the camera serving as Stowe's vision and showing us what amounts to little more than phantasms. She also suffers from mental time gaps with her returning vision. Stowe ends up falling for burly cop Aidan Quinn who decides she's telling the truth and protects her. There's a nice trick at the very end involving the killer. Suspenseful and stylish for its time with a thoughtful performance by Stowe.".

The irony is she only sees the killer in a sort of surreal way with the camera serving as Stowe's vision and showing us what amounts to little more than phantasms. She also suffers from mental time gaps with her returning vision. Stowe ends up falling for burly cop Aidan Quinn who decides she's telling the truth and protects her. There's a nice trick at the very end involving the killer. Suspenseful and stylish for its time with a thoughtful performance by Stowe.";

I am a woman and live alone with a dog and from the time she hears the noise upstairs to the next morning when she has the flashback of the man in her apartment well it really scared the crap out of me.

	schema:reviewBody "Blink is directed by Michael Apted and written by Dana Stevens. It stars Madeleine Stowe Aidan Quinn James Remar Paul Dillon Peter Friedman Bruce A. Young and Laurie Metcalfe. Music is by Brad Fiedel and cinematography by Dante Spinotti. Story sees Stowe as Emma Brody who after being blind for 20 years receives a double cornea transplant that mostly restores her sight. However she's subject to something known as retroactive vision which means that what her blurry vision at first sees doesn't register to the brain sometime later. A problem now because there has been a murder committed upstairs at her apartment complex and she's the only eye witness to the murderer.It's all set up to be a standard woman in peril thriller the kind that drops into the cinema on a yearly basis. But thanks to some technical smarts and a terrific performance by Stowe Blink is one of the better films from this particular subgenre. It's a bit saggy in the middle where probably thanks to the success of Basic Instint and Sea of Love in the five years previously Apted and co try to turn it into an erotic thriller as Stowe and Quinn's surly copper form a relationship but it's genuinely tense and the novelty of Emma's unusual affliction never wears thin.Apted and his team have devised a unique visual effect that lets us see the world through Emma's unusual eyes and the result is very unsettling. Blurry focus blends with wobbly vision and this allows for scary moments that stretch the concept across the films running time. It's of course a hokey premise and the formula at the core of the plot is nothing new but the character of Emma coupled with her affliction is. Emma is no poor victim looking for sympathy she's spunky sexy and not suffering fools gladly. She lives as an independent plays fiddle in a Celtic rock band The Drovers playing themselves and is full of feminine whiles. Stowe really gets to grips with the character and convinces fully. Quinn is OK plays sarcastic and moody with ease while Apted has a keen eye for the Chicago locale and Spinotti's photography is gorgeous in colour tones.It needed a better more frantic ending and that over played midsection stops it from being from the top draw of thrillers but otherwise it's well worth a look for potential first time viewers. 710".

Madelaine Stowe plays a fiddler blind since childhood maternal abuse who partially regains her sight only to become the only one who can identify a serial killer. Stowe is terrific in the part. Course sexually predatory and foul mouthed she is NOT the vulnerable tender Audrey Hepburn  Mia Farrow' victim we normally see in this kind of movie. Stowe is real perhaps too much so. Nonetheless this is an Oscarcaliber performance. Aiden Quinn nearly matches Stowe as the conceited callous police detective who doesn't so much as gets in touch with his feelings' than he acquires them as the story unfolds. This makes for an interesting character study but by film's climax we're worried more about him than Stowe. WARNING SPOILERS I believe the confrontation between Quinn and Stowe at the station was a mistake particularly Stowe's level of viciousness and vulgarity. This reduces our empathy for Stowe at the critical climax of the movie. The weird hallucinogenic confrontation on the commuter train doesn't help either. Better that the killer pursue and attack Quinn for getting too close. AN EXPLANATION FOR ONE PUZZLED VIEWER. The killer had either given the cross to the organ donor or she wore one. You can see this in a picture of her near the end of the film. After murdering a women he would place a cross on her. He made no attempt to reharvest' the transplanted organs except from Stowe. He strangled the women into unconsciousness. Despite the comment earlier in the film they were probably not dead when he raped them. He then cut their wrists so they would bleed to death preventing the harvesting of organs. I liked this movie a lot though I have to admit I felt a little empty at the end. Pardon the pun but Blink is certainly worth a look.".

The supporting players including the excellent James Remar are effective. I must admit though that the expression red shirt crossed my mind when a not very bright uniformed officer named Crowe and played by Matt Roth was assigned to keep an eye on Emma.

True the premise is a been there done that sort of thing with a romance between the detective and the potential victim with a serial killer in the shadows etc. However there is just enough originality here added to solid performances by the stars to make it worthwhile.Aidan Quinn no relation to Anthony plays a cute and quirky detective in the Windy City on the trail of a budding serial killer. Madeleine Stowe is a blue grassIrish violinist blind since she was eight. As the movie opens she is about to get cornea transplants and before long she can see sort of which is important since she has become a witness to murder. Some of what she sees are flashbacks to the day before which makes her a problem witness for the police. Some other flashbacks are to when her mother smashed her face into a mirror for playing with her makeup. How sick is that? I presume this was dreamed up by Dana Stevens who gets credit for the script which is a kind of mishmash of clever lines and shlock dialogue as though two different people or half a dozen wrote it.Michael Apted's direction is not inspired although it isn't all that bad either. But he doesn't develop the serial killer's personality and so the weirdo's motivation seems a bit of a stretch. Also undeveloped is the doctor whose love for Stowe is unrequited. The main thing is the erotic chemistry between Stowe and Quinn and the personality of Stowe's character which is original and the best thing in the movie. I think this would have received a better reception had Quinn's character fallen in madly in love with the violinist. As it plays we are not sure whether he really cares or not.Madeleine Stowe is sexy and does a good job in a demanding role probably the most demanding of her modest career. See it for her.".

Some of what she sees are flashbacks to the day before which makes her a problem witness for the police. Some other flashbacks are to when her mother smashed her face into a mirror for playing with her makeup. How sick is that? I presume this was dreamed up by Dana Stevens who gets credit for the script which is a kind of mishmash of clever lines and shlock dialogue as though two different people or half a dozen wrote it.Michael Apted's direction is not inspired although it isn't all that bad either. But he doesn't develop the serial killer's personality and so the weirdo's motivation seems a bit of a stretch. Also undeveloped is the doctor whose love for Stowe is unrequited. The main thing is the erotic chemistry between Stowe and Quinn and the personality of Stowe's character which is original and the best thing in the movie. I think this would have received a better reception had Quinn's character fallen in madly in love with the violinist. As it plays we are not sure whether he really cares or not.Madeleine Stowe is sexy and does a good job in a demanding role probably the most demanding of her modest career. See it for her.";

	schema:reviewBody "Michael Apted's direction sometimes gets in the way of true suspense the middle of the movie seeming to slow down and the killings take second place to the love affair. A red herring is thrown in and you might swallow it but the identity of the killer once revealed may come as a surprise. A brilliant performance from Madeline Stowe elevates Blink in an otherwise slow moving at times muddled movie. It's true that the story may stretch your willingness to believe at times though it seems that the delayed vision phenomena is accurate what makes this a really good movie is the quality of the acting. As for the plot its a thrilling and interesting crime as it begins to unfold adding touches of fear with scenes of the killer... seen mostly through Stowe's blurry eyes. The best thing about this movie is Madeleine Stowe playing the blind woman Emma Brody who is given a transplant operation to help her see again. While her sight is returning she witnesses a murder committed by a brutal serial killer and becomes his next target. Stowe plays her character really well making the blind scenes look genuine and making you care about her future. Aidan Quinn was OK in his role as Detective John Hallstrom the police detective investigating the serial killer case who surprise surprise falls for Emma Brody. Madeleine Stowe is sexy and does a good job in a demanding role probably the most demanding of her modest career. This is a top notch thriller that will keep you guessing until the very end and the soundtrack is not too bad. Overall rating 8 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "The thriller genre loves it's blind girls. Particularly ones who are being stalked by some kind of malevolent force be it supernatural force or simple home invader. From The Eye Blind Fear and more it's a classic setup with not always classy results. 1994's Blink however is so mature in its setup of the premise that when the thriller elements come along they almost seem out of place. Almost. Madeleine Stowe brings her doe eyed resilience to the role of Emma Brody a musician who has been blind since she was a very little girl following a sickening incident with her mother. She is undergoing a radical transplant to restore her vision which will give her the corneas of a deceased person. Stowe handles the early scenes of seeing for the first time in decades phenomenally really urging the audience to experience it alongside her. There's just one problem with this little operation the eyes she receives belonged to someone who either witnessed a murder or was crazy because soon she is seeing threatening figures following her and violent acts she isn't sure are even real or not. The film refuses to be an outright thriller and won't touch any horror tropes with a ten foot pole rooted in the notion that it's a drama that some scary elements have just happened to wander through on their way to a cheaper more exploitative piece. Stowe is never the helpless waif showing strong intuition and the will to persevere. She is assisted by rowdy jaded police detective John Hallstrom Aiden Quinn whom develops romantic feelings for her his brash tactics initially crashing and burning in the face of her fiercely independent nature. James Remar gives a nice understated turn as his partner Detective Ridgely. It's nice grounded work from all in a film that plays it dead straight despite its spooky subject matter. Definitely the one to go for in the sub genre.".

Handsome in a James Deanish way but without the extravagant thespianism and not afraid to have himself thoroughly deglamorized when the part calls for it. And that's him in Blink. He even musters a firstclass Chicago accent not surprising for a film shot in Chicago. Madeleine Stowe is equally appealing in part for quite different reasons. She has a low voice that is simultaneously throaty and nasal all her sinuses seem to be pumping away like a dolphin's and she has a tendency to break into endearing childish giggles when she is about to undergo a corneal transplant overjoyed at the prospect of being able to see again. And on top of all that she is a beautiful woman with a slender and very feminine body the kind of figure you might see in a 19thcentury illustration of Hans Christian Anderson's fairy tale about the little mermaid only better because Stowe has legs as well as a tail. I also give her bonus points because this is her most vulgar spunkiest performance on screen.The film doesn't have a lot of action in it. There is not a car chase in sight nothing explodes and all the murders but one take place off camera. About five shots are fired all together. But Apted the director has organized everything so that it rambles along without a boring moment except perhaps for the predictable shootout at the end. We have a halfblind woman in jeopardy locked up in a big garage with some moron who wants to tear her eyeballs out. Give me back those eyes that belong to her he says or something like that. The situation is straight out of Helpful Hints for Screenwriters  Part Three Section Two Subsection A sub b backslash 4. Put a blind woman in a dark room with a murderer. In fact the script is the weakest part of the movie. The heavy is another serial killer following a pattern which it takes the cops two hours to figure out. He's collecting the organs that were harvested from his dead girl friend. Some of it makes no sense. What's the business with the Byzantine cross? Why does he slash his victim's wrists postmortem so that the blood will drain away and the organ transplants no longer of use? That is since nobody bleeds after death anyway. And  okay  I can buy delayed perception although I've never heard of it but after her transplant Stowe begins hallucinating her mother the killer her boyfriend her neighbors even in their absence. We're only one step away here from the old Helpful Hints for Screenwriters story of the transplanted organs that carry the impulses and sensations of their donors. Cf. The Hands of Orlac or whatever. Enough to make me worry about my hair transplants. There is also something about Stowe's wanting to be in control all the time a desire of which nothing is made in the script and is only there to provide something for her and Quinn to fight about.But Apted pretty much compensates for these weaknesses through sheer efficiency. He even handles the atmosphere people with notable effectiveness. When Stowe bursts out of the police station's men's room after a brutal argument with Quinn we see a knot of cops in the background who have been eavesdropping and they casually break up and stroll away.There are also themes that explore the sensory apparatus of the human body. Actually it's quite a sensuous film. The chief theme of course is Stowe's vision and she's the actress for the part because her eyes are slightly crossed. We get some idea of her vision from time to time through a distorting lens and some morphing but it's a technique that's only used when it's called for. There are no visual fireworks other than that. None of the shots calls attention to itself as in Look Ma I'm a Director! It's a tactile movie too. There are two or three love scenes between Quinn and Stowe and they're pretty rambunctious. Lamps get knocked over and all that and she feels faces and hands while Quinn feels her. Pretty sexy actually but not at all titillating. Stowe has said she always made love with her eyes closed while she was blind and fantasized a good deal and in one such session Quinn asks her to open her eyes and look at him. It's a rather tender moment. The chemical senses are represented only by smell taste being neglected. There are lots of flowers in this movie. When Quinn visits the home of victim number three the husband had just brought his wife a large bouquet and Quinn is holding another bunch of flowers. In one scene Stowe tiptoes nude up to a vase full of roses that Quinn has given her and she sniffs one rapturously. And then there is the surgical soap. As for the kinetic senses there are several sports scenes  basketball two and baseball 1 in addition to the rather strenuous lovemaking. The auditory sense is centered around music. Stowe plays the violin. Quinn brings her CDs of The Drovers the Irish band she plays with of Vivaldi and of Pearl Jam. Eclectic remarks Stowe. I was drunk replies Quinn.This is worth watching if it happens along on cable. It's even worth renting.".

There are only about six of them but I can watch one and rewind it and watch it again and keep repeating if time and a life didn't intrude. These movies aren't necessarily great some aren't even good by critical standards  regardless I can view them over and over. Blink is one of those films. It's not a great movie although I think the acting of Stowe and Quinn are quite good. Yet out of all the movies I have on DVD or VHS and it's around 500 this is one of less than ten that I would always answer yes if someone asked if I wanted to watch it. I think the music has a lot to do with it. The soundtrack is good and the songs by the Drovers are excellent. The blind woman theme is a favorite of most men in particular however this one throws two great twists  one she is more independent than most other women who aren't blind and two she regains her sight very early in the film. The well done love scenes don't hurt but edit them out and this film would still retain it's multiple watching status for me. Women I have watched this with enjoyed it and surprisingly a few said it was the scariest movie they had ever seen. The reason given was the unknown element of danger and her level of vulnerability. I can see how this would be much more scary to women than to men. It is in no hurry to finish itself and I find that leisurely paced movies that hold your attention and provide suspense all the while are winners. I'm sure everyone has that movie or two that they love but can't explain why. Siskel and Ebert used to do a show once in a while called Guilty Pleasures about movies that were critically bad but they enjoyed. Which is the nearest thing to what I'm talking  but not quite. Overall a good movie and who knows it might become one of your cult favorites.".

There are two brief scenes with children in this movie that show what a subtle director can do with little or nothing but the real difference in this film is the main characters not exactly lovable people these two have a way to go before anything approaching romance is on the horizon and Mr Apted manages to traverse this distance in 106 minutes so if the world is not enough try this one out.".

There are two brief scenes with children in this movie that show what a subtle director can do with little or nothing but the real difference in this film is the main characters not exactly lovable people these two have a way to go before anything approaching romance is on the horizon and Mr Apted manages to traverse this distance in 106 minutes so if the world is not enough try this one out.";

	schema:reviewBody "The main reason I saw this film was not because I thought the plot sounded interesting or even because of the fact that it stars the beautiful Madeleine Stowe the reason I saw it is purely down to the fact that I remembered seeing posters for it in the video store when I was a kid. With such a nonchalant viewing reason behind me it probably wont come as a surprise that I wasn't expecting a lot from this film and it's a good job as Blink is a highly disappointing thriller with numerous problems and very little to recommend it for. The plot is not particularly original and focuses on the idea of a blind woman in peril. There is a slight twist on this theme as the woman in this film is not quite blind in fact she is the benefactor of a breakthrough 'eye transplant' which reenables her sight after over twenty years of being blind. A side effect of this treatment is the fact that she sees some things 'by memory' and this is a problem when she apparently witnesses a murder as she's not sure if it's real or just flashback...The film would be described a 'psychological thriller' and the reason why these films are often hit and miss is the main problem with this one. A film like this really needs a central character that is easy to get into and while I believe that Madeleine Stowe is a great actress she's not given the room to do much with this role. The plotting is not good at all and is often all over the place and too much of the film focuses on the tentative and boring relationship between the central character and a policeman on the case. This relationship feels extremely phoney and since it makes up a large proportion of the running time of the film it becomes a pretty big problem. There are a few decent scenes Stowe is very good despite the poor material though I would have preferred a lot more suspense given that this is really supposed to be a thriller. The ending is pulled off fairly nicely though its impact is lessened by the tepid film that preceded it. For a far better take on a similar theme see the fantastic 'Wait Until Dark' and skip this.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is sometimes described as a comedy and while it has humorous bits a more sardonic and biting form of humour most of the time it has never really felt at home being classified as a comedy in my estimation. I do like the rapidfire wit that Holmes seems to have here a bit more in abundance than in the canonical Conan Doyle stories but the Holmes presented here is a bit more dark and brooding more akin to the extracanonical 'Seven Percent Solution' Holmes in many ways.Wilder was an extraordinary director and genius who sometimes gets carried away with his subject in this regard he is sometimes compared with Stanley Kubrick. His films are often of epicproportions even though they are not essentially 'epic' subjects. This film is reputed to have been nearly twice as long as the final cut version but this may be apocryphal in that much of the raw footage never made it to final print and production. The restoration available on the disc currently available is in fact rather minimal  a few scenes and a few extras but not much more than the original release of the film. This is disappointing to many fans but in fact is more than most of us have had for a long time as the somewhat choppy film was often mercilessly cut for television broadcast.Holmes in this case is played by Robert Stephens an unlikely Holmes in comparison to standards such as Rathbone Brett or Gillette but still an interesting choice  quintessentially British reserved but daring brilliant yet flawed and faltering. Colin Blakely presents a stronger Watson than often portrayed before this film being made in 1970 presented this as a newer idea for Watson one that has been picked up by many subsequent productions. Wilder has the actors play at various issues of Victorian sensibility and morality including the implication dismissed in the end that Holmes might have a sexual identity issue. Christopher Lee who himself plays Holmes in other productions plays Holmes' smarter brother Mycroft here to good effect.The story line does have some inspiration from the canonical stories the BrucePartington Plans for one and from Gillette's play the strange case of Miss Faulkner introducing an ending that allowed for a love interest for Holmes in the end but for the most part takes the characters from Conan Doyle and runs far afield. Still this is mustsee film for any fan of Holmes and any fan of Wilder who saw this as one of his last great productions.".

Curiosity overcame me and I switched on at the sequence with Stephens and Genevieve Page on their bicycle. I was immediately fascinated particularly by the music which appears to have been specially written for this scene. Elsewhere in the film the music is taken from Rozsa's 1956 violin concerto which unusually was not written as film music but which partly inspired Wilder to produce the film.The acting is excellent particularly by Stephens slightly less so by Blakely although Watson is probably the most difficult Doylesian character to play. Clive Revill has also been praised for his part. Christopher Lee gives an early display of his impeccable technique. Genevieve Page is perfect in her role and the subtle nuances of her acting are a joy to behold. She also has a beautiful voice with a wide vocal range.There is also some brilliant casting. Stanley Holloway as a gravedigger is a witty reference to his playing of that part in Olivier's Hamlet although his Scottish accent is not the most convincing. Irene Handl made an excellent Mrs Hudson. Frank Thornton was also a fine choice for the tiny part of receptionist at the Diogenes Club. Britons of a certain generation had they been able to see the missing episodes would have recognised Noel Johnson as the sea captain in the Naked Honeymooners episode. Johnson had a distinctive and powerful voice and became famous in 1948 as the BBC fictional radio detective Dick Barton.It is of course sad that significant parts of the film have been lost. Nevertheless In its shortened form it works well for cinema presentation. Now that domestic DVD players are common a fulllength version would be perfectly acceptable since viewers would have control over which parts if any they might want to skip through. Meanwhile the German Spy episode in particular stands beautifully on its own. Wilder creates a wonderful feeling of the atmosphere of 1888. The outdoor scenes in Scotland also provide a nostalgic feeling for the year in which filming took place there presumably 1969 for the 1970 release.".

Now it's back on uncut and I'm glad I'm finally able to see it.A very strange movie but lots of fun. Some people think this is a spoof. It really isn't but there are some very funny momentsmy favorite is at the beginning when Holmes blasts Watson for how he writes about his casesWatson I've never said 'elementary my dear Watson' in my life!Poetic license Holmes. There's also quite a few funny one liners mostly delivered with great relish by Stephens and it does deal with the sexual relations of Holmes and Watson it was hinted that they were gay lovers. But it does involve a very serious case and the jokes stop towards the end. Stephens is actually very good as Holmeshe won't make you forget Basil Rathbone but he's not bad. Colin Blakely isn't as big a buffoon as Nigel Bruce was but he tends to overact a little. Page is just terrible as the mystery womanbut then again English is her second language. Lee surprisingly is kind of stiff as Mycroft. He's a very good actorI'm surprised to see him so bad.The movie is very lavish probably because Billy Wilder was involved...a lot of money and attention was given to sets and costumes and they actually went on location to shoot the end in Scotland. The cinematography is just beautiful and the movie was never dull. It doesn't always mix the comedy with the drama successfully but it works more often than it misses. As most people know this was HEAVILY edited before it was released and the uncut version doesn't seem to exist anymore. That's too bad but what remains is not bad. Worth catching...a must see for Holmes fans.".

Since then he has become possibly the most portrayed movie character in cinema history according to the Guinness Book of Records over 70 actors have played the coveted part in more than 200 films. So rich was Conan Doyle's description of Holmes that many readers have come to think of him as a historical figure and derive enjoyment from speculating on the finer detail's of the private detective's life. Likewise many authors and filmmakers have decided to expand on the stories of Sherlock Holmes creating new mysteries that perhaps Dr. John Watson forgot to publish. 'The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes 1970' is such a tale directed by master filmmaker Billy Wilder who also produced and cowrote with longtime collaborator I.A.L. Diamond the film.'The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes' was originally written and filmed as a threehour roadshow picture an episodic compilation of Sherlock Holmes' most difficult mysteries. Unfortunately the studio's unwillingness to take a risk with such a format meant that entire sequences including a prologue with Watson's grandson in London and a flashback to Holmes' university years were inharmoniously cut from the film. Though I was initially unaware of this studio intervention I met these findings with anger and frustration while the surviving picture is merely a good film Billy Wilder's original vision would certainly have been something special. I hear that at least one episode has been restored into later DVD editions of the film but most of the missing footage remains devastatingly permanently absent. The story as we now find it is comprised of two unequal portions the first concerns Holmes' interactions with a glamorous ballet dancer Tamara Toumanova casting doubt on the famous detective's sexuality while the second mystery demonstrates the efforts of Holmes and Watson to locate the husband of an beautiful woman Genevive Page suffering from amnesia.When littleknown British actor Robert Stephens first appeared on screen as Det. Sherlock Holmes I wasn't certain that he was the suitable man for the job Wilder had initially considered Peter O'Toole as Holmes and Peter Sellers as Watson before deciding to cast unknowns. However despite initially appearing too flamboyant to play Conan Doyle's brilliant investigator I'm happy to say that by the end of the film he had wellandtruly grown on me. While Stephens didn't quite match the stories' depiction of Holmes this is only because Dr. Watson's dramatisations often tend to embellish the truth and misrepresent facts about the detective's personality and demeanour  a point that is alluded to early in the film itself. Colin Blakely though given very little to do is a lot of fun as Holmes' companion and biographer playing the role a lot less serious than I've seen it done in the past. Christopher Lee also appears as Holmes' intellectuallyequal brother Mycroft whose associations with the British government may prove crucial to the case being investigated.".

Mikls Rzsa scores the music and cinematography is by Christopher Challis.There were cases that Sherlock Holmes worked on that were deemed of a scandalous nature and not for public knowledge. But Dr. Watson made journals and as Watson's private deposit box is opened some 50 years later one such journal now sheds light on one particular tricky case and one that also delved deep into the private life of the greatest of sleuths.Billy Wilder film's rarely need an introduction with a CV that contains Stalag 17 The Apartment Sunset Boulevard and Some Like It Hot his output it's safe to say is mostly remembered and quite rightly is often praised. The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes is not forgotten by Wilder fans but it most certainly is his most underrated. Originally made as a three hour movie the film was taken from Wilder and snipped to a two hour picture. So where once there was a four story narrative weaved together as an episodic humanisation of the consultant detective now sits a two story movie. That's it's still a fabulous movie is a towering credit to Wilder and his long time associate I. A. L. Diamond. With Wilder declaring his displeasure at the final cut of the film it promptly bombed at the box office. Further lending weight to its reputation as something of a stinker. But time has been kind to it where the advent of various home format releases and internet discussion forums has seen its stock rise considerably. And rightly so.Wilder deals an irreverent take on Sherlock Holmes but one that is not disrespectful to the world created by Arthur Conan Doyle. It's a loving recreation that simply portrays the man as a flawed yet still genius like human being one with his own hang ups and insecurities. Once this has been established in the first third of the movie and hopefully accepted by the audience Wilder and co then take us into familiar case to be solved territory. Once a bedraggled Genevive Page turns up at 221B suffering from amnesia and clearly in need of help we are whisked along with our intrepid duo on a journey involving canaries midgets Trappist monks Queen Victoria and the Loch Ness Monster. With Sherlock's mysterious brother Mycroft Lee front centre and very involved too. It may not be a mystery to appease purists of the Holmes literature but it's real good fun and contains one or two twists and revelations along the way.Robert Stephens plays Holmes as fey yet articulate intelligent yet complex but always with a nod and a wink that surely pleased his knowing director. Colin Blakely is pure effervescence as Watson excitable and exuberant and perfect comic foil for his more mannered partner. Lee is utterly splendid as the straight laced Mycroft Page adds a simmering sexuality to the proceedings and Handl is joyously sarcastic as Housekeeper Mrs.. Hudson. Look out too for celebrated stage and screen actor Stanley Holloway as a gravedigger. Rzsa's score is very upbeat even for the more reflective moments further evidence of Wilder having tongue nicely nestled in cheek and the score sits snugly with Challis' pleasing photography around the Scottish Highlands. Major bonus here is the marvellous sets by Alexandre Trauner particularly the recreation of Baker Street for here be a sometimes forgotten cinema art at its grandest.A crisp script is crisply executed by all involved this film deserves the credit that is now finally coming its way. 8.510".

	schema:reviewBody "Billy Wilder wasn't interested in making any old Sherlock Holmes movie and this film The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes reflect that if only in the sum of the parts that were finally kept in. He meant it to be a personal story on Holmes or rather chronicling the stories from Holmes that weren't included as 'official' stories in the Baker Street files by Dr. Watson. At the same time it was also fashioned as an epic threehour roadshow presentation but sadly as the 1970's dawned and crap like Hello Dolly tanked the roadshow slinked away from existence as did Wilder's preferred cut. And yet for the concessions Wilder had to make he intended it as a 'fourpart suite' with a prologue and two segments not kept in the film one or two of these is mostly complete on the deleted segments section of the DVD what remains like Welles with The Magnificent Ambersons shows more than enough artistic merit and invention of filmmaking and entertainment to suffice.In what remains of The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes are two stories pretty much complimentary to one another and almost making Holmes into a 'Pulp Fiction' kind of story arc. At first it looks to be about a mysterious invitation that Holmes and Watson the former bored out of his gourd without a good case to the ballet and there Holmes discovers that he's really been tapped to knock up a primadonna ballerina to which one of the funniest homosexual jokes unfolds. Then as Watson questions in the narration about what has really been Holmes' love life we see the story of a woman from Brussels who has come upon Baker street without any memory of how she got there though the clues eventually lead Holmes and Watson and the woman to Loch Ness and a mystery surrounding her husband's death... and hey is that really Nessie in there? While one wonders how the entire epic would have fit together and made the most out of Holmes' 'private' files one of the joys of the work presented here is how much Wilder is faithful to Doyle without missing out on his voice. This is a rather cynical and sardonic film and the laughs are the kind much like in other Wilder films that sneak up on you five seconds after the line or quip has been laid. It has that intelligence to really work as good dialog but also allow the actors underrated Robert Stevens as Holmes and Colin Blakely as Watson a really fantastic 'buddy' pairing of personality and wit room to work their stuff. Wilder also has the good mind to cast supporting players well such as a near unrecognizable Christopher Lee unlike his Hammer film Big Dog of the Baskervilles as Mycroft and Genevieve Page as the confused and sad and mysterious woman that leads Holmes and Watson on their story.If there are any bones to pick they're minor the look of the picture has a kind of odd fog or shade to it as if the director of photography was coming up with a technique that would suit Zigmond on McCabe  Mrs. Miller much better either that or my DVD had a bad print. It's not a terrible choice but in some scenes it just seemed ancillary to the story being told only in those foggy scenes on the water of Loch Ness are they effective. But in general this is a handsomely made selfreflexive film knowing of what Doyle's world is so meaningful but also questioning what makes its characters tick. It works for both Wilder fans and Holmes aficionados. Whether or not Stevens is the 'best' Holmes I still can't say some put Rathbone at the top while I can't wait to see more of Robert Downey Jr but he does lead a film that is wellpaced comictragic in equally satisfying measure and a few real honesttogoodness plot twists!".

	schema:reviewBody "The wonderful thing about Sherlock Holmes is that Arthur Conan Doyle's abilities gave us so much information and lack of information about him that we can invent details all the time. For example in 1886 Doyle wrote a manuscript which became A STUDY IN SCARLET and initially was entitled A TANGLED SKEIN. He named Watson his narrator Orrin Sacker and named Holmes Sherrinford. He thought better of both fortunately. However in the 1970s Gene Wilder made the movie SHERLOCK HOLMES'S SMARTER BROTHER and in it he made the younger brother third after the Canonical Mycroft and Sherlock Sherrinford and he is assisted by a Scotland Yard Sergeant named Orrin Sacker!Holmes is the only character in modern post 1700 fiction that generated so much interest as to make a cottage industry of books magazines clubs and continuations on his and Watson's and Moriarty's and Irene Adler's and Lestrade's adventures. Nicholas Meyer did two fictional continuations one THE SEVENPERCENT SOLUTION being turned into another successful film with Nicol Williamson Robert Duval Alan Arkin  as Sigmund Freud and Vanessa Redgrave. He is also the only fictional character that many people insist was real  not simply based on Doyle's teacher Dr. Joseph Bell the subject of a series of Bell  Doyle television adventures with Ian Richardson as Bell but a real Sherlock Holmes. That is real immortality folks. When was the last time someone suggested there was a real Prince of Denmark named Hamlet? This Billy Wilder film was unfortunately recut for economic reasons that Wilder could not control but enough remains to enjoy it. Although Robert Stephen and Colin Blakeney are not as powerful box office draws as Peter O'Toole and Peter Sellers would have been both were highly respectable performers. Stephen played the art teacher lover of Maggie Smith in THE PRIDE OF MISS JEAN BRODIE and Blakeney was the treacherous servant of Sir Thomas More in A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS and later one of the train traveling suspects in MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS. They are convincing in their parts here.Wilder's story is about a woman Geraldine Page who is fished from the Thames with Holmes' address on her person. She is trying to find her husband and Holmes agrees to help. The plot involving the Loch Ness Monster and national security problems enter Holmes' brother Mycroft  Christopher Lee in a rare comic performance is suitably complex and leads to Holmes stumbling a bit as he falls for the woman in the case. The conclusion is sweet in it's way but melancholy too.Wilder being Wilder he could not fail to bring in a sharp joke or two at the expense of his central figures. The Holmes  Watson friendship has been the subject of some speculation over the years just how close was the friendship? In the scene with the Russian ballet and their impresario Clive Revill we see Wilder making a thrust at this particular rumor. Also unfortunately in a cut scene Lestrade comes to a preoccupied Holmes with the news of another of those unsolved Ripper murders  they need him on the case. Holmes says he is too busy and can't get involved. Now we know why Jack got away with it!".

	schema:reviewBody "The plot is not based on any Arthur Conan Doyle story but nevertheless the plot used is one Doyle might have been proud of. It is for a change intelligent believable and leads to a satisfactory conclusion. The settings interpretations and dialogue are all top notch. Holmes almost meets his match when he lets his guard down and allows emotion to creep into his steely mind. Great stuff.Also they don't cut out his drug habit as if we were all little children who might take up a 5 proof cocaine habit just because we see it on screen. It's an adult movie for Sherlock fans.It's also very funny thanks to Colin Blakely's Dr Watson and supporting characters  the Russian ballet scene for example  superb mockRussian voices and misinterpretations such as Ees not your glass of tea? Watson's energetic womanising character contrasts nicely with Robert Steven's sombre Holmes. We get to know why he stays away from women  as if we couldn't guess. Genevive Page is excellent as the sexy spy.The first half is is where most of the humour is and then the plot gets going for real in the second half. A very enjoyable experience that should satisfy Holmes fans  like me. There have been some very good Homes inventions such as Spielberg's Young Sherlock Holmes and this is one of the earlier interpretations not based on any story but which does not spoil the Holmes character.".

In the Private Life of Sherlock Holmes the game involved missing engineersa submarine in Loch Ness crewed by circus midgets and a Russian ballerina with a request of a rather personal nature.

	schema:reviewBody "There have been many strange productions featuring the character of Sherlock Holmes. There's been Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century a cartoon that reimagined Sherlock Holmes in the future with a robot Watson. There's been the amazing Young Sherlock Holmes that features a sequence where Watson suffers from a hallucination in which he is chased by a giant cupcake. There's been the Asylum production of Sherlock Holmes featuring dinosaurs. All of these have been so out there that they have been entertaining regardless of how blasphemous they may seem to Sherlock Holmes enthusiasts. To me no Sherlock Holmes production can match the insanity strangeness and odd entertainment value of The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes. Directed by the great Billy Wilder The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes can be described in one simple sentence Sherlock Holmes hunts the Loch Ness monster. It is an absurd premise for sure and one with a twist ending almost too bizarre for words but I can't help but love this movie. It's both stupid and brilliant at the same time. Christopher Lee as Mycroft is inspired casting and the portrayal of Sherlock Holmes is way more touching and sympathetic than one would expect from a movie that features the Loch Ness monster as a main storyline.Much has been made about the fact that the studio made Billy Wilder cut the movie down from its original version. I have no doubt that Wilder's original version was even better than what made it to screen but I still love the final version. It's such a unique strange and all around different interpretation of the Sherlock Holmes mythos that it's near impossible to hate this movie. A movie this offbeat would never be made by a studio today. It's an oddity for sure though one that is definitely worth checking out for Sherlock Holmes fans.If there's a downside to The Private Lives of Sherlock Holmes it's that it's evident at times that the movie has been cut down from a longer version. It doesn't destroy the movie by any means but there are times when the flow of the film seems mildly choppy. The episodic nature of the whole production is inevitable since the film itself is divided into individual segments but every so often it's clear there was postproduction trouble.Even though it's probably viewed as one of Billy Wilder's lesser films The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes is well worth watching for Sherlock Holmes fans. It's a forgotten gem that one day will hopefully get the director's cut it deserves. I can't say it's perfect though it is at the very least a fascinating watch. Recommended. 810".

Holmes is a favorite from childhood and odd takeoffs on him are generally not appreciated. I have settled on the Jeremy Brett series as the definitive version but enjoy others that are well done. To me with remakes and other versions if the piece is well done it is not only acceptable but enjoyable. With remakes I don't know what's worse  it being a general flop as a movie or their changing it all around and calling it the same thing. Sometimes both happen. Usually if you like the subject matter you will probably like a good adaptation if a bit more inventive that the source material. The Seven Percent Solution movie was well done and enjoyable.I haven't seen a lot of Robert Stephens but have appreciated what I have. I looked him up and found that this was pretty light fare for his experience. This is a quality portrayal by him and the others do a good job as well. The overall production is pleasing. The Dr. Watson portrayal mystifies a bit that here and in other things they make him sort of ditsy. That doesn't fit the original stories nor what Holmes' temperament would seem to tolerate as a companion or assistant with his careful work. Maybe it came from the early Rathbone series with Nigel Bruce. Whether intentional or not he nearly always had a bumbler quality to his portrayal.This is a worthy production in all aspects which I would think garnered some critical approval at its time of release. I can see why it would take the public a while to adjust to seeing Sherlock Holmes as presented here. But it speaks of the film's overall quality that it has aged well.".

You will be first blown away by the fact that this movie even exists. It is truly unprecedented in every sense of the word. I don't remember seeing anything like it since maybe Nanook of the North which would be a stretch.  Unlike Nanook this movie is shot from the Inuit perspective the characters are not looked upon as anthropological specimens. They are people living in a fragile existence where any wrong move could mean sure death.The actors are astonishing and it must have been so terribly cold up there that you know this was a labor of love for the production team. The scenery is astonishing. Almost everyone who participated in this production was fullblooded Inuit. It is a beautiful story based on an Inuit legend that exists on many different levels and subplots etc. All told on the frozen tundra without ANY indication given about the timeframe or even century in which it was set.I am just astonished at the painstaking attention to historical detail. I have read many books on Inuit culture and most everything I have read was visualized in this movie the social structure the power of the patriarch the constant looming of starvation the role of the hunterhusband the insubordination of women prearranged marriages the obsession with taboo and curses the fine art of building igloos and staying warm in 60 temps and yet through all the hardships there was so much happiness. They even showed how the dogs were handled and treated even down to the way they would slicken their sledge rails by spitting small amounts of water on them until a layer of slick frozen ice formed which makes the sledges slide easier over the pack ice. The one thing that I thought of today was how the movie was TOTALLY absent of the white European influence. Their knives were made from caribou horns they had no metal knives or metal cookware which indicates that the movie was purposely based on a time before the Inuit's first contact with white men.It has a slow start it's only fault. You will be a bit confused at first trying to understand the characters and what exactly is happening but then it starts to really suck you in you begin to love the protagonists who are physically beautiful people and then you will grow to hate the antagonists who are mean and undesirable. Afterwards you will realize that almost all of these people cast and crew were fullblooded Inuit. You will then want to immediately see it again and demand a documentary on the making of this film. You will want to know who these people are what they do in their normal lives because most of these actors are making their big screen debut. The end of the movie gives you a quick behindthescenes peek but it serves as only a small appetizer to a bigger feast. Most importantly your respect for their pride and perseverance of their culture will increase tenfold".

They are people living in a fragile existence where any wrong move could mean sure death.The actors are astonishing and it must have been so terribly cold up there that you know this was a labor of love for the production team. The scenery is astonishing. Almost everyone who participated in this production was fullblooded Inuit. It is a beautiful story based on an Inuit legend that exists on many different levels and subplots etc. All told on the frozen tundra without ANY indication given about the timeframe or even century in which it was set.I am just astonished at the painstaking attention to historical detail. I have read many books on Inuit culture and most everything I have read was visualized in this movie the social structure the power of the patriarch the constant looming of starvation the role of the hunterhusband the insubordination of women prearranged marriages the obsession with taboo and curses the fine art of building igloos and staying warm in 60 temps and yet through all the hardships there was so much happiness. They even showed how the dogs were handled and treated even down to the way they would slicken their sledge rails by spitting small amounts of water on them until a layer of slick frozen ice formed which makes the sledges slide easier over the pack ice. The one thing that I thought of today was how the movie was TOTALLY absent of the white European influence. Their knives were made from caribou horns they had no metal knives or metal cookware which indicates that the movie was purposely based on a time before the Inuit's first contact with white men.It has a slow start it's only fault. You will be a bit confused at first trying to understand the characters and what exactly is happening but then it starts to really suck you in you begin to love the protagonists who are physically beautiful people and then you will grow to hate the antagonists who are mean and undesirable. Afterwards you will realize that almost all of these people cast and crew were fullblooded Inuit. You will then want to immediately see it again and demand a documentary on the making of this film. You will want to know who these people are what they do in their normal lives because most of these actors are making their big screen debut. The end of the movie gives you a quick behindthescenes peek but it serves as only a small appetizer to a bigger feast. Most importantly your respect for their pride and perseverance of their culture will increase tenfold";

	schema:headline " A remarkable film that dramatizes an Inuit legend with Inuit actors in Inuktitut with English subtitles.";
	schema:reviewBody "Perhaps the word that best describes this film is 'remarkable'.  It is remarkable that it was made at all by an Inuit film company remarkable that it was shot on location in the High Arctic in conditions of winter and summer remarkable for its absolute authenticity for its faithfulness both to its subject and to the Inuit culture which transcends remarkable.I have been to the High Artic more than once.  I have sat in the great silence of the north on the late summer tundra when it turns purple and the winds begin to blow across the ground and make the cotton grass sing.  I have heard the snow squeak at thirtyfive below zero as it did in this film filming in such conditions must have been a nightmare.  Metal does strange things at those temperatures cameras freeze and film becomes brittle and breaks into pieces.  Actors get cold and those just standing around get colder.  There are no local power sources.  And everything must be flown in by transport plane including everything needed for the film crew to live and eat.  There are no hotels and no restaurants no pub of an evening and the daylight hours for filiming in February or March are very short.  And in the summer there are the flies.The use of Inuktitut which is still a living language preserves that essential atmosphere of complete authenticity the building of igloos the darkness inside the communal dwelling with only seal oil lamps the use of bone and driftwood and dried seaweed for tools and fuel are absolutely authentic.  And yet not once did I have the impression of watching a documentary.  These were real people living real lives using real tools wearing real clothing relying on the hunt on luck and on each other for survival.The story is set a thousand years ago. It is a legend but one easily sees that it was a real story passed down through time in the oral tradition. As it plays itself out  in the slow pace of Inuit time not the frantic highpressure pace of our everyday existence  the rules of survival become clear family alliances taboos social practices. Where survival in a lethal environment is moment to moment social rules broken have immediate consequences not only for individuals but for the whole community which usually consisted of no more than a dozen or so related individuals.  Jealousy murder theft could not be tolerated.  The story must not therefore be judged by our standards.  The only way to see this film is with complete openness not only must you let the characters tell you the events of their drama you must let them show you why those events were so destructive and why their way of dealing with it was right for them.This is about survival in a way that someone living in a city with a supermarket down the street medical care and central heating can probably never fully grasp. It is not for the smallminded not for anyone who cannot see past his own prejudices or narrow moral concepts and it is not for the squeamish.  Survival is messy it involves animal guts and blood and pain it involves you in your own continued existence in a way that we can no longer experience in all our plenty and our ease.  This film is also about fierce love blinding jealousy hatred courage and abiding patience  all things we share in our common humanity.  But the filmmakers did not present the characters as 'noble savages'. Life was about food about having it or not having it about hunting it gathering it bringing it home preparing it preserving it eating it and then doing it all over again.  All the time.  The Inuit are in no way 'primitive' people whatever that truly means this is how they survived.  We couldn't do it  and perhaps that makes us the primitives.I was fascinated.  It takes a short while to become used to the unfamiliar the setting the names the culture shock.  After that it is compelling and very very real.  The events unfold tragically and inevitably in a distressingly familiar a frighteningly human way.  And you care deeply about the characters about what happens to them about whether they win out  because it is made very clear that they have every chance of not surviving for any number of reasons.And it is gorgeous.  The Artic is immensely photogenic but the cinematography was up to the challenge.  The sounds are a whole new experience for those who have never been there  the wind the squeak and crunch of the snow the dogs the singing the drumming the rattling of bones the sounds of the ice.This film is an experience if the Arctic has ever intrigued you this must not be missed.".

But when the title became available I decided to as they say throw caution into the wind and watch this. After finishing it I'm really glad I had the experience as it's a pretty amazing movie both in it's story and the sheer fact that it got made. The story is about one man Atanarjuat and his daily life in the cold harsh arctic. He seems to get along well with the other Inuit but soon a power struggle erupts and soon he has to rely on the powers within himself and others to overcome great odds thrown in his way. Again the sheer fact that this was made and the fact that they found actors in the caliber of performance that Natar Ungalaaq Pulls off is nothing short of remarkable. I don't know the full story of how this was made but I am sure these are first time actors here and they just ace it. Probably because the story hits so close to home. The lead actor Natar Ungalaaq is to be especially commended for taking so many acting risks as he did running naked on ice floes?? The only problem I have with this and this seems to be a common complaint with people who watched this is that it's quite hard for the first hour or so to figure out who's who. But other than that yeah try to see this one if you can you'll be glad you did.".

I do not recommend reviewing the extras on the disc before watching it it does have a slow start as you try to understand the hierarchy of the tribe but when it goes you are on edge. What amazed me the most is that these UNPOLISHED actors did such a remarkable job especially in their emotional display. Worth buying to keep such gens don't come easy".

I live in a very cold climate and my appreciation for the Inuit and other northern aboriginals has magnified. This movie did not get the publicity it deserved not even in its native country. I do not recommend reviewing the extras on the disc before watching it it does have a slow start as you try to understand the hierarchy of the tribe but when it goes you are on edge. What amazed me the most is that these UNPOLISHED actors did such a remarkable job especially in their emotional display. Worth buying to keep such gens don't come easy";

We all want this to be a good film and we all want to be able to say that it's a good film but we can only do so by thinking so by ignoring the plain evidence of our eyes and persuading others to do likewise.The first thing we must ignore is the lousy cinematography. Atanarjuat was shot not on film but on digital video ... and don't believe anyone who offers the justification feeble even if true that it's just too hard to shoot on film in subzero temperatures. It was done in the 1920s and it's still done today. Is it perhaps too hard to shoot 35mm inside igloos at night? Not inherently so after all Stanley Kubrick shot Barry Lyndon by candlelight back in the mid1970s. There's no excuse for shooting as badly as this when it can be done properly  and for that matter no excuse for shooting AT ALL if it can only be done this badly. The ice vistas cry out for the sensuous subtlety and razorsharp precision of film. It's an insult to the material to settle for less. Imagine how badly Lawrence of Arabia would have been spoiled if David Lean had said Ack the sand ack the heat  I think I'll shoot on video.Make no mistake the digital video ruins the film all by itself. It's ugly to look at we can tell by a process of mental reconstruction THAT the ice fields are beautiful but we cannot actually see the beauty. Outlines are fuzzy it's hard not to squint at them. Necessary details are lost. The pervasive lens flares nearly drove me nuts. In places there's a weird blotchy purplish discolouration that I'm at a loss to explain. The lighting continuity errors and there are many are somehow made more obvious. And  although the digital technology is only indirectly to blame for this  the amateurish Dogmestyle framing is infuriating. Some say the digital video is the only flaw which apart from being false is like saying It's a good film apart from the fact that all 243360 frames are terrible.At first I thought that the story would be as tedious and incomprehensible as the first hour  or perhaps it only feels like an hour  promises but luckily the outlines of a true epic begin to appear and make it possible for a conscientious audience member to make it through to the end. It's good that the film is so long  or at least it would be good if it were at all well made. Perhaps it's good anyway as it gives us time to get used to the film's many failings and begin to ignore them. We start to care about the central character. This is by no means the utter disaster the opening hour half hour whatever would suggest. But not being an utter disaster is hardly much of an achievement. The acting is at best just barely convincing at worst painfully unconvincing the music is uninspiring the editing has so far as I can tell not been thought out at all and the entire supernatural basis of the story has been muffed completely. It would have been franker to leave out the sorcery altogether rather than to have the cinematographic equivalent of a halfmumbled Oh hang on a minute I forgot the tribal elder was possessed by the Lord of the Walruses and ... uh ... some magic stuff happened.These are not nitpicks they are deep flaws that completely undermine the story's sweep. Nor are they aspects of the film that anyone except children perhaps could honestly claim not to have noticed. We cannot but conclude the lavish praise bestowed on Atanarjuat has not been offered in good faith.".

	schema:headline " A wellintentioned but disappointing film.";
	schema:reviewBody "I am one of probably three Canadians  I think the other two are in hiding  who doesn't believe that Atanarjuat  The Fast Runner is a great film. Every Canadian film critic I have read has declared this to be a masterpiece or close to it. The critic at the Globe and Mail which modestly calls itself Canada's National Newspaper gave Atanarjuat four stars. I cannot remember any film at least not in recent years receiving that kind of accolade from the Globe.I went to see Atanarjuat at an art theatre in Ottawa full of eager anticipation. The trailers I had seen had been promising. The image of a naked man running for his life across the Arctic ice was irresistible. And then there was the Arctic itself vast and magnificent in endless whiteness and desolation. The opening scenes of the film were stark and arresting and I settled down to enjoy the next three hours. Unhappily though thirty minutes later I was squirming in my seat and checking my watch moaning almost audibly that there were still  more than two hours to go.Frankly I found Atanarjuat to be an amateurish and frequently boring film however wellintentioned. The boredom is occasioned in large measure by the fact that it's at least an hour too long. There are some good sequences and some indelible images but these in my opinion founder under the awkward weight of the whole. I have described the film to friends as an Arctic Western not greatly different in content from the hundreds of melodramatic oaters that flowed out of the Hollywood machine in the thirties forties and fifties.In Atanarjuat we have two good brothers battling three bad brothers and their wicked seductive sister. Atanarjuat and the elder bad brother compete for the same woman and Atanarjuat wins. The three bad brothers murder one of the good brothers. Atanarjuat escapes  just  taking his famous naked run across the ice while the bad guys burdened with what looks to be fifty pounds of sealskin clothing apiece stumble along behind him and eventually drop away. At film's end Atanarjuat returns to the community and in a kind of metaphorical shootout at the OK igloo he bests the three bad brothers and they along with their wicked sister are banished from the community. Atanarjuat and his wife reunite.It's all too familiar and even with an overlay of Inuit myth about an evil spirit that afflicts the community it didn't work for me. The film's dialogue at least as it is expressed in the subtitles is mostly banal. Perhaps the actors are saying interesting things in Inuktitut the Inuit language but little of that comes through in the mostly oneliners that appear onscreen. It was also very annoying that the director shoehorned into the film a vaguely Hollywoodish sex sequence between Atanarjuat and the wicked sister complete with the trendy orgasmic bleating that has become all too commonplace in the mostly bad and mediocre films that flood across our screens these days.Even the celebrated chase sequence across the ice perhaps the signature moment of the film fell rather flat for me. Like Atanarjuat's pursuers I felt it ran out of steam before it was over. Interestingly it reminded me of the chase sequence in the 1939 John Ford film Drums Along The Mohawk where Henry Fonda is pursued by three Indian warriors  the number three has an enduring mythology that transcends many cultures  running for his life across the New York countryside in Revolutionary times. The sequence with Fonda will linger with me for much longer than the one in Atanarjuat. Well it has already I first saw Drums decades ago.The film that comes most readily to mind though after seeing Atanarjuat is Himalaya the 1999 film directed by Eric Valli who used a cast composed almost entirely of local amateurs. In my opinion Himalaya succeeds where Atanarjuat fails although both were focused on local traditions and conflicts and both were set in remote nonwestern locales. Himalaya no masterpiece itself but very watchable is simply a better film.One of the things that does come through in Atanarjuat and very powerfully is the depiction of a strong and resolute people who live in an environment that places them almost literally on the knifeedge of survival. It is astonishing on every level that they do survive and in a sense prosper making full use of the few resources at their disposal. Even here though I have a minor quibble the film appears to be set in prehistoric times long before the white man entered the picture. Yet in a number of scenes the Inuit are using implements of iron and steel. One wonders where they could have obtained them.All of that having been said I think Atanarjuat is an important film. And I don't say this in a condescending way. As many have pointed out on this site and elsewhere this is probably the only featurelength Inuit film ever made. Some commentators have suggested that it will likely be the only Inuit film we will ever see. I hope not. Film is important arguably the most effective way for one culture to communicate with others and with itself. One hopes that there will be more Inuit featurelength films building on the few but genuine accomplishments of this one.".

It also makes a profound assertion  that the way to get rid of evil is not with more evil but with forgiveness.  Since all the action takes place within the physical and cultural confines of a Stone Age culture one might think that the drama lacks emotional depth vigor or subtlety.  On the contrary perhaps it's because the movie is bereft of theatrical embellishments and stratagems the problem comes all the more clearly into focus.  Despite the wide cultural divide between the Postmodern world of the twenty first century and the primitive world of our huntergatherer forebears we easily identify with the main characters their hopes fears and ambitions.  For that reason alone Atanarjuat is a remarkable movie.  With respect to the problem of evil however what I really love about the film is its emotional complexity which one wouldn't expect from a threehour epic revolving around the daily lives of a Stone Age culture.  On one level there is the Shaman and his curse.  It's part of the package that comes with the religious beliefs of the people.  If one believes in the ability of dead ancestors to come and render assistance to the living it's also possible for spirits to bring calamity and misfortune to the same.  In this film beliefs that for me are about as tangible as a ghost in a fog come alive.  On another level Atanarjuat like Hamlet delves deep into the origins of evil within the human heart.  Good old family values such as love affection greed lust and murder come clearly into focus.  We're left with judgments about what is right and wrong  judgments that the clan reaches from within the internal logic of its own values  but also with understanding.".

When he falls even having just come in from the sweltering summer heat you feel the cold.This is the best scene in Atanarjuat the Fast Runner' a movie very different from any other you will have seen. What makes it so special is that it is about and made entirely by the Inuit of Canada. It immerses you in the harsh nearly desolate world of a tiny Arctic community.In such a small group where a few families live in confined spaces tensions can be explosive. The story is centered around the rivalry of Atanarjuat and Oki over Atuat a rivalry which echoes that of their fathers Tulimaq or Sauri for leadership of the tribe. In the prologue to the main story we see Sauri assassinate his father with the aid of an evil spirit who continues to haunt the tribe. The struggles of the families of Tulimaq and Sauri lead to a betrayal and a murder that sends the naked man running across the ice. It is a good story though it is long slow and sometimes hard to follow. What makes it so memorable is the remarkable lifestyle that it makes seem so real. From dogsleds and ritual combat to seduction and exorcism we see many of the facets of premodern Inuit life which was built entirely on just two things water and the flesh and bones of Arctic animals. The acting is completely convincing the music is sparingly but powerfully used and the cinematography captures both the beauty and cruelty of that vast wilderness in the north of the world. It is something far from the conventions of Hollywood and if you have the patience you will find it fascinating.710".

Perhaps I am misguided to demand some sense of pacing from this sprawling three hour mess of a film to demand compelling performances from its actors or some sense of meaning from the story.  It can easily be argued that Atanarjuat is not meant to work on the same level as so many of the films moviegoers even arthouse moviegoers are accustomed to seeing.  Even if this is true however it is an answer I cannot accept.  I hope that more and better Inuktitut films will be made in the future but I cannot say I think that this is a promising start.

	schema:reviewBody "Some people have claimed that just because this film is so unique and strange that it must be accepted and critiqued on its own terms. To me that is a copout. By putting their stories and legends to film the Inuit people are now subject to the terms of film. As a film this is not good. The digital photography is amateurish and distracting. The editing is horrible. The direction is no better than any runofthemill student film.The opening half hour is confusing and poorly constructed. It took quite awhile for me to understand what had happened and even longer for me to care about what was going to happen. The supernatural elements of the legend were downplayed and muddled I suspect due to budgetary constraints or the fear that these people might come off as too primitive and superstitious. There's no reason such a simple and universal story of tribal revenge and overcoming evil needs to be three hours long. And while it's interesting to hear this language on film the actors speaking it all fullblooded Inuit newcomers to film are stilted and overreaching the crying of Puja annoyed the hell out of me. It's not all bad though. The opening shot of one man and some sled dogs howling at the moon over the icy tundra is striking and beautiful. There's some loving and thoughtful closeups of the natural beauty of the Inuit faces the women adorned with some tribal tattoos and the central conceit of a naked man running across the icy landscape for his life is pretty powerful despite the fact this it is poorly photographed and edited.For all its faults this is a landmark film in that it is the first dramatic narrative from this unique and isolated culture that Western society only discovered less than a hundred years ago. On those grounds the film is at least interesting to the extent that you learn much about these nomadic huntergatherers of the frozen north and you ultimately learn that any culture rich in tradition and familial ties from modern or ancient times holds the same heartfelt desire to live a peaceful life on their own terms.This all should be very fascinating for cultural anthropologists but pure torture for the average moviegoer. Still this is worth watching for its uniqueness even if the only thing you take from it in the end is that you can say to someone Hey I saw that Inuit movie!".

Like the movie Kandahar the honest verisimilitude of a world we would never see on our own by native filmmakers and actors adds immeasurably to the experience.I was confused by the prologue with its flash backs and flash forwards and it took me a bit to sort the characters out. But once I did I felt like I was watching a primal universal story unfold with the same very humanness of Genesis and Greek and Roman myths  sexual attraction seductive vs. loyal women ah all through time and space men think with the same part of their anatomy! sibling rivalry jealousy elder wisdom natural leadership playful children the search for food and supporting a family and as always  seeking an explanation for man's violent tendencies. Here's it's all compounded by the exigencies of living in a very difficult environment where enemies perforce have to cooperate to survive and privacy and independence can be death. I absolutely got completely swept up in the story if the audience wasn't a bunch of senior citizens they probably would have joined in my involuntary oohs and aahs at the dastardly acts of villains the struggles and revenge by the hero particularly his amazing naked escape over a glacier the beautiful smiles of the women and the victory of true love  and reaction to the solution unique to their culture. These are not stereotypes but towering mythic figures given life and cold breath.Over the credits we see how they shot this film in excruciatingly difficult situations for both actors and film crew. The cinematography is particularly outstanding as our eyes adjust to the differences in microclimates and it is sometimes summer  time for caribou hunting.The music however is disappointing  rather than native sounds we hear a melange of world music from Shanachie CDs including throat singing from the other side of the world  what's with that? originally written 772002".

It's also important for bringing to the world an ancient story most of us would never have heard of otherwise.Let's also not mistake a hardtomake film for a good one. 1995's Waterworld was hard to make too and about as entertaining as this one.However a film is supposed to do a few things.1. Tell a Story.Halfway through this film I was lost. Now for that to happen in such a slowpaced film is saying something. Then when I read a plot synopsis it appears that not only was I lost but the parts of the film that I thought I knew I apparently didn't know at all. For a film to be good it shouldn't require prior knowledge of an obscure culture or a secondary source to follow along with.2. Entertain.The editing of this film was such that the story tension and character detail were both sacrificed to the priority of documenting a past Inuit way of life. This is the same mistake that science fiction and fantasy films make when they try to dazzle you with their special effects as if a CG dinosaur is impressive just because it is on screen for the first time Jurassic Park. It's not. The past and current Inuit way of life is well worth documenting in film. But it belongs in a documentary not a drama. If cut in half it could be a better film.3. Yes Entertain.While there were some truly beautiful shots much of the cinematography was little better than you'd expect from any schoolboy with a handheld camera. I found myself imagining what the same onscreen action would have looked like if a competent team had been permitted to film it. It could have been given the weight that a story that is this important to its people deserves and could have drawn in other viewers to this story. That didn't happen.Some final random thoughts I have never seen so much urination in a movie that was not pornographic. Also it was not good to be a dog in the old Arctic. It was even worse to be any other nonhuman animal. Last apparently the word translated as forgive doesn't mean forgive at least as most people understand the concept.

	schema:reviewBody "After realizing the first hour was unnecessarily included in this film I took a break from the utter boredom and read some reviews here in hopes of finding something that would convince me to watch the next hour. And I found plenty but mostly from people who were intrigued by the Inuit culture. I had never heard of this culture but I figured what the heck. So I went ahead and watched the next hour and while the oneatatime fight scenes were a bit intriguing I remained pretty much bored. I understand the culture is a bit savage but that still didn't hold my attention. It took a while before I found the energy to watch the final hour of this movie. It turned out interesting but not super interesting.This movie was not meant to be a documentary but the camera work reminds me of one. I think it would have been better if it were done as a documentary. I see lots of interesting documentaries about strange cultures on the Discovery channel but this pseudodoc bored me to sleep several times. They could've used a good editor to prevent spontaneous audience narcolepsy. I've seen better one hour documentaries about a cheetah catching a whateveritwantstoeat dinner.One person who rated this more than 7 stars said The actors are astonishing and it must have been so terribly cold up there that you know this was a labor of love for the production team. The scenery is astonishing.A few other people made similar comments.But the truth is the acting is borderline. Most of it is similar to cheesy Latino daytime soap operas. The scenery is hardly astonishing it is mostly a blend of blue sky snow and boring small rocks. There is much better scenery in a documentary like Touch a Void.With some better editing this film could be rereleased remove the boring stuff and hit the nail on the head. Kinda like that scene where the two adjuncts hit each other on the head for a challenge.The subtitles could also use a bit of work too. Most of the captions are yellow on a white background. Not very easy to read. And they often linger for a brief moment not giving you enough time to read them. And there is too much dialogue that doesn't even include captions. This could have been a very good documovie with better editing. Where are the next two thumbs up going to land?".

And I found plenty but mostly from people who were intrigued by the Inuit culture. I had never heard of this culture but I figured what the heck. So I went ahead and watched the next hour and while the oneatatime fight scenes were a bit intriguing I remained pretty much bored. I understand the culture is a bit savage but that still didn't hold my attention. It took a while before I found the energy to watch the final hour of this movie. It turned out interesting but not super interesting.This movie was not meant to be a documentary but the camera work reminds me of one. I think it would have been better if it were done as a documentary.

	schema:reviewBody "The Argentinian film La cmara oscura 2008 directed by Mara Victoria Menis was shown in the U.S. with the title The Camera Obscura. It stars Mirta Bogdasarian as Gertrudis a woman so unattractive that her own mother cannot bear to look at her. Actually Ms. Bogdasarian isn't even remotely as unattractive as the character she portrays. Nonetheless the point of the story is that she's unattractive so we have to accept it.I knew that some Jews who escaped the Holocaust managed to get into Argentina. However I didn't realize that immigrants like Gertrudis's family had arrived much earlier to escape the Russian pogroms. They settled in rural Argentina and became farmers and ranchers. The story moves forward 20 years by which time hope has been lost in regard to a marriage for Gertrudis. Nonetheless she does eventually get married to a wealthy widower whose first wife was beautiful but unfaithful. The plot really begins much later after World War I when Gertrudis her husband and her family are living on their large ranch. Into this situation comes a French photographer a former war correspondent who takes pictures of everyone including Gertrudis. What happens next is somewhat ambiguous and each viewer will have to decide the significance of the last scene in the film. Apparently Ms. Menis has been quoted as saying that the last scene is not ambiguous. Most of us in the audience thought it was.An interesting facet of this movie is the portrayal of Gertrudis's husband and their sons who have adopted the Gaucho costume and who work alongside the hired ranch hands. In the same way the women work hard at the traditional female jobs. An English squire in similar circumstances would have a life of leisure and his wife would have maids to do the hardest work. Not so apparently in Argentina. Assuming that this is an accurate portrayal I found these facts fascinating.The film has some beautiful scenic shots and they'll be mostly lost on the small screen. Better to see this film in a theater if possible. We saw it at the excellent Rochester Jewish Film Festival.P.S. For reasons I don't understand this movie has a dismal weighted IMDb average of 6.3. It's not a great film but it's much better than that. The Camera Obscura is definitely worth seeing.".

The customs inspector suggests she could be called Gertrudis after his own girlfriend.Gertrudis has a hard time throughout her youth. Growing up she meets a subtle cruelty from her classmates.

When Leo Cohen a Jewish widower goes to find a substitute for his dead wife he passes over Gertrudis' sisters and selects her. He obviously sees quality in the homely woman whom he will use as a way to get children for all practical purposes Gertrudis becomes his slave. We do not even see a kind gesture from this man toward the woman that has done everything for him without even complaining.When the French photographer JeanBaptiste arrives in the farm he is surprised by the self effacing woman who refuses to be photographed with her family. During his stay Gertrudis listens riveted to what the stories the man has to offer. JeanBaptiste who has been injured during WW1 has seen enough horrors in his lifetime that he now wants to escape from them by taking pictures of beauty. He finds in Gertrudis the kind soul that has been taken for granted by her family and the world at large.Maria Victoria Menis the director and adapter of a short story by Angelica Gorodischer works in subtle ways in this moody film that is basically a character story about Gertrudis. The film is slow in the European tradition. Ms. Menis has brought the viewer into a magical world where beauty of the land contrasts with the outward appearance of a woman that has tried to erase herself from existence. Gertrudis has lived with a man for many years without being given any kind of affection by a cold husband and indifferent children. When JeanBaptiste arrives she begins examining her life and she is reborn because she feels wanted and appreciated by the French man that happens to come her way.The work of Mirta Bogdasarian is pitch perfect. She really understands what it is to be looked down because the outward appearance. Gertrudis is played with a subtlety that with another actress it might have not been possible. Ms. Bogdasarian is the whole reason for watching the film. Patrick Dell'Isola does a fine job for the director. Fernando Arman gives a solid performance as the selfish husband that has no clue about the gem he had but did not appreciate.The film is beautifully photographed by Marcelo Iaccarino. The musical score is by Marcelo Moguilevski. Not having seen the previous work of Ms. Menis we can only go by this film which shows a talent for giving her audience a subtle story told in gorgeous detail.".

	schema:headline " Nothing to say...";
	schema:reviewBody "It comes and goes with independent movies. The truth is they always seem to have something different to say something more to say but there are also times when they come with a straightforward story filled with emotion and you can't help to like them. At least that's how I see it in Argentina thinking very quickly that for example Un Oso Rojo hasn't got any big or fundamental message but tells a slice of life that gets right into your heart. La cmara oscura the film by Mara Victoria Menis is a piece of a strange nature that couldn't enter into any of the groups I mentioned above if there is such thing as those groups in the first place simply because it's the first picture I've seen in a long time that doesn't seem to know exactly what it wants to be. It tells the story of Gertrudis Mirta Bogdasarian one of the children of a Jewish family that escapes from their home country to go to Argentina. Gertrudis comes to life from her mother's belly and maybe that's the reason of her strange beauty when she's coming down of the ship that brought her to Buenos Aires. It's important that you notice the expression strange beauty because it's one of the fundamental aspects of the movie. There are two aspects that you would expect the writers to develop after witnessing Gertrudis' birth but they sort of evade them. With this I mean that they do delevop these things but they don't do it fully a fact that gives the film a simplistic look. There's an intention of representing a historical period in the country that never takes shape and there's a relationship of silence more like indifference between Gertrudis and her sisters but everything is surpassed by the 'beauty' aspect. Probably what I'm trying to present as the film's fundamental aspect is the only thing the film cares about and this turns out to be a problem. When we understand that Gertrudis is seen as ugly by all the people around her we feel obliged to feel sorry for her. This can never be possible in a movie and least possible in a piece like this one that only cares about a central character.There's something secretly sad about a woman that only knows to watch her own feet and is not able to raise his head but nothing secret about the way La cmara oscura guides us towards this conclusion. The rest is background and it's not attractive enough to carry a fulllength feature. Like that failed attempt at meditation directed by Santiago Loza Extrao Menis gives us beautiful images of beautiful fields in peaceful times. It shows us a family that lives happily by repeating a boring routine which is understandable due to the time period and the activity of the father head of the family in question and at times elevates the risk with animated sequences. What I mean with thee fact that the film doesn't know what it wants to be can be appreciated just by watching it La cmara oscura has nothing to say. If you read the first paragraph of this review you could say I'm contradicting myself because I defend movies that don't have a fundamental message but these films at least have something to say. Except for the final scene during which I found myself smiling this film has nothing to say and therefore the viewer has nothing to feel. However La cmara oscura is a very interesting film because it tells a love story we're not accustomed to watch every day and it tells it relying mostly on images and looks without the need of using a lot of words and that's always appreciated.".

La cmara oscura the film by Mara Victoria Menis is a piece of a strange nature that couldn't enter into any of the groups I mentioned above if there is such thing as those groups in the first place simply because it's the first picture I've seen in a long time that doesn't seem to know exactly what it wants to be. It tells the story of Gertrudis Mirta Bogdasarian one of the children of a Jewish family that escapes from their home country to go to Argentina. Gertrudis comes to life from her mother's belly and maybe that's the reason of her strange beauty when she's coming down of the ship that brought her to Buenos Aires. It's important that you notice the expression strange beauty because it's one of the fundamental aspects of the movie. There are two aspects that you would expect the writers to develop after witnessing Gertrudis' birth but they sort of evade them. With this I mean that they do delevop these things but they don't do it fully a fact that gives the film a simplistic look. There's an intention of representing a historical period in the country that never takes shape and there's a relationship of silence more like indifference between Gertrudis and her sisters but everything is surpassed by the 'beauty' aspect. Probably what I'm trying to present as the film's fundamental aspect is the only thing the film cares about and this turns out to be a problem. When we understand that Gertrudis is seen as ugly by all the people around her we feel obliged to feel sorry for her. This can never be possible in a movie and least possible in a piece like this one that only cares about a central character.There's something secretly sad about a woman that only knows to watch her own feet and is not able to raise his head but nothing secret about the way La cmara oscura guides us towards this conclusion. The rest is background and it's not attractive enough to carry a fulllength feature. Like that failed attempt at meditation directed by Santiago Loza Extrao Menis gives us beautiful images of beautiful fields in peaceful times. It shows us a family that lives happily by repeating a boring routine which is understandable due to the time period and the activity of the father head of the family in question and at times elevates the risk with animated sequences. What I mean with thee fact that the film doesn't know what it wants to be can be appreciated just by watching it La cmara oscura has nothing to say. If you read the first paragraph of this review you could say I'm contradicting myself because I defend movies that don't have a fundamental message but these films at least have something to say. Except for the final scene during which I found myself smiling this film has nothing to say and therefore the viewer has nothing to feel. However La cmara oscura is a very interesting film because it tells a love story we're not accustomed to watch every day and it tells it relying mostly on images and looks without the need of using a lot of words and that's always appreciated.";

This is better than Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid where she's onscreen for two minutes and even makes that film worth seeing.This is a silly comedy with a few effective gags and lots of slapstick. I think the movie is hated because 1many of the Native American characters are played in brown makeup by EuroAmerican actors and they seem to childishly enjoy getting drunk and getting into fights. 2Presley has a bed scene with Quentin Dean who won a Golden Globe the year before for In the Heat of the Night. Dean is supposed to be a Lolita type nymphet. Her age isn't mentioned but she appears to be about 16 years old at most.If you can get over these two offensive points the movie is fun in a three stooges type of way. Presley seems to be enjoying himself and his performance is pretty smooth and easy going. This was one of his last films and he seems totally comfortable playing rodeo rider Joe Lightcloud.It is always nice to see Joan Blondell. She had become a big star again in 1968 with her role on the hit television showHere Comes the Brides. Still her role is pretty pedestrian as the bootlegger mother of Quentin Dean who first tries to keep Elvis away from her but then decides to use a gun to make him marry her.Still its Katy Jurado's delightful small performance that made the film worth watching for me. We even get to see her taking a bath. That is worth two of the six stars I gave the film.".

As a fan of western movies I have seen all the Peckinpahs Hawks' and Fords and I find it interesting that Stay away Joe tells a similar story like Junior Bonner which was made several years later rodeo champion returns home wants to support his folks encounters all sorts of problems. Even in some details Junior Bonner seems to be inspired by this movie e.g. in both movies there is a big fight scene during which the hero takes his girl by the hand and crawling on all fours tries to find a quiet spot outside.

It couldn't have been because this movie's script was anything to get excited about. Joan Blondell trying to seduce Elvis and Burgess Meredith in war paint should be ashamed.The best song is Stay Away actually Green Sleeves with different lyrics. The most embarrassing song is Elvis' love song to the bull Dominic.

Magazines books CDs movies you name it. I have it all. I've been trying to reach 31 with Presley's movies. So far I have 21. Every Elvis movie that I've seen I've liked. But when I saw this movie I was really disappointed. I kept saying the whole time of this movie What the hell is going on? The movie had no story and it had no point. There's things going on in the movie and there are obstacles for Elvis to overcome but the movie just doesn't have a point. This is coming from a die hard Elvis fan too. People say that Clambake is Elvis Presley's worst movie and Elvis himself almost refused to do it but what was he thinking when he agreed to this. This movie is just about Indians on a reservation that like to drink party and roughhouse. Good actors are even dragged into it. I have no idea why Burgess Meredith starred in this or why Katy Jurado did. To top it all off I still can't understand why Elvis did this. The only good parts in this movie are when Elvis is singing running for his life and fighting. People say how he sings to a bull. I don't know where they got that from. He is singing about the bull Dominique but he's not singing to a damn bull. When you watch this movie it's not even like an Elvis movie. Elvis doesn't even get to show what a good actor he is in this. Elvis is given nothing to work with. This is the type of movie a comedian would do. This is not for Elvis Presley. Towards the end of Elvis' career I don't know what MGM was thinking. Look at their first movie with himJailhouse Rock and then look at this movie. The movie even has a dumb ending. Maybe Elvis wanted to get away from the same formula they used in his movies where he gets the girl. Elvis Presley made very good movies. See his other movies if you want to see a good Presley flick. Hey it took me 21 until I got to a a bad one. I still want to watch this movie again though. I'll admit that it is watchable. Maybe I'm missing something.".

I'm really curious if Marlon Brando watched this movie and that's what set him off about how Indians were being treated in film because this movie is so outrageous that even D.W.

In fact all of the Indians do nothing more than get drunk fall down and start fights. The stereotypes here are outrageous but the film is so poorly done that you can't even get any politically incorrect laughs at of it. I'm really not sure what in the hell was going on with the story but it was incredibly stupid and full of large plot holes. The songs were equally as bad including one scene where Elvis sings to a bull. The supporting cast are all pretty bad but Meredith comes off the worse with the most embarrassing performance and part I've ever seen him do. He was such a great character actor that it was rather sad seeing him in something like this.

There is no campy trashy fun to be had here like in some of Elvis' other bad movies like Clambake. This one is so rotten to sit through its painful. Pure Garbage.

	schema:reviewBody "Not even the normally astute management of Colonel Tom Parker who as usual got a cast of top flight players to support Elvis Presley could save a stinker like Stay Away Joe. I had heard for years at how the American Indians were upset at this film and I've finally seen why.As usual a bunch of white actors with a little olive oil makeup including the King are playing Navajo Indians. Elvis is a rodeo performer and a bull rider to be precise who has come home to the reservation bringing a herd of cattle that the government has given his parents Burgess Meredith and Katy Jurado to tend and raise. About two dozen cows and a bull which the Navajos slaughter and barbecue at a wild party to welcome Elvis home. The rest of the film deals with various escapades romantic and otherwise the King gets himself in. A running joke is Joan Blondell trying to affect a shotgun wedding between Elvis and her daughter Quentin Dean a girl whom the facts of life haven't been sufficiently explained but who has some real lively hormones.The Navajos here were portrayed as a bunch of partying drunken louts whom the white man isn't sure can deal with such responsibility as government cattle. No wonder they were all upset not to mention the fact that white actors were portraying them as such. It's the Amos and Andy syndrome working here.A young man named Ryan Dirteater who is one of the rising stars of the Professional Bull Riders came to mind when I watched Elvis riding home making a grandstanding gesture on the original bull. Bucking bull or not I think the riders of the PBR would have been hooting at this one knowing how hard it is to make that 8 seconds. I single out Dirteater because he is from Oklahoma of Cherokee Indian background.Worst of all there are no good songs for Elvis coming out of the score. Isn't that what we really see a Presley movie for?Just Stay Away Joe and you viewers stay too.".

I started with Stay Away Joe and I nearly packed it in. I'm being extremely generous rewarding the film with 3 stars. There's hardly anything to recommend it...even to hardcore Elvis fans.Elvis doesn't even attempt to act here and yet he fares better than old pro Burgess Meredith who gives a shamefully bad performance as Elvis's father. Depictions of NativeAmericans here consist of excessive drinking at all times low IQ's and laziness beyond belief. The comedy here is so over the top and badly performed that the only laughs stem from the likes of Oh god  how bad can it get?. The scriptif there ever was oneis chock full of stupid lines and one ridiculous scenario after another. And the songs apart from the opening song they're silly and forgettable.Now I've laid out why the flick is bad and probably Elvis's worst. But The King looks absolutely smashing here and has probably never looked fitter. This film came at about the time of his Comeback Special and Elvis worked real hard at getting in physical shape...and it shows. Although he doesn't act here at all his presence is welcomed and he looks like he's enjoying himself and it's somewhat infectious...not much but a bit.It's a stretch but I'm awarding another star to the beautiful scenery in the flick. During the entire ordeal the viewer at least is treated to pleasant images of beautiful country and that at least pleases the eye. The third and final star goes to the gorgeous opening song Stay Away that plays out over beautiful images. In fact the first three minutes of the film are very pleasant...too bad the rest isn't.".

They just didn't have the commitment to do what it took as evidenced by a gunslinging Joan Blondell I love her anyway and the almost unbelievable decision to let Elvis act near a comic bull to or about which he will inevitably sing with tragic results.The film they wanted to make here more or less in my opinion is The Rounders 1965 a bawdy modern western with a smallish feeling driven by lifesized characters and the fringe world they inhabit. Good idea. And there are a lot of things going for Stay Away the location shooting an excellent cast and even the meandering plot serves the film well to a point. Elvis is clearly on board this time with his unapologetically horny scheming and semicorrupt character a much needed change of pace.But they just can't get Elvis off of Gilligan's Island. Stay Away Joe is defeated by a number of things ranging from the decision to let Elvis sing diagetically i.e. in the film rather than over it a makeup job on Burgess Meredith who is completely wasted that would make Bozo blush and most especially the overly broad comedy.Broad comedy is a nice fit for this film. But in one of several fight sequences they push through a progression of painful cartoonish clichs that starts with timpani and slidewhistles and degenerates into the old favorites someone gets something over the head and goes crosseyed little guy's punches bounce off big guy etc. If that really makes you laugh I beg your pardon I guess. Joan Blondell chasing Elvis around with a gun and actually shooting at him while friends and family stand by and chuckle further erode the sense that we're in a more believable world than Hope and Crosby or Martin and Lewis inhabit. Blondell's daughter is one of the saddest clichs the exploitable sexpot with a small child's mind. It all just doesn't fit.So unless you love Elvis and Elvis films as much as I do stay away Joe".

Elvis is his son and he shows up just in time to get everything messed up. Almost every Indian is a white man in bad make up. There are several wild parties with lots of booze women and fighting. Sure makes the Indians look good. At the first party they have a BBQ with did you guess? the bull. Elvis then borrows another bull who just sleeps until someone tries to ride that is. Now this bull is a Hereford. I have never seen one of those in the bull ring. Setting up a rodeo with the never ridden bull Joe takes on all comers is the only one to ride the bull and wins a ton of money. Meanwhile Meredith's wife has sold off all the rest of the stock to fix their hovel of a shack up for the visiting mother of her daughter's fiance. This turns out soooo well!! A fight breaks out the fiance's mother faints the house ends up trashed a mother shows up with a shotgun to force Elvis to marry her daughter plus they are repoing his cars. So no cows no bull no future. Wait Elvis takes his winnings and shows up with about a hundred head to appease the congressman and keep papa out of jail. This movie is kind of uneven and not that well written in other words a typical Elvis movie. Though titled a musical there is not very much music.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie totally surprised me on every level. I had never even heard of it until recently when an observant video store clerk noticed how many thrillers I was hiring and suggested it. Having missed it at the movies I figured it would be the usual Bgrade mystery murder flick a bit of fun at best. Instead this movie had me hooked from the opening sequence I almost thought they'd put the wrong DVD in the box! The story is like one big twisted turning tunnel with barely a glimmer of a light at the end. The cast is great the setting appropriately scary with no short measure of red herrings to keep you guessing. The cast really delivers too the characters are diverse and given enough attention to keep you engaged but not so much as to slow the action down. John Cusack is in fine form as the easily likable excop trying to hold it all together Jake Busey plays the psychotic to perfection as usual. I don't usually go in for gore but there's really barely more than a few hints of blood  guts. Definitely one to watch in the dark with a group of friends to scare the hell out of yourselves. You won't regret this one.".

The ending is a real shocker  and I suspect that the typical reaction of many viewers is to say No way  but if you think about it it is the only possible ending. But you have to think about it  and the film is so actionfilled that you never have time. SO the realization must come after the closing credits roll.I'd never seen John Cusack in anything but a comedy before except for a film called Max but I saw that before I knew who Cusack was.

	schema:headline " The twist is cleverer than the genre should allow but needs you to be totally into the film to accept it  the cast and the direction are both quality in quite an exciting and enjoyable movie";
	schema:reviewBody "In the middle of a rainstorm the judge and lawyers involved in the case of murderer Malcolm Rivers due for execution the next morning are called together to discuss evidence that the defence believe had been illegally suppressed.  Meanwhile a series of accidents damaged phone lines and flooded roads means that a group of strangers are forced to hole up at a motel.  When the prisoner of a cop escapes and a murder occurs they group together to try and capture him.  However with him dead the deaths continue  each with a room key forming a morbid countdown as the remainder try to survive the night.For the majority of this film more or less the first hour the film is a standard horror thriller that is quite thrilling as the guests are picked off one by one.  However more or less on the hour comes a twist regarding the connection between the guests that is at first silly but then actually quite clever  even if it takes a bit of swallowing.  From then on it continues in the same vein with this twist changing our perception of the action onscreen.  I imagine about as many of the audience will scoff at the twist as will accept it and like it.  I liked the twist and thought it was pretty clever even if I have to acknowledge that it is pretty touch and go for a minute or so at least.  The deaths are a mix of gory and shocking without pushing it to an 18 certificate and the first hour is pretty effective in terms of tension and drama.The director opens with several clever shots that freeze frame before moving onto the next scene  this is pretty slick and helps start the film with a good sense of urgency.  His direction within the motel is hardly original but again it works well enough.  The heavy rain serves to put walls around the motel ie by not being able to see further than the perimeter and this also increases the tension and the feeling of being trapped.  Of course it's not brilliant as it is really still just a slasher thriller but it is an effective one.  The cast go a long way to helping this by having quite a few big names as well as pretty good performances.  Cusack and Liotta are both good despite the temptation to slum it in this.  They both up the tension and the urgency by their performances.  Peet is the standout from the rest but McGinley De Mornay and others all do well.  In the hearing Vince is as good as he always is when called upon to do a character with darting eyes and he is effective doing what he does as little as that is here.Other than the big name actors many people will wonder what about this film made it stand out so much that it got good critical reviews.  I think the critical twist will annoy as many people as it pleases and you do need to have been absorbed into the story by the hour mark to really appreciate it. I'm not a big fan of this genre but I enjoyed this movie and suspect that fans of this type of film will as well.".

The way they figure they can cure him of his multiple personalities is to have them all come together inside of his head and hopefully they will all be killed off with the risk that the killer will be one of the personalities killed. Let me repeat the point of that motel is to have all the personalities come together hoping that they will all die except for one that one takes control of his life. As each character dies that is one less personality he has left. In the very end they think he is OK because all of his personalities are dead except for the girl. But really that kid is still alive and he kills Amanda Peet. The exercise that they tried to do was complete all the personalities died inside of his head unfortunately the only personality that survived was the one that was the killer.

	schema:reviewBody "Because of what seem to be unusual circumstances eleven people strangers to each other outside of their respective groups two families two professional associations end up stranded in a desolate Nevada motel on a dark stormy night. One of the strangers is a death row murderer being escorted to another prison for execution. When bodies start turning up and the murderer goes missing he's the obvious suspect. But things are not what they seem. Identity provides a double mysterya traditional whodunit and an increasingly bizarre rubber reality mystery that we must figure out along with the characters.This is my second viewing of Identity. I didn't like it quite as much this time although it still earned a B. The two aspects I had a slight problem with on the second goround were one the plot didn't quite envelop me to the same extent maybe because I remembered the twist? and two since first watching it I've seen a lot more films in the rubber reality genre and Identity is nowhere near as mindbending as many other examples. Still this is a great film with a lot of assets.Director James Mangold effectively employs a number of interesting techniques here. The main standout in the first reel is the use of Tarantinolike multiple viewpoint shots where we see the same span of time from one character's point of view then another then another. He also effectively creates two very attractive atmospheres especially for fantasy fansa Twilight Zone1959like conundrum and a sustained dark ambiance. The Twilight Zone aspect makes itself most obvious beginning with the scene where the convict Robert Maine Jake Busey tries to flee but discovers that he's still at the motel after all. The constant Blade Runner 1982like rain underscores the dark ambiance which is reminiscent of films such as Fallen 1998 and Se7en 1995.While Identity isn't exactly a bastion of graphic violence there are a number of strongly visceral scenes and shots that are extremely well done and effective for seeming realistic. The atmosphere is also greatly enhanced by the hotel set which matches the Bates Motel from Psycho 1960 in dingy gloom. The film also has a wonderfully nihilistic ending.Even though I wasn't as enraptured in suspense this time one is still drawn into the film by the gradual quickening and spiraling of loss of control experienced by the characters. While slowly killing each one of them off as they're stuck in an isolated setting is a traditional 10 Little Indians horror film motif that writer Michael Cooney employs the Twilight Zone aspects allow him to trump the sense of horror and despair as the surviving characters come to realize that they are not in charge of their own lives they can't call the shots and their illusions about their realities crumble before their eyes.One of the negatives is that the rubber reality resolution is a bit too telegraphed too overt. The solution is given too early and ends up being spelled out notefornote. It's a bit like giving a lecture on a joke right after one gives the punch line. It might be difficult to blame either Cooney or Mangold with this however as American film studios and test audiences are notoriously allergic to ambiguity which is depressing because I love ambiguity in films. Still maybe the Identity is just easier to figure out when you've seen tens of rubber reality flicks. When I watched the film upon its theatrical release I overheard more than one fellow theatergoer still trying to figure out the gist as the lights came up.One might be tempted to claim that Mangold underuses his fine castwho all turn in excellent performances including one of my favorite character actors John C. McGinley. But on the other hand it makes sense that there is this large number and broad range of characters. Under this scenario you either underuse them or you've got a 3hourplus film not that I'd complain about a 3hourplus film.Of course the theme of the film as well as all of the subtexts has to do with personal identity and especially veiled personal identity. None of the characters are who they seem. Most of them are lying to each other in some way when they first meet and even some of the ones who know each other already are also lying to each other. Cooney and Mangold explore the various social facts actions ceremonies rituals and so on that help provide personal identity for us such as birthdates names residency marriages benevolent versus criminal or unethical actions and occupations. They also explore a more dynamic identity of action as relationships continually shift throughout the film.".

I should not forget to refer to the hot presence of Peer that embellished the movie apart from her casting abilities. Lastlyyou should make sure that you will be 100 concentrated on the film in order to understand what is happening cause i regard it as one of the most difficult movies to understand.It is certain that this film will dominate you with mystery and in parallel make you think a lot of things that will be predicted wrong in the end.

Hitchcock once said you should never lie to an audience you should never show something that isn't true.

To understand it better see the difference between The Usual Suspects and Seven. The first shows a story that wasn't there and in the end pulls a rabbit out of the hateasy!. The other builds up to an explosive and unexpected finale without any cheap shots it just carries you through. With Identity the movie suddenly pulls a fast one on you and leaves you wondering... But Mangold doesn't gives the twist at the very end and keeps a tense film until the last frame. It's a worth see inventive film and with a great cast to back it up.".

Even taking into account the fact that filmmakers construct films of this ilk to the whims of testaudiences and focus groups read as lowest common denominators i.e. swineherders this particular case still elicits misunderstanding even WITH the kindergarten paintbynumbers explanation in the final minutes.It seemed to be a PatrickDuffyshowerscene copout but director James Mangold and writer Michael Cooney were using sleightofhand to misdirect viewers through most of the film.I envision those looselipped testaudiences comprised of societal castes who have nothing better to do with their Tuesday afternoons believing that the movie was taking place in real time only to be chagrined when it is revealed that most of the action was occurring in a psychopath's disturbed mind. Instead of appreciating WHY this filmic device was used they immediately wished they'd spent their Tuesday afternoon downing that HaagenDaaz tub and watching McMillan  Wife explain every last Grated detail to them like they were the last retards on earth.Ten guests are floodstranded at a Motel among them Rebecca deMornay almost unrecognizable with her ample boobjob and burgundy hair playing a character whom she is assuming the mantle of with each passing botoxed day  a woman who used to be that actress Amanda Peet whose stage direction was kept simple  Back that booty up some more honey!

We are intrigued as to how these two disparate tales are related but we DO sense a connection in due course because the dry somber doctors are talking about a killer and in that wet parallel Motel story there're KILLIN'S GALORE.By the end of the second act after the film's most neckhairraising moment when all the corpses at the Motel are found to be missing it is revealed that the Motel scenes have been taking place within a psychopath's mind and that each Motel character was merely one of the multiple personalities of the psychopath.That's Twist No.1  that all this raindrenched piling in and out of rooms like the Spanish Inquisition with shocked pusses is merely a psychopath's IMAGINATION.For a few moments we are led to believe the Shyamalan trap has been sprung  but there's a trump card  through Grand Misdirection on the filmmaker's part the doctors believe they successfully purge the psychopath's mind of his killer persona but it is revealed in the last few seconds of film that the psychopath was too adroit in concealing his real killer persona in the form of the least likely hotel guest.THAT was the true twist to the movie discovering that the doctors' cure did not go deep enough discovering that the psychopath was able to disguise his persona as a benign presence in full view of both the viewers and doctors.The movie could have opted to wrap neatly with the first Twist or could have taken any number of juvenile turns blaming spirits from an Indian Burial Ground or any of the lesser characters who all sported damaging secrets but the writers led us on a merrier more interesting goose chase.Thus this deponent sayeth Bravo to the road less traveled.

	schema:headline " Two good films spliced together to make a bad one";
	schema:reviewBody "The twist a sudden unexpected development is a common plot device in the modern cinema especially in thrillers. Unfortunately for scriptwriters most of the classic twists have been so overused that they no longer come as a surprise to the audience. It no longer seems original to reveal that for example the hero's girl or best friend is really in league with the villains or that a police officer investigating a crime is in fact responsible for committing it or that a character believed to be dead is still very much alive.Of course the fact that a particular twist is so hackneyed as to have become a clich does not prevent filmmakers from continuing to rely upon it Reindeer Games and Along Came a Spider are two examples of modern thrillers likely to leave audiences with a seen it all before feeling. The challenge to the really inventive scriptwriter is now to come up with as novel or outlandish a twist as possible. Identity is a good example.The setting of the film is an isolated Nevada motel. Motels in the cinema have always seemed sinister places ever since Hitchcock's Psycho set in the neighbouring state of Arizona. A sudden and violent rainstorm brings together ten strangers the motel manager a spoilt arrogant movie star and her chauffeur who turns out to be an expoliceman another policeman and the convict he is escorting a prostitute and two married couples one of them with a young son. The mother of this boy has been injured after being struck by the film star's limousine.One by one the members of this group start to die violent deaths. One of them must be a killer the question is Which one? The film seems to be a traditional thriller along the lines of Agatha Christie's And Then There Were None challenging the audience to work out who is the murderer. We can for example rule out Caroline the film star first to die or the convict too obvious or his police escort. His violent aggressive personality also makes him a tooobvious suspect and in any case the policeman did it was a plot line famously used by Christie in another of her murder mysteries.Intercut with the scenes set in the motel however are scenes set in a courtroom. The judge prosecution and defence lawyers and a psychiatrist are discussing the case of a convicted murderer named Malcolm Rivers who has been condemned to death. The psychiatrist claims to have new evidence about Rivers' mental state which could save his life. Rivers however is not one of the group at the motel and cannot possibly be responsible for the killings there.Then comes the twist which shows what the connection is between the two seemingly unconnected plot lines. It is revealed that none of the events at the motel have ever taken place. The characters gathered there do not exist outside Rivers' mind. He suffers from multiple personality disorder and each of the characters at the motel represents one of his many separate personalities. The supposed killings represent a struggle between these personalities for dominance. His psychiatrist believes that at the end only one of his personalities will survive the personality responsible for the reallife murders committed by Rivers.This is certainly an original twist. The trouble is that as soon as the truth is revealed it renders everything that has gone before essentially meaningless. It becomes difficult for us to care about the people in the motel or to concern ourselves about which one of them is killing the others once we realise that they are no more than the fantasies of a madman's sick mind. This is a pity because the motel part of the film is actually quite well done highly atmospheric with some good acting contributions especially from John Cusack as Edward the chauffeur and Ray Liotta as the policeman escorting the convict.Identity contains within it two potentially good films one a murder mystery the other a courtroom drama about the battle to save a mentally ill killer from the death penalty on the grounds of insanity. Unfortunately these two good films have been incongruously spliced together to produce a bad one. 510".

	schema:reviewBody "a fresh feel a fresh look a fresh conceptTaal is a great movie. Great story great performances great songs and great look  feel. It should be the utopia of modern Indian cinema and it should represent what all movies should aspire to be like. This can be classed as one of the best if not the best movie ever made by Subhash Ghai.The cast is great including the supporting cast. The star of the show is Ashwaria whose portrayal of a simple village girl coming to terms with love hurt and pressures of modern life is excellent. It was probably the role that helped her to shed her Barbie doll image and her acting was very natural full of character and spot on. It was good to see the transformation from the first half where she is the small town girl to the second half where she is a reputable icon. Akshaye was great in his role as Manav a determined strong headed love bitten guy. Akshaye always gives sound performances and never lets you down as in this case. Anil Kapoor is fab in this role. His comedic side always hit the right note best part being the rules of life!!. Alok Nath  Amrish Puri gave good performances and really do support the movie. The story is simple to the point and not extra bits added in. Manav sees Mansi and is smitten by her and slowly she develops feelings for him through some fab songs like Taal and Ishq Bina and then he goes back to the big city. She follows him and is cast aside by his family. Becoming more determined she pursues a sing job becomes really good. Her career is helped by Vikrant who also has feelings for her and proposes to her.  The climax helps to bring things together. If one was to think of something bad to say about Taal then they will be thinking for a long long time.".

So I thought this movie was going to be a psychostalking movie. But then my wife explained to me that in Indian movies the standard way of developing a romantic story is to show the man stalking the woman and obsessing over her in a fashion which might in other cultures be considered criminal behavior. Armed with this new found knowledge I was able to enjoy the movie. The music of A.R. Rahman who appears to carry the burden of creating the music for every one of the 400 movies to come out of Bombay every year is catchy and the stars look good.".

With slightly above average music in the generic mould of A R Rahman.Subhash Ghai's extensive use of Coke jars throughout the movie and the hotchpotch of scenes and plotlines stolen from other Hindi movies makes for jarring viewing.Some very strange things go on in the movie starting with the casting. Aishwarya Rai while made of plastic is beautiful but rustic she is not. 'Dehati' women and my knowledge of them may be flawed seldom sport plucked eyebrows immaculately waxed legs and shaved armpits. Though of course the alternative would mean audiences would have little to whistle at so perhaps it is best to let that pass.Akshaye Khanna's acting seems to consist of making weird faces  an absolute ham if there ever was one. I'm saddened to see a person of Alok Nath's acting talent reduced to roles such as this. One can expect little else from Amrish Puri who plays his stockintrade with all the same expressions that we have come to live from other brainless flicks. 'Mogambo' all over again.The movie itself boasts of pathetic lyrics where do they get the inspiration for this tripe?. Subhash Ghai's guest appearance jars more than an ST bus on the road to Pune.The only saving grace is Anil Kapoor's acting. Akshaye Kumar would do well to take lessons from him  just the right amount of hamming for the most part although the sentimental drivel being pushed across as acting by the others seems to affect him too in the end.To summarize this movie should never have been made. Take a few scenes from Hum Aapke Hain Koun Dilwale Dulhaniya and Bombay and paste them together instead. Not that the result would be any better.Also the concept of using the Coke bottle for indirect kisses is lifted from Salman Rushdie's book 'The Moor's Last Sigh.'The problem is audiences in India have become so used to worse films that rotten pigkidneys like this movie become hits and the standards stay low all the time.".

There are certain flaws but the film is still refreshing for the music of AR Rehman brilliant sets and a beautiful cinematography. Perhaps in her earlier roles Aishwarya Rai looks beautiful and acts well. Akshaye Khanna and Anil Kapoor look quite familiar. The flaws of the film include it goes for an overlength in the second half and towards the second half the twists go for some lightness.

I created an IMDb account just to comment on the movie and warn people not to waste their time watching this crap. Taal felt like a movie written by an 8 years old girl who is going through a prepuberty hormonal ups and downswho is overly vulnerable and is riding an emotional roller coaster and believes that she will be living rest of her live with her school crush. Seriously what was going on in the writer'sdirector's mind while making the movie?".

But beside the music the movie left me shockedit was a long boring and never ending childish play with horrible actingwhile watching the movie I was wondering who buys such crap? I created an IMDb account just to comment on the movie and warn people not to waste their time watching this crap. Taal felt like a movie written by an 8 years old girl who is going through a prepuberty hormonal ups and downswho is overly vulnerable and is riding an emotional roller coaster and believes that she will be living rest of her live with her school crush. Seriously what was going on in the writer'sdirector's mind while making the movie?";

The story is very unoriginal boy and girl fall in love then he jilts her and she finds someone else but then in a strange twist of fate they meet again.

He has a way with a song and isn't clever enough to see that he is being used as a dim bulb stooge by a political machine to take him to the governor's mansion. The film offers nothing new on this age old chestnut but the presentation is what counts here.A star vehicle to be sure slanted Susan's way much more than Dean's even though he gets a moment here and there. Spotlighted in a way stars never are today Susan commands the screen. Notice that she is surrounded only by colors that flatter her the rooms she finds herself in are almost exclusively white or a soft green to highlight her flame colored tresses. Even the roadhouse where she starts the story has that high class sheen that is a hallmark of the studio era.The performances are excellent. Dean ambles through without too much to do but handles his one big scene well. Martin Balsam and Ralph Meeker are solid as Dean's trusted friend and a slimy cop respectively but it's Wilfred HydeWhite who stands out as the reptilian political operator who crosses swords with Susan. Therein lies the meat of the story and the basic enjoyment of the film. When these two old pros square off the fireworks are a treat although Susan gets a couple of other chances on her own to rip apart the unsuspecting when she discovers malfeasance. A few interesting side notes. The actress playing Susan's madam Connie Sawyer known as the oldest working actress in Hollywood is still alive and appearing in small parts at 102 as of November 2014. The other note is a bit more somber as she entered the end of her cancer struggle Susan Hayward's friends told her they had arranged for her to see any of her films that she wanted and she selected this film much to their surprise. In hindsight though it's easy to see why every effort is made to make her look her best its set in the south which had been her home for many years during her happy second marriage and her part is tailor made to many of her strengths.If you love Susan Hayward or old time studio made melodramas don't miss this!".

	schema:headline " Thumbs up on an underrated film";
	schema:reviewBody "For me this film started off with a leg up because of the two stars. I'm a huge Dean Martin fan and Susan Hayward has always been a favorite. Having said that I still think this film is underappreciated.I've heard people say that the plot's not really believable. It's about as believable as the plots of most films. And it's loosely based on some real southern history  multiple times in fact and most recently in the case of Lurleen Wallace wife to George Wallace. However  despite the modernity of Hayward's attire in the film  this film was set during the Great Depression...and in the deep South. So I think the basic plot is quite believable.As much as I enjoy Dean on film a better southern accent would have helped which he certainly achieved in Some Came Running. However he's supposed to be a bit of a bumpkin in this role and I think he plays it as needed. Susan Hayward...well she has spunk and it really showed in this film. When you went to a Susan Hayward film this is exactly the kind of portrayal you wanted to see.There are also a couple of superb supporting performances. Wilfred HydeWhite is brilliant as the dirty politician. True his British accent showed through a tad but his delight in playing the villainous role more than made up for that. An actor I usually don't really appreciate  Ralph Meeker  ably portrays the sleazy colonel in the state police and militia  a wonderful performance. Martin Balsam is also very good as the speech writercollege boy working for the governor but his role needed to be expanded just a bit. Balsam was one of those reliable character actors throughout much of the latter half of the 1900s. Frank Maxwell also has a good role as the lieutenant governor here and joins a number of recognizable character actors in support of the primary cast.I also have to mention the direction of the film. It would have been very easy to overdo it with the southern aspect of the film and shove that southern malaise down our throats as Lillian Hellman sometimes did. Director Daniel Mann resisted that temptation and also the South was always there it didn't overwhelm the story.The Warner Archives has recently 2012 released this film although it has not been restored. My biggest complaint with the DVD is a lack of crispness though not bad and variations in skin tone throughout the film...often too red. But it's still nice to have it out in reasonable quality.Yup I'm a bit prejudiced here but this has always been a particular favorite of mine. I highly recommend it soapsudsy as it may seem.".

Susan Hayward acted her best as a hardspoken woman intent on serving her new husband Bo Gilles Gubernatorial Candidate well. Three weeks before the election Candidate Bo Gilles played by Dean Martin  in his first drama picture marries Ada a former prostitute. Basically Bo was not a shrewd politician but possessed charismatic qualities and was elected in a landslide. The voters of that Southern state loved Bo and saw him as a regular guy who even played guitar and sang. Eventually Bo realizes the crookedness of the powerful man who had sponsored him Sylvester Marin and the corruption abounding in that government. Eventually Ada's past comes back to haunt her but it doesn't stop her. Colonel Yancey top State Policeman a crooked operator wellplayed by Ralph Meeker tries to bring Ada down  who at the time is Acting Governor. The entire movie is riveting and is a mustsee if you like real movies.".

No film can be truly bad with someone like Susan Hayward in it and yes I think that goes for Valley of the Dolls 1967 too so you can't really lose if you watch a Susan Hayward film. She's confident aggressive smart sassy and attractive. As for the film itself it had some gaping plot holes. For instance why did Sylvester end up in a wheelchair being pushed around by a nurse? Was something cut and never explained in the final cut?Another hole I believe that digging up the dirt that someone worked as a prostitute would be fairly easy to find. They had detectives in those days too. You would think that Ada's past would have caught up with her much earlier.Another thing as one reviewer also said in the story various characters speak of the rough economic times sort of alluding to the Great Depression yet the movie looks like a movie from the sixties. What's up with that?Even though the ending is sort of Pollyannish the film works in its Frank Capra kind of way showing that the common man can make changes in a corrupt political environment. It was interesting to watch the movie realizing that we are still in the same sad shape with many lying and evil politicians.The film is worth watching even if it is rather forgotten.".

The sly selfdeprecation in Bo Gillis's stump speech at the beginning of the picture is well done. But once he hooks up with Susan Hayward Dean Martin becomes a marshmallow.

His fame wealth and power allowed him opportunities to be sure but that is about it. The story itself is interesting from this point of view. Who doesn't like a rags to riches or an underdog becoming a top dog especially it they are a good soul. That is the case here. Susan pulls it off. However Dean further distracted me when I watched him run for office and playing guitar songs to win people over. At this point I was ready to pullout but a strange thing happened. The story appeared and it is an interesting one. Human nature does not disappoint and here we get a generous portion of greed underhandness corruption scheming and for those that like decent endings comeuppance visits and gives us closure making it satisfying for the viewer and for the actors to say they earned their pay.

And director Daniel Man's relentless use of Hayward closeups even in tracking shots doesn't help either.Nonetheless Wilfrid Hyde White has a field day. Admittedly his dialogue is the sharpest and most interesting in the picture. Maybe he brought his own writer along to the set. Maybe he wrote it himself. In a lesser role Ralph Meeker's fascinating performance as a slimy police chief also deserves watching.As said above Ruttenberg's superb cinematography is often wasted on ineffective closeups but CinemaScope does come to the fore in some of the location setups in what certainly look like real government buildings and legislative chambers. These scenes plus the cab trip and our first exposure to the executive office give the film much needed dramatic effectiveness plus an engrossing yet taut political atmosphere.

	schema:headline " Political drama featuring Susan Hayward in the title role Dean Martin becomes Governor";
	schema:reviewBody "This above average political campaign drama by Daniel Mann features Susan Hayward whom he'd earlier directed in the Lillian Roth biography I'll Cry Tomorrow 1955 in the title role. The film also stars Dean Martin Wilfrid HydeWhite in a very nonColonel Pickering role four years before My Fair Lady 1964 Martin Balsam and Ralph Meeker among others.Martin plays a political novice whose only qualifications are his looks and easy going nature which makes him good with people that's elected Governor of a Southern state with the assistance of power broker HydeWhite who pulls all the strings until Hayward as Martin's newlywed trollop wife intervenes. Balsam plays Martin's speechwriter who shares the same humble beginnings and Meeker plays a lecherous cop who does HydeWhite's dirty work.The first 30 minutes or so introduces us to the characters Bo Gillis Martin is a guitar playing twice elected Sheriff of a small town in an unnamed Southern state probably Mississippi or Louisiana who's running for Governor. We learn later that he was plucked out of a bar by Sylvester Marin HydeWhite an insider who controls the state legislature to be the Reform party candidate running against the incumbents. Tabs are kept on Bo by Steve Jackson Balsam the now grownup smart kid from his neighborhood who now acts as his speechwriter.After one rally Alice Sweet Connie Sawyer provides a call girl for Bo's entertainment who accepts against Steve's protestations. Actually it's not made too clear whether Bo realizes that Ada Hayward had been bought and paid for him or not Martin plays it as if he lured her with his own charm. In any case on the lonely campaign trail Ada is a breath of free air and after three weeks three weeks before the election as well they elope.By now Bo knows of her humble beginnings as the daughter of a sharecropper and her struggles to get out of Alabama by being a friend to men for money. But he doesn't care and he genuinely seems to love her. It appears that she loves him too that she's not just a gold digger looking for a leg up. However that fact is called into question at least by Bo as events unfold. We meet Sylvester who successfully hides Ada's background from the press while exposing the opposition candidate's wife as a drug addict thanks to police Colonel Yancey Meeker. Of course Bo is elected.The rest of the film is about Bo as Governor and the power struggles that ensue when Ada tells him that it is HE and not Sylvester Marin who was elected. It seems that being Governor isn't all that it's cracked up to be to Bo. Everyone bypasses his office on the way to Sylvester's who asks Bo to sign his name to dozens of pieces of paper each day none of which Bo reads.It isn't until Ronnie Hallerton Frank Maxwell also from Bo's hometown and now Lieutenant Governor thanks to Sylvester brings a park bill to Bo's attention that he thinks there is anything wrong. Bo learns that thanks to his own signature the State is going to pay large sums of money to Sylvester's friends who invested in Bo's campaign to build parks the need for which is nebulous. The State of course will have to raise taxes to buy the land.Meanwhile Ada has been propositioned by Yancey who is now head of security for the Governor and gotten Steve to get her invited to an old money tea party. In a scene that may have been done better Hayward plays Ada as a woman who realizes the power of her newly elected husband and demonstrates a desire to wield it as her own. She effectively takes names of the stuffy women obsessed with their own blue blood backgrounds and later gets an opportunity to deliver their comeuppance.When Sylvester learns that it was Ronnie who woke up Bo as to what he'd been signing he forces Hallerton to resign. Bo tells Ada about the whole goings on and she manipulates Sylvester into having her sworn in as Lieutenant Governor. Bo is not sure whether Ada is his partner or Sylvester's but suspects the worse. His suspicions are confirmed at least to him when he is injured by a car bomb allowing Ada to be sworn in as acting Governor while he recovers.When Sylvester learns that Ada is not his ally but is Bo's instead he uses Yancey who uses Alice to get what he needs to discredit Ada. Fortunately there are some honest men played by Larry Gates  Bill Zuckert maybe Charles Watts in the legislature who are willing to help Ada and stand up to Sylvester his Speaker Ford Rainey and another bought Senator Robert Simon. The final showdown scenes in the Capitol Building are surprisingly good and well choreographed.A few recognizable character actors appear uncredited Emory Parnell plays the security guard at the Governor's office when Bo and Ada first see it Mary Treen plays a woman that offers Ada pie at a rally before the election Bill Walker plays the servant at the Governor's mansion.".

However once I started I was quite anxious to find out how it ended.The plot for the movie was interesting. A tramp marries the man running for governor three weeks prior to the election day and they proceed to cleanup corruption in politics when he is elected. The first thing I thought was how hypocritical. He was elected by crooks and then decided he didn't like them. That of course made me think of Wilson President Wilson. He did the same thing. So I dismissed that notion. If Wilson can do it it's not too bad.Next as the film went on I began to wonder why they ever got married. Susan Haywardredhead and Dean Martinlounge singer didn't seem to be an ideal couple in my mind. I must say they didn't look too odd next to each other. Their marriage was not a healthy one to say the least. They did work well in their roles. I enjoyed Susan's ruthless determination and Dean's clueless and laid back attitude. I think an already established acting couple or a couple that looks like they could have a relationship off stage would have been better. I felt like they weren't right together. Nonetheless they did a good job.The final thing was the ending. It really bothered me. There was something missing. Like dialogue or a kiss or some form of interaction besides looking at each other. The scene was wonderful. I loved the whole Congress session. But it was like the writer gave up on ending the relationship between the main characters. HeShe I don't remember who wrote it thought we didn't care what they did as long as they were together. That may be but I need more than a hand shake to show that they are happy together.This is really a good film. I love Hayward. Her characters are so passionate and devoted. That really worked well. The angry scenes were stifled because Dean's not a yeller. In this role it appears he lacks the drive to get angry. In all Susan steals the show and lays every thing on the line to win our hearts and Dean's.".

Susan Haywardredhead and Dean Martinlounge singer didn't seem to be an ideal couple in my mind. I must say they didn't look too odd next to each other. Their marriage was not a healthy one to say the least. They did work well in their roles. I enjoyed Susan's ruthless determination and Dean's clueless and laid back attitude. I think an already established acting couple or a couple that looks like they could have a relationship off stage would have been better. I felt like they weren't right together. Nonetheless they did a good job.The final thing was the ending. It really bothered me. There was something missing. Like dialogue or a kiss or some form of interaction besides looking at each other. The scene was wonderful. I loved the whole Congress session. But it was like the writer gave up on ending the relationship between the main characters. HeShe I don't remember who wrote it thought we didn't care what they did as long as they were together. That may be but I need more than a hand shake to show that they are happy together.This is really a good film. I love Hayward. Her characters are so passionate and devoted. That really worked well. The angry scenes were stifled because Dean's not a yeller. In this role it appears he lacks the drive to get angry. In all Susan steals the show and lays every thing on the line to win our hearts and Dean's.";

	schema:reviewBody "I must tell you up front that Susan Hayward is among my least favorite actresses. Part of it is that sometimes she tended to overact such as in I Want to Live where she mugged shamelessly. Part of it is that in the 1960s she made a lot of trashy soap opera like films which were anything but subtlesuch as The Valley of the Dolls. I mention all this now because I did have a certain predisposition towards her and Ada when I began watching. Now this is NOT to say I can't enjoy the film or even her performance. Heck I saw another one of her films Summer Flight last night and enjoyed it immensely. Plus surprise surprise this film was VERY soapy VERY loud and still VERY enjoyable!When the film begins Bo Gillis Dean Martin is running for governor. Along the way he meets Ada Susan Hayward and pretty soon the pair are hitting the sheets! Ada is evidently NOT a nice girl and Bo is well just doing to her what most politicians want to do to the voters! However surprisingly Bo's interest is apparently NOT just sex and he soon whisks her away and they are married. Bo's handlers aren't happy howeverwho is this woman and what is her past and most importantly what will be her impact on their candidate?! In essence they treat her a bit like something the cat just drug in the house! What the film doesn't make clear until much later is that Ada is a prostitute...not just a woman of easy virtue.Soon Bo is elected governor. Things look great. However over time Bo comes to realize that he is rather powerless and his adviser Sylvester Wilfred HydeWhite is trying to pull all the strings. As for Ada despite her white trash background she actually turns out to be VERY adept in dealing with people and playing the role of the First Lady of the State. She and the new Lieutenant Governor are both worried...as Sylvester appears to be a real snake! So what's next for Snakeboy and the Gillis family? And what about the OTHER snakes...and there are definitely more! Watch the film and see...In the case of Ada Susan Hayward was well chosen. While the toughasnails broad with more manliness in her than a football team persona won't work in all films here it's absolutely perfect! Seeing her heading into the governor's office to clean house is very exciting to watchas is her eventual runin with Sylvester. He's a snake...but she turns out to be a real mongoose! In effect it's sort of like Mr. Smith Goes to Washington and a soap opera merged into one! Sensationalistic a bit sleazy and a lot of fun to watch on a real lowbrow level. And most importantly it's NEVER dull!! Who cares if it lacks realism...it really doesn't matter!".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is the message on political lob corruption as done in 1961 Wardrobe with a 1930's setting. While it is not perfect Wirt Williams only novel brought to the screen a story of a woman being appointed Governor of a state in the 1930's. She does not even have to run for office much like Gerald Ford's appointment to Vice President in 1974. Of course this setting is not anywhere near as exciting as the first elected woman to the office Nellie Davis Tayloe Ross November 29 1876  December 19 1977 was an American politician the 14th Governor of Wyoming from 1925 to 1927.Still it combines the light humor of Dean Martin as Bo Gillis who runs and is elected to the office with the help of his friend Sylvester Marin Wilfred Hyde Whitewho has so many people in his pocket that Bo can not even throw his election off by eloping with Ada a Hooker who just gave him the 3 best weeks of their lives I guess 3 weeks with Hayward would be pretty good back in the day. Martin Balsam heads up a supporting cast with more UNcredited than credited cast members. After the election Bo begins to realize that Marin got him elected simply to sign bills and make Marin and friends rich at the expense of the taxpayers this sounds to close to home since the 1980's nationally. Martin's Bo a simple man who plays guitar and gets elected suddenly realizes he has been took because of his friend and Ada who is the main star here. It is Ada who has to do the heavy lifting after Marin try's to kill Bo with a car bomb.Ada is not your average hooker. She gets quite a ways in proposing stopping Marin though it does take Bo to get her over the top. Overall this is a good film from MGM which fell a bit short of being a great film. Daniel Mann who directed Our Man Flint for James Coburn is behind the camera for this one. Arthur Sheekman who worked on the script for Martin's Some Come Running is on this script too which explains Martin's character fitting him like the proverbial glove. Recently caught this one on TCM.".

It hasn't even made it to dvd yet and I know of terribly worse comedies that have and most are from the present Saturday Night Live Crew. The film does fulfill the area of not only certain high school hijenks but also a human feeling for the kids of that specific time.  It pushed through the ideas of free alcohol drugs but not so much sex.  There was the element of sex in words and conversation but no real nudity or fulfillment. Overall an excellent film that would have done better a few years later when teen flix came back with a vengeance.  Senior Trip carries with it the National Lampoon feel of Animal House but doesn't veer off into a demented spoof like Not Another Teen Movie.  It filled the void where drama and action films had worn away movie goers in the mid 90s.  Watch for Tommy Chong as the bus driver and the chemistry whether electrified or jaded between the characters.".

Quite frankly Chong isn't enough of a reason since he can be seen in better form in a dozen other choices and de Boer is a minor player at best. You are better off watching the last few seasons of Deep Space Nine to be mesmerized by Nicole. So that leaves us with Tara. Yes Tara is enough of a reason to watch this movie... once. Only because it is the only movie in existence that she is in as a physical entity. If you don't know Tara is the voice behind 100s of cartoon characters you probably watch with your kids. The movie has a few funny moments but they are rare and limited. Tara on the other hand is absolutely gorgeous.".

I still don't understand how people can make movies stink so bad. They could have had more scenes with the principal and the typing teacher but that would have involved lesser known actors so that they would have taken their clothes off. Or they could have had the students actually catch the bad congressman having sex with one of the students. I can not reiterate how awful this movie is. I sat there waiting for something funny to happen and even waited for ending hoping something would salvage this painstaking road I had wondered down.

Most of the time any studio that releases the movie that gets two thumbs up will rush to print the accolade on the box of the movie when it is released to video. But if it DOESN'T get two thumbs up there's no need to worry because there is bound to be somebody who has something good to say about a movie.I mention this because when I rented this movie a long time ago not one review graced the cover of this train wreck.  Not one.  I would soon discover why.when I watched this movie I was 15 years old so you figure I was part of this movie's target audience.  But I can tell you as a 15year old kid I didn't laugh at all.  The movie was totally utterly unfunny.The story follows a bunch of high school seniors who embark on a trip to Washington D.C.  A grabbag of mindless high school stereotypes handsome rebellious guy antisocial guy disgusting fat moron smart goodytwo shoes computer nerd promiscuous outcast get thrown into detention and are assigned to write an essay which will be sent to Washington explaining the faults in the modern American education system.  The smart goody two shoes Miss Tracy Milford Valerie Mahaffey is the only one who actually writes a paper and wouldn't you know the President reads it and loves it.  Enter the senior trip.I hoped that at least things would get funny here as road trip movies usually involve unusual situationscharacters.  It's cliche but who cares if it's done well right?  Well it's not done well here.  Kevin McDonald the only person in this movie I recognized from other projects aside from Tommy Chong in an amazingly humordevoid role as the bus driver who is a raging drug addict plays a weird Star Trekobsessed crossing guard who has a personal vendetta against one of the seniors and chases the group to D.C. Don't ask.After a series of stupid and endless scenes we finally end up in D.C. where the President finds out that the group of kids aren't the scholars he thought that they were.  This leads to a mercilessly banal sappy speech from the seniors about how it's too late for them but not for tomorrow's children or something smiliar.  I can believe that one could be convinced that public education is in bad shape by parading these kids around but I can't believe that the response solicited from such a display would be the ever popular 'slow clap' started by the President himself.  After that the movie somehow ends but not soon enough.I identified with none of the characters portrayed in the movie.  Even Tracy Milford who at one point looked like she was above the rest of the crew totally betrayed me when it was revealed that she had feelings for Mark Dags D'Agastino Jeremy Remner the star of the movie a punk that no girl of intelligence or ambition could ever find attractive.  While most teen comedies have outlandish characters there is always at least a grain of truth to them.  I was spoonfed a series of what looked like an outoftouch writer's uneducated guess of what they thought high school kids were.  So awful was this movie that some seven years after viewing it I can still recall it well enough to review it.  Most bad movies I hope to never see again. This is the kind of bad movie I hope to repress.National Lampoon's Senior Trip  Zero stars out of four".

They're not funny they're interesting to watch. Jeremy Renner is the ringleader an underachiever who has accepted his limitations and blindly corrupts logic to break the rules. He should have been a break out star but the direction doesn't explore his comedic chops and he is forced to mug grimace and cow tow to the rest of the cast. The true funny presence to watch is characteractor Kevin MacDonald as the psycho Trekkie with a chip on his shoulder who wants to takeout Renner's character for years of psychological abuse he's the one to watch here as he goes through abuse after abuse and realizes the things he learned from Star Trek don't help him in the real world. Matt Frewer is wasted as an exasperated harried and frustrated principal stuck in one mode as the kids push him over the end he's pretty much the kids patsy and victim from one end of the movie to the other. Eric Edwards plays a forced Belushi clone an sleepy yet vicedriven imbecile without morals but without any of the charm humor or presence of John or Jim Belushi. To see him now you'd never expect he was the same actor! Tommy Chong is stuck in the same onejoke clich role he plays in every movie a conspiracytalking pothead who is his own worst enemy. It's a shame he's written off so early investigating his life would have been more interesting. My favorite character is Carla Morgan played by Tara Charendoff she oozes sex and kittenishly moves through the movie possessed by Marilyn Monroe showing off the full range of her acting ability. The plot is weak it runs like a documentary of high school rejects attached to a loose sequence of comedic criminal events and unfunny disasters filled with a huge cast of unknowns. Only Charendoff and Nicole DeBoer would go on to any greater success. It lacks the spirit of Animal House the humor of John Landis or the commentary of Harold Ramis and yet you wonder what sort of damage these kids could do somewhere else and there there is the one saving point of this film that you wonder what happens to them next.".

I liked this film...the stuffy kid in the suit reminds me of what I possibly could ahve been like had I gone along with stuffy stupid republicans at a similar event. I was involved in the close up foundation and am so glad I lost. This film spoofs those functions. Naturally this film was not about me or my situation in life i am different than this character and excell at dressing like a slob and looking like one. this is a film anyone tied in with student political groups in school could love. The film satires the political ssytem and student young party groups that are so green they have no concept of what the ssytemis actually like. Foolish kids breast fed on half truths in cirriculum books and the 90's senastionalism news. A great satire on the gen x generation as well. Not as clever as ANIMAL HOUSE but clever enough..yet i am not a film maker and never will be one...who am I to judge. A fun night of viewing one of the few comedies I laughed at in the 1990's.".

I liked this film...the stuffy kid in the suit reminds me of what I possibly could ahve been like had I gone along with stuffy stupid republicans at a similar event. I was involved in the close up foundation and am so glad I lost. This film spoofs those functions. Naturally this film was not about me or my situation in life i am different than this character and excell at dressing like a slob and looking like one. this is a film anyone tied in with student political groups in school could love.

	schema:reviewBody "I really don't care about what others think but for me this movie is the best teen comedy ever. Maybe it's just because I've not seen a lot of teen comedies.It was year 1996 in Russia when I bought this movie on VHS in little shop near my house. At this time I was a little stupid kid. I think I was 10 or 11 years old. This movie made a big impression on me. You know it's kinda hard to explain my feelings in English cause it's not my native language but I'll try.Since I was a kid I wanted to become a cool mature guy. I thought that being mature is like having parties all the time drinking alcohol and so on. Senior trip had it all in it. It was really funny it had all this cool music that I tried to like. At this time I got my first Nirvana CD. I liked to be the one I was. I liked being bad talking in bad language joking about sex. Yes I was a bad kid. A really bad one. After years of life such as this I get to hospital I was really depressed but it has nothing to do with the movie.It was very cool to listen to grunge music in 1996 though it was not so popular in the US. And the movie felt like a grunge movie for me. Yeah I know it's a very stupid movie it has a lot of crap in it but I still like it cause it was like a Bible at my teenage. It showed me another alternative life not the stupid life I was living. My best friend liked this movie too. He is the only one whom I showed it to this day. For me it's very personal movie though it's neither about my life nor about my country. I think it's very hard to understand why I think it's great. Cause it's just my feeling which I can't explain in Russian too.After this movie I saw some teen comedies like American pie Road trip Not another teen movie Scary movie but all of them are a much more badder than Senior trip. Yes I laughed when I watched first parts of American pie and Scary movie but I've never wanted to rewatch them again.I don't think that this movie will be a hit if it gets republished today. The world has changed the teenagers have changed. This movie is a history now. Nothing else. But in my heart it is a classic.".

After the amazingly funny team of D'Agastino and Reggie's plans for a senior class party at the prinicpal's house lands them and some of their buddies in detention I don't know why the selected few were the only ones to get busted.

The President is in for a big surprise and that's exactly what Senator Lerner wants.

Besides Dag's the arsonist and Reggie his spaced out friend there's Virus the horny AudioVisual geek Wanda Reggie's equally spaced out girlfriend Lisa the brain Herbert the guy who is in perpetual mourning Meg the lesbian Steve the preppie jerk who gets his just deserts Miosky and Carla the nymphomaniac. These kids do everything from locking their principal in a flooding convenient store bathroom to steal beer to drugging their principal and chaperone a timid math teacher to throwing a rad party in a crude man's huge hotel room. It is one of the better teen comedies you'll find in the late 90s and one of the last few National Lampoon movies. I recommend checking it out.".

	schema:headline " Wild Field Trip";
	schema:reviewBody "This film is one of my honorable mentions of school comedies it's also another comedy that passed under the radar like a student passed by a bus. I really got into this movie in the latter part of my adolescence and was looking into crudeteen comedies which were starting to become more frequent in the mid to late 90's. This film you could say is pretty much Animal House but in High School I think that's makes sense going this direction just as Animal House parodiedsatire a little on students and their subculture in Collage this does it for teen and their subculture in High School.This isn't I would say a great comedy by any means it's not trying to be this is one of those comedies where you just simply turn your brain off and have fun and that part of the purpose of most comedies anyway to just have fun.I really like the characters both teachers and students their colorful characters and each of them have some memorable moments. Let alone I actually really like the high school they're in despite the wild and crude company it's strangely a school that actually functions and is clean or clean as can be there's no bullies or violence anywhere or none I can detect except for one preppy jerk but he's easy to deal with. Other than that I would of liked to gone to this school.Dags is my favorite character whom is surprisingly by Jeremy Renner. This was his film debut and it's one heck of a debut this movie seems like the least likely film this famous actor would ever dodid but then again same can be said about a lot of other actors out there. Also at the time he sort of looks like actor Brendan Fraser if you can believe that. Jeremy is just great at playing a total rebel slacker what I like about him is he's not afraid to put it out there or do what he feels like or feels must be done. He's also slightly determined in getting what he want as there is his pursuit in winning over the character Lisa whom is pretty she's a person that is on the studious side and just doesn't know when to loosen up and she does once she spends more time with Dags. Dags has some good lines he says my favorite line in the film Let's do some Van Damage! I just think that's an awesome quote I like the say that sometimes if I feel like being aggressive and on a side note Van Damme is one of my favorite action stars which make it more fun.Principal Todd Moss by Matt Fewer is funny he's basically the school authority archetype whom is just extremely uptight from his voice and wardrobe. He's trying so very hard or very little in trying to keep everything at the school going right. It's just funny how much grief he is being dealt from Dags and the fellow students which makes him lose a little of his cool. Tommy Chong as Red is funny despite only in the film for a small amount of time as he's pretty much playing the same character he's played in his Cheech and Chong films and as usual does it well. It's funny that this guy has became a bus driver despite the fact he really shouldn't be driving though fitting for the company he's escorting. It's also funny how much grief he gives the principal showing how much disrespect he has for authority figures and is clearly on the kids' side from not opening the doors unless he says the magic word it cracks me up when we find out what that word is. On a side note you also see famous voice actress Tara Strong whom looked pretty good and has a little memorable moment in the film. As well as Nicole de Boer whom is a sci fi TV show alumni from Star Trek Deep Space Nine and The Dead Zone she has a really small role in this as well and say's another favorite quote with some girl in the psa movie scene Poor Suzy.Other than that the film is just plain stupid fun full of stupid fun antics. There are lots of them from an assembly scene when there is some hippie Christian rock group called High on Life they seriously should have rethought that band title whom is singing let's just say a song not on my favorites list. Dags and his friend Reggie of course put on a cool heavy metal song and the assembly turns into a rave I remember thinking yeah now this is an assembly. A scene where al the students are watching one of those bad black and white psa movies. This scene sort of predates Rifftrax as we see the students mocking the film as it goes on. That scene always cracks me up because it's true a lot of those psa films in the schools weren't always on par in quality or some of them can be strange despite the good message they try too hard to send. Let alone the fact that the main guy and girl character always had a name that rhymes or ends with the letter y like Jimmy Billy Suzy etc. Either there weren't that many names at the time or the writer was too lazy to think up any other names.There is another little scene which was sweet and funny when Dag's friend Reggie and this shy girl whom throughout the film always had her eyes covered. Both are watching Jason Goes to Hell and she says something of Jason and Freddy fandom which is funny but is really on the nose as that comment was prolific to the film Freddy versus Jason.There is also this rather strange subplot involving a psycho crossing guard played by Kevin McDonald from Kids in the Hall whom let's just say his Starship isn't operating on warp speed. It's just funny as we see him relentlessly pursuing Reggie for a crack comment he's made man that guy really can't take a joke and at the same time taking his fandom for the show Star Trek too far. There are several jokes and references on the show going on in this subplot the writer obvious was a big fan of Trek. Senior Trip is worth a trip.Rating 3 stars".

Dags has some good lines he says my favorite line in the film Let's do some Van Damage! I just think that's an awesome quote I like the say that sometimes if I feel like being aggressive and on a side note Van Damme is one of my favorite action stars which make it more fun.Principal Todd Moss by Matt Fewer is funny he's basically the school authority archetype whom is just extremely uptight from his voice and wardrobe. He's trying so very hard or very little in trying to keep everything at the school going right. It's just funny how much grief he is being dealt from Dags and the fellow students which makes him lose a little of his cool. Tommy Chong as Red is funny despite only in the film for a small amount of time as he's pretty much playing the same character he's played in his Cheech and Chong films and as usual does it well. It's funny that this guy has became a bus driver despite the fact he really shouldn't be driving though fitting for the company he's escorting. It's also funny how much grief he gives the principal showing how much disrespect he has for authority figures and is clearly on the kids' side from not opening the doors unless he says the magic word it cracks me up when we find out what that word is. On a side note you also see famous voice actress Tara Strong whom looked pretty good and has a little memorable moment in the film. As well as Nicole de Boer whom is a sci fi TV show alumni from Star Trek Deep Space Nine and The Dead Zone she has a really small role in this as well and say's another favorite quote with some girl in the psa movie scene Poor Suzy.Other than that the film is just plain stupid fun full of stupid fun antics. There are lots of them from an assembly scene when there is some hippie Christian rock group called High on Life they seriously should have rethought that band title whom is singing let's just say a song not on my favorites list. Dags and his friend Reggie of course put on a cool heavy metal song and the assembly turns into a rave I remember thinking yeah now this is an assembly. A scene where al the students are watching one of those bad black and white psa movies. This scene sort of predates Rifftrax as we see the students mocking the film as it goes on. That scene always cracks me up because it's true a lot of those psa films in the schools weren't always on par in quality or some of them can be strange despite the good message they try too hard to send. Let alone the fact that the main guy and girl character always had a name that rhymes or ends with the letter y like Jimmy Billy Suzy etc. Either there weren't that many names at the time or the writer was too lazy to think up any other names.There is another little scene which was sweet and funny when Dag's friend Reggie and this shy girl whom throughout the film always had her eyes covered. Both are watching Jason Goes to Hell and she says something of Jason and Freddy fandom which is funny but is really on the nose as that comment was prolific to the film Freddy versus Jason.There is also this rather strange subplot involving a psycho crossing guard played by Kevin McDonald from Kids in the Hall whom let's just say his Starship isn't operating on warp speed. It's just funny as we see him relentlessly pursuing Reggie for a crack comment he's made man that guy really can't take a joke and at the same time taking his fandom for the show Star Trek too far. There are several jokes and references on the show going on in this subplot the writer obvious was a big fan of Trek. Senior Trip is worth a trip.Rating 3 stars";

The film additionally features two hilarious fake movies one a 1950s style film about contraception the other a pornographic version of 'Forrest Gump'! Oddly enough the film does not really offer any real ideas regarding the future of education given that the students are traveling to Washington to discuss such matters but this is a bubbly comedy first and foremost and an enjoyable one at that with Frewer even nicely learning how to bond with his students along the way.".

	schema:reviewBody "National Lampoon's Senior Trip 1995 Dir Kelly Makin  Cast Matt Frewer Tommy Chong Kevin McDonald Valerie Mahaffey Jeremy Renner Academic trash comedy of vulgar jokes similar to National Lampoon's Animal House but lacking the spirit and broad character types of that film. It stars Matt Frewer as a school principal who punishes his students after a prank gone wrong. He makes his students write a letter to Washington explaining why the school system must change. This earns them a trip to Washington where they steal everything that isn't bolted down. Contrived formula with an ending that makes every lame excuse for the behavior witnessed by the viewer. Directed by Kelly Makin who is backed with some effective visual elements including an outraged Star Trek fanatic. Frewer does what he can as the stiff principal but the role is a prop not a personality. Tommy Chong plays a bus driver who overdoses on pills. Also with Kevin McDonald and Valerie Mahaffey among others and everyone of them deserve an F on this cinematic report card. These teenagers are hardly sympathetic and the screenplay never develops any one character beyond surface appeal unlike the broad personalities to the characters in Animal House. The message is bypassed in favor of crude sexual humour and a lot of bathroom jokes. It is for no one with an I.Q. Score 2  10".

	schema:reviewBody "Where did this movie go wrong? Where do I start?1. In being made by National Lampoon it appeared to try way too hard to be Animal House. There was a stupid fat guy an uptight head of the school a straight laced honor student and the rest of the student got drunk andor stoned. There was one militant black guy that would have made an interesting character but his character was pushed to the back too often. Above all you didn't feel any sort of sympathy for the main characters which is why the movie didn't play out very well.2. The principal was unnecessarily stupid. When the evil senator threatened to have the principal revoked from his job I didn't blame him. The principal character should have been the moral center of the story the only sane person in an insane situation. That kind of situation makes for uproarious laughter and it's something the writers not to mention the actor who played him should have taken into account.3. The title of the movie didn't fit. Yes the students were seniors and yes they were going on a trip making the title Senior Trip sound obvious enough. However the title made you think that every senior was going on this trip which was not true. Plus the students didn't embark on the trip until halfway through the movie since the premise took too long to extrapolate before the movie's main premise got underway. In my opinion the beginning scene with the High On Life band was completely unnecessary not to mention not funny. I'm not a stoner and I would have booed that band.4. The movie employed too many movie clichs which weighed down the potential hilarity of the movie from the uptight teacher getting her hands on alcohol to the undeserved slow clapping to the unnecessary epilogue at the end of the movie. One could argue that it was parodying other movies but this movie didn't appear to parody anything.5. Kevin McDonald. Simply putting him in any movie is a bad idea. Sure he was funny when he was with the Kids In The Hall but nearly every movie he has been in has sucked from The Godson to The Ladies Man to this movie. Plus his character wasn't necessary to the movie and you had no clue why he was chasing these kids to D.C. other than the fact that he had nothing better to do. If there is a plus side to his character it reminds you that hardcore Trekkies are too damn annoying to function properly in today's society.I did buy this movie for 8.00 in a special Double Feature edition with National Lampoon's Loaded Weapon 1 on the other side of the disc. At least four of my dollars didn't go to waste.".

Martha Hyer is along and provides some classy maturesexy glamor. Bikini even has a cameo by a very young Stevie Wonder. While Frankie Avalon won't win any acting awards his alterego Potato Bug is certainly a less annoying character than Mike Meyers' execrable Austin Powers. Even Don Rickles is along playing a character named Big Drag a gentle pun on Don Big Daddy Garlits a wellknown drag racer and auto customizer of the era. Too bad Rickles doesn't get to cut lose with his usual wise guy humor. Guess AIP was too cheap to spring for that.While no work of art Bikini Beach is more than just watchable. It's actually at times enjoyable. I give Bikini Beach a weak 6.".

Martha Hyer is along and provides some classy maturesexy glamor. Bikini even has a cameo by a very young Stevie Wonder. While Frankie Avalon won't win any acting awards his alterego Potato Bug is certainly a less annoying character than Mike Meyers' execrable Austin Powers. Even Don Rickles is along playing a character named Big Drag a gentle pun on Don Big Daddy Garlits a wellknown drag racer and auto customizer of the era. Too bad Rickles doesn't get to cut lose with his usual wise guy humor. Guess AIP was too cheap to spring for that.While no work of art Bikini Beach is more than just watchable. It's actually at times enjoyable. I give Bikini Beach a weak 6.";

In short order the Beach Party gang goes gaga over popular English superstar Frankie Avalon in a dual role as The Potato Bug arriving to fill out a romantic triangle for Mr. Avalon and Ms. Funicello. Newspaperman Keenan Wynn as Harvey Huntington Honeywagon III is also on hand accompanied by his ape Clyde Janos Prohaska Mr. Wynn sets out to prove the sexually preoccupied teenagers are akin to monkeys. Adult beauty Martha Hyer as Vivian Clements thinks Avalon and company are just having a good time. Don Rickles as Big Drag and Harvey Lembeck as Eric Von Zipper help add drag racing and motorcycle fun.Returning more to the initial entry's Beach Party formula makes Bikini Beach an improvement over the series' recent dip into Muscle Beach Party. The script is relatively snappy and amusing. Clyde and Frieda have a great scene together for example when Clyde plays with Rickles' bird in the dragster's beer joint strictly for kids Rickles explains as he serves only beer and soda. Avalon's dual role is nicely played and it is a timely welcome nod to the midsixties musical British invasion. Funicello with a decent amount of navel displayed is always charming however the added hair was unnecessary. The regular teenagers are attractive and Ms. Hyer performs exceptionally well.Director William Asher uses bewitching wife Elizabeth Montgomery well she reads the beginning of a newspaper article and voices the French Lady Bug. Despite the presence of Stevie Wonder the Pyramids and the Exciters performing songs by the usual writers the soundtrack is derivative and unmemorable. Look for Gary Usher Roger Christian and Mike Nader among the Beach Boys. Mr. Nader once told me he was in these movies and now I see him.

	schema:reviewBody "O.K. O.K. I must take some exception with the two prior reviews in this thread.  Bikini Beach has a lot more going for it those pieces implied.First Frankie Avalon finally earned his AIP pay in this picture.  While I really don't care for his 60s greaser college kid character in most of the other beach Party movies here his dual roles as Frankie the surfer who takes Dee Dee Annette for granted and as English invasion artist the Potato Bug are enjoyable to watch.  He shows his reach as an actor far beyond what one would expect in a B movie like this.Secondly for anyone interested in the history of drag racing the strip scenes are interesting textbook mid 60s drag environment.  Few if any other examples of that are available in American film.Third the music.  Much better than what was in the movie that preceded it Muscle Beach Party was one of the weakest of the series in terms of music and many that followed.  In Bikini Beach you get to hear Annette sing a duet of a StynerHemrick ballad Because You're You with Avalon that is good if you have a copy of her Bikini Beach LP her solo version of this song on it is arguably one of the most hauntingly beautiful recordings she ever made.  The house club band at Big Daddy's in this film is the Pyramids arguably one of the better nowforgotten west coast groups that played the role of the house band in these movies.  Their instrumental version of Fingertips is classic early 60's surf instrumental.  And a very young Stevie Wonder actually appears at the end.Fourth the infamous Candy Johnson the fringewearing wild blond gogo dancer character who with the swish of her hips could put a man in a daze and send him flying through the air finally comes of age in this movie the club fight scenes actually feature her.  As do the closing credits where she fractures the camera lens at the end.Does all this make Bikini Beach a work of art?  Heavens. no but it's a heck of a lot better than Muscle Beach Party Pajama Party How to Stuff a Wild Bikini and the Ghost in the Invisible Bikini.  In other words out of the seven AIP Beach Party Movies this is definitely in the top two or three only bettered by Beach Blanket Bingo and arguably Beach Party.".

I also didn't find the gorilla stuff or the chase at the climax amusing either. I did like the songs and instrumentals the latter of which was provided by a guitar band called The Pyramids. Frankie and Annette have a nice duet at the beach while Ms. Funicello provides a nice solo. Brunette teen Donna Loren also sings an enjoyably catchy song at the beginning here and then there's Little Stevie Wonder providing his number at the end which while not memorable is all right. Like I said the comedy mostly falls flat after about 30 minutes but that said Bikini Beach remains mostly harmless fun as an introduction to me of the series.

	schema:reviewBody "Evil Harvey Huntington Honeywagon III Keenan Wynn of The Mechanic does not want teenage surfers cavorting around on the beach near his retirement home for oldsters and sets out to write a smear campaign against them until high school teacher Vivian Clements Martha Hyer of Some Came Running comes to their rescue. Honeywagon complains that the girls run around half naked with boys in bathing suits and no chaperons in sight. Furthermore Honeywagon plans to make them look bad with his talented chimpanzee Clyde Janos Prohanska of Pussycat Pussycat I Love You who can not only ride a surf board but also serves as a chauffeur for his wealthy but prudish boss. Incidentally before his tragic death in 1972 Prohanska made a career out of dressing up in an obviously ersatz simian outfit on Gilligan's Island Star Trek and other shows. The wholesome teens in question are Frankie Frankie Avalon of The Alamo and Dee Dee Annette Funicello of The Misadventures of Merlin Jones and their gang including Deadhead Jody McCrea of Gunsight Ridgewho are out of school for the summer. Meanwhile a new arrival on the beach is the fabulous British rocker Potato Bug Frankie Avalon in a dual role and he turns Dee Dee on so she flirts with him. Of course Frankie turns greeneyed and tries to figure out a way to get his gal back.Bikini Beach was the third entry in the BEACH movies that costarred Frankie and Annette. No Beach Party movie would be complete with their nemesis the infamous Eric Von Zipper Harvey Lembeck of Stalag 17 and his blackleather clad motorcycle gang the Rats and the Mice trying to thwart the antics of our heroes and heroines. The Potato Bug challenges Frankie to a drag race and Von Zipper and his cretins set out to sabotage the race. None of this sets too well with the raceway owner Big Drag Don Rickles of Kelly's Heroes who dabbles in art. Basically the plots for these sand sun and surf sagas revolved around Frankie and Dee Dee making each other jealous and their lamebrained pal Deadhead making a fool out of himself in his hillbilly hat. Believe it or not it took three scribes to scrawl this hilarious nonsense. One of them was William Asher who directed over 100 episode of the classic Lucille Ball television comedy I Love Lucy. The bikiniclad babes are visual eyecandy and there is a cameo appearance by a famous horror movie star at the end.Mind you Bikini Beach has all the depth of a bed pan but the antics are so silly and stupid that you may wet yourself laughing. Perennial villain Timothy Carey of OneEyed Jacks makes another appearance as pool hustler South Dakota Slim and Stevie Wonder does a singon as Little Stevie Wonder. Ironically enough the Beatles were supposed to appear in Bikini Beach but they hit it so big that their fee skyrocketed and Asher replaced them with a character that spoofed them. Indeed Bikini Beach is an acquired taste like all the 1960 era teenage Beach party movies from American International Pictures. Incredibly the Frankie  Annette beach party movies were a spinoff of the Gidget movies with the parents taken out of the mix. Despite the prominence of surfing in most of these movies only Clyde the Ape surfs in this movie. Clearly the name of the Keenan Wynn character was an movie inside joke because a honeywagon in Hollywood parlance is a toilet trailer.".

	schema:reviewBody "One tends to regard all the Frankie and Annette beach movies as interchangeable but current viewers should find a lot more substance in Bikini Beach 1964 than in the others. And not just because the film holds up reasonably well and performs the time capsule function. Most of the credit goes to the writers who probably realized this thing as a sequel of sorts was presold and took a few chances with social commentary and satire that you normally don't see in an American International exploitation film. And Bikini Beach features a genuinely good soundtrack with an absolute minimum of performances by Annette. In the satire and parody department there are a number of nice selfreflexive elements. The best of these being a parody of the Beatles I Want To Hold Your Hand performed by Frankie who doubles as a mopheaded British import named The Potato Bug. Those who recall the British invasion remember that for every two screaming teenage fans there was at least one sulking boy who just didn't get it. Then there is the Wild Ones parody including Harvey Lembeck's entrance on a motorcycle complete with a trophy tied to the handlebars. Finally there is a tribute to The Hustler's Minnesota Fats a pool hall scene with a player named South Dakota Slim. There are even social commentary themes. Keenan Wynn's Harvey Honeywagon drops his crusade against the partying surfer crowd once he starts getting it on with Martha Hyer. The idea being that uptight people are just frustrated at not getting any action. Of course the writers don't let the surfer off completely as their surfingdancingdrag racing lifestyle offers so little challenge that a trained ape can beat them at their own games. As to the soundtrack highlights include a great title song with the opening credits the earliest Stevie Wonder performance you are likely to see some nice stuff by the great Donna Loren including another parody elementthis time a secret agent spoof and the Beatles parody already mentioned. The real beauty of the Potato Bug character is that he replaces about half the FrankieAnnette stuff usually found in these movies. It's still Frankie and Annette but this time the scenes have some actual entertainment value. Then again what do I know? I'm only a child.".

The highlight of this film is the fact that the title actually delivers during the opening credits as they have some fun showing off some female bodies in those new bikinis. The film also changes things up a bit by taking the kids away from the beach.This film is probably best remembered for Avalon playing a second role that of a rock star from Britain which was obviously a joke on The Beatles. I actually thought Avalon did a very good job in both of his roles and certainly helped make this film more entertaining. Funicello is also given more to do here as her character certainly developed a bit more from the previous films. Wynn is extremely entertaining as the researcher and we've got Don Rickles and Harvey Lembeck back as well. There's also a nice cameo but I won't ruin who it is.As with the previous two films in the AIP series this certainly isn't a masterpiece or even what you'd consider a good movie but it is slightly entertaining as a product of its period.".

And he is good at the role and it is quite funny. I also think this movie is an influence on Clint Eastwood's Every Which Way but Loose movie.

What was probably most interesting was the way this movie managed to assimilate the relatively new surf music with the brand new sound characterized by the First British Invasion. On the other hand while I appreciated the scenery provided by Annette Funicello Martha Hyer Meredith MacRae as Animal and a host of other young ladies I didn't especially care for the amount of time devoted to Clyde or Candy Candy Johnson.

Accordingly I rate it as average.".

This one with Frankie Avalon who was actually a pretty decent singer and Annette Funicello who wasn't much of a singer couldn't act much but was cure as a bug.These movies strike a particular chord with me as I was a college freshman in 19631964. I remember the Beatle invasion quite well and this movie 'Bikini Beach' has a character that is a parody of the Beatles the 'Potato Bug' a wealthy and popular young British pop star with a mop of a haircut and wire rim glasses. Interestingly Frankie Avalon plays him as well as 'Frankie' the suitor of Funicello's character.By today's standards this would rate as a fairly poor movie but for those of us who were teenagers in the 1960s it brings back good memories of a simpler time. There is a thread of a story here the teens just want to hang out at the beach near Los Angeles but a wealthy businessman and developer wants to give them bad press as part of his attempt to buy up some beachfront land. There is also a motorcycle gang seemingly for no good reason and some drag racing. Much of the humor is slapstick inspired by the Three Stooges I'd imagine.Frankie Avalon plays Frankie and in a wig and gap teeth the Potato Bug. Annette Funicello plays Dee Dee. My favorite was Martha Hyer pushing 40 in 1964 but lovely as Vivien Clements who takes the side of the teens. A relatively young 35ish Don Rickles is Big Drag  who builds drag racing 'rails'. Harvey Lembeck is Eric Von Zipper the outlandish motorcycle gang boss. Plus assorted cute girls in bikinis. Of note is a cameo appearance by Stevie Wonder  still known as 'Little Stevie Wonder' at about 13. He sings one song as the movie is ending. Just plain 1960s fun that's all.".

	schema:headline " Convincing performances by Perry and Fox prevent Alex Cross from being completely unwatchable.";
	schema:reviewBody "It's not hard to figure out what's wrong with this movie. Skeptics may think Tyler Perry was a bad choice to fill in a young Morgan Freeman's shoes but he was absolutely fine in the role. Plus Matthew Fox as a psychopathic skinhead assassin? Hell yes. Edward Burns as Perry's detective partner? Eh less convincing but I'll let it slide. The direction and the writing though... whew. It's amazing the actors were able to recite this dialogue with a straight face.The story of Alex Cross is a simple murder mystery  Alex Cross and his partner investigate the scene of a crime and discover that they're after a professional killer referred to as Picasso. Then things get personal and Cross plans to seek his revenge once and for all. Standard crime thriller plot right? The problem is when the characters start talking to each other. Honestly it's laughable how bad some of this dialogue is especially between Cross and his family. They throw in these emotional scenes to break up the action but all they do is make for a really awkward paced movie. It would be passable if the dialogue actually moved the plot forward but it doesn't at all. There are some subplots that are introduced and never brought up again. Like Alex Cross becoming an FBI agent. What was the point of even including that?The main reason to watch this movie is for Matthew Fox. He's playing a sadist who is fascinated by pain. Not very original but who cares it's Matthew Fox playing a 130 pound untamable psychopath. The scenes in which we see him doing his job  stalking his targets infiltrating their houses taking out their body guards and whatnot  are the most interesting parts of the movie. He's really the only character given a clear cut motive and enough development to make him a decent antagonist. He's also batsht crazy did I mention that? Yeah he's a lot of fun to watch.Unfortunately Perry isn't given nearly as much to work with. He's a generic detective masquerading under the name Alex Cross who acts as a poor man's Sherlock Holmes. His whole objective is to get into the mind of this madman while trying to maintain a steady family life but instead of building tension between these two factors and having them play off one another and ultimately effecting Cross' personal life the writerdirector think it's more effective to jump from one setting to another with no leadins or relevance to what just happened or what is about to happen. The family scenes are cringeworthy and even the dialogue with his partner gets really cheesy. I wanted to see more psychological warfare between Cross and Picasso. They try to do that in a couple scenes but it's so poorly written that you don't believe a word of it.Tyler Perry's acting shines in a few scenes. He's certainly a capable dramatic actor and anyone who says otherwise is talking out of their ass. Thankfully I haven't seen the Madea movies so I had no prior opinion of Perry but he won me over with this. Mind you some of his lines sound forced and awkward but that's completely on the scriptwriters. It's just impossible to be drawn to the character and you'd think with a title like Alex Cross that we'd get a deep look into the mind of the title character but instead they spoonfeed us this cheesy soapy dialogue and the occasional battleofwits with the villain that isn't the least bit intriguing. Also the climax of this movie if you can even call it that is laughable. The fight scene is probably the worst camera work I have seen in an action movie. You can hardly see what's going on half the time and once it ends you're just like okay. Is that it?Again the leads save this movie from being a total bomb. I was admittedly entertained for a good portion of the movie despite its stupid dialogue. None of it is inventive or new it's just your runofthemill murder mystery that is low on thrills and high on cheese. Worth a one time watch if it's on TV or something but really the main thing you'll remember from Alex Cross is the criminally wasted talent.".

	onyx:emotionText "It's not hard to figure out what's wrong with this movie. Skeptics may think Tyler Perry was a bad choice to fill in a young Morgan Freeman's shoes but he was absolutely fine in the role. Plus Matthew Fox as a psychopathic skinhead assassin? Hell yes. Edward Burns as Perry's detective partner? Eh less convincing but I'll let it slide. The direction and the writing though... whew. It's amazing the actors were able to recite this dialogue with a straight face.The story of Alex Cross is a simple murder mystery  Alex Cross and his partner investigate the scene of a crime and discover that they're after a professional killer referred to as Picasso. Then things get personal and Cross plans to seek his revenge once and for all. Standard crime thriller plot right? The problem is when the characters start talking to each other. Honestly it's laughable how bad some of this dialogue is especially between Cross and his family. They throw in these emotional scenes to break up the action but all they do is make for a really awkward paced movie. It would be passable if the dialogue actually moved the plot forward but it doesn't at all. There are some subplots that are introduced and never brought up again. Like Alex Cross becoming an FBI agent. What was the point of even including that?The main reason to watch this movie is for Matthew Fox. He's playing a sadist who is fascinated by pain. Not very original but who cares it's Matthew Fox playing a 130 pound untamable psychopath. The scenes in which we see him doing his job  stalking his targets infiltrating their houses taking out their body guards and whatnot  are the most interesting parts of the movie. He's really the only character given a clear cut motive and enough development to make him a decent antagonist. He's also batsht crazy did I mention that?

	schema:headline " Alex Cross fails miserably";
	schema:reviewBody "Finally a Tyler Perry movie that is actually funny. For those who don't know however Alex Cross is not meant to be a comedy. It's supposed to be a serious actiondrama. With all of its cheesy moments corny dialog and doubtful plot points Alex Cross misses entirely.Alex Cross stars Tyler Perry as an expert detective who is about to embark on his most difficult case. The case is to track down a deranged psychokiller played by Matthew Fox. Matthew Fox enjoys torturing people to death and playing mind games with the detectives that are on his trail. I would like to say more about the plot of this movie but sadly there isn't much more to tell. It's that basic. You'd think a plot where a genius detective is facing an intelligent serial killer would have more complexity but it doesn't.There are a lot of problems with Alex Cross. For starters the script may as well have been written by a thirteen year old. This is probably one of the worst scripts of the year. In order to buy this script you just have to believe everything the characters say with no explanation. The character Alex Cross never proves that he's smart. The audience is just supposed to believe he's smart because other characters say so. Cross just throws out theories without backing them up and of course they turn out to be right. For example when Cross and his partner Edward Burns walk into the first handful of murders committed by Matthew Fox Burns guesses that this must have been the work of multiple guys. Cross replies Nope. This was one guy. Does he bother to explain why he feels that way? Nope. In another example Fox is on a train and Burns comes up to Cross and says You need to get in his head and think like him. If you were him where would you be? Cross thinks and then exclaims He's on a train! Care to enlighten us on how you arrived to that realization Dr. Cross? The problem is the writers clearly aren't smart enough to come up with ways for their characters to solve the case. Because this movie is so poorly written it is unbelievably predictable. I'm no Alex Cross but I knew exactly what was going to happen throughout the film. Literally every scene can be predetermined by a first time viewer.Not only is there terrible writing but there was also terrible directing. Matthew Fox and Edward Burns are both very good actors but they can't do anything under poor direction. Everyone in this movie is horrendous except for one person and that's Tyler Perry. I found this very surprising because I can't stand Tyler Perry's work and I thought he would be the worst thing about the movie. However he is the only thing that can be considered somewhat decent in the movie. You can tell Perry wants to branch out but unfortunately he can only do the best with what he was given. There were so many bad decisions made by the director. For emotion he tries to add some family value by adding in an old sassy black woman as character. Thankfully this character was not played by Tyler Perry. Another terrible idea was to have the camera constantly shaking because that's an action movie clich that everyone loves sarcasm. The camera was shaking during the most still moments. For example the camera was shaking ferociously when I kid you not a woman was typing on her computer. Perhaps one of the worst decisions from the director though was to throw in a twist at the end. Not only did he add a twist but he made it glaringly obvious.The only reason anyone might find Alex Cross appealing is because they get a kick out of watching bad movies or they really might enjoy seeing Tyler Perry try and do something different. Other than that there is absolutely no reason to see this film. The acting is horrific the dialog is idiotic the action sequences are poorly choreographed and the plot is 100 predictable. This movie is so bad that you will find yourself laughing at moments when you're supposed to be either gasping or crying. D".

There is no development of the villain why he does what he does and why a professional assassin would make the choices that he makes. Time makes absolutely no sense in this movie. Events must have occurred over a period of time in the book that have been condensed down to minutes in this movie. I haven't seen a movie in a while we're I've said to myself You've got to be kidding me multiple times because the scene was so implausible. Rob Cohen's direction is nothing short of terrible. Action scenes that are so blurry you can't tell who is beating up who. When there's not action scenes the rest of the film is a talking heads 70's made for TV movie. The acting flat out stinks with the exceptions of all to brief appearances of Cicely Tyson and Giancarlo Esposito. No chemistry with Perry and Ed Burns and no chemistry between the villain Matthew Fox and Perry. The movie score mostly sounds like a movie of the week from the 70's. The only redeeming value I find in this film is the location. There were some nice uses of Detroit buildings in the film. Other than that don't waste your time.".

	schema:reviewBody "Adapted from James Patterson's pulp novel 'Cross' this catandmouse action flick more closely resembles an extended episode of 'NCIS' or 'Law and Order' than it does a fullyfledged feature film.

	schema:reviewBody "This was possibly the worst movie I've watched in 2012. It made me want to walk out of the cinema before half the show was over and that's saying a LOT as I've sat through movies like 'The hotty and the notti' and 'epic movie'. I pretty much went into the cinema with zero expectations having seen the awful ratings it received and at the same time being a fan of the Alex Cross series. Still i was left squirming in my seat and muttering what the f? half the time. The script was terrible even a children's picture book would be more fascinating and less predictable. A complete waste of decent actors with totally onedimensional roles such as Tyler Perry himself and supporting actors like Jean Reno who did such an amazing job as Leon the Professional and eventually ended up being remembered only as the rich man with the ridiculous twodigitkarat diamond ring with less than 10 minutes screen time YET being revealed as the mastermind behind the murders.In the James Patterson series Alex Cross isn't just revealed as a brilliant psychoanalyst solely because his fellow colleagues and family members said so. There is solid evidence provided to gradually convince readers into believing and respecting this man who fiercely loves his nana and holds his own as a black man in a chaotic society like Detroit. However the audience in the movie is expected to believe that this man can make amazing deductions just because he deduced that his wife drank a frapp from a foam stain on her blazer jacket? That is pretty much the only deductive abilities he portrayed aside from the wildly random 'HE'S ON THE TRAIN' comment which was just implausible. The other characters are just as bad Alex Cross' partner Edward Burns was always conveniently missing from action scenes in an absurd attempt to allow Perry and Fox to have a showdown between themselves. Getting stuck by an iron wall and injured in a car accident which could have been avoided ENTIRELY wait how the hell did it happen again?! his character might as well have been omitted entirely from the movie. The side plots are even worst an unnecessary sex scene between Burns and his girlfriend whom he tries to hide from Cross who then finds out 3 minutes later wow how clever! the boxing ring scene to display Fox's violent nature which was so badly filmed anyway the three loser jesters who got shot on the train.. I could go on but it's not even worth recalling the scenes which did nothing to develop the plot or the characters.Additionally the villain is portrayed as someone so much more powerful and skilled than the protagonist that the audience cannot help but think Cross is weak and unable to protect his loved ones. Personally I felt that Perry's Cross had no redeemable qualities about him i couldn't care less if he got killed in the end and that is the major failure in the movie. If a director doesn't even have the ability to create a likablecompetent MAIN character in an action movie where a single chasingfighting scene can set the stage for it that makes his film a fluke. I would never catch the sequel even if i had to be dragged into the cinema and i truly hope that the upcoming Jack Reacher which is also based on a famous thriller writer's character will be less disappointing than this lousy excuse of an action movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm a big fan of the 'Alex Cross' series of books. I feel they've weakened a little in recent years but was still glad to hear they were rebooting the movie series. The most exciting part of the books for me was always the villains The Wolf The Mastermind Casanova etc. and how Cross would be effected by them and ultimately track them down and confront them. This was key to the quality of each individual book to me and I felt the first two movies 'Kiss the Girls' and 'Along Came a Spider' were a real let down in this regard.So I was glad to my find myself captivated by Matthew Fox's portrayal of Picasso. His opening scene demands your attention and his screen presence never lets up from that point on. The other thing I was always going to be interested in was how Tyler Perry went at portraying Cross. For me Morgan Freeman has always just been Cross. When I'm reading one of the books I can't help but picture him. He brought a calm serenity to the role that helped define Cross for me and I felt Perry had this as well at least for the first half of the film.The film really shows us two sides of Cross. At around the halfway stage Cross's pregnant wife is shot dead by Picasso himself. This enrages Cross and sends him rogue along with his partner Thomas Kane who also has had his lover murdered by Picasso. From this point on we see a darker Cross willing to use any means necessary to enact revenge upon his wife's killer. Perry's performance gets even better from this stage on. He nails the intensity needed to bring the audience in on the pain and drive he's feeling to achieve his ultimate goal.The problems lie in the writing for the most part. The opening and closing action sequences just don't have any imagination. The car crash that sets up the closing one is also bizarre. Are we just supposed to believe this was a complete coincidence? Or has Cross displayed superhuman timing to achieve this risking his friends life in the process? Incredibly lazy writing shown at that point.It's far from perfect. The actress cast as Nana Mama was done so poorly. She had none of the charm that the character in the books has. She just came across as mean. The twist right at the end is one of the most foreseeable I can ever remember. One scene from a big name actor that added absolutely nothing to the story at the time  has to be a twist that he was in on it. More lazy writing.But for all its faults its a very watchable movie. Perry and Fox are excellent and the story is entertaining if flawed. I certainly have no objections to more additions being added to the series.".

I think people are judging Tyler Perry by his other film and plays versus by the movie that is actually being reviewed. I thought he did a great job in the movie and I believe it is worth seeing. I enjoyed it and I think a lot of viewers did too. Unfortunately everyone acts like they are a movie critic and only wants the same people doing movies. It is unfortunate that there are only a handful of African American actors used as the main character of a film in Hollywood with a role other than a Maid Thief or some down trodden person. To see just a regular role with a person of color was nice and enjoyable. And all things being equal he did a fine job! This movie was very good and the ratings have been played down and are unfair. Is it an instant classic? no but it is a solid film that is worth seeing. Give it a chance... Many other films that IMDb viewers have rated at 7 have been way more predictable than this one less of a plot and the same people doing the same thing as they did in part 1 2 3 on so on.

He along with his motley crew is on the trail of a psychopath who loves inflicting pain on peopleis there any other variety of psychos. However the battle is about to turn very personal. Cross is a fictional detective who is the hero of eponymous series written by James Patterson. The books are generally very fast reads with little or no substance. However these books are thrillers whereas the movie attempts to be an action movie. It combines elements from different books to make this a personal fight for Alex. Needless to say it fails. The acting is as bad as I have seen this millennium. Tyler Perry steps in the big shoes of Morgan Freeman who played Cross in the previous two installments of the series Kiss the girls and Along Came a Spider and does a terrible job. He cannot emote and is clumsy in the action scenes. When he should be all fire and brimstone he is pretty lame . Edward Burns used to star in top notch movies like Saving Private Ryan a decade back. He is less than a shadow of his old self. He sucks big time as this beautiful cop. Jean Reno must be in a cash crunch or the director of this stinking pile must be having his objectionable video with him. I can think of no other reason for him starring in this. The script is terrible. The background music and the characters are also so clichd that they don't stay with you for even 2 minutes after the movie has ended. The only saving grace is Matthew Fox who plays the villain. He is menacing and terrifying and looks to be the only one who doesn't sleepwalk through his role. Recommended for people who love torturing themselves.".

At points in the film he is a badass albeit a bit overweight but hey not all heroes hit the treadmill and at others he is quite likable. He has some some quick and funny dialogue that he looked very at home with. All in all I now believe he is a pretty decent actor especially when comparing to his other characters.Matthew Fox plays an intense dude. Check out the images section to see what I'm talking about. He plays the insanity factor pretty hard and at times feels like he is nearing the full retard line but he never quite jumps the shark. It's sort of hit and miss. At times it's extremely effective and at others it seems a bit overdone. As a whole pretty effective and definitely crazy.I liked Edward Burns as Alex's partner and Rachel Nicols as the third in their team. I was disappointed with basically everything else in the movie. Acting was for the rest of the characters pretty downright bad with the exception of Dr. Cox who was acceptable. The stunts aside from a cool fight scene in a business office were pretty lame. The cinematography was average. The script was too heavy handed and convenient. The dialogue was good but the situations were not so much. It sort of felt like they were trying too hard to be gritty and raw. Seriously though Tyler Perry is BY FAR better than you are expecting. Go see it just to have your perception of him shattered a bit.".

	schema:reviewBody "'ALEX CROSS' Two and a Half Stars Out of FiveTyler Perry takes over the titular role from Morgan Freeman who previously played the detective in 1997's 'KISS THE GIRLS' and 2001's 'ALONG CAME A SPIDER'. The film also costars Matthew Fox looking very slim and Edward Burns and was directed by Rob Cohen the popular B action film director of hits like 'THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS' 'XXX' and 'THE MUMMY TOMB OF THE DRAGON EMPEROR'. It was written by Marc Moss who also wrote 'ALONG CAME A SPIDER' and first time feature film writer Kerry Williamson and based on the book 'Cross' by James Patterson writer of the entire 'Alex Cross' book series. Patterson also served as a producer on the film. As far as reboots go this one took the series in a seriously wrong direction and there's already a sequel planned with Perry reprising his role called 'DOUBLE CROSS' adapted from the thirteenth novel featuring the character. The films with Morgan Freeman were much more respectable crime thrillers. This isn't even 'so bad it's good'!This film centers on Alex Cross Perry discovering his wife Carmen Ejogo is pregnant with their third child as he's also offered a job working for the FBI. He breaks the news to his partner Tommy Kane Burns who also breaks the news to Cross that he's began relations with another officer on their team Monica Ashe Rachel Nichols much to the disapproval of Cross. The two respond to a murder scene where a madman Fox tortured and murdered a young woman Stephanie Jacobson and her bodyguards. Clues lead them and Officer Ashe to the offices of a businessman known as Erich Nunemacher Werner Daehn who they realize is the insane assassin's next target. They engage in a conflict with the killer before he escapes. This causes the three detectives to be marked for death by the killer and all hell breaks loose when the Cross family is put in harm's way. The movie like most of Cohen's work is heavy on action and extremely light on plot and character development. The characters aren't really fleshed out at all despite whatever moves the plot along in typical 'cops chasing killer' crime thriller fashion. The dialogue is dull and the acting is even worse. Fox is somewhat creepy as the psychopath bad guy but given his atrocious real life image as a women beating asshole it's not hard to dislike him at all. Burns is wasted and Nichols looks beautiful but offers the film nothing else. Perry is severely miscast. I've only seen one of his awful 'Madea' movies but it was enough along with the trailers for the others to know I'd never want to go through the pain of watching one again. He might actually be better in action films like this but he's still no actor and he's definitely no Morgan Freeman! I had heard Idris Elba was originally cast in the film instead of Perry. He would have made the movie much more intriguing and fun. As it is it's pretty bad and none of the 'so called' talent attached does anything to make it anymore bearable.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at httpwww.youtube.comwatch?vAGpMUj20Xx4".

Going into this movie you will be thinking of Tyler Perry as madea but you quickly get to see a side that you never seen of him before.

	schema:reviewBody "I want to start off by saying that I have never read a James Patterson novel nor did I see Morgan Freeman's interpretation of Alex Cross. This film is about a gun for hire who takes particular enjoyment in sadistically killing his marks. I think that the story was okay but there was nothing fantastic about it. It was pretty much your run of the mill crime drama that could have probably aired on Criminal Minds on television. Tyler Perry Dr. Alex Cross steps out of his usual comedic role to take a stab at the action genre.

To sum things up the film did keep my attention and the story was good but I am not sure that this is a film that belongs on the big screen. I hope that they are not thinking about turning this into a franchise but that probably depends on how well the film does at the box office. Maybe Morgan Freeman did a better job than Tyler.

This film is about a gun for hire who takes particular enjoyment in sadistically killing his marks. I think that the story was okay but there was nothing fantastic about it. It was pretty much your run of the mill crime drama that could have probably aired on Criminal Minds on television. Tyler Perry Dr. Alex Cross steps out of his usual comedic role to take a stab at the action genre.

The premise involves four high school friends Regan Kirsten Dunst Becky the brilliant Australian actress Rebel Wilson Gena Lizzy Caplan and Katie Isla Fisher. The four girls  who were collectively known as the B Faces as school  reunite for Becky's wedding. Despite the happy facade they're a fractured group.Regan is a cruel controlling woman who's secretly upset that Becky got married before her Gena uses sex to cover her problems even explaining detailed sex acts to strangers and Katie  despite her outward craziness and love of partying  has elements of depression. Even Becky who seems to be the most normal of the girls is still dealing with the fallout of being teased at high school.While the plot has been done a million times and is similar to the Hangover movies it's the coarseness of the characters which make this movie stand out. The girls are meant to be unlikeable and there's plenty of coarse language to illustrate that point. While the plot plays out conventionally it doesn't drown in a sea of third act sentimentality for the sake of neatly wrapping up the loose ends. While things improve for the girls as the movie progresses they're still the same mean girls they were at the start. It's also refreshing to see a movie with strong female characters. Probably the stand out is Rebel Wilson having graduated from Australian sketch comedy shows to establish herself as the next great comedic actress.If you're after a slightly darker take of the romcom formula 'Bachelorette' is worth a look.".

FINALLY in a movie and role worthy of her comedic talents.3 Rebel Wilson. Naturally hilarious. Too bad her role necessitates underutilizing her gifts.4 James Marsden. I've only ever seen him in goodguy roles at which he is excellent. It's a confirmation of his skill that he's equally great at playing a sleazeball manipulator.5 June Diane Raphael.

	schema:reviewBody "Leslye Headland's Bachelorette is an unfunny miserable experience that toddles around for 90 miserable minutes with three people so obnoxious that you wouldn't want to share an elevator with them. It is a comedy that strives to be an earthier recreation of Bridesmaids and The Hangover but it is neither as clever nor as funny as either of those great films. This movie is aggressively bad.What is worse is that the three leads are played by three otherwise good actresses. Kirsten Dunst just off her triumphant performance as a bride facing the end of the world in Melancholia plays Regan a girl pushing 30 who has done everything right with her life and can't understand why some rich gorgeous hunky bozo hasn't swept her off her feet. At her side are best pals Katie and Gena. Katie is a party girl who spends most of her time cokedup or drunk. She's played by Isla Fisher who has been wonderful in films like The Wedding Crashers and Confessions of a Shopaholic. Gena played by Lizzy Caplan is just as cokedup and spends her time pining for an old boyfriend who has clearly moved on.The story kicks off when the three friends are asked to be bridesmaids to a girl they once ridiculed back in high school. She is Becky Rebel Wilson a sensitive overweight girl that they once called Pig Face. Why she called these people to be part of her special day is a mystery left unsolved. The night before the wedding Becky's friends gather for her bachelorette party at a hotel where naturally a stripper shows up dressed as a cop.

	onyx:emotionText "Leslye Headland's Bachelorette is an unfunny miserable experience that toddles around for 90 miserable minutes with three people so obnoxious that you wouldn't want to share an elevator with them. It is a comedy that strives to be an earthier recreation of Bridesmaids and The Hangover but it is neither as clever nor as funny as either of those great films. This movie is aggressively bad.What is worse is that the three leads are played by three otherwise good actresses. Kirsten Dunst just off her triumphant performance as a bride facing the end of the world in Melancholia plays Regan a girl pushing 30 who has done everything right with her life and can't understand why some rich gorgeous hunky bozo hasn't swept her off her feet. At her side are best pals Katie and Gena. Katie is a party girl who spends most of her time cokedup or drunk. She's played by Isla Fisher who has been wonderful in films like The Wedding Crashers and Confessions of a Shopaholic. Gena played by Lizzy Caplan is just as cokedup and spends her time pining for an old boyfriend who has clearly moved on.The story kicks off when the three friends are asked to be bridesmaids to a girl they once ridiculed back in high school. She is Becky Rebel Wilson a sensitive overweight girl that they once called Pig Face. Why she called these people to be part of her special day is a mystery left unsolved. The night before the wedding Becky's friends gather for her bachelorette party at a hotel where naturally a stripper shows up dressed as a cop. In the midst of his gyrating he calls the bridetobe Pigface and Becky is naturally so offended that she brings the party to a halt.In Becky's absence the drunk Regan and Katie think it might be funny to climb into the wedding dress at the same time so that they can post the picture on Facebook. In the midst of their cruel joke the dress rips and the next hour of the movie is spent trying to find some possible way to get it fixed.

	schema:headline " Possibly the best movie I've seen this year. I'm serious.";
	schema:reviewBody "I saw this movie earlier today. Witnessing the critical and popular dismissal leveled in some of these IMDb reviews compelled me to write the adamantly positive review it deserves. First things first let me name the virtues of this film. The most plainly excellent detail is that the plot is perfectly paced in this respect it outdoes both Bridesmaids and The Hangover the two films most frequently compared to it. The drama builds steadily and without halt for almost the entirety of the movie.Bridesmaids relied too heavily on Kristen Wiig's admittedly hilarious performance while comparatively ignoring several other potentially interesting characters. Dramatically it lulled too often and relieved too much focus from the impending wedding. The Hangover while better than Bridesmaids lacked the impressive dramatic pacing and humane camaraderie as well as the outstanding cast that bolsters Bachelorette.Kirsten Dunst gave what may be along with Melancholia the performance of her career particularly throughout the sequence in which she portrays a Regan who masterfully resists coming apart while simultaneously saving two of her best friends from a wedding disaster and a suicide attempt. It is no exaggeration to say that she exceeds herself and the genre and overpowers the role.Lizzy Caplan and Isla Fisher play their roles ideally while no match for Dunst they introduce the chaotic broil of fups and sidesteps that make this story both intently awful and irresistibly watchable. Caplan reprises the role she perfected in Party Down as the depressing but charming and somewhat inaccessible Casey while Fisher brings the burnoutnotfadeawayenergy she is known for from Wedding Crashers to another level.Now to address the criticism of those who can't abide this movie. The complaints tend to fall into two categories of those who refuse to see the redeeming value in a movie filled with such repugnant personalities and such small moralizing and of those who believe the movie failed its own dark comedy agenda by finishing with a predictable happy ending. There is no point in addressing reviews that make both complaints. Their contradictory desire for a movie that is ultimately both redemptive and damning only shows that they are not able to clearly formulate their thoughts or express themselves.The first category of complaints is eminently understandable. Bachelorette often jokes with borderline offensive humor and at times the jokes cross the border into the realm of the seriously offensive. Most of Trevor's James Marsden's commentary falls under this warning label as he spouts the pickup pseudopsychology that is despairingly commonplace among young men shows indifference toward the prospect of rape and takes it for granted that women like being treated as objects. Similarly does the recurring nickname pigface for Rebel Wilson's Becky incite a kneejerk reaction against the debased characters in this movie. But we should not commit the fallacy that congenial characters make a good movie or that the words of the characters are the ideology espoused by the movie. Ethically I think Bachelorette performs the critical function of revealing to us the unpleasant aspects of our culture and facing us with the surprisingly difficult truth that our most serious problems are neither irresolvable nor unfunny.The second category of complaints those who did not find the film dark enough is easily addressed. Yes I admit it has a happy ending. There was a wedding two of the three leads end up in relationships the transcendence of love is affirmed. But the only character who receives a properly happy ending is Rebel Wilson's Becky perhaps the least important person in the film more a plot device than a character. Gena and Katie still have serious emotional issues to work over and their relationships are far from stable or longlasting. And Regan is still further from the ideal of marriage than she was in the beginning.In the film's final accounting Regan empowers herself without jumping through the relationship hoops that all romcom female leads are traditionally subject to. Likewise she avoids becoming a victim a soapbox or a pretty face who is just glad things have settled down. In a plain moralistic sense the bestbehaved characters all end up with the best fates Becky the virtuous axis at the center of this pandemonium receives the perfect wedding Gena and Katie fall into stabilizing relationships as unwitting in happiness as they were in their depression all while Regan the wicked and energetic typea core of this ensemble receives nothing but instead actively attains her own hope for redemption which comes without a man attached.This won't be a popular opinion but I think this film is among the best of 2012 and I believe Kirsten Dunst's performance is Oscarworthy. I think Leslye Headland Dunst Caplan Fisher and their cinematographer all deserve recognition for producing this illuminating and entertaining picture.Having said all this I would not recommend the movie to my parents. Please do your research if you are easily offended. But those acclimated to the Apatow brand of domestic grossout comedy will not find anything here out of place only better executed. If you have a stomach for raunch and can deal with beautiful women portraying intelligentlywritten characters please see this movie. It will delight you.".

	schema:headline " a disappointing middleoftheroad comedy containing a cast with so much more potential than delivered";
	schema:reviewBody "With a cast that includes Kirsten Dunst Lizzy Caplan Isla Fisher Rebel Wilson James Marsden and Adam Scott I had a lot of hope for the Sundance film Bachelorette. What I didn't expect was with this talented of a cast the result would be a lifeless comedy that has some semihumorous moments but ends up as one of the biggest wastes of potential in recent comedy history.Bachelorette tells the story of Regan Dunst Gena Caplan and Katie Fisher three girls who are bridesmaids in their high school friend Becky's Wilson wedding. From the start the objective of trying to be a raunchier and more ridiculous Bridesmaids is laid out with the set up of the wedding and the focus on the three bridesmaids. However while succeeding in being raunchier and more ridiculous than Bridesmaids Bachelorette doesn't have half the heart or spirit as the far superior Kristen Wiig comedy.Quickly on we establish the strong personality differences between our four girls. Becky the bride has grown up quite a bit since high school and her steps into marriage have her partying less and wishing for a very quiet bachelorette party. On the flip side Gena and Katie are two girls that are looking forward to the chance to party at a bachelorette rave Gena making sure to pack her cocaine in a baby powder bottle and Katie drinking whatever she can and popping whatever pills she finds. And finally there is Regan who couldn't have been casted any better than Ms. PoleUpHerAss Kirsten Dunst.What I mean by Dunst being casted perfectly is that there is absolutely nothing redeeming about the character of Regan much like Dunst's performance. She walks through the steps and says the lines in the script like a bitch robot trying to make a quick payday. And while Caplan and Fisher are type casted as well the smartass and the dumb party girl it is Dunst's Regan that is absolutely the toughest part of this film.When actually stepping back and looking at these three characters it makes almost zero sense that any of the girls enjoy the other two's company. They constantly fight bitch and mock each other and reveal each other's darkest secrets in a series of angry moments drunk mishaps and stupid speeches. All of these are written for seemingly comedy purposes but they make each of the characters so dumb and selfcentered that it is hard to like or cheer for any of them.After a botched stripper show at the bachelorette party Becky goes off to bed leaving the three bridesmaids to drink do drugs and ultimately rip the bride's dress. And thus the film goes from the story of the wedding to a wild night of trying to get the dress fixed sort of a mash between The Hangover and Bridesmaids. But what is so frustrating is how dumb these girls are. For example after ripping the dress they drag it around the city trying to get it fixed having it reach the pinnacle of places you wouldn't want it to inhabit a strip club bathroom. The irrationality is not humorous. It is outlandish and dumb making you think how easily these situations could be avoided instead of making you laugh at the screen. In fact the entire film could have never existed if two of the dumb girls hadn't stepped into the bride's dress together and ripped it in the first place.To read the rest of the review IMDb form too short visit httpcustodianfilmcritic.combachelorette".

It kind of sucks for the writerdirector Leslye Headland in that it's based on the play she wrote several years ago and she likely already had the movie deal before Bridesmaids appeared. Even if it was beaten to the punch though it's not very good. The film follows three high school friends Kiresten Dunst Lizzy Kaplan and Isla Fisher who gather back home for the wedding of another friend Rebel Wilson. All three of the bridesmaids have pretty cruddy lives and they're upset that their less attractive fatter friend is getting married before them. The night before the wedding on a coke binge the three tear Wilson's wedding dress and then have to scramble to repair it. The thing that will put most viewers off of this film is that the three leads are just awful petty people. Many of the supporting characters notably James Marsden and Adam Scott are even more despicable. You have to wonder how these people are friends with the bride and groom in the first place. I did think after a while they characterised the three women enough that we at least understood why they were so screwed up. There are a handful of funny moments. Any small bit of goodwill it had built though was jettisoned by its ultralame rushtothewedding finale and then a particularly painful and miscalculated postwedding toast where Adam Scott tries to hook back up with Caplan who was his high school girlfriend. The film's really just not worth sitting through.".

However everything I read was almost apologetic about it it seemed that many people were disappointed with the flick.Well it opened today and yes the reviews were mediocre at best including those at IMDb.com but we still wanted to see it at least as a follow up to the play. So in sum we were ready to hate it.Well surprise surprise...it exceeded all expectations. It was VERY different from the play which I think is a good thing. One area that the play DID do well that the movie fell down on was the character development of the three main women but other than that the movie was the winner.Kirsten Dunst was terrific...her energy comic timing and presence were wonderful. Lizzy Caplan however stole every scene she was in. This is perhaps a rare example of the movie being better than the play. One caution although there are a few LOLs this is NOT a comedy so do not expect one.".

This definitely deserves a fcking nomination and that is not stretching it too far!Overall 'Bachelorette' is a smart and a darkly funny story of flawed but vulnerable ladies in a one crazy night. That is how it is going to look if you keep an openmind while watching it.

	schema:reviewBody "Der schwarze Abt is a German blackandwhite sound film from 1963 so this one is already over 50 years old as well. Writer and director is Franz Josef Gottlieb and he also worked on many other of these old Edgar Wallace films. Sadly I must say despite the title which sounds like a promising main antagonist that this was a pretty boring and mediocre watch. Then again I may be a bit biased in terms of the whole thing as I almost liked none of the Edgar Wallace films I watched and I saw almost all of them. This was probably a bit of a missed opportunity here as the cast includes quite a few big names such as Blacky Fuchsberger Borsche Aren't Boettcher and last but not least Klaus Kinski. But Kinski is already the perfect example of how mediocre these Wallace films are. He was definitely a gifted actor but the characters he played in these films were extremely interchangeable just like the whole stories and antagonists. I give The Black Abbot a thumbsdown. Not recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "MOLOCH translated as 'a demon in the shape of a man' is a film that shows yet another aspect of Aleksandr Sokurov's approach to filmmaking. As in his splendid 'Russian Ark' 'Mother and Son' and 'Father and Son' he manages to say more in his silences and interplay of his characters with nature and their environments that in his spare scripts this script is by Yuri Arabov and Marina Koreneva. His movement is slow like an adagio his eye is constantly on symbolism and irony and his filmingcamera technique is always experimental. Given these factors 'MOLOCH' is a fine example of how Sokurov works his magic whether or not the viewer will relate to this bizarre film depends on how willing one is to enter Sokurov's vision. This film about Hitler is very much a Russian product and given the history of the relationship between Russia and Germany that fact is necessary to know.1942 in a fortress in the clouds of Bavaria we find Eva Braun Yelena Rufanova cavorting balletically both inside the foreboding stone 'dungeon' and out on the dangerous parapets. She is visited by a strange entourage Hitler Leonid Mozgovoy Dr. and Mrs. Goebbels Leonid Sokol and Yelena Spiridonova Martin Boorman Vladimir Bogdanov and a priest Anatoli Shvedersky. The action takes place in a single day and during this time the actual war is not discussed. We are to understand this is a retreat for relaxation but as we get to know the characters we find that many hints of the evil and insane minds of all of them. They talk Auschwitz is mentioned and Hitler apparently has never heard of it Hitler pontificates on power the Goebbels demonstrate their abject worship of Hitler Eva Braun is the sassy journalist who is the only one who can talk back to Hitler teasing seducing and acquiescing to his inability to demonstrate intimacy. They dine Hitler's vegetarian mentality deplores the 'corporal soup' his dinner partners devour they watch old grainy black and white news clips of war machines new tanks soldiers and oddly a performance of Beethoven's 9th Symphony with Knappertsbusch conducting. Then the guests retire and Hitler is joined by Eva Braun in a bizarre boudoir scene. In the morning the entourage leaves and Eva remains retuning to her strange world of dancing through the fortress.Throughout the film the music is that of Wagner  Siegfried's Funeral Music and other passages from 'Die Gtterdmmerung' Twilight of the Gods! accompanied by some banter about Furtwangler and Bruno Walter as well as Knappertsbusch. The acting is somewhat stylized which adds to the bizarre mood the story creates. In the final analysis this appears to be Sokurov's image of a mind gone mad with power and visions of immortality and it is only at the very end when Eva Braun whispers that he cannot defeat death that there is a moment of vulnerability in the historical Hitler.This is a slow moving 108 minutes of film and not for everyone's taste but if you are an admirer of Aleksandr Sokurov it is a mesmerizing journey through the cerebral passages of one of history's worst molochs.

	schema:reviewBody "The year is 1942. Hitler is at the height of power. He and his inner circle retreat to a misty mountaintop castle in the Alps. Eva Braun nearly naked and alone basks in solitude on the ramparts. It is her only escape from the burden of loving a human chimera. Thus begins Alexander Sokurov's film MOLOCH which won the Best Screenplay Award at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival. Webster's Third International English Dictionary describes Moloch as an ancient Semitic deity and the figurative definition runs as A tyrannical power propitiated by human subservience or sacrifice. The latter is definitely in evidence as the film explores Braun's personal world and tribulations as well as the grotesque behavior of Hitler and his obsequious associates. The film does not attempt to mirror history rather it is a bold speculation that takes its cues from the past.Leonid Mozgovoy's performance as Hitler is uncanny. He is nervous annoyed selfabsorbed even vulnerable and oblivious to the strained relations around him including his troubled relationship with Braun played by Yelena Rufanova. Their final scene is particularly compelling where Braun in sympathetic tones tells Hitler as he is about to be driven away in his sedan Death is Death. It cannot be defeated.In a unique maneuver Sokurov had his entirely Russian cast voice the dialogue in German after which they were dubbed by native German actors from Berlin creating a nearly seamless result.Unfortunately the Russian version of the film in theaters had a voiceover translation done entirely by Mozgovoy which interferes with the German text defeating the whole purpose of going to all that trouble. This decision was made in deference to Russian audiences which are used to  and even sometimes prefer  this type of translation but subtitles would have worked much better. Luckily the Russian DVD has this option Russian subtitles only. The film is more streamlined than other Sokurov efforts and may be called one of his best works if not the best. The editing and pacing are smoother than that of many of his other films. The recently released video version of the film contains 21 minutes of footage not seen in the theatrical version. The long version plays well with more rich detail more expository elements such as additional manifestations of Eva's mischievous nature and Adolf's sensitivity to smells and foodstuffs.Sokurov studied history at Gorky State University before becoming a filmmaker. He makes highly idiosyncratic strikingly atmospheric and ponderously paced works drawing inspiration from classical literature and music  what he calls Old World art. He crafted the film from a screenplay entitled The Mystery of the Mountain originally the title of the film written by Yury Arabov with whom he has collaborated frequently.The film can rightfully be called a cinematic milestone because of its portrayal of Hitler. For the first time in narrative film history Hitler is shown to be human. This is ultimately a valuable artistic judgment for it fosters understanding of the political forces that he set in motion.Sokurov notes Erich Fromm wrote that until we learn to understand Hitler's human nature we will never understand anything about Nazism or learn to discern potential monsters in those lusting for power.".

His heart is broken he is an alcoholic he's perfectly neutral and he doesn't stick his neck out for anybody. But as the film progresses Rick rediscovers his own life again and goes on to take a roll in the war.Moloch shows us this reverse story of the antihero Rick. Hitler is the negation of an antihero someone who probably began life offscreen perfectly moral and alive. But his desires and fears have made him a monster dead on the inside.People who destroy life do so because they are afraid of their own deaths. Any child who has a momentary fright in contemplating death may respond by killing an insect or a small animal and taking succor in the control over life and death. This is how evil might begin. Thus Sokurov films the vulnerable underwearclad Hitler of the everyday in a state of childlike fear of his own death nearly all the time.But the real damnation of the killer is that in the end even perpetrating destruction will not ward off the ghosts of the mind. Death is death reminds Eva Braun helpfully. Like Rick's Ilsa she knows the whole time the true source and purpose of life knows it down in her bones. But poor Eva has no Rick to work with and eventually her efforts to liven Hitler only bring up her own worst fears.Pretty nice example of classical plot structure with negation of the antihero!".

	schema:reviewBody "Honestly I don't know what all the fuss is about when people say this is a boring and pretentious film. Yes this is an arthouse flick. It's beautiful purpose is to make you think in many different ways and about many different aspects of Nazism for instance look how the throng assembles like one of Rembrandt's paintings of the ruling council when 'Adi' slumps into the chair. A very telling reference out  but this film doesn't restrict its references to 'highbrow' themes. In its stylised portrayal of Goebbels and Bormann it manages to suggest the stereotypes of American cinema which is meant to generate insights into how to view this centre of evil. As the synopsis says Hitler et al have come to Berchtesgaden for R  R right? Not much fun is it? At the centre of this empire there is simply a void of yesmen who cannot relax in each other's company who cannot even break out the wine until der Fuhrer has gone to bed and who for whom every day is an exercise in the most intense nervousness with no way out except through der Fuhrer's whimsical violent rage. This movie is one of the driest I've come across. If Mel Brooks was the slapstick Nazis this is Nazis as 'Big Brother' contestants. So underplayed it's not exactly surprising many people complain there's nothing going on here  but then the evil of the Nazis is a strange and unwanted gift for artists and filmmakers who want to get as damn near to Eliot's 'Objective Correlative' as possible so they can play with a collective coherent response. In this case it begins with The Nazis were awful awful people. When did their punishment happen eh? How was death truly a punishment for their particular evil? This movie shows by making fun of them from several perspectives exactly what their punishment was. When the film moves into the relationship between AH and EB later on it is further complicated by the fact that Eva is the only one who has even seen what they are doing. Note the subtlety of the exchange which ends in Adi saying That's the right answer or the weird symbolism of their body language when he finally catches up with her in the bedroom. Sokhurov is not trying to portray realistically what happened he is using the space of Berchtesgaden as a space for a symbolic expression of what Nazism did to the Nazis themselves. Their hell began when they imposed it on others and they only discovered it later by which time one of them was a doddering old neurotic wreck another one way out of his depth and still another one abandoned by his old comrades and desperately trying to curry favour. And the whole thing adds up to something ludicrous. I have read on another critique here that Hitler was considered to be very boring. Well he can't have been that boring if you could provoke him to send you to the Russian front simply by criticising his ambitions  but then the boredom angle is catered for in the first ten minutes with Eva's listlessness. This film is classic.".

The fourth I think is not yet made. All concern men of great power at decisive and tragic moments. Moloch concerns Hitler in 1942 in an eagle's nest castle in the Bavarian Alps isolated as in other portraits among his cadres and Eva Braun indulging in grumpy vegetarian dinners and tossing about weird racist remarks about other nationalities. This is acted by strong members of the theater of St. Petersburg Elena Rufanova as Eva Barun Leonid Mosgovoi as Hitler Leonid Solol as Goebbels Yelena Spirindonova as Frau Goebbels Vladimir Bogdanov as Martin Bormann whose lines are dubbed by German actors and this is done well. The whole is bathed in a murky greengray or verdigris fog  saturated someone has written with a kind of patina characteristic of old Agfa films  the fogginess typical also of Sokurov's style elsewhere with as in The Sun a sumptuous feel in the miseenscne and amazing evocative period realness to objects photo books ashtrays serving dishes which seem at once solid and delicate. Yes this is remarkable filmmaking. But the film as a whole is yawninducing. Hitler spends most of his screen time moaning about his health. Ten minutes are devoted to Eva's wandering around naked without a word spoken. She is graceful and athletic but why? Well to evoke the boredom and idleness of the isolated concubine  but is such length necessary? Moloch is very different from and rather disappointing in comparison to The Sun's stunning touching portrayal of Hirohito which dwells also on trivial moments but always in the cause of a sensitive exploration of character and situation. There is a hushed intimacy about The Sun that Moloch though it has a few grand moments and may even evoke Lang's Metropolis never attempts. Hitler doesn't even really talk enough and this brings us to the inevitable fact that at this date 2006 Moloch is thoroughly overshadowed by the far more conventional sometimes heavyhanded but nonetheless richly detailed and accurate and breathlessly exciting recreation of the last days in the Bunker achieved recently by Oliver Hirschbiegel in his Downfall Der Untergang 2004 released in the US last year and containing Bruno Ganz's powerful performance as the Nazi dictator.".

The limits of the characters are often confused with the environment with the unreal atmosphere of the landscape.It is important to highlight its fine technical work and especially its cinematography a very careful composition in each scene. The cold way in which the light is treated and the density of the environment in each picture are the perfect frame to explain the morbid delirium of a group of attenuated and bizarre figures confined to their desolation.The dialogues have a certain dynamic and despite their absurdity and pathos they maintain enough dramatic tension so that the film is not lost in boredom.An original movie with an independent way to explore from the formal simplicity of its cinematic the hypochondria the mania and the phobia of the main character and his naive and wicked chorus.".

The limits of the characters are often confused with the environment with the unreal atmosphere of the landscape.It is important to highlight its fine technical work and especially its cinematography a very careful composition in each scene. The cold way in which the light is treated and the density of the environment in each picture are the perfect frame to explain the morbid delirium of a group of attenuated and bizarre figures confined to their desolation.The dialogues have a certain dynamic and despite their absurdity and pathos they maintain enough dramatic tension so that the film is not lost in boredom.An original movie with an independent way to explore from the formal simplicity of its cinematic the hypochondria the mania and the phobia of the main character and his naive and wicked chorus.";

What a great deception this Molokh is ! Winner of the Golden Palm in screenplay in Cannes Festival I really expected a great film. However I found a very boring and pretentious movie too much slow paced and going nowhere. The title refers to an evil divinity adored by ancient pagan cultures and shows a ridiculous Hitler in his intimacy with Eva Braun his hypochondria and crazy speeches about human races life and death and a rebel Eva Braun being the unique person to contest his words. I did not like this fictional movie the story the screenplay the direction and the performances. My vote is three.Title Brazil Moloch".

	schema:headline " Extremely slow political drama";
	schema:reviewBody "Molokh is a Nazithemed movie from over 15 years ago that runs for 108 minutes. It is the beginning of a quadrilogy by director Aleksandr Sokurov. Fittingly to the topic the film has German as its language although it is obvious that all or almost all of the cast were dubbed. Also the fourth film in the quadrilogy Faust is in German. There however a big part of the cast are also German actors in contrast to here. I think the guy who dubbed Hitler here could be Monk's German voice but I am not 100 sure. One of the reasons I watched this film is because of the screenplay award it won in Cannes. Another would be that I read that Mozgovoy's Hitler may be the biggest competition to Ganz in terms of who played the Fuehrer best. Mozgovoy was almost a rookie when this was made in terms of film acting but an experienced theater actor. No surprise this looks like an intimate play. The Eva Braun actress is a bit more experienced but not really that much either. The supporting players may have the most experience here. Note that Goebbels maybe even more bizarre than Hitler here is played by a woman here. This also adds to the theater atmosphere as do most of the settings.The movie looks much older than it actually is but this applies to some of Sokurov's works. The film moves very slowly and there are repeatedly section with little to none dialog. In the first 10 minutes we only watch Eva Braun dance. Later on we see her practice on the rings like a professional athlete and near the end she is dancing wildly again on a table. Very physical performance from her. Almost balletlike at times. Hitler joins her on the table at the end and I personally felt occasionally that without the costumes and the famous names and judging from their actions and dialogs this could have been a random unknown family too instead of the Fuehrer and his wife. Anyway it left me fairly unimpressed. Maybe it simply was too slow for my taste. This movie never really captured my interest so i cannot recommend it. Next time Downfall again.".

It again is about a group of pathetic individuals who inhabit a mistbound palace whilst the world crumbles around them. The black swamp and masked man of the prior film here is replaced by black soup and black puppies. I think that perhaps both films show the huge might of German ingenuity being harnessed by cretins. The inhabitants of the house in Mournful Unconcern represented the English upper class who rowed their boats merrily down the stream instead of participating in the reform of an outdated Europe gearing for war. Inaction is again the point in Molokh how did a great nation allow itself to be ruled by a bore a man who failed to recognise the rights of others failed to understand the feelings of others a fantasist a sadist and a selflover? The movie portrays them as nothing less than big kids Bormann hasn't even learnt how to sit on a chair. Braun and Hitler chase one another around a table and hold doors closed on one another all of which is very reminiscent of my life circa aged twelve. I ended up feeling rather sorry for them in their airy castle blown by draughts and tortured by psychological complexes. I was also wondering why on earth people feel such a need to be controlled. Sokurov seemed to have got even darker here than with Mournful Unconcern providing hardly any contrast against what is progressive.".

'Moloch' is a different league.Moloch has been made because Moloch wanted itself made. A stream of consciousness that was gushing through the director  Aleksandr Sokurov just presented itself. The cinematography was ethereal  magical. There is a perfection to it that leaves you spellbound. Think of a beautiful painting of a misty morning and you somehow get into the painting and see more of the world in the painting and all the sights as beautiful as the painting itself.That is how the cinematography was. The subject itself is a very surprising one. As you watch the movie a protagonist comes in who looks like Hitler. You are not sure if he really plays Hitler yet. A little later  this person is presented in a very light manner and you think it is some sort of a spoof of Hitler. Soon you realize that this is a portrayal of Hitler among people he is close to and this closeness leads to comic moments where Hitler's idiosyncrasies are presented. After many such situations  Hitler's conviction in cruelty and insanity is presented with such conviction that it sends chills down your spine. The director has been extremely adept here.The movie is based out of Hitler's secretary's diary notes and the aspects presented are eyeopening. The way he sits in his building and watches news reels of real war that is happening projected for him in his theater. His mad conviction towards what he is doing. When his weaknesses are presented  it is unbelievable to imagine that this idiot is such a terror. There is a vacation sequence where guarded by German soldiers Hitler and his close friends fool around. The soldier is unable to look at Hitler's slapstick dances as this is the same man who has made his life so taut. One insane man and so much devastation. This movie needs another watch for further comprehension  worth a thorough study for content and for presentation.".

That makes sense because the movie covers the awkwardness danger and constant potential for liferuining humiliation that is freshman year high school. Being skinny scared and lonely as Drillbit Taylor puts it.One of the other writers is the awesome Seth Rogen cowriter  costar of Superbad and costar of Knocked Up.Owen Wilson is funny sexy and heartwarming in this role. The trio of geeky lads who hire Owen as their protector are all played by wonderful young actors. The Apatow organization seems to have a genius for finding great and funny teen actors. I was especially impressed by Alex Frost he plays the bully who I think has stardom in his future.The small roles of the film are filled by standup comics and The Daily Show alumni. Good talent all around.The movie is not perfect. It's frontloaded  meaning the first half has so many laughs you can't hear all the lines for the laughter. Then it suddenly slows down in the second half. It's still interesting  just not as funny. And when you get to the violent fighting that dries up the laughs.Overall though any film from the Apatow organization is going to be 6 times funnier and more inventive than the average movie comedy out there. So go have some laughs.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's been a while since I wrote one of these but thanks mainly to Owen Wilson for another hilarious yes and interchangeable role this movie was funny enough to get motivated once again.The premise is obviously pretty simple and has been done before in both bodyguard and teen movies Superbad and My Bodyguard come to mind...duh. The beauty of this movie it combines the two genres with Owen Wilson's natural comedic talent and three capable younger actors resulting in a mostly funny comedy that is unique from the rest.There was an interesting metaphor contained in one of the trailers showing Drillbit telling the kids he's taking them under his wing. The reason I say this is interesting is because this is how it mostly worked for the movie's humor. It took almost 15 minutes for it to really get started. Don't get me wrong there were some funny parts that didn't involve him like the bodyguard interviews gotta love Frank Whaley's cameo Ryan's rap off with the bully and the two hitting each other but the biggest laughs for me were from Owen Wilson. To be fair though Owen was at his best when the kids were involved. I loved the way he approached this job with one part seriousness one part B.S. and two parts hilarious. I was dying when he was holding up that kid's burning popsicle stick project up to the sprinklers and just the general training conversations just to illustrate that recipe.Overall this storyline was nothing brilliant but as in You Me and Dupree Owen Wilson manages to take something that could be rather mediocre turning it into an enjoyable and endearing comedy. True he really didn't do it by himself as I'd try to make you believe. I mean the way the bullies were portrayed was a very convincing and effective factor that helped sell this one as well and who could forget the lovely Leslie Mann in an interesting and sometimes funny romantic subplot. To sum it all up if you liked the trailers you're going to like this movie. And a shout to all the people who replied in my thread that convinced me to go myself. You were right.".

However an opportunity arose to see the movie well before it came out and I took the chance to see it.To my great surprise I thoroughly enjoyed the movie to its fullest. Sure Owen Wilson is funny but the kids stole the show. The crude humor was left to a minimum and the funniest lines were the really subtle ones that almost everyone missed. This movie had heart and a good message which you don't normally see in mainstream teenage movies excluding Juno. Although I know it's probably not gonna make huge headlines I feel like this movie needs more recognition than it's gonna get. I want to see this movie go big and I'm excited to see what people say about it. So take it from me it's funny and it's not disappointing.".

The three kids in this movie made everyone laugh in the theatre. Then having Owen Wilson team up with the kids that just makes the movie all the better. The acting in this was pretty good especially out of the kids. At first going to see this I thought the acting would be just okay. Instead it was really good though. The messages in this were pretty good. The movie was trying to state a point to you that if you tell the truth no matter what it is you will get farther in life. Owen Wilson in this movie just kept lying to everyone especially the kids. At first you dislike Owen Wilsons character. Then he gets to know the kids and they teach him a lot about life. This was a great teen comedy movie in my opinion. I liked the idea of having Owen Wilson play a homeless man at first trying to make money. The thing that was bad about him though is that he did mean things for the money. This was also a pretty cute movie. The reason it was a little cute was because one of the kids liked a girl in his high school. Most of the time that always helps in a movie. I thought that this movie was well worth your money to see it. Another good thing about this movie was the idea of having such a mean bully picking on the kids.

	schema:reviewBody "Take one part Owen Wilson and three parts high school freshman and you have a clever comedy. The story tells of three high school freshman just starting their first day hoping that they could generate a fresh start. However all turns sour when one boy stands up for each other and all three become the ridicule of the school and targets for two very rough school bullies. To avoid further ridicule the boys hope to hire a body guard to protect them from their bullies. Barely living by day Owen Wilson comes into the picture and uses his wits to charm the boys for the job. Though at first his intentions are for his own benefit he later grows a heartfelt concern for the boys. Throguhout the movie we see a gentle chemistry with Owen and the boys. I actually enjoyed the movie because it had nice humor and strangely some sort of plot that did not make you feel the movie was dragging. Owen Wilson adds his own flavor to the film by being both a new high school vigilante and a charming gentleman for a fellow teacher. This movie combined subtle comedy romance and friendship that sends a positive message surpassing the social people in high school. I would say this is well worth the watch and if your an Owen Wilson fan be prepared for a smooth ride.".

	schema:headline " Drillbit Taylor is too sour and mean spirited to be heartwarming and rest of the movie is dull and undercooked.";
	schema:reviewBody "Drillbit Taylor is the newest addition to the collection of Judd Apatow comedies. Although this time around he only produced and the movie is watered down to a PG13 instead of his usual raunchy R rating. The movie is about two nerdy young kids Wade Nate Hartley and Ryan Troy Gentile who just started high school. But on just their first day they begin getting picked on by the school bully Filkins Alex Frost and his littletonodialogue crony Ronnie Josh Peck. The bullies becoming increasingly threatening and it only gets worse when the biggest nerd in the school Emmitt David Dorfman starts hanging around them. The constant bullying gets to the point where the kids decide to hire a bodyguard who calls himself Drillbit Taylor Owen Wilson. Drillbit tells them that he was trained by the military and is an expert fighter but in reality he is just a lazy lying homeless man and proceeds to loot their homes. But the boys gullibly believe in him anyway and as Drillbit teaches them some martial arts and defense moves some right out of action movies he really starts to like them. But eventually Drillbit has to face the truth behind his lies and the boys have to face their fears and stop the bullies themselves.Judd Apatow and his crew's comedies have really been on a roll lately. Recently we've received the hilarious Knocked Up Superbad the 40 Year Old Virgin and Walk Hard the Dewey Cox Story. All of them received a good R rating for their raunchy and often foul mouthed dialogue and humor. But along comes Drillbit Taylor with its watered down PG13 humor. Let me start off saying this Judd Apatow should really stick to the R rated comedies and if he really wants to produce a PG13 at least produce one that is actually funny. That just goes to say that Drillbit Taylor tries to be funny but the whole bullied kids story has been done so many times that there's not much here to laugh at. But hey does anyone remember a guy named John Hughes? The man who had his name written all over excellent teen comedies from the 1980s like The Breakfast Club Sixteen Candles and the classic Ferris Bueller's Day Off. Well John Hughes helped put together this story but in my own opinion he should never have graced his name on such garbage.Drillbit Taylor is not only unfunny but also incredibly mean spirited and cynical. The jokes in this movie are few but when they do happen to arrive they're far too soft and easygoing. Nate Hartley and Troy Gentile however are a completely welcome presence and both are very good and charming in this movie. They were essentially the only good part of the movie. Whereas the third actor David Dorfman is awful as an annoying jabbering loser who really doesn't even become a character. He just sits around and acts like Raymond from Rain Man only this kid acts like he just did crack and had one too many Red Bulls. Owen Wilson gives it his all as Drillbit but the character is just not made to be funny. The scenes where he teaches the boys self defense loots their homes flirts with their teacher and most other things he does didn't make me laugh. Drillbit and his homeless friends even preposterously pose as substitute teachers at the boys' school because it seems as long as they have coffee cups in their hands all the teachers are oblivious to them. Drillbit hits on the teacher Lisa Leslie Mann but she is so flat and one dimensional it's not even remotely funny. Leslie Mann is a great actress and she is wasted here because her character is stupid barely gets screen time and is completely pointless to the story.The bullies in this movie which the plot of Drillbit Taylor is centered around are not just bullies but sadists as well. Alex Frost played a school shooter in Gus Van Sant's movie Elephant and it almost seems like he's the same character here. As the lead bully Filkins is more of a teenage psychopath and whenever he's on screen I was reminded of Columbine. Josh Peck only has a few words of dialogue in the movie. Josh Peck is also very talented and deserved better. The bullies in Drillbit Taylor try to run over the kids at high speed with their car driving over lawns and mailboxes and anything and in one fight scene Filkins picks up a long metal lamp and starts swinging it violently at Wade. He also says he gets off on their misery and that he likes watching kids like them suffer. But when he's brought to the principal's office he acts like a goodytwoshoes and gets off Scotfree. I began to wonder if the teachers and administrators were blind. The tone and message of Drillbit Taylor are way off because at first it's about self defense then suddenly it's antiviolent and then for the end it's brutally sadistically violent. In the end Drillbit Taylor taught me violence is okay as long as it's brutal you don't get in trouble for bullying and that as a bully you naturally crave the pain and misery of others.Everyone here tries their hardest but Drillbit Taylor is just not funny. It's message and extreme violence is disheartening and for a movie that's PG13 this film sure is nasty. I give Drillbit Taylor a 1 out of 4. I don't recommend it to anyone really especially kids.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Drilbit Taylor' is a teen movie that revolves around three highschool students being bullied and in order to protect themselves they plan to hire a bodyguard. The film has its own charm and is quite likable thanks mostly to Wilson's chemistry with the three teens. Another thing I liked about this movie is that it wasn't overloaded with sex and crudeness which seems to be a forced compulsory requirement of every teen movie these days a recent example being the awful 'Superbad'. The teen actors Nate Hartley and Troy Gentile are very good. Hartley particularly gives a natural performance. Owen Wilson uses his superb comic timing and does nothing short of great. What I didn't like about 'Drilbit Taylor' is that it tends to go unnecessarily over the top with some sequences and the fight scene in the end is a little too violent. The bullying scenes were meant to be funny at least that's the impression I got given the background score and the way it was executed but with me they had the opposite effect and I wonder how kids who are actually bullied would feel after watching such scenes being used as comic relief. However on the other hand it might be uplifting to them as the point of the movie was to stand up for oneself and his friends. Anyway 'Drilbit Taylor' is fun entertainment. Not the best of its kind but still good enough.".

So I did rent it watched it last night I'm actually glad I waited for the rental because while I didn't hate the movie I wasn't a big fan of it. I think because the story was just beyond unrealistic I know it's a comedy and I always do lighten up for a movie but this just seemed ridicules. These boys who are getting picked on I mean they're not just getting picked on they're are getting brutally humiliated and somehow no one notices? Not to mention that a homeless guy can just walk into a school wearing a tie and he is assumed to be a substitute and no one asks questions? This script must have been written by someone who was drunk.Three kids at school are getting brutally picked on by two bullies they're getting hit constantly being made fun of getting stuffed into trophy cabinets and even getting hung from doors they've had it they decide to hire a body guard to protect them. They meet Drillbit Taylor an actual homeless guy who is trying to get to Canada so he's ripping off these kids in any way he can to get there but he promises them that he's a great body guard and will teach them how to fight. Of course madness ensues he ends up liking the kids the story speaks for itself I'm sorry.The movie is unoriginal the comedy is alright the actors I wasn't impressed with the casting. I just feel like this movie could have been so much more it just seems so beyond insane to me to believe a lot of these situations. Not to mention the bully he was kinda puny and I was supposed to believe him as a bully who can kick anyone's butt? I know that everyone is going to tell me to lighten up with this movie but honestly I feel like it did waste my time it was predictable and not comedy gold I wouldn't really recommend it to anyone to be honest.310".

You should TOTALLY see it you won't be disappointed!! Even though it says Crude Sexual References Throughout it DEFINITELY DEFINITELY IS NOT Throughout. And the Partial Nudity is just a brief shot of Drillbit's behind. And the bullying is kind of obvious shoving into lockers etc. The drug references is just when the mother repeatedly asks her son Are you smoking pot Anybody 10 and Up should be able to see this and handle it just fine. It's not as bad as it sounds on the parents guide and the parents guide isn't even really bad so there you go. The bottom line is GO SEE IT!! It is a GREAT flick!!

Only people who don't care and don't ever think about why they like what they like and how the filmmakers manipulate would not object here. It is an irresponsible film and really glorifies the problem by making it a fun buddy caper. I hate to sound so uptight and I don't think I really am but some of the sadistic attacks on these children made me cringe and rage as I saw it... not because it went too far but because to some degree this sort of thing happens everyday and the system the school the parents the other students stand by just as they do in this film. However here we have a fantasy about some crazy solution. It would be fun and cute if it weren't such a vile topic  one nobody seems to take seriously. If you have children or know children or care about children in the public school system this film should not be fun for you. Do not suspend your disbelief. Is rape a fun topic for a happy ending buddy comedy? Is murder? Is child beating? Domestic violence? No? Really?? No one would say yes to any of that? Then why is a topic that can lead to things like school shootings and suicide not to mention the endless fear deep emtional damage and daily desperation and unhappiness of many children's lives so easily translated into a cutesy buddy film with a happy feelgood ending? The makers of this film should bear some scrutiny for exploiting such an issue for diminishing it and making light of it.

The plot is predictable from the start and The actors playing the kids are annoying bad at acting and very strange looking I couldn't keep my eye off the small kid with braces he was so strange looking it was distracting all rolled into one.However if you can get past this the film has some funny yet forgettable moments. Most of these involving Owen Wilson who is the angel of this below average movie. He has a great charisma about him in all his films however he needs some sparring partner to hit lines off rather than a bunch of strange looking 14 year old kids.In conclusion the film is below average yet has some funny parts most of them becoming overshadowed by the poor acting and predictable plot. Highly Disappointing for a Apatow film.".

Although guaranteed I found myself laughing at some moments such as the karate kung fu tai chi kung pao Panda Express joke but overall this attempt to make a throwback at the high school revenge flicks of the 80's such as Three O' Clock High seems too clich for its own good. As a matter of fact this tells the story of Drillbit Taylor Owen Wilson a bodyguard or so he calls himself who fakes being a former soldier in order to rig money from anyone who believes his story. He finds himself lucky when he's hired by your typical freshman nerds who've had enough of the bullies who treat them so badly. Along the way he fakes being a substitute teacher falling for another colleague played by Apatow's wife Leslie Mann and one of Taylor's greedy friends one of them being Danny McBride of Pineapple Express winds up betraying him which winds up with Taylor betraying the kids. But when one of the kids dares a bully to a fight that will happen in the bully's house it's up to Drillbit Taylor to save the day. Does'nt work especially with names such as Apatow producing Seth Rogen writing the screenplay and Edmond Dantes a pseudonym for the late John Hughes helping to write it just seems too weird for itself and just makes us beg for Hughes' teen flicks of the 80s to come back again.".

Unbeknownst to the boys Drillbit is a homeless man who has lied about his credentials.I like the premise. It had potential. Unfortunately this comedy only had a few good laughs. Unfunny dialogue and unfunny situations. Like Superbad this movie was cowritten by Seth Rogen. Unlike Superbad this script was boring full of holes and not very funny.Examples of plot holes Neither the principal nor the parents take the kids seriously when they say they're being harassed by bullies. Even after one of the kids gets a black eye apparently no adults ever notice. The bullies openly attack in crowded areas at school without ever being caught by the faculty. A man posing as a substitute teacher is able to walk into classrooms at random and start teaching without the real teacher ever walking in and saying Why the heck are you here? Owen Wilson plays Drillbit and he brings a lot of charm to the character. He provides a few laughs but his ability is limited by a mostly unfunny script. Actually this film had some great casting. Leslie Mann is fantastic and her chemistry with Wilson was so strong that I hope they get another chance to work together on a better film. The perfect actors were also chosen to play Wade's stepdad a former bullyjock and braindead stepbrothers.Overall this movie is not worth renting even if you usually like Seth Rogen or Owen Wilson. I know a couple 12yearolds who loved this movie and I do believe other kids of that age would enjoy it. For the rest of us skip it.".

As they are both rather nerdy their fondest wish is to simply fit in and snag friends and girlfriends. But on the first day of school their dream is roundly shattered. You see there is a senior at the school Filkins Alex Frost who lives to torture those individuals who unhappily catch his eye. Since Wade and TDog have showed up in the same shirt he promptly buttons their tops together in a tangle for his amusement. It is only the beginning. When Wade rescues a third outcast Emmitt from Filkins clutches the big bully makes the threesome his pet victims. Then TDog gets the idea that if they find a bodyguard preferably with martial art skills they can throw Filkins for a loop. Answering the boys' ad is one Drillbit Taylor Owen Wilson. Although he informs the boys that he was once in the army and skilled in combat he fails to tell them that he is a homeless panhandler who is taking the job so that he can pocket enough money to make the bus fare to Canada. Posing as a substitute teacher Drillbit does keep an eye on the boys especially with the help of a walkietalkie. There is even a pretty teacher Lisa Leslie Mann who falls hard for the now buttondown Drillbit. But how long can such a scheme last and does Filkins have some more tricks up his sleeve? This is a droll bit of fluff this Drillbit and most likely you will enjoy it. Young boys especially will probably clamor for tickets but parents do note the PG13 rating and the description which follows it. This is not a family film exactly and there are quite a few elements that will frost someone's cookies. That is not to say the film is not very funny and true to life for it is. There are some great lines such as the one where Drillbit notes if you take away their video games they might choose to read a book or if you garnish their ipods they could learn to play the piano. The young cast is great with Hartley and Gentile demonstrating their natural comic abilities and Frost a dead ringer for Anthony Perkins delivering an appropriately loathsome turn as the bully. Mann is always a welcome addition to any film for she has looks talent and an arresting voice. As for Wilson it is doubtful that anyone could have played this role any better. When a film requires a sunsoaked slacker with a giant heart he is the man to call absolutely. Then too the production looks good with wellchosen costumes and sets and the screenplay is inventive and humorous. No it is not the greatest thing since slicebread and it may fall into oblivion at some point. But there is truly much to like about Drillbit and its cheery tale will entertain most folks who sit down for a viewing.".

We've seen all this bullying before in movies and unfortunately in real life... being stuffed into lockers heads banged against walls wedgies and being kicked punched poked fun of etc. etc. etc. Bullying is a serious issue in public schools and here it's treated like slapstick. Some of it funny but most of it not. Drillbit Taylor has some of the dumbest parents mostly nonexistent in movie history. The principle of the school is a naive clueless dimwit and the English teacher that falls for Wilson's character acts like she hasn't been on a date since Jr. High and is basically ready to jump his bones right there in the teacher's lounge. There's nothing witty or clever about Drillbit Taylor. Most of the writing is unfunny and just plain stupid. I noticed from the audience's reaction dialogue that was supposed to be funny received forced laughter. One very funny scene is shown in the movie trailer as two of the boys sucker punch each other in different parts of their bodies practicing for that big fight toward the third act. The far superior Superbad had the perfect formula dealing with high school bullies and a few of it's geeky inhabitants. Not only was that film overthetop funny but it had that rare feat of having a heart and soul and was one of the best adolescent films of recent years where as Rogen's and Apatow's new film needs so much life resuscitated into it it's basically dead on arrival.

	schema:headline " A hopeless hapless humorless soulless MESS that some 14 year olds will like";
	schema:reviewBody "First and foremost...Wedding Crashers fans need not apply. 81 of Top Rotten Tomato critic's thumbs down got this one spot on.From synopsis to DVD jacket cover this film is touted as the story of 3 HS Freshman nerds who hire soldier of fortune Wilson to protect them from the school's bully. Untrue. Wilson is not a soldier of fortune. Even the interview scene kids interviewing real soldier of fortune types so often the highlight in other films like The Full Monty is utter nonsense here. The thought that any of these 'real' bad asses would interview with 14 year old nerds offering pocket change and no compelling argument plays as absurd as it sounds. At the constant core of this 'comedy' is Wilson's life choice to be a 40 year old homeless highway panhandler who lives in a park and takes naked showers at the beach. He lies cheats and is a thief who steals from the kids home as they give him a house tour. His best buddies are likewise bums and thieves. He failed a short stay in the army and is not and has never been any kind of soldier of fortune. Humor? Stuffing a kid into a locker making them pea on one another and punching one of the kids till his face is a bloody mess. The the bully tries to run the kids down with his car...laughs galore right?That Wilson can waltz into a high school be taken for a sub and immediately start teaching.....now that is funny....being detached from any semblance of reality. For 95 of the film Wilson is punched out by the bully time and again bloodied face and all.

	onyx:emotionText "First and foremost...Wedding Crashers fans need not apply. 81 of Top Rotten Tomato critic's thumbs down got this one spot on.From synopsis to DVD jacket cover this film is touted as the story of 3 HS Freshman nerds who hire soldier of fortune Wilson to protect them from the school's bully. Untrue. Wilson is not a soldier of fortune. Even the interview scene kids interviewing real soldier of fortune types so often the highlight in other films like The Full Monty is utter nonsense here. The thought that any of these 'real' bad asses would interview with 14 year old nerds offering pocket change and no compelling argument plays as absurd as it sounds. At the constant core of this 'comedy' is Wilson's life choice to be a 40 year old homeless highway panhandler who lives in a park and takes naked showers at the beach. He lies cheats and is a thief who steals from the kids home as they give him a house tour. His best buddies are likewise bums and thieves. He failed a short stay in the army and is not and has never been any kind of soldier of fortune. Humor? Stuffing a kid into a locker making them pea on one another and punching one of the kids till his face is a bloody mess. The the bully tries to run the kids down with his car...laughs galore right?That Wilson can waltz into a high school be taken for a sub and immediately start teaching.....now that is funny....being detached from any semblance of reality. For 95 of the film Wilson is punched out by the bully time and again bloodied face and all. Why won't he fight back his 'employers' ask...Because I've never been one with violence...he finally admits. Where some teen comedies are written for teen and adult audiences this film was written with an 'adults need not apply sign' in mind.

	schema:reviewBody "Experiments in the Revival of Organisms 1940  out of 4This film from the Techfilm Studio in Moscow Russia is quite a bizarre one and one that's hard to really judge or rate. Basically what we see is Russian scientists trying to restore life back to a bunch of dead dogs. Early in the film we see their hearts and lungs kept alive but then we move to bigger attempts which includes keeping the head of a dog alive while it's detached from the rest of its body. Finally the scientists remove all the blood from a full dog keep it dead for tenminutes and then try to pump the blood back to try and restore its life. I'm not sure how many people actually watched this thing when it was released but once the Prelinger Archives released it it seemed the flood gates opened in terms of controversy. If you do some reading on the picture there are all sorts of arguments going on about whether what we're seeing is real or fake. I've seen experts say that it's all fake. I've seen experts say that it's all real. I've heard people say why on Earth would anyone want to watch something like this which is a good point because there's no doubt that real animals are being used so the images are certainly going to be very disturbing to most. For the most part I thought the film was very crudely made but this actually helped build up some strange and rather unique atmosphere. This is like a lowbudget movie that just goes for shock value even though the filmmakers were obviously trying to show this as a documentary. The images of the heart's beating and the dog coming back to life was just way too weird and is certainly some of the most bizarre images you're going to see from this era. With all of that said you can't deny that the film contains a certain amount of power simply because of how strange it is. This isn't really a film you can recommend to people but if you're interested then you're almost guaranteed to see something unlike you've seen before.".

Before LOTR's Jackson's biggest financial hit was the Michael J. Fox horror comedy 'The Frighteners' and his biggest critical success being the haunting 'Heavenly Creatures' starring a then notsofamous Kate Winslet. But it wasn't an easy ride getting to be the director of the most anticipated trilogy since Star Wars. Jackson started small very small and clawed his way up the movie ladder using nothing more than pure determination and a raw talent for filmmaking.Jackson's first feature was Bad Taste a low lowbudget horror comedy movie made over two years about aliens killing humans for their fastfood business back in space. No real plot no real actors no real crew. Only an insane imagination and devoted friends willing to help out. There's not even much of a script because what Jackson sets out to do is sicken his audience with some of the most gruesome deaths ever seen and make them laugh until the back of their heads fall off. And he succeeds.Narrative and plot structure are not on the vile menu here. Instead Bad Taste is a testament to sick jokes lowbudget gore and technical brilliance on a shoestring. Jackson made his own steadicam crane and other camera rigs to create the impression of a biggerbudgeted movie he fails to do so unfortunately and even undertook the task of making all of his own makeup and prosthetic effects including mechanised masks and realistic machine guns. This is an even greater achievement when you consider just how much gore there is in the film but the finale in which a huge mansion is rocketed into space defies the rules of its low budget and minimal crew.Even the cast were so minimal that the same aliens can be seen if you look hard enough being killed over and over again throughout the film and Jackson himself takes on two roles the unstable Derek and a mad alien called Robert. In one scene Derek and Robert engage in a clifftop fight with each other balanced precariously on the edge and with no indication that one is a body double. Jackson's creativity and knowledge of movie trickery is undoubtedly on display here but the lowrent sickness and bloody gore on display would suggest otherwise. At first it is hard to imagine that Jackson would go on from this to directing one of the best films of all time but when you look closely examine just what Jackson could do with no money and no crew you begin to realise that a true genius was at work here.Bad Taste is a delirious testament to the 'justgetoutthereanddoit' school of filmmaking as that is literally what Jackson did. Shooting whenever he had the money for film stock and making props and special effects in his parent's garage. Apparently one of Jackson's greatest problems was keeping his actors consistent in appearance over the twoyear period making sure haircuts remained the same and that one actor had a permanent fiveo'clock shadow. Bad Taste is true to the spirit of independent filmmaking one man making the film he wants when he wants and with whom he wants. In fact it would never and could never have been made under the supervision of a studio and even if it had the spirit would have been killed off.Bad Taste works for me because I admire the way in which it is made. When I first saw it I was in my teens and I liked it because it was a demented gruesome funny film so maybe the teen crowd is the right one for Jackson's braineating vomitspewing chuckupathon or maybe it's also for twentysomethings after a night on the lash. Either way Bad Taste should be seen as an example that if you want to make a movie and know how  there is usually a way".

Because Peter Jackson has created one of the funniest splatterfests period especially the hilarious machine gun scene and the pine cone tossing.  It takes a while for the hilarity to start but so did Dead Alive another Jackson great. Enjoy as Derek Ozzy wearing a Tales From the Crypt tshirt and the rest of the boys take on extraterrestrial buggers who've come to Earth in search of meat.

Because Peter Jackson has created one of the funniest splatterfests period especially the hilarious machine gun scene and the pine cone tossing.  It takes a while for the hilarity to start but so did Dead Alive another Jackson great. Enjoy as Derek Ozzy wearing a Tales From the Crypt tshirt and the rest of the boys take on extraterrestrial buggers who've come to Earth in search of meat.

The unmitigated commitment the crew had towards the production of the film really shows as they all must've given their utmost towards not just getting the movie complete but making it look spectacular. Jackson's camerawork and special effects are nothing short of mindblowing and the fastpaced editing really gives this 16mm wonder a bigbudget professional look while still maintaining a goofy campy feel.Sure the acting may be a bit overthetop and the meandering script does seem largely improvised but these shortcomings only add to the picture's fun crazy atmosphere helping to make it even funnier. The soundtrack is oftentimes a little overbearing and awkward as well but again it doesn't in any way detract from the overall enjoyment of the film.

Also throughout the film Derek becomes increasingly demented after having a particularly nasty fall off a 90ft cliff although miraculously surviving this he has a nasty crack on the back of his head which keeps flapping open and letting bits of brain fall out nice and at one point he replaces his emptying skull with an alien's intestines who he has just slaughtered!

It's hard to imagine how Mr. Jackson went from this to incredibly campy comedy of guts and brain chunks to the brilliant Lord of the Rings Trilogy in 20 years but if you take a look at the films he made along the way  Meet the Feebles Heavenly Creatures Dead Alive etc  you will see the common threads.Like most of Jackson's work this film sets out to make the best possible use of the available talent sets and budget and does so with verve. In this case Jackson worked with very little of these three elements and yet managed to pull off a hilarious bit of campy horrorcomedy with remarkable no to low budget special effects and plenty of the slapstick with cow blood and chicken guts that characterizes most of his early films.To describe the plot with more than two or three sentences would require spoilers. In other words there isn't much of one. The film opens with a group of mulleted New Zealand special agent security guys investigating a massacre of an entire village by aliens which first appear to be extras from a living dead movie then later somehow become more intelligent agile and.... inhuman. The film is decorated with an amazing array of creative gore and slapstick death scenes and once the bullets start flying the alien's demonstrate their fatal flaw  they have less talent with guns than the average criminal in a Matt Damon film.To his credit Jackson knew what he could get away with considering what he had on hand and didn't try to make a serious film. The camera work is as always excellent and the makeup compliments the absurdity of the plot quite nicely. The result is hilarious but only if you grock his sense of humor. I would recommend Dead Alive first because it's humor is more literally in your face and obvious. This is definitely worth an evening but unlike the rest of Jackson's repertoire it is a disposable film  worthy of one or two viewings max.".

It's not Manos the Hands of Fate or anything but it's still extremely crude film making wise. Years ago this would have been available to film enthusiasts who spent money and time track down a bootleg copy but now thanks to Jackson's current success the film has been released to mass audience on DVD. It's nice that it's available but unless you're a Peter Jackson completist or a very forgiving genre fan  stay away this probably should have been left in the world of bootleg VHS.Those who are interested in Jackson would be better served by checking out movies like Heavenly Creatures and the Frighteners. If you think you would like to see this movie perform this test first rent Dead Alive which looks like Oscar material compared to this movie if you can stomach that and want more then next you want to go rent Meet the Feebles.

	schema:reviewBody "Goofy and ridiculously exaggerated horrorcomedy obviously made by a group of unprofessional movielovers and friends. Dig this big potatoheaded aliens slice up an entire little town in order to serve them in an intergalactic chain of fastfood restaurants! Four eccentric lowlifes are after them they form a government agency called A.I.D.S  Alien Investigation and Defense Service. Peter Jackson yes THE Peter Jackson desperately tries to hide the fact that he doesn't have the story by showing a whole lot of nasty gunfights and immature butchering. Buy heywho's complaining? Bad Taste is great fun and one of the most hilarious horrorcomedies ever.  Nobody in the cast knows how to act the makeup effects are cheesy and the cinematography is laughable. Jackson himself plays Derek an obsessive freak that constantly has to reinstall his own brain after he lost some cells in a fall of a cliff. There isn't one scary' moment to detect in Bad Taste but the vulgarity and nastinesslevel is pretty high Chainsaw dismemberments crushed skullsyou name it and Peter Jackson shows it! Even drinking someone's fresh vomit is possible in his wicked imagination! As Jackson's budget slowly increased so did his filmmaking skills.

Dig this big potatoheaded aliens slice up an entire little town in order to serve them in an intergalactic chain of fastfood restaurants! Four eccentric lowlifes are after them they form a government agency called A.I.D.S  Alien Investigation and Defense Service. Peter Jackson yes THE Peter Jackson desperately tries to hide the fact that he doesn't have the story by showing a whole lot of nasty gunfights and immature butchering. Buy heywho's complaining? Bad Taste is great fun and one of the most hilarious horrorcomedies ever.  Nobody in the cast knows how to act the makeup effects are cheesy and the cinematography is laughable. Jackson himself plays Derek an obsessive freak that constantly has to reinstall his own brain after he lost some cells in a fall of a cliff. There isn't one scary' moment to detect in Bad Taste but the vulgarity and nastinesslevel is pretty high Chainsaw dismemberments crushed skullsyou name it and Peter Jackson shows it! Even drinking someone's fresh vomit is possible in his wicked imagination! As Jackson's budget slowly increased so did his filmmaking skills.

The filming locations such as the cliff side are all of outstanding natural beauty. Some awesome cinematography. The action is very good compared to the budget n the era. The sheep scene man.

Surely we all have our own opinions and tastes but are we really putting this movie on a par with Halloween Elm Street Frankenstein? What scale are these people really using to judge movies?I first came to Peter Jackson's work through The Frighteners which I actually saw in a theater. I am a big fan of that movie as well as Jackson's work in Dead Alive both of which I'd consider to be among the Top 100 horror movies of all time. So this opinion is not coming from someone who is simply not a fan of Jackson's earlier work or from someone expecting LOTR.I also watch hundreds of low budget horror films so do not disregard this opinion as that of someone who has been tainted by big budget Hollywood horror because in general I do not prefer the big budget films but tend to lean more towards indie and underground horror.All that said because I know the lovers of this film are just going to discount my opinion but so be it. I used to make movies with friends when I was a teenager and we'd show them to our friends for fun. This movie is not much better than any of those were and they were NOT GOOD. The only positive going for this movie is a good level of copious gore and fun splatter. There are certainly plenty of moments of candy colored blood and guts galore which does have a certain charm. They aren't enough to save this movie though which I barely made it through.I've been trying to come up with some verbose way to explain this movie but in reality it boils down to STUPID. This movie is stupid. Plenty of reviews will talk to you of the humor but it's just not there. It's not broad humor. It's not sophomoric humor. It's just dumb humor. The kind of gags that the people making this movie probably thought were hilarious yet failed to bring even a slight chuckle out of me. If you feel that driving a car with Beatles cutouts in the window is laugh out loud then you may find humor. The rest of you will just roll your eyes.There is no plot no acting nothing that actually makes this movie worth its' reputation. Can I credit for imagination? Sure but there are plenty of people on Kickstarter right now with plenty of imagination and that won't make their movies any more watchable than this one is.If you like Troma films then this movie is probably right up your alley. For those of us looking for something a little more cinematic in our horror don't be tempted by the underground rep of this movie. You will be sorely disappointed.".

Sure it's incredibly dumb and tatty but this is one of those films that its so bad that its good entertainment. It looked like they had a great time making the film and it definitely shows on screen. Well the conviction was there since it took Jackson and his pals four years to make this lowbudget splatter and the crew had a whole a lot things to do other than one particular role. Like Peter Jackson who directed cowritten acted edited cinematography and did the special effects. From that it surely does deserve its strong cult status. Everything about it boarders on farcical the performances are truly uninspired or they are just too damn relaxed. It's hard to say if they were mocking themselves as its like they just read the script for the first time and putting no real effort in their lines. Maybe the dialogue was made up on the spot? And those thick accents well they came across as drongos excuse the Australian slang using a lot bad pun and wit. Although the memorable fashion statements takes the cake.

The film is filled with a terrible amount of clichs and homage's but the thrills are top grade. You get overthetop gungho action with brain splattering and body parts flying everywhere! These moments are hilariously setup in a twisted slapstick way. Although the winner of this film is the repulsive gore and decent alien makeup and effects. Which is a big contrast to the pleasantly lush New Zealand scenery! This deliberately idiotic feature mixes gore and comedy to great effect. Highly amusing but definitely not for the faint hearted or squeamish! Jackson went onto to make two more wicked cult films after this the grotesque Braindead and the overly filthy Meet the Feebles.

Forget any sense plot or logical arguments here when you have heads exploding guys drinking vomit and bodies being chopped in half you don't need anything else.I must say that the FX's are impressive old school and very erm nice.Alas taking in consideration the resources and the date this was released you have to give Jackson his credit.Add 1 to my vote if you worship gore.

	schema:reviewBody "Robert Altman has never shied away from casting every actor known to mankind in his films and this is certainly true with his 1993 film Short Cuts a film set in Los Angeles over the course of a couple of days. In terms of primary actors ones that had a substantial enough part to merit a supporting tag I count at least 22 but more impressive than the sheer number of the cast is the fact that the film does not suffer from character overload nor do their intertwining stories and they are all separated by no more than one or two degrees.I started this review by going through each character and the story each brings to the table but after about three paragraphs worth of explanation it is clear that it is not only a bad idea but probably counterproductive to the review itself. Short Cuts is simply about human relationships all of which seem to be completely unhealthy. The beauty of Altman's script and direction is that this isn't imminently apparent in all cases. Something as subtle as a sigh and a minor roll of the eyes speaks volumes in a film this well done. The acting in the film is to be expected great in most cases. Andie MacDowell though not quite as insipid as usual is still pretty bad but gems like Lyle Lovett Peter Gallagher Tom Waits who I am really biased toward and a fairly fresh and new Julianne Moore more than make up for any minor acting mishaps.There are not many films that are so involved that I simply throw up my hands at the prospect of doing my standard summary review for them but Short Cuts is one of them. The script is compelling enough to easily sit through all 187 minutes of the film the ending doesn't disappoint and the film contains a cool jazz score. If you're a fan of ensemble films this should be on your list. If you're an Altman fan this should be on your short list because I consider it to be one of his best. 810 Shelly".

	schema:headline " This then is a rare gem A Hollywood movie of artistic enormity.";
	schema:reviewBody "After watching this film one thing I was left with was a feeling of tremendous euphoria a glowing feeling which lasted well into the next morning.  I could not help but think that this collage of events in the lives of 22 people in sunny LA was realism.  Not the harsh gritty realism of 'Taxi Driver' but a different realism.  This movie is who we are as people.  This movie chronicles the emotions we may have when confronted with a persistent crank caller or the lingering suspicion of a partner's affair. And the acerbic intelligence of the script is tempered with director Altman's stunning technical virtuosity.The style is very pastiche and one scene cuts to another as the title suggests with reckless abandon.  This lends a very fresh and watchable quality to what is by any standards a long film.  While most of the characters never meet the movie is given shape by the connections between scenes.  The connections are of two kinds thematic connections for which the credit goes to the script and also visual connections whereby the direction and editing employed by Altman allow him to create recurring imagery with which he weaves the sprawling kicking constituent bits and pieces of this movie together.  This style works very well indeed and at the end of the film miraculously you are left not with the impression of having just watched a series of 'short cuts' but something entirely more holistic in nature.There was not a false note in the acting and the starstudded cast did great justice to a remarkable script.  The casting is flawless from Tim Robbins' adulterous cop to Julianne Moore's adulterous painter. The camerawork is refreshing in its fluidity and control transmitting an intense watchability. However many feelings there are in the human emotional vocabulary and I am sure there are a fair few it seems that 'Short Cuts' is somehow able in the course of three hours to display in the actors and evoke in the audience each and every one of them.  For those who are of the belief that modern Hollywood is unable to produce films of artistic merit watch this movie now or hold your peace forever.".

	onyx:emotionText "After watching this film one thing I was left with was a feeling of tremendous euphoria a glowing feeling which lasted well into the next morning.  I could not help but think that this collage of events in the lives of 22 people in sunny LA was realism.  Not the harsh gritty realism of 'Taxi Driver' but a different realism.  This movie is who we are as people.  This movie chronicles the emotions we may have when confronted with a persistent crank caller or the lingering suspicion of a partner's affair. And the acerbic intelligence of the script is tempered with director Altman's stunning technical virtuosity.The style is very pastiche and one scene cuts to another as the title suggests with reckless abandon.  This lends a very fresh and watchable quality to what is by any standards a long film.  While most of the characters never meet the movie is given shape by the connections between scenes.  The connections are of two kinds thematic connections for which the credit goes to the script and also visual connections whereby the direction and editing employed by Altman allow him to create recurring imagery with which he weaves the sprawling kicking constituent bits and pieces of this movie together.  This style works very well indeed and at the end of the film miraculously you are left not with the impression of having just watched a series of 'short cuts' but something entirely more holistic in nature.There was not a false note in the acting and the starstudded cast did great justice to a remarkable script.  The casting is flawless from Tim Robbins' adulterous cop to Julianne Moore's adulterous painter. The camerawork is refreshing in its fluidity and control transmitting an intense watchability. However many feelings there are in the human emotional vocabulary and I am sure there are a fair few it seems that 'Short Cuts' is somehow able in the course of three hours to display in the actors and evoke in the audience each and every one of them.

Short Cuts is arguably Altman's finest film with nods to MASH  Nashville The Player and Gosford Park. It's also probably the  best of the subgenre of intertwining vignette films the overlapping  mosaics that Altman trailblazed. It's odd because had I seen Short  Cuts before I viewed P.T. Anderson's Magnolia which I loved upon  first view but not so much the second time around I would've realized  that film was an eerie knockoff of this Altman classicright down to  the casting of Julianne Moore and Jack Lemmon. Magnolia is full of  nervousness operatic melodrama and hamfisted symbolism whereas  Short Cuts is full of smooth transitions hyperrealism and keen  insights into human behavior. I'll take the earthquake at the end of  Short Cuts over the raining frogs of Magnolia any day.  Altman's film runs well over three hours and features nearly twenty  main characters. As such it's one of those movies where everyone will  have their personal favorite bits and characters. I found Lori Singer's  cello playing daughter of a boozehound jazz singer Anne Archer's  empathy riddled clown and Frances McDormand's young son who insists on  telling everyone about how he feels about his toys which are showered  on him in the absence of real love though no one ever pays him any  direct attention to be the most compelling. There's also some great  bits involving a dog and Tim Robbin's adulterous cop and a hilariously  disturbing mix up at a photo hut involving Lilly Taylor and a  fisherman.  With Mr. Altman now passed one wonders will anyone ever be able to  make a film like this again? Surely not. Short Cuts is nothing short  of a masterpiece and a testament to Altman's unique brand of  filmmaking and humanistic view of the misanthropic world he inhabited.".

The majority of the stories have the potential for strong emotions to draw the audience in but the majority don't let it out too much like real life I suppose the one story that does let the characters feel the story of McDowell's child is not that convincing. Some of the stories don't make a lot of sense and don't feel based in reality. Compared to Magnolia Glengarry Glen Ross 12 Angry Men and other ensemble pieces this engages on an interest level but lacks an emotional involvement. I know that this is often on critic's topten lists but I felt that interesting stories and great acting do not make up for the lack of an emotional centre to the film.

The storieschapters themselves would probably have been fine if theyhad been left as individual segments to attempt a little cohesion betweenstories some of Carver's separate characters were fused into oneLily Tomlin who plays the wife in They're Not You're Husband is also the woman who hits the little boy with her car in A Small Good Thingwhy Altman then chose to destroy narrative cohesion WITHIN the stories is beyond me but with so much going on simultaneously it's impossible to follow. Carver's writing motto was No tricks in other words he eschewed gimmicks and clever little devices and instead just wrote honest sometimes brutally frank depictions of life as it is warts and all. Altman's movie is one big gimmick one long pointless trick. It's amazing to me that a movie combining several of my favorite things in the world Raymond Carver Tom Waits Lily Tomlin and a clowncould be so bad!Another IMDB user commented that the movie seemed more like a big party forthe actors then something the viewer can appreciate and this seems to me to be a very apt point.".

Normally understanding that Altman's style is one of using confusion and misunderstandings to move the plot along I was surprised when I reacted so positively to MASH Nashville and The Player but not this.The cast overall is quite good with Robert Downey Jr. and Madeline Stowe giving the best performances along with the great Jack Lemmon in perhaps the scene with the only real emotional pull as he describes the sad truth of why his family broke apart. Everyone else seems lost and misguided floating around in this LA world Altman is exploring without much to do. They act out involving themselves in affairs drugs their children's lives and the simple desire to survive each day but none of it particularly moved me. Even one plot line involving Bruce Davison and Andie MacDowell that should have had great emotional depth has almost none to speak of.I have the greatest admiration for Altman and his ambitious vision of how to create interesting stories and characters. Yet despite many claiming this to be one of his best works I didn't feel at all that it was on par with MASH or Nashville as it seemed to meander and sag heavily in the middle until a final occurrence brought many of the characters together. This may be what Altman wanted the meaningless and accidental nature of many of life's adventures that nevertheless still affect us. However I wish it would have been made more cinematically stimulating.".

Based on nine short stories by Raymond Carver the film is itself essentially a series of loosely knitted short films each film rather slight on its own but richly rewarding when taken as a whole.Some of the stories in particular are very fun. One for example finds actor Tim Robbins playing a hot tempered police officer constantly at war with the family dog. Another sees Robert Downey Jr playing a make up artist with a fondness for gore Jennifer Jason Leigh playing a phone sex operator with a sexually repressed husband and Tom Waits playing a boozy limousine driver.Typical of Altman Cuts sports a jazzy atmosphere Altman's plot weaving in and out his actors improvising his story lethargically told. With several arguments accidents corpses and tales of infidelity the film makes all the usual points about chance fate abandonment love and loss but upon closer inspection there's some deeper stuff going on as well.For example when one character returns home from a visit to the bakers to buy a cake she finds that her television has been left on. She turns the TV off but is then startled to find her son Casey sitting on the couch. The kid's just been hit by a car. This sequence is repeated later on when another woman gets out of the shower and likewise finds her television on. She's then startled to find her son Chad on the floor eating cake. He's at home because he's been abandoned by his father. Two scenes each with the following elements cake bakery televisions baby shower a literal shower mothers returning home and finding their sons.The positioning of both women and their gestures as they turn their TVs off only to find their sons who shouldn't be home are identical. These scenes are further linked by an angry Tim Robbins kicking out the family dog whilst his wife frets that her baby the dog might get hit by a car. The abandonment of the dog anticipates the abandonment of Chad. The threat of the dog being run over anticipates the running over of Casey.But there's a further relationship between Chad and Casey. Chad's father a respectable news reporter was himself abandoned by his father as a child on his birthday. And Casey's father and Chad's father are further linked by the fact that one reports the other's news. Likewise Doreen the woman who hits Casey with her car serves Chad in her bar the next day.Not only are the character's lives affected by coincidence and chance but they represent one another in different circumstances. The film is a giant what if?. Taken apart the stories are relatively insignificant. It is only when we interact one scene with another that meaning is found. It is this play of difference that makes Short Cuts so rich. Meaning is found only in relation and opposition to something else. But what's more it's the audience's responsibility to make all the film's connections. To find the short cuts between one point and another.When Altman has a character played by Julianne Moore say I think they're about seeing and the responsibility that goes with it when speaking about her art he's communicating directly to his audience. Short Cuts knows the world is simply too big to talk about. Too vast limitless filled with infinite possibilities and masses upon masses of intercontextual layers. The world is rife with association movement meetings upon meetings. Put the world under a microscope and Short Cuts is what you get. Seemingly random but ultimately not. At the same time it is about all the associations that we miss in life. Upon first viewing the stories are all disconnected and only superficially linked. It's our responsibility to see beyond the superficial.910  Long before Short Cuts Altman's films anticipated the mosaiclike plots of similar films by the likes of Anderson Sayles Haggis Kasdan etc. He's still the undisputed master of this sort of stuff though. Worth multiple viewings.".

The world is rife with association movement meetings upon meetings. Put the world under a microscope and Short Cuts is what you get. Seemingly random but ultimately not. At the same time it is about all the associations that we miss in life. Upon first viewing the stories are all disconnected and only superficially linked. It's our responsibility to see beyond the superficial.910  Long before Short Cuts Altman's films anticipated the mosaiclike plots of similar films by the likes of Anderson Sayles Haggis Kasdan etc. He's still the undisputed master of this sort of stuff though. Worth multiple viewings.";

It's really hard to explain what Short Cuts is about  or is it really about anything?  Like most Altman films  Short Cuts has a voyeuristic feel to it.  It feels like we are eavesdropping on the most private moments of people's lives.  With over 22 main characters  that's a lot of people to get to know but Short Cuts manages to make a memorable character out of every one of them.  This is a truly great film.  My favorite performance in the film Either Lyle Lovett the baker or Tim Robbins as the cop.  Also features full frontal nudity by Julianne Moore.  This movie has everything.".

Here is where Nancy Sinatra comes in as the IRS agent responsible for seeing he makes restitution for the 145K that he owes. That is a huge amount for 1968. My parents bought a four bedroom house that year for 20.5K At first Nancy is all business but since this an Elvis movie she softens up and they fall in love. There are a lot of girls and songs as is too be expected. I found this to be a pretty nice movie and definitely one the better Elvis ones. As most know he did make a couple of dogs!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "The King completed this final entry in a series of strictly formulaic virtually cookiecutter musical movies before shifting gears a little! into more varied fare. Here he is cast as he was several times prior as a race car driver this time stock cars. He's highly successful at it so it comes as a surprise when he realizes he owes the government a large sum of back taxes! It turns out his manager buddy Bixby hasn't exactly been handling his finances with the best of care. On hand to investigate Presley and to facilitate a budget for him to live on is frosty but attractive Sinatra. He finds little luck in getting her to release his own purse strings but does make some degree of headway in the romance department but not without some misunderstandings. Presley looks great and sports a couple of iconic looking jackets with white racing stripes on them. He's in good voice too and manages decent chemistry with his female love interest. Sinatra performs a solo and is the only artist who ever had his or her solo included on an original Presley soundtrack album but otherwise just has a little bit to sing in one of his numbers. An actual duet between the two would have been terrific to see and hear. Sinatra's clothes range from far out to strangely dowdy and viewers will marvel at her interestingly highlighted hair. Bixby is quite over the top and has hair problems of his own. It's lightened to a rather icky shade. Gordon best known for his TV work with Lucille Ball plays Sinatra's boss and has little to work with though he does appear in a production number at the IRS office. Other cast members include Schallert as a hard up widowed friend of Presley's who has five very young daughters and an underused Hagen as a rival racer. Ponce a supporting player on TV's Hawaiian Eye appears as comic relief in the pit crew. A few reallife stock car racers appear very briefly as themselves. There's also an eyecatching diner run by Ballantine in which guests are served in converted cars. The typical assembly of buttswinging vividly attired dancers is also present. It's the typical undemanding fluffy contrived type of film that simultaneously made Elvis and sent his film career into the toilet. Everything is clean colorful and pretty which looking back at it from today is refreshing. It's just a shame that it's also awfully predictable plodding and pedestrian as well.".

NASCAR stars such as Buddy Baker and Richard Petty did the driving and it looks very real at least until we see Elvis in close up in front of an obvious rear projection screen.

Once again Elvis is playing a racing driver  this time Nascar ace Steve Grayson  who is racking up a small fortune but unbeknown to him his friend and dodgy accountant Bill Bixby Kenny hasn't been declaring it all and has even been losing the cash on horse bets. When Elvis' off track attention is taken by the sexy gorgeous Nancy Sinatra it later turns out she's an employee for the IRS monitoring his every earning and reporting it back to Uncle Sam hence the reason for fun song and funny scene He's Your Uncle Not Your Dad After being hauled in to see the tax man it turns out Grayson and Kenny owe the government close to 50000 thus losing their lavish lifestyle in it perhaps a bit nudgenudge winkwink to his real life persona Grayson generously donates large sums of money and cars to struggling individuals whom he believes to be decent people. I suppose if you were going to be critical there isn't really a point to 'Speedway'. Elvis never recoups all the money he owes the government in the movie and he doesn't even win the big race at the end in this Movie  he gets collected and taken off the track by two lapped cars tangling...but nevertheless it's still a really good entertaining movie with some great dialogue better humour and a more modern feel than any other Elvis movie in the 60's up to this point Viva Las Vegas excepted! and the chemistry between Elvis and Bill Bixby is good. Elvis looks fantastic in 'Speedway' too. It was filmed shortly after his wedding to Priscilla in 1967 and he really looks great  as does Nancy Sinatra who is quite possibly Elvis' closest opposite AnnMargret aside. Not the best of actresses by her own admission but stunningly beautiful and in Your Groovy Self she sings arguably the song of the film. It's a tough call between that and Let Yourself Go which is one of my Top 10 Elvis songs. Bill Bixby is also good in this I thought...despite being a sleazy lech and not a particularly good friend to have around!!".

Unfortunately Bixby's character messes everything up for Steve Grayson Elvis by betting Steve's money on the horses instead of paying for those things Elvis bought for his friends and besides makes an outrageous tax claim form for Steve with deductions such as perfumed record albums and 4000 for air? Oh yes! Lucille Ball's Mr. Mooney was kinda funny too and was excellent for the role of the head IRS agent R.W. Hepworth. When I first saw this movie in the theater I cracked up at the He's Your Uncle Not Your Dad! sequence. It was funny it was cool. Just everything about Speedway is superbly exciting. But what else could you expect out of a movie that stars the king of rock and roll! And lets not forget Nancy Sinatra who is more than just the icing on that cake. It's not everyday you see such a gorgeous tax collector.  I give this film a perfect A. It's just loaded with the stuff! Speedway is an honest to goodness must see.".

	schema:reviewBody "The King gets together with fast cars and Nancy Sinatra in this romantic comedy about the exciting worlds of stock car racing and tax evasion. In Speedway Elvis plays Steve Grayson a successful race car driver who's generous to a fault. Bill Bixby plays the girlchasing managerbest friend who gambles away all their winnings. Nancy plays Susan Jacks an IRS agent who's assigned to collect the astronomical taxes that have accrued. But the fun never begins.Speedway came out a year after Nancy's Number One hit Somethin' Stupid a duet with her famous dad Frank. But this film's attempt to pair her with Elvis fails miserably. Nancy's parched personality and juiceless acting makes Elvis look like Brando. And there should have been more than enough cinematic proof by this point that stock car racing never looks interesting on the big screen. It's hard to believe that this rather passive Elvis is on the verge of making his celebrated '68 comeback. On a more pleasant note This was Nancy's swan song to feature film making.".

	onyx:emotionText "The King gets together with fast cars and Nancy Sinatra in this romantic comedy about the exciting worlds of stock car racing and tax evasion. In Speedway Elvis plays Steve Grayson a successful race car driver who's generous to a fault. Bill Bixby plays the girlchasing managerbest friend who gambles away all their winnings. Nancy plays Susan Jacks an IRS agent who's assigned to collect the astronomical taxes that have accrued. But the fun never begins.Speedway came out a year after Nancy's Number One hit Somethin' Stupid a duet with her famous dad Frank. But this film's attempt to pair her with Elvis fails miserably. Nancy's parched personality and juiceless acting makes Elvis look like Brando. And there should have been more than enough cinematic proof by this point that stock car racing never looks interesting on the big screen. It's hard to believe that this rather passive Elvis is on the verge of making his celebrated '68 comeback. On a more pleasant note This was Nancy's swan song to feature film making.";

I was pleasantly shocked to see how much I enjoyed this thing because there's really nothing overly special about it. What I did like was all the race car stuff and this is coming from someone who hates Nascar and all of that stuff. The races were very well photographed and put you right down into the action. Another added bonus was the relationship between Elvis and a little girl who he helps support. There scenes together were very warm and heartfelt. Sinatra also makes for a good costar and the two do nice work together and actually make you feel like you're watching a couple. The songs aren't all that memorable and a couple of them get in the way of some pretty good scenes but this is certainly a major step up from some of the other Elvis films I've watched from this period.".

He embarked on a film career consisting of 33 films from 1956 to 1969 films that did well at the boxoffice but mostly panned critically especially his later films and while he was a highly charismatic performer he was never considered a great actor.'Speedway' is certainly not one of Elvis' worst films it's much better than the likes of 'Double Trouble' 'Paradise Hawaiian Style' 'Clambake' and particularly 'Harum Scarum' and 'Stay Away Joe'. It's also not one of his best either being nowhere near as good as 'King Creole' 'Flaming Star' 'Jailhouse Rock' 'Viva Las Vegas' and 'Loving You' all very good and nearly great films. 'Speedway' has enough to make it watchable but from the film's tagline you'd expect it to kick high gear from the get go but it never really does.There are no qualms to be had with Elvis himself here something that was a good deal of the time not the case in his later films. Here he looks great actually looking in good shape and energetic without than looking under the influence and acts with much more engagement and involvement than in some of his late 60s films where he looked like he couldn't be bothered.Bill Bixby is very entertaining if at times a bit too manic and his friendly and charming rapport with Elvis has genuine spark and is one of 'Speedway's' high points. Gale Gordon William Schallert and Carl Ballantine also give good support. In comparison to the soundtracks of other later Elvis films 'Speedway' doesn't fare too awfully while also not exceptionally. The title song is catchy and there are two particularly good songs Let Yourself Go and Nancy Sinatra makes a hit out of the sexy and groovy Your Groovy Self. There are a few amusing moments too.Nancy Sinatra however goes through the motions and judging from her indifferent and annoyedlooking presence throughout it looked like she wanted to be elsewhere only in Your Groovy Self does she lighten up. Her chemistry with Elvis is at best icy. Luckily none of the songs here are disposable and there are none also that reach rock bottom status but two or three songs aside they are rather forgettable and He's Your Uncle Not Your Dad epitomises take it or leave it. The children are cute but their scenes are rather cloying and overenthusiastic threatening to slow the momentum down.Director Norman Taurog has moments where confidence comes through but too often it's unsteady and at best perfunctory. Which does affect the comedy which mostly falls flat as a pancake due to being at times overengineered and much of the time undercooked and the racing which is mostly unexciting due to the cheaplooking stock look and the crippling predictability. One doesn't see an Elvis film for the story that was obvious right from the beginning with a few well done exceptions 'King Creole' 'Flaming Star' but here the story is paper thin and contrived.Overall watchable but not much more than that. 510 Bethany Cox".

We were deep in the flower power era by 1967 and Elvis was ceding his top spot to the lads from Liverpool and their imitators.The one thing about Elvis films were was that the whole film was sold on the personality of its star. If it was a good script with an intelligent story line that was gravy. Easy Come Easy Go was a steak tartar of a film.No hit songs came out of this movie but Colonel Tom Parker as he always did made sure the King was always given a good supporting cast of veteran Hollywood players. In this case we have two of the best. Elsa Lanchester has a brief bit as a yoga instructor who literally ties the King in knots. And she even sings a line or two with Elvis. Not a duet combination anyone would ever have dreamed.Also Frank McHugh plays Captain Jack who owns a marine supply store who's never been to sea. Mr. McHugh graced just about every other Warner Brothers film during the hay day of the studio system and was always a welcome whimsical presence. He's no less welcome here in what turned out to be his feature film swan song. McHugh's problem is that he gets seasick in a row boat. Elvis is a Navy Seal who on his last day in the service discovers some buried treasure at the same time some other folks have. He enlists the help of his former partner Pat Harrington Jr. and McHugh in trying to get to the treasure. Of course Elvis has a couple of girls after him Dodie Marshall and Pat Priest. It's pleasant and entertaining enough but not up to the standards of stuff like Blue Hawaii or Jailhouse Rock for Elvis.".

This makes for a fairly compelling story line.Of course there are plenty of pretty girls. The cast was wonderful.

Hats off to William Margulies for his incredible Cinematography. The scenery and settings were wonderful. The underwater scenes were very well done. This was a tough shoot. The credit goes to underwater photographer Michael J. Dugan.The drawback in this film was the Yoga scene. This has to be one worst scenes ever shot in film history. What was John Rich thinking? For that matter what was film editor Archie Marshek thinking. This was a no brainer. That scene should have been cut. I really believe that if it wasn't for that one scene This would be one of Elvis' best. It was really that good. Well acted and Elvis looked like he really cared.

I love seeing him  he had such an incredible voice presence and energy but what a waste as far as his films. Had he not been tied to Colonel Parker filmwise he could have done some interesting roles.I'd say let's not dwell on the past but unfortunately with Elvis it's all we've got. Easy Come Easy Go was one of his last films and it was made during the hippie movement so Elvis has to deal with a lot of free spirits. He's after some underwater salvage and he has competition. There's the story right there.There is a yoga class headed by Elsa Lanchester who sings a little song  I guess at this point they threw everything but the kitchen sink into these films to make them bearable. Frank McHugh turns in the best performance of the film. He's wonderful and very funny in what would be his last film. Elvis is charming of course although by 1967 doing these films was a painful and angrymaking experience for him. The songs are terrible  my understanding is that Colonel Parker figured out by the mid60s that the lower the budget the more money he made so apparently there were no songs written expressly for the movie.Elvis could have been in Midnight Cowboy or the Streisand remake of A Star is Born but the Colonel was afraid of losing control of him and Elvis was afraid to leave. Colonel Parker was his lucky charm. Colonel Parker had given him all his success. Colonel Parker was taking 50 of everything Elvis made. Colonel Parker made Elvis a slave to the Hilton Hotel because he kept telling the management to take his gambling debts out of Elvis' deal. Colonel Parker wouldn't look at Elvis' dead body but took Vernon aside and made him sign a document that the court later negated since it was detrimental to Lisa Marie's inheritance. Yes Colonel Parker was a prince. This movie is just one example of everything he did for Elvis.".

A lot of the songs relate directly to the film's story. There are a number of very amusing novelty songs. For example Elvis' friend has a love machine that is basically a big wheel of fortune with different girls' names and pictures on it. Elvis sings a song about the wheel it's very amusing.

There are also some impressive underwater sequences here Easy Come Easy Go is a little more visually compelling than other Presley flicks around this time. The songs are few but pretty good 6 in total and many have commented on Yoga is as Yoga Does as Elvis's most embarrassing moment on film. Personally I think nothing can top his singing to the dogs in Paradise Hawaiian Style but I also think the Yoga moment here is pretty funny and the song OK in a cheesy sort of way. You gotta admire how the King was a professional through and through and pulled this off and manages to be funny as well in his bungled Yoga attempts.".

The songs are few but pretty good 6 in total and many have commented on Yoga is as Yoga Does as Elvis's most embarrassing moment on film. Personally I think nothing can top his singing to the dogs in Paradise Hawaiian Style but I also think the Yoga moment here is pretty funny and the song OK in a cheesy sort of way. You gotta admire how the King was a professional through and through and pulled this off and manages to be funny as well in his bungled Yoga attempts.";

As for Elvis he isn't horrible here but there's not too much to the performance. He seems a bit livelier here than in the previous picture I watched but he's still a long way off from an actual good performance. The title track and The Love Machine are pretty good tunes but Yoga Is As Yoga Does is pretty embarrassing.

	schema:reviewBody "EASY COME EASY GO is another winning entry in Elvis' annals of entertainment.Elvis was customarily charismatic and endearing but I also credit his costars for making the movie a winner. Film veteran Frank McHugh enjoyed a large role as the charming Captain Jack former kiddie show host now proprietor of a marine goods store who outfits the treasure hunters. I appreciated how Elvis movies frequently cast older stars bridging the generation gap.Pat Harrington as Judd Whitman was a more mature and savvy sidekick to Presley than the young and carefree Gary Lockwood and Jack Mullaney of earlier pictures. Harrington was integral to the story not just tackedon as a foil or for comic relief. His Easy GoGo club was the hub of the film's onshore action and site of two of the film's best songs The Love Machine and I'll Take Love. Harrington was a hardworking actor at this time appearing in everything from THE MAN FROM UNCLE to F TROOP and voicing both the Inspector and DeuxDeux in a popular series of DepatieFreling cartoons.Harrington had also appeared on two episodes of THE MUNSTERS working alongside our film's femme fatale Pat Priest who proves herself to be a wow in a bikini as well as adept at playing a bad girl. Priest's Dina Bishop is a rich girl like Laurel Goodwin's character in GIRLS! GIRLS! GIRLS! but unlike goodhearted Laurel Dodge Dina Bishop is a wanton and a wastrel frittering away her time and money in idle pursuits and attracting selfserving hangers on like Gil.Skip Ward as Gil was convincing as Dina's kept man pinched of face and simmering with anger and resentment for the Navy man who has caught his girl's wandering eye. Gil has a good scene with Captain Jack playing on his vanity by telling him how much his children loved his old kiddie show. He's as much a manipulator as the devious Dina! I did a feel a moment's passing sympathy for Gil at the end when in the face of defeat Dina's so good a sport about it. She could afford to be. But for Gil that treasure could perhaps have bought his independence from Dina.Dodie Marshall as Jo Symington fell shy of being the film's heroine. At one time she was rich and still lives in a mansion but like Dina is living a carefree and idle life dancing barefooted in the Easy GoGo and playing hostess to a menagerie of misfits weirdos and wouldbe artists. One dumps a cauldron of spaghetti onto a couple kissing atop a VW Beetle while another rolls bikiniclad girls covered in paint across a canvas. Elvis already a man from a different era raises a mocking eyebrow at this brave new world that has such people in it. Jo the barefooted beatnik claims to disdain money until she learns of the sunken treasure when she suddenly turns into Scrooge McDuck and persuades Ted Judd and Captain Jack to turn over their shares of the booty to help build her dreamedof arts center.I never warmed to Jo but I liked the actress Dodie Marshall and was sorry to see she had such a short acting career albeit one highlighted by two Elvis movies. Pat Priest provided the commanding presence and the feminine pulchritude shining in living color like she never could on THE MUNSTERS. Director John RichpostGILLIGAN'S ISLAND and preALL IN THE FAMILYknew how to photograph Priest with a slightly upward angle that really showcased her awesome beauty.Love it or loathe it virtually everyone mentions Yoga is as Yoga Does. Me I loved it. I sure didn't expect Elsa Lanchesterthe Bride of Frankenstein herselfto break into song and for Elvis to accompany her in a delightful duet. It was a funny song and scene and a testimony to Elvis' ability to laugh at himself and to be the butt of a joke. Speaking of butts I wish today's tightcheeked yogis and yoginis traipsing across strip mall parking lots with their mats cushions and water bottles would watch this clip and enlighten up.A song rarely mentioned is Sing You Children which Elvis croons to clear a path through the partygoers. Its a Spiritualstyled number referencing Jonah and appropriately Moses parting the Red Sea as he Judd and Joa latterday Moses Aaron and Miriamcleave a path through the press to the door. It's a catchy number and one that reflects Elvis' Christian faith and lifelong love for hymns and gospel songs.EASY COME EASY GO is easy on the eyes and goes down easya feelgood happyending movie with welcome faces and great songs. Discover this lesserknown Presley treasure if you haven't already. A splendid time is guaranteed for all to quote some other singers circa 1967.".

Wallis' indifference was largely due to the fact that Elvis movies were no longer big boxoffice. Rich who knows what his problem was but he kept Elvis in the frogman suit in unbearable heat for a ridiculous amount of time. Besides these problems Easy Come Easy Go was just another of the horrible plot less teenybopper musicals that Elvis had already long grown to despise and there's really nothing else to distinguish this from the others. Well one thing during the final song 'I'll Take Love' which can be described as somewhat listenable for a flash of a second a look of disgust and anger passes over Presley's face. This in itself raises the rating from less than one star to two.".

Rich who knows what his problem was but he kept Elvis in the frogman suit in unbearable heat for a ridiculous amount of time. Besides these problems Easy Come Easy Go was just another of the horrible plot less teenybopper musicals that Elvis had already long grown to despise and there's really nothing else to distinguish this from the others. Well one thing during the final song 'I'll Take Love' which can be described as somewhat listenable for a flash of a second a look of disgust and anger passes over Presley's face. This in itself raises the rating from less than one star to two.";

	schema:reviewBody "Elvis Presley was a hugely influential performer with one of the most distinctive singing voices of anybody. He embarked on a film career consisting of 33 films from 1956 to 1969 films that did well at the boxoffice but mostly panned critically especially his later films and while he was a highly charismatic performer he was never considered a great actor.As far as Elvis films go 'Easy Come Easy Go' really isn't one of Elvis' best. It is nowhere near on the same level as 'King Creole' 'Flaming Star' 'Jailhouse Rock' 'Viva Las Vegas' and 'Loving You'. In fact am of the opinion that most of his late 50searly 60s films were decent some better than that with 'Kissin' Cousins' being his first mediocre at beat effort. At the same time 'Easy Come Easy Go' while in the weaker end in his films ranking is more watchable if only just than 'Harum Scarum' 'Paradise Hawaiian Style' and his later films.There are things that keep 'Easy Come Easy Go' afloat. The supporting do quite well with what they have. Frank McHugh comes off best in a sincere and playful performance while Pat Harrington has some amusement and Dodie Marshall some charm.Didn't think hugely of the songs this time around but I'll Take Love and the title song are lovely and fun. The underwater sequences are quite nicely shot and hold more attention than other areas of the story.However John Rich directs strangely unsteadily and like he was merely fulfilling some kind of contract. Got the same feeling too with Elvis his earlier performances were much more charismatic and enthusiastic with a grittiness and emotion too but from mid60s onwards he clearly started looking bored and uninterested and like he didn't trust or even like his material. While not as badly as his previous four films or so or later that is the sense one gets here watching Elvis in 'Easy Come Easy Go'. Elsa Lanchester is pretty much wasted in a scene that is as far from worthy of her talent as one can get.Not that one can blame them entirely for lack of interest when the material is barely passable at best and sometimes risible catering solely seemingly to hardcore Elvis completests. While the songs generally serve a point instead of being thrown in they are not particularly well recorded and with rather poor lyrics. Yoga is as Yoga Does has often been considered one of the worst scenes in an Elvis film and one can definitely see why very poorly written garishly shot and Elvis clearly looks demeaned.Story here is virtually unfathomable and like it was made up as it went along. Very rarely is there any punch with so much of the action being tentative. Worse is the writing especially in the humour with the embarrassing hippie scenes and jokes that would have been out of date and tasteless even in 1967 let alone now did they really need to plumb to lower depths to integrate antibeatnik jokes?. Apart from the underwater sequences while there are cheaperlooking Elvis films out there the production values do have a lowbudget made for TVlook to them and cheapened further by the nauseating garishness.Overall not awful but not particularly good if it weren't for the few things that kept things afloat 'Easy Come Easy Go' would have sunk without much of a trace. 410 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "There is a new genre infesting our nation's movie theaters. With apologies to Garrison Kellior let's call it guy noir. Films aimed directly at the young hip male audience. Movies that are an unholy combination of old fashioned film noir and the modern action movie as directed by the class clown. They offer fast paced entertainment great character actors twisty plot lines explosions and more spent ordinance than used in a typical week in Baghdad. Even new genres breed clichs however and the original freshness heralded by Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction is beginning to smell the slightest bit stale. This brings us to Smokin' Aces a movie that isn't so smug as to be intolerable or so brilliant as to be ground breaking. Rather it is good competent workmanlike example of its genre which is bad news for a movie that wants to be hip and edgy.Smokin' Aces has the requisite twisty plot. Actually it has at least nine plots all twisty. In fact it has so many plots the movie dissolves into a series of incidences strung together by a smattering of narrative glue. Aces a card magician and mob nabob turns federal stoolie and a dying Godfather posts a high dollar contract on him. Naturally every photogenic hitman with the weekend free descends upon Ace's casino penthouse to do the job and collect the dough. Smokin' Aces tries hard and includes everything needed to qualify as guy noir. It even tries to incorporate the Tarantino Digression. That is extended expository flashbacks incorporated for no good reason except that they are fun to watch. Smoking Aces can't quite pull these off as they require a defter touch than the movie is capable of.There aren't any real people in Smokin' Aces. All the characters are strictly stereotypes played for effect rather than reality. Jeremy Piven as Aces is the self loathing hop head Alicia Keys and Georgia Sykes are the hot lesbian hit team Ben Afleck is the hipster bounty hunter and so on. Everything you need to know about these guys you learn in the first split second they are on the screen. There is no star in Smokin' Aces. Afleck the biggest name has a relatively small part and is upstaged by his hat. You might remember Chris Pine Kevin Durand and Maury Sterling as the Tremor brothers if only because they were the loudest most violent bunch in a loud violent movie. The only actor who rises above caricature is Ray Liotta who invests his FBI agent with quiet dignity and a touch of pathos and in doing so sticks out like a sore thumb. It takes a strange sort of movie for a review to criticize the one genuinely good performance in it but Liotta just doesn't fit.Smokin' Aces manages to hold its whirly gig self together for the most part. There are a few problems. It goes on too long after the climatic blood bath wrapping up plot threads you probably didn't notice amongst the explosions. There is a denouement where a hero brought in from way out in left field makes an existential choice that is not nearly as agonizing as the movie thinks it is because we have no emotional investment in the fellow making it. Though the final plot twist is prepared for and makes as much sense as anything else in the film still it feels flat and unsatisfying. Think of Smokin' Aces as a shaggy dog story. It's long involved and fun to listen to but ultimately goes nowhere.".

There is a plot about around 5 different flavors of assassins and hit men competing for a 1m contract on an FBI informer Buddy Aces Israel a sure recipe for carnage. There is a deeper plot than that but i wont go into detail as it will spoil the overall plot as there is a very major twist.There are a number of big names in this film so the acting is superb and there are many scenes which left me both laughing and intrigued.Again i must stress that if you go into this film expecting anything other than a fun exhilarating action movie not to be taken seriously then you will miss the whole point as many other reviewers have this is definitely a comedy. A great fun film for the lads.".

	onyx:emotionText "If you haven't seen this film id better point out which many people have missed in their reviews or ignored is that this film is a comedy it is not in any way meant to be taken seriously.With that in mind it is a thoroughly entertaining movie. There is a plot about around 5 different flavors of assassins and hit men competing for a 1m contract on an FBI informer Buddy Aces Israel a sure recipe for carnage. There is a deeper plot than that but i wont go into detail as it will spoil the overall plot as there is a very major twist.There are a number of big names in this film so the acting is superb and there are many scenes which left me both laughing and intrigued.Again i must stress that if you go into this film expecting anything other than a fun exhilarating action movie not to be taken seriously then you will miss the whole point as many other reviewers have this is definitely a comedy. A great fun film for the lads.";

Compared to testosterone treats like Jason Statham's pair of Transporter stints this one offers a more complicated plot fewer explosions and chases but more gruesome killings.

Carnahan careens among multiple arenas of plotting with FBI briefings filling in the audience and their agents on some of the players they're about to face building to the inevitable chaos of competing factions converging on Piven and his legion of bodyguards in what promises to be a dazzling display of carnage and comedy. The reality comes pretty close with a couple of cool surprises along the way.Unfortunately Carnahan like a certain US President who comes to mind crafted his superb attack without a viable exit strategy. After the cosmic convergence there's more exposition and anticlimactic winddown than anyone needed or the preceding frenzy deserved.Enjoy the movie fellas. But for those who wait or doubledip expect the DVD's extras to include at least one alternate ending and several bloody andor sexy deleted scenes that were axed for optimal running time rather than lack of titillation.".

	schema:headline " A movie you want to like... but just can NOT!";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie should get high marks for its style but everything about its style that is likable was ripped off from Guy Ritchie. The plot is sooo out there that I can only imagine that the writer director... producers and pretty much every studio exec was doing more blow than the characters in the film. I got the distinct feeling that the ending was done in reshoots. There are only two main characters in the entire ending. And the ending is basically Andy Garcia reading you the reveal as one gigantic paragraph. Something tells me this was not the original ending.At its best the movie is a psychedelic postmodernist romp through the crime genre. All the usual washouts and degenerates from the Mickey Spillane novels are here but they have a 21st century spin to them. High high marks for Jason Bateman. His cameo appearance is almost worth the price of admission. The violent scenes are pretty much the best part of the film and some of them are genuinely tense. But they are filled with glaring holes. Time and again cops and security guards fail to follow basic precautions and wind up getting killed for it. Alicia Keys and Ryan Reynolds are miscast. Andy Garcia! Holy cow what does he call that accent? SouthernBoston.Most of the pivotal events of the film are based around happenstance and freak luck. Without getting into the details the ending is unbelievably hack and unimaginative. Put it this way the emotional core of the story is based around a character that we never meet except in flashbacks. And the inciting incident of the film the hit being put on Israel appears to have been a giant misunderstanding. the guy said they wanted Israel's heart. They construed that to mean they wanted him dead. But who put the million dollars in a swiss bank account and told every hit man in the Western Hemisphere that they could have it for killing him? Makes no sense What a rip off!!High Points 1 Jason Bateman is AMAZING in fact I swear that when he is slapping highfives in the hotel room Ben Affleck is struggling to keep a straight face. 2 The NeoNazi characters even though it felt as though they had been lifted from Big Lebowski and The Road Warrior. Their malevolence is so gleeful that it's contagious. 3 Jeremy Piven's cokedout paranoid Israel. If there is a shred of human emotional core to this film this is it. He nails the character both megalomaniacal and insecure. As his situation becomes increasingly desperate he sinks further and further into selfdelusion. The camera trains on his eyes and Piven somehow builds a universe of frailty inside. It's wonderful.Low Points 1 Andy Freakin' Garcia yeesh!. Speaking of a universe of selfdelusion. Watching an actor slip in and out of an accent is like listening to a guitarist play outoftune. But it is clear that Andy Garcia is utterly convinced of his own prowess. Sad. 2 Guy Ritchie ripoffs everywhere 3 Movie begins and ends with tons of back story given in paragraph form. Always a bad sign. 4 The sense of time is extremely distorted I swear the skinheads were riding the elevator up to the penthouse for twenty minutes 5 The cops and security guards in this movie are only one step above Keystone Cops. Bumbling idiots who fall for the flimsiest deceits. 6 There are at least five characters who take a ton of bullets and somehow live through it. And when I say a ton of bullets I'm talk ten to twenty at point blank range. One is difficult to believe but it happens over and over again. 7 Everything about Alicia Keys' exit from the building is contrived and impossible to believe. 8 The writer and director seem to treat story like style and style like story. The story behind this movie is confusing at best and ridiculous and contrived at worst and serves only as a silly excuse to get Nazis and Lesbians and cokeheads and crossdressers together for an orgy of violence and cool dialog.".

No one set of actors though gets above the others and in doing so you have multiple stories in the film tied into the whole premise of the film. Acting is great by the general assemble which includes fine performances by Andy Garcia and Ray Liotta.Problematically the film tries to be too cool at the start and reminds me too much of Things to do in Denver.... and so on. In addition the film is really confusing at points but is worth persevering with nevertheless. The complexity makes it very original and you never know where its going but it wraps up together in the last 30mins which are more than worth the cinema ticket alone.No classic but enjoyable original and interesting overall..".

FBI agent Donald Carruthers Ray Liotta  his partner Richard Messner Ryan Reynolds are assigned to go to Lake Taho where Israel is hiding in the penthouse of the Newton Hotel the race is on between various freelance assassins seeking the one million payout bondsman Jack Dupree Ben Affleck after Israel for a skipped bond reward  the FBI as to who gets to Israel first. As people die it becomes clear to agent Messner that there is much more going on than a simple witness protection case...This American British  French coproduction was directed by Joe Carnahan  to me is a British gangster flick wannabe Smokin' Aces felt like an attempt to make a Guy Ritchie flick the US  while it's not a complete loss I must admit I didn't like it as much as many seem to. I found the script unnecessarily complicated not complicated because I couldn't follow or understand it but complicated because at heart Smokin' Aces is a pretty simple film. A guy named Buddy 'Aces' Israel who has mixed with the wrong people wants to turn witness for the FBI  as such it's straight race between the good guy's  bad guy's to who gets to him first that's really all there is too it  the numerous subplots  character's just slow things down  get in the way. I wouldn't mind so much if Smokin' Aces had the humour  twist's of a Guy Ritchie flick but they don't in fact I was quite surprised at how serious Smokin' Aces takes itself. The amount of character's is another problem there are too many  there are too many unlikable ones particularly that awful black woman with the sniper rifle. There's a lot of early exposition that bogs the film down  it's not always clear who or what is being spoken about the twist ending isn't that great with a rather lame surprise  like the FBI  hospital would leave those two alone in a room together unguarded. At over an hour  forty minutes Smokin' Aces is quite long with only one big action scene  even that is just a shootout the dialogue isn't as sharp or cool or referential or quotable as say a Quinten Tarintino or Guy Ritchie gangster flick you know the ones I mean  I simply didn't care for anyone or anything on screen at any time.There are a few really silly over the top scenes  character's like the three Tremor brother's who surely wouldn't be that hard to track down  find if you were the police? The scene inside the house with the kid  Granny are also silly  feel out of place. The attitude of just about every character here towards everyone else is sheer callousness even Agent Messner when all those FBI guy's get shot the only one he seem bothered about  tries to save is his partner. There's no soul or heart in Smokin' Aces  I found it hard to like  therefore care about anyone. Surprisingly short on action there's one big shootout otherwise it's fairly low key stuff  the film relies more on it's over complicated plot. As an action film there's not enough here  as a thriller it ties itself up in knots.With a supposed budget of about 17000000 this was actually filmed in Lake Tahoe  Las Vegas. It looks nice enough the who feel of the film again tries to duplicate a Guy Ritchie flick with speedups slow motions frame skipping split screen people talking over other scenes flashback revelations impossible camera movements  the whole filming style just screams British gangster thriller. There's a decent cast here with singers Alicia Keys  Common making their acting debuts.Smokin' Aces is a film I didn't like that much sure it tells a story  it has a bit of style but it doesn't add up to much  the lack of action  dialogue heavy exposition slow it down too much too often. Followed by the direct to video sequel Smokin' Aces 2 Assassins' Ball 2010 which I have yet to see.".

The reason he is wanted dead is because of his snitching and deceitful ways. I'm not going to give anything away but once you watch the movie you'll know there's a lot more behind that. Only thing you really need to do is pay as close attention as you can during the beginning because it does get a little confusing. The story moves along pretty quickly but you will get the gist of it.Overall I thought it was very well done. The plot was good the characters were amazing especially Ryan Reynolds and there were some nice action parts. Even though it dragged on a little bit during the middle it was necessary to develop plot details. 9 out of 10 stars from me it was very entertaining and thought provoking.

The trailer probably the best thing about the movie whoever made the trailer is clearly a genius as he managed to make this film look interesting made the movie look like an all out action film. Well it isn't! In fact when there is some kind of action sequence they pull away! I mean there is one scene where you watch the FBI close in on a lift with smoke coming out of it they cut away and later come back to the FBI still watching it it opens they burst out and then........ it cuts away! Im not a person who goes to watch a film for its action but an hour in the film i just wanted some sort of entertainment at least! And people kept dying... then coming back to life! That happened too many timesThe dialogue is appalling! The writer has clearly watched a few gangster movies and a couple of sopranos best series ever and thinks he can write a mafia movie! well he cant! Its very annoying! OK so the story. well in the first 10 minutes you learn that there is a man and everyone wants to either save or kill him. Then.... nothing until the very last 5 minutes. I mean what the hell happened in the middle! it wasn't story or action or entertainment! it was just a build up to nothing or at most some very dull unimpressive scenes !So the acting. ray liotta seriously needs a good script! he is really putting himself down with these movies. Affleck was good as always but once again he needs a decent script behind him. The good thing about this film there are 2 is that ryan reynolds is doing something a little different to his normal gig. And he managed to do something i didn't expect at all he impressed me. He proved that he has potential to be a good actor. The other good thing was a cameo from mathew jack from lost fox. Which i enjoyedAnyway i don't want to end this review on a positive note as i don't want to encourage people to see it at all. This is a boring pointless poorly written movie with no story or emotion that will leave you angry that you had wasted your time watching it".

While it's not a bad movie it's still far from as good as it could have been.I think the movie started out pretty well. It's got an almost Lock Stocklike quality to it where it presents all the main characters in different sequences. After that you feel the stage is set and the guns loaded. Unfortunately then you get the first dip in pace and the movie never really recovers. Sure you get a few laughs and some pretty welldone action scenes. But the pace really never picks up and lives up to the promise of the beginnings.It's difficult for me to put my finger on why i didn't really like this movie. Like i said before it's not bad and it was fairly entertaining. Perhaps my expectations were wrong? I expected something more fastpaced and hysterical while this is a lot more sombre in pace. The good points are the actors not that they're great but most of them are pretty good in their parts and many of them are quite funny. Also the action scenes are pretty well done. The negative parts is that i would have liked more action a quicker pace and a lot less bewildering ending without giving anything away.I think most people who like action movies might like this one. It works pretty well although there are quite a lot of things to improve. I give it a 610.".

Boring.Dialogue  when it could even be heard was uninteresting and served no purpose.I don't think I'm spoiling it when I say there's a huge bloodbath that was not even interestingly choreographed or filmed and that served no purpose If John Woo was dead he'd be spinning in his grave at this insult to bloody shootouts.Even who lived or who died seemed completely random. There was no one to root for.Have I mentioned this was bad? Sure there were a few funny moments with the hick neo Nazis. Jeremy Piven did a great job. It was nice to Ryan Reynolds in a serious role.I've definitely seen worse but this was a waste of time.P.S. the promotional comic that was given away with the film actually has the neoNazi's looking at a list and saying Death to Israel and Destroy Israel.

	schema:reviewBody "Here we have Joe Carnaghan the writerdirector of Narc? They say that human cloning has not yet taken place but this film may be the proof we were looking for. This just can't be the same Joe Carnaghan can it. He must be a doppelganger who has no idea about writing direction and tension.There hasn't been such a jumbled mess on the screen since Revolver and unfortunately both Ritchie and Carnaghan have proved that too many characters doesn't help! However these actors are struggling with a garbled plot which has a twist at the end two in fact which were so see through that they were obvious from the beginning.

He must be a doppelganger who has no idea about writing direction and tension.There hasn't been such a jumbled mess on the screen since Revolver and unfortunately both Ritchie and Carnaghan have proved that too many characters doesn't help!

	schema:reviewBody "Here we are folks. The real start of the year for films has finally begun. Director and screenwriter Joe Carnahan's shoot 'em up adrenaline flick 'Smokin' Aces' starts it all. With its intriguing cast and premise it looked to be something to talk about. Although it has a few decent qualities there's still something missing.Five time entertainer of the year Buddy Aces Israel played by Jeremy Piven has gotten himself into quite a pickle. Associating himself with the crime leaders of the underworld in Las Vegas he became delusional. He started believing he himself was one of them. After many failed schemes Aces decides the only way to get himself out of the mess he's created is to rat out his associates to the FBI. In turn mob boss Primo Sparazza puts a bounty on Aces. One million dollars to be exact. Not only does he want him dead though he wants his heart too. Once word of the bounty spreads hit men and women from all over make their way to Aces' Lake Tahoe hideout hoping to get to him first and get their hands on the one million dollars.At the beginning everything in 'Aces' is a bit of jumbled mess. Back to back flashback narratives explaining everything up until the present do not let up and may cause some viewers to stop and think twice about what was just said. The same thing happens near the end and comes off the same way. This is a film that can't be taken seriously and there's just far too much storyline here. Carnahan tried a little too hard to make it more clever than it needed to be which takes it down a few notches.Obviously though we all know what everyone is going to see this film for the action scenes. They range from good to excellent with none of them being amazing. Some of them are a little too well planned and executed to be seen as believable but that's not an issue really. They're all pretty pleasing and that'll be good enough for most people.What really makes everything all go together and is the actual glue of the film are the characters. They're each interesting entertaining  fun. We have a torture fiend chainsaw wielding brothers a pair of sniper lesbians  a master of disguise. Most appealing would be Alicia Keys'. In her acting debut she demonstrates just the right amount of cool and sexy melded together to make her character Georgia Sykes the vixen sniper in one word awesome. Also just as surprising and also a relief was Affleck didn't I repeat didn't ruin the film. Now I'm not saying he was good either. Just go and see the film and you'll see what I mean Now with all that said there remains to be something missing here. I'm not going to drag out with a couple of jokes what it is either. Plain and simple it's Tarantino. 'Smokin' Aces' looks like it was made from some Quentin Tarantino movie kit. Apparently Carnahan didn't follow the directions correctly. Had Tarantino been the director I think it could've been great. He would have added that little something that only he can that made 'Reservoir Dogs' and 'From Dusk Till Dawn' what they were. At least 'Grindhouse' will be here in a couple of months. Still if you're looking for some high energy fun 'Smokin' Aces' is where it's at.".

I went to the screening and I'm glad that i waited the 45min outside in the 25 degree weather and then another hour inside the movie theater with a bunch of loud people next to me. Trust me...its worth your money and your time. One word of advice though. This movie is not for people with attention problems. You miss one second of this movie or even a word you might miss the whole object of the movie so just be careful. Jeremy Piven Buddy 'Aces' Israel was dramatic as well as freaking hilarious. Ryan Reynolds Agent Richard Messner was also a strong dual character. His comedic presence as well as his strong dramatic performance was enough to make this movie a hit in theaters. The rest of the cast are well known actors who each play there own essential role in the movie and make it that much better. I hope you like the movie and my review. This is my first official review on paper but its not my first time writing reviews or watching movies. The movie comes out in theaters on January 26 2007 so keep an eye out and enjoy.".

Unfortunately for him and everyone he knows it has caught up with him and he now finds himself targeted by all sides and in the hands of the FBI desperately trying to make a deal with them from the security of the penthouse floor of a luxury hotel. However the FBI pick up wind of a hit called in by Sparazza with a strict time limit a 1000000 bounty and cut out Buddy's heart. It is not long before a handful of bounty hunters are heading towards the hotel with one aim  to be the first.On a transatlantic flight during the day I had time for one more film before landing. As I was just trying to relax I was looking for undemanding stuff just to distract and entertain me. The film I watched first was Shooter and I mention this deliberately. Shooter was only an OK film but what it did was lay out its stall and make it very clear what it was going to do and how it was going to do it  not necessarily in terms of plotting but more in terms of style and approach. It wasn't great but it worked. I assumed that Smokin' Aces would do the same as the trailer made it look like a comic hitman film  with hyper filming lots of stars and lots of action.Now if you're thinking that I shouldn't assume then you're right but this is how the film starts and it is how it is at various stages across the film. However it goes from being a bit like Guy Richie freeze frames names on screen etc to being an all out action fest with guns everywhere and people surviving the way that they only do in action films. The suddenly in the final third it decides that it not going to be superficially comic or superficially actionpacked and suddenly seemed to have an emotional side and expected me to care about the characters and their plights  like it had been a serious drama all along although I'm not sure how I'm supposed to take the ADD kid with the erection in that context.In doing this it does still do just about enough to keep a story going but to be honest I started to get bored as it changed tone based on whatever it want to do. Another problem I had with it was the violence  it was very brutal throughout which I don't have a problem with but the mixed tone meant it was confused. With the comic feel the violent death of characters is really jarring likewise with the action section  it just seemed too much and made it hard to enjoy. The final turn of tone actually makes the violence work because the extent of it works when you actually are expected to feel it  however by then it was too little too late.Keeping this in mind it is no surprise that nobody is really that good. Piven goes from ham to tragic figure it is a nice try but the film doesn't go with him and he is left exposed. Reynolds is reasonably good on the level he works on a good presence  I've never seen him in anything that good but I generally like him when I see him. Affleck Berg Garcia Liotta and a few others are solid enough but not anything special. Keys is goodlooking but she is helped by Henson who is sassy and cute at the same time. The real stand out for me was Common. He dropped out of a big tour to make this and I felt bad that he seemed to be going down the rapper goes to Hollywood to be in action movie path. However he is actually one of the few who impressed me not throughout the film perhaps but in the one scene he has with Piven in the bathroom I did think that he showed potential to do more than just be in this sort of thing. Time will tell if he can move away form just being a good looking guy with a deep voice but he did seem in touch with his character here.Overall though the film is nothing to write home about. With an inconsistent approach that sees approach markedly changed abruptly not once but twice the film is hard to stick with. It probably offers enough noise and narrative to please those looking for noise and violence but personally I was disappointed and found it hard to care that much about.".

I was as my summary tagline thing states Thoroughly impressed.I know I gave it a 7 but I honestly cannot think of any gripes and the ones I do are way too minor and end up having a balancing factor.For example the movie doesn't seem to want us to be sympathetic with Aces. The balancing act? It later reveals that you're really not supposed to be.And that's pretty much the rest of the cast too. They act well but you don't really give a damn about any of them BUT THAT'S OKAY.

	schema:headline " Part Tarantino . Part Ritchie . All Crap";
	schema:reviewBody "It's said that if you want to make a great film then keep the premise simple and SMOKIN' ACES has a relatively simple premise of the mob putting a million dollar contract on potential star witness Buddy  Aces  Israel and rival gangs of hit men trying to eliminate both Aces and each other to get their hands on the money . I'm sure we all agree that this is a fairly simple and effective idea for a film . Alas what can often happen is that a writer or a producer can throw a massive spanner in the works by making everything too over complicated This is certainly the problem with this movie . It confuses the audience as to where it's going  has totally ill thought out plotting and totally underdeveloped characters . There's too many characters which means we spend the first twenty minutes of SMOKIN' ACES being introduced to them in a very lazy manner with captions . THE DEPARTED has perhaps too many characters but at no point do we see captions saying  Mob rat  or  FBI informer or  Undercover cop  letting the audience know who these characters are  probably because it's revealed in the narrative what their function is  as SMOKIN' ACES continues you start to realise that there's no cohesive story save for the central premise . What makes it so annoying is that many of the characters are written out of the film between 30 and 60 minutes of its running leaving the audience pondering why they were included in the first place . One character seems to be merely included to set up a  hilarious  scene with a hyperactive kid at some point in the movie . The more SMOKIN' ACES continues the more you realise what an incohesive mess the screenplay is Writer  director Joe Carnahan is more interested in incident rather than narrative which while not exactly making him an auteur could be forgiven if the incidents were well done but they're not and Carnahan seems to suffer amnesia . For example we're told about an international hitman who is so ruthless he bites off his own fingertips in order to stop himself being identified . Do you get it ? Fingerprints can get you identified by law enforcement agencies and a good hitman will do absolutely anything to stop themselves being identified or linked to their crimes by the law . Strange that a couple of scenes later we see possibly he world's greatest hired killer carrying out a hit where he leaves a wheelchair  mask  and weapons at the scene of the crime . I'f he's such a great assassin then why would he leave all that forensic evidence lying about ? If the screenplay owes a lot to Tarantino then the directing owes a lot to Guy Ritchie . We see lots of camera tricks  freeze frame etc but at least Ritchie is able to make a consistent film with a complicated plot . Like the screenplay the directing is often an uneven mess and can be summed in the last ten minutes which has an entirely different mood to the rest of the film . And don't be fooled that this may be a good film to rent due to the  big name  cast . Andy Garcia and Ray Liotta haven't had a big hit for years and SMOKIN' ACES ensures they'll be stuck in straight to DVD obscurity for a lot longer yet . SMOKIN ACES also heralds the death knell of Ben Affleck as an actor since he shows us what he does worst  Playing tough blue collar Irish Americans . I'm not sure how his directing career will go but anything that keeps him away from being in front of a camera will be a blessing . And I doubt if even he could direct a film as dire as SMOKIN' ACES".

	onyx:emotionText "It's said that if you want to make a great film then keep the premise simple and SMOKIN' ACES has a relatively simple premise of the mob putting a million dollar contract on potential star witness Buddy  Aces  Israel and rival gangs of hit men trying to eliminate both Aces and each other to get their hands on the money . I'm sure we all agree that this is a fairly simple and effective idea for a film . Alas what can often happen is that a writer or a producer can throw a massive spanner in the works by making everything too over complicated This is certainly the problem with this movie . It confuses the audience as to where it's going  has totally ill thought out plotting and totally underdeveloped characters . There's too many characters which means we spend the first twenty minutes of SMOKIN' ACES being introduced to them in a very lazy manner with captions .

	schema:reviewBody "This film is TERRIBLE but its almost worth seeing.Allow me to break it down...We are introduced to around 20 characters in the first 5 minutes by each character having a still shot of them with their name and occupation subtitled. In my opinion this is such a nono for a film as it means that the audience cannot properly connect with the characters and learn about them. Another problem that is immediately obvious is the amount of characters once again impossible to connect with them.The film from this point is a downward spiral with poor acting from all including Ray Liotta and of course including Alicia Keyes but worst of all being Ryan Reynolds. Cinematography is also poor with little innovative shots sticking only to basics. However a birds eye shot of the main character Buddy Aces Israel makes an appearance for no reason whatsoever. What really shines through as being the worst part of all is the script coupled with the direction. One particular scene sees around 20 armed officers waiting outside of a lift ready to fire then suddenly three crazed men DANCE out of the lift with guns chainsaws and so on without being shot at once mind you... This part simply looked like a CIRCUS it was a joke  you have to see it to believe it.The ending on the other hand is what made me give this film 2 stars instead of 1. From the outside it looks like a really really poor ending... Possibly the worst you have ever seen! However as Ryan Reynolds pulls those life support plugs from the walls I think that director Joe Carnahan was telling the audience that he was pulling the plug on the film.Quote of the film Ryan Reynolds Angrily Talk to me like a man!".

Great script  a crazy concept well addressed with a script that even now is several notches above the stuff that JJ Abrams is currently peddling. Logic says that a movie about a bunch of idiosyncratic assassins converging on a single target should not work should not make sense but this story strikes just the right balance between sensible and nuts 2. Cast? In this genre probably the largest assortment of stars ever assembled. Credit for not merely trying something new but frontloading it with talent to spare. 3. Direction? As good or better than any martial arts film in other words a very high standard every bullet seems to go somewhere. 4. Ending? Clever attentiongetting and satisfying.

These films tended to sap Elvis of the energy he could have devoted to better films and better roles all of which he was capable of. Having said that some of these films were more tolerable than others.SPINOUT made at MGM is one of the most entertaining thanks to its teaming of Elvis with three colorful and delightful leading ladies all of whom more than hold their own with their charismatic leading man. Deborah Walley plays the tomboyish redhead drummer in Elvis' band and has a secret crush on him Diane McBain plays a sexually voracious bestselling author on the hunt for the perfect American male and Shelley Fabares plays the heiress of an auto fortune who thinks she's entitled to whatever she wants and whose father wants Elvis to race a car for him. In the course of it Elvis encounters rivals for each of the girl's affections leading to a set of romantic entanglements that are ultimately resolved in an inspired and original ending. The plot is packed with lots of clever twists thanks to a script cowritten by Theodore J. Flicker who would write and direct the cult hit THE PRESIDENT'S ANALYST the following year. Fortunately the film's racing angle is downplayed in favor of comic situations and a set of enjoyable songs.The supporting players deserve singling out including Jack Mullaney as Elvis' comical bandmate Carl Betz as Shelley's father a role he played with Shelley on The Donna Reed Show as well Warren Berlinger as Betz's loyal assistant TV cowboy Will Hutchins as a highway cop with a penchant for gourmet cooking and Hollywood veterans Cecil Kellaway and Una Merkel as an elderly rich couple who allow Elvis and his band to take over their house when they go on vacation. This latter touch is representative of the film's Hollywood fantasyland approach to life but it's all so well played by such skilled hands that it's difficult not to get sucked into the fun of it all.".

Presley plays the lead singer of a band that includes Hawkins Mullaney and girl drummer Walley. When millionaire Betz decides he wishes Presley to not only sing for his daughter Fabares' birthday but also to drive his car in an upcoming race a battle of wills begins which results in Presley living next door to Betz and playing cat and mouse with him and his daughter. Meanwhile Walley nurses a crush on Presley and seductive researcher and authoress McBain decides that she too must have Presley as a mate! In between Presley's juggling of the ladies he sings his usual retinue of songs though in this case they tend to be livelier and more engaging than in some of his lesser screen efforts. At this stage in his career Presley was on a cinematic treadmill churning out movie after movie many times with middling results. Here he is fortunate to be working with charismatic people instead of unseasoned starlets as he was sometimes paired with. Fabares does a good job as the spoiled but caring socialite. Walley hams it up and overacts as the tomboyish drummer but at least has pizazz and energy. McBain is sultry and lovely portraying her rather voracious character with a wink and a sparkle. Betz who had played Fabares father in a far different way for years on The Donna Reed Show isn't particularly challenged in his role but lends solid support. Former child actor Hawkins and Mullaney's comedic contributions are a matter of taste. Also in the cast are Berlinger as a weakkneed associate of Betz's and Hutchins as a policeman who spends his spare time cooking gourmet food. Appearing briefly as a couple who leave their home in Presley's care are film veterans Kellaway and Merkel. It's almost never believable but that isn't the point. It's just frothy colorful tuneful fluff that's stacked with entertainingly mod hairdos and clothes with hipswinging teens flailing away at any opportunity. One peculiar set piece includes a campsite and meal preparation that predates The Young Girls of Rochefort and has Presley  Co. moving in choreographed synchronization to the music as they set up the tents table and food. Former Warner Brothers contractees Hutchins and McBain who had starred together in Claudelle Inglish don't really share any scenes here. Fabares made three Elvis films in all.".

Will Hutchins television's Sugarfoot is also around as a policeman who appreciates good cooking and Jack Mullaney and Jimmy Hawkins are the other members of Elvis's group. Note that they play electric guitars or simulate playing them while Elvis sticks with a regular model.Of course Spinout ends with the Big Race and I don't think I have to tell you who wins but the race itself is 34 of the fun. No big songs came out of the score for Elvis but he acquits himself in the vocal and comedy department. Spinout should please his fans.".

She plays the spoiled rich girl Cynthia beautifully and she has never looked prettier on film than she does here. Her father is played by Carl Betz who as many know played her father on the Donna Reed show for five years. He also does a great job trying to get Elvis to drive his car but keep him away from his daughter. Warren Berlinger also plays a great comic relief role as Philip who really likes Cynthia. Will Hutchins is very funny as the cop who tries to run Elvis and crew out of town. He would later star with Elvis in Clambake. Adding a nice touch to the film as well is Una Merkel and Cecil Kellaway. They play an elderly couple that Elvis meet and convinces them to let him and his band watch their house as they take a vacation in his car. The songs are wonderful. I especially love Spinout Smorgasbord Adam and Evil and the great I'll Be Back sung at the end. All in all a very entertaining film that has a good feel and good flow to it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Elvis Presley was not a bad actor. I've seen him do competent jobs in several films and he had a very likable screen persona. However despite his box office appeal he seemed willing to star in some of the slightest and silliest films of the 1960s. Some of the films have a bit more depth to them though most are just familiar mindless drivellike SPINOUT. Harry Medved listed it among the movies in his Fifty Worst Movies book though it isn't that badthough it certainly wasn't very good either.In SPINOUT we find Elvis as a struggling rock 'n roll star AND champion race car driver! If only he were a scientist too and he'd be Buckaroo Bonzai see THE ADVENTURES OF BUCKAROO BONZAI ACROSS THE 8TH DIMENSION. Unlike the real life Elvis his character shuns glamor and glitz and travels with his three musicianscamping out and living a bohemian life while STILL managing to have clean clothes multiple wardrobes gourmet meals a race car and a 1929 Duesenberg! Their camping out was pure hooey and the camp sites bore an amazing similarity to the sound stage.Well because he can sing and drive fast cars and is Elvis it's not surprising that he's pursued by some hot ladies. What makes this different from some of his movies is that three different and very clichd ladies all want to marry him and he wants nothing to do with this. One is the rich princess played by Shelly Fabares. In an interesting casting nod her father is played by Carl Betzthe same guy who played her father in The Donna Reed Show. The second is a pretty but rather cold writer played by Diane McBain. The third is a kooky girl played by Deborah Walley. All three are very very broad stereotypes and probably the worst of these was the role given to Ms. Walley. That's because she was supposed to be part comic relief musician gourmet chef and vampthough no one seemed to realize she was a hot and happenin' chick until late in the film what were they all blind?!?. Considering how beautiful these ladies were in the film AND how much Elvis avoided them and preferred to hang out with the guys I really think some might watch this film and wonder if his character was supposed to be gay. I particularly wondered about the two guys in his band.I could say more about the plot but frankly it all was too trivial and silly to mention in detail though it was occasionally accidentally entertaining. However what was not entertaining were the many songs Elvis sang as well as the kooky race at the end of the film. As for the songs Elvis does have a lovely voice but every one of the 1893 songs he sings in the film is completely forgettable and insipid. None have decent lyrics or are memorable in any positive way. I would have preferred if he'd just sung a few of his old familiar favorites. Instead it often just seemed like padding. The race at the end of the film was a major letdown as well. While auto races can be exciting having it be comedic really didn't work well at all and having a complete and total idiot nearly win a professional auto race strained credibility to new lows. It was just embarrassing and tended to bring the whole production to a grinding haltyet it was intended as the highlight of the film! So what's to like about the film? Well Elvis is pleasant in a plastic sort of way and the ladies quite lovely particularly the radiant Ms. Fabares and it was nice to see Una Merkel Cecil Kellaway and a 1929 Duesenberg. Otherwise there isn't much to recommend this dull little film. Overall a mindless and harmless sort of filmmostly of interest to Elvis worshipers. Any one else would be bored by it.".

Well Elvis is pleasant in a plastic sort of way and the ladies quite lovely particularly the radiant Ms. Fabares and it was nice to see Una Merkel Cecil Kellaway and a 1929 Duesenberg. Otherwise there isn't much to recommend this dull little film. Overall a mindless and harmless sort of filmmostly of interest to Elvis worshipers. Any one else would be bored by it.";

It's average fare that serves as a serviceable enough onetime watch but not particularly distinguished and one for completests intent on checking out all of Elvis' films like me. It's no 'King Creole' 'Flaming Star' 'Jailhouse Rock' 'Viva Las Vegas' and 'Loving You' but it is far better than 'Kissin' Cousins' 'Frankie  Johnny' 'Paradise Hawaiian Style' and particularly 'Harum Scarum' as well as his later efforts.'Spinout' benefits in particular from the climactic big race an incredibly fun scene that is the most energetic everything gets and a generally polished supporting cast with Shelley Fabares Diane McBain Dodie Marshall and Carl Betz lighting up the screen and Cecil Kellaway and Una Merkel nearly stealing the show.It is a decent looking film there are betterlooking Elvis films but it is a long way from cheap apart from the racing footage looking artificial but the photography and sets are fine. The soundtrack is generally unimpressive though there are far worse Elvis film soundtracks but there are a few standouts such as the title song I'll Be Back and All That I Am. Usually a hit and miss director Norman Taurog gives some of his most enthusiastic directing of his numerous collaborations with Elvis.However there are exceptions with the supporting cast and they are Jack Mullaney and Deborah Walley both very annoying in roles written in a way that grates on the nerves fast. Most of the soundtrack is forgettable at best with Beach Shack and Smorgasbord being disposable songs that one can easily do without.Regarding Elvis himself he has certainly been far more disengaged before and since but he has also been much more enthusiastic and it was like he didn't trust the material. Not that one can blame him because the script is more cringeworthy than funny and flags in energy. The story has its slow spots but also suffers from being too busy.Overall you can certainly do with far worse but Elvis and the cast did deserve better. 510 Bethany Cox".

Amazingly he also races on the side with his band members assisting in the pits. As usual every woman is attracted to the character played by Elvis McCoy. In this case there are three who desperately want to marry him the tomboy drummer of his band Deborah Walley a spoiled heiress Shelley Fabares and a woman writing a book on him Diane McBain. Carl Betz plays the heiress' rich father who wants McCoy to drive his fancy new racecar but also to stay away from his daughter. Jack Mullaney Will Hutchins and Dodie Marshall are also on hand.These types of movies aren't meant to be taken too seriously. They exist as vehicles for Elvis' talents and to entertain with fun 60's shenanigans. You're not supposed to scrutinize 'em too closely. But sometimes the writing is so stoopid it takes you right out of the story. One quick example from Spinout McCoy Elvis wants to temporarily move into the mansion next door to the heiress and her rich dad so he charms the elderly neighbors and convinces them to immediately go on a second honeymoon while he and his bandmates  perfect strangers  stay at their mansion. Why sure! Elements like this make it seem like they enlisted a 14 yearold to assist with the script. Still Spinout fills the bill if you need a brainlessbutamusing mid60's fix. The film runs 90 minutes and was shot in Southern California. GRADE C".

Surprisingly the fact that Elvis was a race car driver really didn't have that much to do with the movie except at the end. I was also disappointed with Jack Mullaney's performance. I was expecting him to be as funny as he was in Tickle Me when he played Elvis's halfwitted sidekick Stanley. Unfortunately Mullaney had a minor role in this movie and in my opinion wasn't very funny but just acting stupid. The movie had some good quotes but the music wasn't all that good although I love the song All That I Am. The acting in the movie wasn't the greatest I've seen but who watches an Elvis movie expecting Oscar grade performances? I think that when watching any Elvis movie one must remember that the movies were made to be funny lighthearted and showcase Elvis' musical talents not to be dramatic or violent like other movies. One thing I did like about this movie is that it wasn't particularly dirty. There were a few words that didn't need to be in there but it wasn't bad in any other way. I wouldn't mind watching it again but I'd rather watch Follow That Dream or Blue Hawaii if I had a choice.".

The film stars Fernando Fernn Gmez as Leopoldo De Gregorio  Marquis of Esquilache  who gives an awesome acting and it is based on the play Un Soador Para Un Pueblo by Antonio Buero Vallejo. This excellent picture recreates faithfully the historical facts  as several years separate us from the events are to narrate  but the shadows still hide from the public this great historic moment  and the significance of such deeds . Esquilache is filled with those lights and shadows  gathers such a very important known event recreated in the artistic frame called Illustration  characterized and inspired by the ideas of reason and freedom . The movie contributes to artistic and cultural record of an era  being masterfully narrated and perfectly played as well as directed . Here appear numerous historical characters competently performed  such as  Charles III by Adolfo Marsillach  Isabel De Farnesio interpreted by Amparo Rivelles  Duque De Villasanta by Alberto Closas and Marqus De Ensenada acted by ngel De Andrs Lpez . It displays a colorful and evocative cinematography by Juan Amoros  being shot on location in Royal Palace of Madrid . Luxurious sets make excellent use of real locations in Spain and it has a look of a great production . Attractive and magical musical score by Jos Nieto . The motion picture was stunningly directed by Josefina Molina who has received a honorific Goya  she has directed good flicks such as Funcin De Noche Lo Mas Natural La Lola Se Va a Los Puertos and the prestigious TV series Tesesa De Jesus. The film was entered into the 39th Berlin International Film Festival and won numerous Goya Awards .The film is very well set in Charles III epoch  he was the main promoting of Enlightened absolutism  also known as enlightened despotism and benevolent absolutism  it is a form of absolute monarchy or despotism inspired by the Enlightenment .

Most enlightened monarchs fostered education and allowed religious tolerance  freedom of speech  and the right to hold private property . Charles III King of Spain from 1759 to 1788 sought to rescue his empire from decay through ambitious reforms such as weakening the Church and its monasteries  promoting science and university research facilitating trade and commerce modernizing agriculture  and avoiding war .

	schema:reviewBody "This film concerns the Esquilache Riots which took place in Madrid in March 1766. Brought about mainly by a growing dissatisfaction among the populace of Spain's capital with the rising cost of bread and other staples they were sparked off by a series of unpopular and impolitic measures affecting what clothes people might wear in public enacted under the advise of the Marquis of Esquilache in Italian Squillacce a Neapolitan whom King Charles III had made his Minister of Finance. Charles III was Spain's chief exponent of what is called Eighteenth Century Enlightened Despotism. He brought public lighting and paving stones to Madrid.

Brought about mainly by a growing dissatisfaction among the populace of Spain's capital with the rising cost of bread and other staples they were sparked off by a series of unpopular and impolitic measures affecting what clothes people might wear in public enacted under the advise of the Marquis of Esquilache in Italian Squillacce a Neapolitan whom King Charles III had made his Minister of Finance. Charles III was Spain's chief exponent of what is called Eighteenth Century Enlightened Despotism. He brought public lighting and paving stones to Madrid.

For one it features an overall darker tone. It doesn't get all sappy either and the idea to have the gang return as demons instead of ghosts works well also tying into a ritual from the original story that the first adaptation omitted. I preferred the fatherdaughter dynamic over the family one and the addition of side characters Maria and Jules was certainly welcome.On the other hand even as demons Alexis Arquette and company didn't come off quite as menacing as the gang from the previous flick. I think that had to do with some lame oneliners. There's also the fact that I recognized one of the gang Glen Beaudin from the silly 90's TV series Superhuman Samurai Syber Squad so it's hard to take him too seriously as a threat. The priest character is way over the top as well and the annoying lawnmower idiot couldn't get off my screen fast enough.Still this is a fun take on the King tale and we get some interesting imagery such as death by flying tarot cards and Swank getting it on with a demonized Arquette. It's far from great but it makes a nice companion to the first as both have their qualities and misfires.".

Now my complaint they talk about how Jon kills the three punks electrocuting them they even show it in the trailer but why did they cut it out of the movie? I for a party of one think that is kind of important to the plot that would be like cutting the train wreck from the first movie.

The flashbacks that appear throughout the movie are interesting and leak out information about the main character's past bit by bit.  There are some good characters.

Father Roberts is played by William Morgan Sheppard who also had a similar role in Zork Nemesis a cinematic computer game that also has a very somber creepy mood. Check it out  The story is similar to the first movie  Jon Porter Michael Gross moves back to his hometown with his daughter after his mother dies.  When he gets back three demons from his past come back to terrorize him and his daughter.  I smiled when several references were made to the original movie.  Stephen King had put a demon raising ritual in which you must cut off a finger in his short story and it didn't make it for the first film but this part of the story ...came back.. for the sequel.  With all that the movie had a great creepy mood to it but unfortunately it begins to feel like a slasher movie with a few characters dying miserably.  That's the only element of this movie I don't like.  Two characters died horribly onscreen crying and screaming.  In my opinion that was a little inapropriate but oh well.  This movie is still good for any fan of the original movie.".

She soon meets up with locals Jules Martin Jennifer Elise Cox and Maria Moore Jennifer Aspen and they decide to go out and explore the town. Together they meet the mysterious Tony Reno Alexis Arquette and they immediately begin to fall for his charms. He is not that impressed and after consulting Father Archer Roberts William Morgan Sheppard about this he begins to realize that he knows him from somewhere in the past and orders them to stay away from him. Not taking this too kindly he begins to go on a rampage and kills all that he can in town to resurrect an army for him to control. Finally understanding the hints from the past he races to stop him before he targets his daughter for his nefarious plans.The Good News This here does manage to get some really good stuff in it. The fact that this one decides to pretty much up the gore factor considerably. This one has a lot more blood than would be expected for something like this and that is greatly appreciated. This is nicely produced through it's rather impressive deaths as there's a severing of both ears having a heart ripped out the chest being sliced over virtually everywhere by tarot playing cards stabbed and being left to bleed and the single most creative one being dragged into the ground by possessed weeds and left in position to have the head run over by a lawnmower. It's a lot more violent than would be expected as there's the aftermath visible and it goes over everything. It's a great site and really leaves some great aftertaste. There's even more in the discovery of the kitchen where it covers the floor and walls in preparation for a ceremonial ritual that is never shown but is good enough to get some more blood and gore into the film. There's even some nice action scenes to be had from all the confrontations to be had in the film. The early 50's flashback scenes do this nicely especially the one from the beginning where the victim is taken into the cave. That is a really great one which also throws in some suspense as well. That is also apparent of the ending which is the big confrontation and really does set up a grand sense of scale and importance. The setting also doesn't hurt as being in the cave manages to get some atmosphere out of it as well. There's one last big positive and that would be it's sardonic humor. The villain's oneliners are so jawdropping bad that they actually become pretty funny like the mention of a classic joke after a complete dismemberment and several other rather nice jokes. These here are all great reasons as to why this film is rather good.The Bad News This here wasn't that bad but it did have a few flaws. One of the most persistent one is that it doesn't offer up anything new. This plays out exactly like the first one did with the exact same setup the same kind of villain and the exact same resources used to get to the same resolution. This can get tiring really quickly since the beyond a few minor changes there's nothing of real interest here. The big problem here is that it virtually makes this a sequel that is practically a remake which is not what a film needs to be especially the first sequel to the original film. By going on the main route it does there's little it can do for repetition and instead relies on the film's new points to prove it's watchability. The fact that the villain is campy doesn't exactly inspire a lot of threat at times as the jokes take away a lot of whatever fear they could've had by not doing so and the jokes can wear thin at times. The last flaw is that it can really be quite inactive at times. There's little here that really does what the ending does provide some solid action parts to the film. This does take a while to get going and the setup is the same as the one before which is quite confusing and really could've been sped up slightly. It isn't completely terrible but these do lower the film slightly.The Final Verdict Really not that impressive but it's still not as bad as it may seem to be which in the end gives this a watchablebutunspectacular tag. See this one for fans of the first one or are in the mood for some harmless fun while those not really interested should seek caution.Rated R Graphic Violence Graphic Language Nudity and animal aftereffect violence".

The early 50's flashback scenes do this nicely especially the one from the beginning where the victim is taken into the cave. That is a really great one which also throws in some suspense as well. That is also apparent of the ending which is the big confrontation and really does set up a grand sense of scale and importance. The setting also doesn't hurt as being in the cave manages to get some atmosphere out of it as well. There's one last big positive and that would be it's sardonic humor. The villain's oneliners are so jawdropping bad that they actually become pretty funny like the mention of a classic joke after a complete dismemberment and several other rather nice jokes. These here are all great reasons as to why this film is rather good.The Bad News This here wasn't that bad but it did have a few flaws. One of the most persistent one is that it doesn't offer up anything new. This plays out exactly like the first one did with the exact same setup the same kind of villain and the exact same resources used to get to the same resolution. This can get tiring really quickly since the beyond a few minor changes there's nothing of real interest here. The big problem here is that it virtually makes this a sequel that is practically a remake which is not what a film needs to be especially the first sequel to the original film. By going on the main route it does there's little it can do for repetition and instead relies on the film's new points to prove it's watchability. The fact that the villain is campy doesn't exactly inspire a lot of threat at times as the jokes take away a lot of whatever fear they could've had by not doing so and the jokes can wear thin at times. The last flaw is that it can really be quite inactive at times. There's little here that really does what the ending does provide some solid action parts to the film. This does take a while to get going and the setup is the same as the one before which is quite confusing and really could've been sped up slightly. It isn't completely terrible but these do lower the film slightly.The Final Verdict Really not that impressive but it's still not as bad as it may seem to be which in the end gives this a watchablebutunspectacular tag. See this one for fans of the first one or are in the mood for some harmless fun while those not really interested should seek caution.Rated R Graphic Violence Graphic Language Nudity and animal aftereffect violence";

I am an avid watcher of old horror movies and if you like those then you should definitely check this out. It has the same vibe as most horror movies from the 70's and into the 80's but they had better visual effects. Although by todays standards they're pretty bad.

Even worse is the voice alteration that they gave the main bad guy. I'm not sure if someone thought this was scary but it was more laughable than anything else. I've always liked Gross but he's pretty forgettable and way too boring here. It was somewhat fun seeing future Oscarwinner Swank here and especially in a rather weird sex scene.

Alexis Arquette made a great leader of the villains though at times he seemed to be doing a bit of a Jerry Seinfeld impression. Micheal Gross was also very good as the typical troubled father. To be honest the only part of the cast that wasn't up to par was Hillary Swank. If you told me in '96 that she would win an Oscar in less than a decade I would have laughed in your face. As good as she may be now she was awful in this film! Her lines were monotone her facial expressions were flat just and overall bad job. Up until the ending the plot moved along at a good pace very interesting and enjoyable. The ending on the other hand seemed to drag on forever! I wont spoil it but suffice to say it could have been a lot shorter. Last but certainly not least The gore. Herein lie the minor spoilers that I mentioned so avert your eyes if you want. Nothing major though. The deaths were all very well done and gory though I wish we would have seen more of the lawnmower scene. The death by tarot cards was very cool however and is quite possibly the best part of the film.Overall I recommend at least renting the double sided DVD with this and it's predecessor.

When I saw this remake in the early 90's for the first time I did not know the original movie.

	schema:reviewBody "It's odd to like an original film and then like the remake equally so if not more but that's the case with this film. I have viewed both versions of this film at least three times apiece and thoroughly enjoy both. Almost 55 years ago this was a film noir called The Narrow Margin and in 1990 this remake took off the The on the title. However as is sometimes the case with remakes some of the twists and turns of this thriller were also changed from the first film.They didn't spoil it. I have no objection to the changes made here because the bottom line is entertainment and that's where this movie excels. Plausible? No but neither was the original for that matter and neither are a lot of suspense crime films.What makes this rerun good in addition to the great suspense are several other things 1  Gene Hackman one of the best actors of his generation and often overlooked in discussions of great actors 2  nice photography featuring some great train shots and the scenic Canadian Rockies 3  an interesting assortment of characters some of which keep you guessing whether they are the good guys or the bad guys 4  a dash of humor thrown in here and there to break the tension.In addition to Hackman we see the sexy Anne Archer who gives a nice film noir feel to the movie and we get some good supporting performances including two from guys with the same last name J.T. and Emmet Walsh and one from a guy who plays one of the hit men James Sikking. That's a name I'm not familiar with but he has a scene talking to Hackman that is riveting.The main fault of the movie at least to me was the Rambo mentality in which I mean the villains have the good guy in pointblank can'tmiss range several times and....you guessed it they miss. The action scenes in here are great but lack credibility or this would be almost as good as it could ever get for a thriller. I'm still tempted to rate it a 10 for the entertainment value alone.".

	schema:reviewBody "Narrow Margin 1990 is a remake of a fondly remembered Bmovie that became a real sleeper hit. It does not match the original for suspense or excitement but it does boast a truly towering performance by Gene Hackman who takes the Charles MacGraw role and gives it everything he's got.The story is about a DA from L.A who travels to a mountain cabin in Canada to pick up a female murder witness. Some baddies follow him because they want to kill the witness but he manages to escape with her as far as the local railway station. They board an overnight train bound for Vancouver and spend the next day or so evading the killers on the train.Hackman is quite brilliant whether delivering panicky dialogue in a whisper or indulging in some violent action atop the speeding express. James B. Sikking makes a chilling assassin. Anne Archer is convincing as the vulnerable and terrified witness who would rather be anywhere other than where she is. Director Peter Hyams packs in some solid action sequences such as a nervejangling car chase through a forest and a savage fight on the roof of the train.Where this film falls short is in the suspense department and the pacing. There are moments where Hackman and Archer are allowed to relax too much. One scene in particular involves Hackman and Sikking having a lengthy conversation at a dinner table when Hackman leaves you'd expect them to follow him to her but they don't. There's another bit where the action jumps from about 1 a.m. to the next morning without any indication of what kind of events have taken place during the night. There's also a lot of long shots of the lovely scenery but to get the claustrophobic atmosphere the maker's needed to emphasise the inside of the train not the outside landscapes. It's a pretty good film but there are just a few things about it which drag it down a peg or two.".

It does make for a cool if a bit too short movie.Gene Hackman is the loudmouth Deputy DA desperate to get a big daddy mob boss behind bars. And when a shy book editor witnesses a mob assassination he treks out to Middleofnowhere Canada to drag her into court to testify. Problem's arise when the bad guys show up in the wilderness and blow the crap out of her cabin.A brilliant rustic carchopper chase down the sheer slopes of a mountain forest follows. It's a great scene with some cool shots and sharp editing. Once they reach the bottom of the mountain they find a train station and board the train for a private cabin. The bad guys follow only they still don't know what their witness looks like. Many scenes of hiding and seeking make up the rest of the movie. It doesn't sound like much but Peter Hyams' widescreen photography is used to the max to promote a sense of claustrophobia and even the quieter scenes are dominated by the sound of the train charging through the dark Canadian wilderness. One particular scene at Monashee Station really does take advantage of the 'middle of nowhere' feeling. Bruce Broughton's score is kind of okay but nothing as loud and exciting as the score he originally created. Peter Hyams disagreed as he often does with his composers and chopped up Broughton's work in postproduction. Thus the music in the movie is more of an underscore with much of the more actionbased cues missing. I wish it did last longer and with more scenes on the train coz trains are cool but for what it is Narrow Margin is a slightly wrought thriller with Gene Hackman on top form as always and having fun playing the older guy in the suit who can still get into fights and car chases as if it were his everyday job.".

	schema:headline " The kind of remake nobody does any more";
	schema:reviewBody "A remake of a 1952 Narrow Margin manages to evoke not only an old way of life but a nearly vanished breed of filmmaking. This is an R rated actionthriller for actual grown ups. It's got some excitement suspense and a few expletives which back in 1990 guaranteed this thing an R but today might slip past as PG13 but the star of the movie is a spry 60 his leading lady is 42 and the storytelling is meant to appeal to viewers of that age without insulting their intelligence or taste. Outside of maybe the James Bond franchise nobody really makes actionthrillers for an adult audience anymore. You basically just have to watch whatever cartoonish crap the kids are into.While on a blind date Carol Hunnicut Anne Archer witnesses a murder. She flees to Canada to hide but because she's the only one who can connect a menacing mobster Harris Yulin to the killing an insolent assistant DA named Caulfield Gene Hackman sets out to bring her back to Los Angeles to testify. After a deadly helicopter attack Carol and Caulfield wind up trapped on a train as it chugs through the Canadian wilderness with two mob killers on board. With nowhere to run and only a few places to hide the reluctant witness and the defiant prosecutor have to work together if they hope to survive.Made in a world before omnipresent cell phones and by a film industry that didn't turn every knob up to 11 for every second of screen time Narrow Margin looks feels and acts like a period piece. The setting is only slightly more familiar than the 1890s and the filmmaking has more in common with the 1940s than it does with today. So your reaction to this motion picture will depend on the diversity and leniency of you cinema palate. As put off as you are by the circumstance and the styling of the film that's how much you'll be bothered by little plot holes and clunky sub plots. For example Caulfield has several encounters with another woman on the train and they're such a blatant digression from the main story you can't help but suspect they're leading to something deflating the surprise when they do.If you keep an open mind however there's something to enjoy about a thriller that's more than an assembly line moving characters from one stunt extravaganza to another. Indeed it's the personal dynamic between Carol and Caulfield that fills up most of the story giving it a more honestly dramatic tone than usual. There's a good scene where Anne Archer gets to strut her stuff as Carol finally opens up and unloads on Caulfield and another when Caulfield gets tired of indulging his witness' reluctance and lays this blunt guilt trip on her. And when Caulfield finally gets a facetoface meeting with the killers it's a nice bit of business where James B. Sikking carries the action as the lead hitman until Hackman steps in with his always surprising power to both end the discussion and propel the film forward into its final act.I wouldn't say Narrow Margin is a great film though it does have a great cast. J.T. Walsh M. Emmett Walsh and Harris Yulin are the sort of character actors that you can almost put them in any role in any sort of tale and they'll make it better through their presence. Seeing the aforementioned Sikking was enough to make me want to go watch some old episodes of Hill Street Blues and Nigel Bennet as the 2nd hitman on the train almost makes me want to do the same with Forever Knight. When you've got someone like Hackman leading the way it's essential that the other performers are able to keep up with him.Director Peter Hyams also makes good use of his train setting both for thrills and other aspects of storytelling. I t's an inherently more interesting way to travel and offers up far more opportunities for physical movement than either flying or driving. The rooftop climax used here may somewhat pale when compared to the wirefu jump cut CGIfrenzy of modern action sequences but that's a bothersome bit of bar raising which is going to plague Hollywood for a very long time.Though dated Narrow Margin is still worth seeing especially when measured against the never ending torrent of misfires failures and nighunwatchable garbage with which the movie industry assaults us. I prefer seeing an old film that's okay to a new one that sucks. Your mileage may vary.".

	schema:reviewBody "A few weeks ago my Aunt a very nice woman gave me a copy of Narrow Margin DVD which was free with the Daily Mail. I had not heard of this film before but was pleased to see that Gene Hackman was in it so I thought I would give it a go in the machine and I must say I'm glad I did.NARROW MARGIN DVD Narrow Margin 1990 is basically about Carol Hunnicut Anne Archer who witnesses a mob killing of her blind date and goes on the runhiding in a remote part of Canada. L.A. District Attorney Robert Caulfield Gene Hackman is informed of her whereabouts by a close friend who then tracks her down to testify but it's not to long before the Mob bad guys find out where she is too. Both the cop and the witness are chased through the Canadian Rockies where their only hope is to take refuge on a claustrophobic Vancouverbound train. Caulfield Hackman is then double crossed by a bent cop and so the killers know there every movement on board the train.The talented Gene Hackman plays his part extremely well as so does the reluctant witness Anne Archerwho both help make this a compelling and an enthralling film to watch. The chase whilst there on the train is very exciting with great scenic mountain views in the background. Here is a link from IMDb showing a clip of the chase on the roof of the train which is well worth watching in my opinion. httpwww.imdb.comvideoscreenplayvi1083965721I must say I did enjoy watching Narrow Margin although I noticed some of the shotsspecial effects of the speeding Vancouverbound train looked like plastic scaled models I'm sure I'm right. The story is fair perhaps a bit simple but I suppose most films revolving around a train chase are. As I said if Gene Hackman was not in this film or someone to match his caliber this film would spell out a big MISS. Yes you could say this is yet another chase filmmovie but may I say it's certainly fun to watch.SUMMARY Narrow Margin DVD is an exciting film and one I would recommend watching first before you go out and buy it full price. Gene Hackman's performance is top notch and with the help of Peter Hyams Director they successfully succeeded in making this a very compelling film to watch and appreciateespecially the gripping chase on the train. I am pretty sure most of you will enjoy the fast pace through out the film and at 94 mins there's never a dull moment. 6.610".

Here is a link from IMDb showing a clip of the chase on the roof of the train which is well worth watching in my opinion. httpwww.imdb.comvideoscreenplayvi1083965721I must say I did enjoy watching Narrow Margin although I noticed some of the shotsspecial effects of the speeding Vancouverbound train looked like plastic scaled models I'm sure I'm right. The story is fair perhaps a bit simple but I suppose most films revolving around a train chase are. As I said if Gene Hackman was not in this film or someone to match his caliber this film would spell out a big MISS. Yes you could say this is yet another chase filmmovie but may I say it's certainly fun to watch.SUMMARY Narrow Margin DVD is an exciting film and one I would recommend watching first before you go out and buy it full price. Gene Hackman's performance is top notch and with the help of Peter Hyams Director they successfully succeeded in making this a very compelling film to watch and appreciateespecially the gripping chase on the train. I am pretty sure most of you will enjoy the fast pace through out the film and at 94 mins there's never a dull moment. 6.610";

	schema:reviewBody "Peter Hyams' 1990 remake of The Narrow Margin 1952 is full of suspense highspeed thrills and exciting action sequences. Visually many of the film noir characteristics are retained but this production is also considerably glossier and more colourful than its predecessor. Good use is made of some stunning locations in Canada and the cinematography is impressive throughout. The grittiness and sharp dialogue of the original are dispensed with and the main characters are noticeably much more sophisticated and wellmannered than they were in the Richard Fleischer version.Recent divorce Carol Hunnicut Anne Archer goes on a blind date to a Los Angeles hotel where she meets successful lawyer Michael Tarlow J.T. Walsh. Before they have a meal Tarlow receives a note and has to make an important telephone call so the couple go up to his suite where Carol immediately goes into the bathroom. When she comes out again she sees two men talking to Tarlow and then witnesses one of them shooting and killing him before leaving. Shocked and panicked by what she's seen Carol furtively leaves the suite and goes into hiding.L.A. Deputy D.A. Robert Caulfield Gene Hackman learns that evidence has been found that a witness was present when Tarlow was murdered and also that the identity of the witness has been established. Excited by this information and the possibility it offers of bringing top crime boss Leo Watts Harris Yulin to justice he then ignores the lack of support that he receives from the D.A. and together with Police Sergeant Dominick Benti M. Emmett Walsh heads to the Canadian Rockies where the men visit the log cabin where Carol Hunnicut is hiding out. She's uncooperative and refuses to return to L.A. to testify but as the men try to change her mind a mob helicopter arrives overhead and the cabin is immediately engulfed in a storm of machinegun bullets. Benti is killed in the attack and Caulfield and Hunnicut escape from the cabin in a pickup truck hotly pursued by the helicopter.After a desperate chase down a steep forestry road the couple arrive at a nearby station and take a train to Vancouver. The journey that follows proves to be extremely dangerous as there are two hitmen on board and also some other characters such as a fat man and a blonde woman who they don't know if they can trust.Gene Hackman brings a great deal of charm energy and humour to his role as a guy who's out of his depth doing all the actionhero stunts and sums up his character's incorruptibility when he refuses a huge bribe by saying I like my side of the courtroom the pay's not so good but the air's a lot better. Anne Archer is also good in her role and makes her fear palpable as she tries desperately to escape the attentions of all her pursuers.Narrow Margin features a number of wellexecuted stunts some well directed action sequences and a very strong cast. Its Hitchcockian influences add some extra interest but overall it's uncomplicated fastmoving and extremely enjoyable.".

We want all the movies to be just one movie the most successful one in our time and it's impossible not because the history doesn't repeat itself only but because that would distort all the movies also ! Here it's fair without any crazy Action or CGI's companionship and It's great to see Gene Hackman in anything. True that this rule has some exceptions but this movie is not one of them. I think this time I have just the screenwriter to blame not to utilize some parts to make it more hot and perhaps that's the reason why this movie seemed more like a TV production or as one had been made by the 1950s' standards. It's not big not loud though not bad. So try to think of it as a clever intermission between Rambo and Die Hard or as a peaceful version of The Gauntlet however in a train or as a solid old fashion kind of thriller.".

By now he has perfected his singular technique of a nervous selfconscious snigger followed immediately by a forlorn introspective expression. A little 'business' from the 'method' school of acting that has now become his trade mark. See him in 'The Firm' and you will know what I mean. In each movie he plays a lawyer  one good one bad  but both acted identically. He is basically playing the same character in each. It works  but it's cheap.Coming back to this movie there are the formulaic elements. A fat cynical detective ably played by the reliable Emmet Walsh you just know is going to come unstuck. Baddies with machine guns who can't knock the skin off a rice pudding a quick blast of pyrotechnics a car chase and an inevitable finale on the train roof. How many times have we seen that? There is an encounter with a femme fatale another baddie that is so amateurish even a child could tell it was a setup. Mr Goodman adds a little tragic humour. The scenery through which the train is passing creates a wonderfully photogenic set. It's a director's delight  which is probably why we see trouble on trains so often at the movies. There is a short but extremely spectacular railway ride over the White Pass of Alaska and down to Skagway on its coast. I guess movie moguls don't get up that way very often otherwise it would have featured in a dozen dramas by now. Hackman's nervous antihero gradually forced into serious action is what keeps this movie up to speed with the train. Again it's formulaic but it's good. Well worth a watch. Replace Hackman with Steven Segal and you have 'Under Siege 2'. You're also down to 4 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "What a completely redundant and pointless idea to do a remake of Richard Fleischer's superb and still perfectly undated filmnoir masterpiece The Narrow Margin But hey bad ideas got turned into highly entertaining movies before and particularly the cast  crew involved in this early 90's production should make you more confident. Peter Hyams is a gifted director and an even better cinematographer Gene Hackman is his good old reliable self and since the script pretty much follows the same trail  or should I say 'rail'  as the '52 original you already know that'll be good as well. Carol Hunnicut witnesses the coldblooded murder of a mafia attorney at the end of their blind date and promptly becomes the only key witness ever to testify against wellprotected crime lord Leo Watts. When the dedicated prosecutor Robert Caulfield travels out her secluded hideout place in order to convince the reluctant woman to do the right thing this triggers a virulent deadly cat and mouse game with a duo of professional killers. The chase largely takes place on the night train to Vancouver the ideal inescapable location and the good guys' only advantage is that their opponents don't know what Carol looks like. One of the taglines proudly claims that Narrow Margin will take you to the edge of suspense. That is perhaps a slightly too optimistic promise but it's definitely one of the better suspensethrillers of its time. A lot of little elements and twists in the plot seem rushed and don't make a whole lot of sense but who cares when there's stuff to enjoy like a spectacular helicopter Vs. Jeep chase through the Canadian forests or an exhilarating battle of train's rooftop? Bruce Broughton's divinely unsettling score most definitely increases the tension level even more. Gene Hackman clearly enjoyed starring in this lightheaded action thriller and particularly his speech to the killers  about why he prefers working on the right side of the law  is truly priceless. There are some great names in the supportive cast as well J.T. Walsh M. Emmet Walsh but sadly their roles are too brief. Overall recommended as long as you don't anticipate a flawless masterpiece but if it ever comes down to choosing just one go for the superior 50's original.".

There are some great names in the supportive cast as well J.T. Walsh M. Emmet Walsh but sadly their roles are too brief. Overall recommended as long as you don't anticipate a flawless masterpiece but if it ever comes down to choosing just one go for the superior 50's original.";

Aside from a reluctant witness Robert Caufield has to deal with crooked cops in his own department and two hitmen on the very train they are traveling but he is nonetheless honorably determined to save Carol.Despite the typical story of a witness trying to escape the grips of unrelentless mafia hitmen it is an entertaining story nonetheless. Anne Archer's character is not stupid she's quite aware of the risks that lie ahead and doubts whether one Deputy Hackman is enough to save her. And despite the tired finales of fights between antogonist and protagonist while on top of a train there are some good action and thriller ploys here and there that make it an entertaining story. I think the lead characters Hunnicut and Caufield add something good to the movie.".

Needless to say I wasn't disappointed at all.After some ominous music followed by very creative opening credits we join the story of Carol Honeycutt who is an editor for a publishing company on a blind date with Michael Tarlow a defense attorney. Michael is obviously a man with lots of secrets but Carol gets to know him quite well and they seem like an even match. However after getting a phone call in his hotel suite they adjourn to his room together and Carol decides to get a glass of water from the next room. Unbenowst to her and Tarlow they have a surprise visitor Leo Watts a reputed crime boss with ties to organized crime. After some chitchat Leo reveals that he knows that Michael has been 'skimming' from him and Michael 'breaks down' and confesses that he did it and he intended to pay him back. Leo seems like an understanding fellow at first when he tells Michael that he's to return every penny that he took from him and then ties will be severed. But as they near the door Leo says 'Michael I lied' and Leo's associate Jack Wooten pulls out a gun and viciously executes Tarlow much to Carol's horror. Knowing that her life is on the line because she's a witness Carol hightails it out of there making sure to cover her tracks the best she could.Enter Robert Caufield a Deputy DA who has been after Watts for years and when he learns that Carol was a witness to the slaying of Michael Tarlow he jumps at the chance to bring her back to testify but is met with resistance from his superiors who for some reason don't want him getting involved. None the less he and Detective Benti head up to her cabin in Canada and do their best to persuade her to come back and assist them with putting a notorious crime lord behind bars but to no avail Carol refuses to cooperate. What was suppose to be a simple 'search and retrieval' assignment soon falls to pieces though when hightech professional assassins show up and start gunning the cabin to pieces. After Benti is killed and their chopper destroyed Caufield and Honeycutt flee the cabin in a Bronco pickup truck down the mountain and to a train station where they will board the first train headed to Los Angeles. Unfortunately the killers board the train too and are intending to earn what their boss has paid them to do to eliminate any loose threads. For the next several hours Caufield and Honeycutt will have to put each other's lives in their hands as they try to outrun outmaneuver and outwit their adversaries in a lethal game of 'step on or get stepped on'.I was completely blown away and amazed at this film and many people are saying that the first version is better than this remake. I saw the first one and in comparison the remake has a lot more going for it. Not only do we have nailbiting suspense but we've got action and great performances by Gene Hackman and Anne Archer. The interesting part is the internal struggle that these two have to go through besides the killers on the train Hackman's character must try and convince Archer's character to do the right thing because even if they escape the killers today Watts would just send more hitters until Honeycutt was dead. Anne Archer did a swell job playing the sharptongued Carol Honeycutt who won't cooperate out of fear that she'll be killed but decides to do the right thing when the killers begin to close in on them. The atmosphere of being in a train with no means of escape and no way to tell friend from foe created a claustrophobic setting for the film. It was very impressive and you spend a lot of time rooting for Caufield and Honeycutt to come out on top. They have no weapons no cellular communication no backup...they are totally on their own and must rely on each other in order to stay alive.Narrow Margin is a terrific film with an excellent cast...if you haven't seen this one yet you don't know what you're missing!

It's a day that nobody present will ever forget for better or worse...Directed by William Wyler Best years Of Our Lives BenHur  Wuthering Heights and starring Kirk Douglas Eleanor Parker William Bendix Cathy O'Donnell and Joseph Wiseman.Detective Story is based on the smash hit Broadway play by Sidney Kingsley adapted by Phillip Yordan and Robert Wyler it's with much relief to me that the worry of it being a stagy production never actually materialises. Practically set on one bleak but quite excellently appropriate set creation courtesy of Hal Pereira  Earl Hedrick Detective Story manages to rise above its very simple plot by boasting interesting characters in a pot boiling story just waiting to peak. Each character has much to offer the film be it oddly quirky or overtly intense within the confines of this particular precinct the characters create engrossing drama.It's a difficult film to sell without giving too much away by outlaying the character persona's and mental fortitude's I personally feel that it will dull the impact of this influential crime genre piece. It's got real raw emotive acting particularly from Kirk Douglas as Jim McLeod and Eleanor Parker as his wife Mary while the technical aspects watch Lee Garmes' camera glide like a third party witness are impressively high. And with it embracing as it does morality themes it also doesn't lack for interest to the cranial head scratching crowd. It's by definition to me an all encompassing picture one that is now sure to be a perennial viewing in my home. It's not a standard fare crime picture and it most definitely is a talky film but it works incredibly well so one can only hope that many others will feel the same as me namely that it is a fine and essential genre piece. 810".

	schema:reviewBody "Detective Story 1951Virtue and abortion don't mix wellmore like matter and antimatter than oil and water and in Detective Story virtue is as flexible and pretty as a cinder block and abortion is as covert and murderous as well as an abortion at its worst back when it was an illegal horrifying ordeal. In this adapted theater piece we expect the leading players to be scarred or dead and they are though tender love does blossom and save one young couple. Detective Story it turns out goes way beyond being a detective story.Virtue? Kirk Douglas has more than a man can handle. At first this seems only to make him a terrific detective for a postWar New York Police Department but he ends up being mostly terrifying. Yes he is tireless and experienced and clever. He knows when to be ruthless and when to be kind he has a nose for evil and he is a good guy with the other detectives. We admire him. But the pieces start to fall askew. When he interferes with the kindness of a colleague played with great sympathy by William Bendix insisting on prosecuting a young man when even the victim doesn't want to we see a heartless man and a reckless one with a damning instinct. And we know he has to either die or see the light and change. In the end he does both.Abortion? Two decades before the 1970 repeal of abortion laws in New York State it's an unsanctioned death a criminal malpractice and it is presented as a horrifying personal and social tragedy a kind of sin. It appears from all anglesthe abortion doctor with his canny lawyer the detective's wife and her boyfriend from the past the one who got her pregnant and eventually the detective who came after the fact but is the one most harmed by it thanks to his blind stubbornness. The woman the detective's wife played by Eleanor Parker has buried the memory almost and in the scene where she has to finally tell her husband about it the detective's world is too black and white to cope. Suddenly she's a tramp and does he protest that he was a virgin when he married her? Hardly. I'm sure he wasn't. Does it even matter that she got pregnant with this earlier man who at one point is in the room and that she aborted the child described as an induced stillbirth? No all that matters to Douglas is that she had sex with someone before him. Voila! In his eyes she is now mere filth.But she is not filth and we all know it. She begs him explains to him cries for him but he doesn't see the virtue in her. She in turn sees the blackness in his brain and realizes in a compact epiphany that he will never change. And so when she says she's leaving him forever he believes her. This final collision between his unbending rules of proprietyin crime and in love equallywith the pliable reasonable realities around him is his ruin.This is all messy deep troubling stuff. Stir it up at a brisk pace shoot it using sharp stark camerawork and you have a really tight first rate significant film. It has slipped under the radar as a masterpiece for several reasons including maybe an excessive perfection that starts to feel slickan odd trap for a filmmaker to need to avoid but one often facing William Wyler one of the slickest and most stylelessly perfect of directors. The shooting barely leaves the suite of officesthere is that brief ride in the paddy wagonbut it doesn't need to. Even the beautiful moment in the cab where Douglas shows his most human side to his very human wife they remain parked right outside the station. It's not an action film. In fact it's not really a crime film nor a film noir despite the gloom and the date on it. It's about man's inability to see beyond himself. His obsessive virtue with no heart is a capital offense because he becomes stupid. He forgets to dodge the bullet.This is also a movie about a justice higher than law. The detective's wife who has broken the law is herself broken by events but she leaves the movie a free woman resolved and strong. The abortion doctor is to be booked the next morning and with luck he'll be jailed. Bendix who shows the highest virtue of anyone in the movie surviveshe's the one who says a prayer over the dead detective's body dead because Douglas cannot survive the blackness in his brain. A key ongoing sideplot is resolved just after Douglas is shot. Bleeding and in mortal pain he releases an unlikely first offender who he earlier wanted to prosecute. This feelgood last act is not left to the good Bendix but to Douglas who gets to see the light before the lights go out. The young criminal's real savior in the long run however is pure true love and we buy into that more easily especially in the form of Cathy O'Donnell who sure knows how to be pure and in love just see They Live by Night from three years earlier. So when the movie ends we are done with stark fast penetration and desperation. The precinct is in emotional shambles. But a corner has been turned and in the gorgeous parting shot we are taken to the street at night from above and the young couple and their shadows meld back into the swarm of real world our world.".

	schema:reviewBody "Adapted from a stage play by Sidney Kingsley Detective Story depicts a day at a New York police precinct in the early 1950's. The film resembles a featurelength episode of Barney Miller without the jokes as the detectives bring various shoplifters petty thieves and embezzlers into the station for booking. However the film does not lack humor as a broad hammy performance by Joseph Wiseman and an only slightly subtler take on a Brooklynese shoplifter by Lee Grant lighten up the often heavily dramatic proceedings.The central character Detective Jim McLeod is an unforgiving bythebook veteran who sees the world in black and white good versus evil with no shades of gray in between. Kirk Douglas brings McLeod to life in one of his finest most powerful performances. Douglas's Oscarcaliber work is matched by a fragile deeply felt performance by Eleanor Parker as McLeod's wife who harbors a secret from her past that unknown to either McLeod or his wife connects back to an ongoing police case. The scenes between Douglas and Parker are among the best in the film.Veteran director William Wyler retains most of the play's action in the central precinct room and only occasionally breaks from the claustrophobic set for a breather. Lee Garmes photographed Detective Story in crisp black and white and some of the shots of New York City could be framed and hung on a wall. With a cast of top character players that includes Gladys George William Bendix Frank Faylen and George Macready the multicharacter multiplotted Detective Story is a powerful wellacted film that somehow is less often seen than its quality warrants.".

But the film's brightest highlights are the few moments dominated by the brilliant Lee Grant whose character seems nonsequitary yet has a refreshing outsideworld quality.

Wyler's discretion of angle exposes or intimates more character than the last and apprehends the decisive sensibility to give significance to the experience of seeing the film.

Douglas looked competent and able in every part but sooner or later something would show his less attractive personality.

	schema:reviewBody "Before coming to the screen Sidney Kingsley's Detective Story ran in the 19491950 season on Broadway for 581 performances. It's hard to believe because Kirk Douglas is so right for the part but on Broadway the role of uptight police detective Jim McLeod was played by Ralph Bellamy.Lee Grant Michael Strong Joseph Wiseman and Horace McMahon are the four that came over from the original Broadway cast. These and the others that William Wyler cast for the film fill their parts almost to perfection. But this one is really Kirk Douglas's show.Kirk essays the part of a modern Inspector Javert in playing McLeod. Remember that in Les Miserables Javert was also the son of a criminal and feels he has a burden to live down. Like Javert McLeod has this maniacal attitude towards the criminal element. The world however is not black and white as McLeod discovers to his thorough destruction. I have no doubt that Sidney Kingsley was influenced by Victor Hugo's classic in writing this play.Note a lot of the Irish names among the squad note also the fact that this is 1951 and the attitude about abortion was a whole lot different back then. Douglas's pet peeve is back alley abortion provider George MacReady. Many women died from the hands of such folk as MacReady this was before Roe vs. Wade. MacReady is also harboring one dirty big secret about someone very close to Douglas. In his black and white world the revelation of it breaks Douglas.Eleanor Parker is Douglas's loving wife who is showed to be less than perfect and neither her or Kirk can deal with his rage. William Bendix in one of his best screen parts plays Douglas's veteran partner who's tough and compassionate.Lee Grant as the mousy little shoplifter got an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress in her screen debut. Unfortunately she fell afoul of the blacklist and didn't make it back to the screen for over fifteen years. After that her parts were anything but what you see here.Joseph Wiseman plays the psychotic burglar and you won't forget his character rages either. But Douglas is wound so tight in his role it's anyone's guess who is the bigger psycho.Detective Story is a realistic look at an NYPD squad back in the days before Miranda. It serves as the model for other police dramas right up to and including NYPD Blue. It's one of Kirk Douglas's best developed characters on screen. Reason enough to see it.".

	schema:headline " A Tale Of Turmoil  Tragedy";
	schema:reviewBody "Detective Story is an unconventional police drama as it focuses predominantly on one officer's troubled emotional state and the ways in which it affects his life both professionally and personally.The setting for the story is a busy detective squad's office in New York's 21st precinct police station where numerous suspects are routinely brought in to be interviewed and charged with a variety of crimes. Detective Jim McLeod Kirk Douglas works in this environment but for some time his main preoccupation has been the pursuit of a slimy abortionist called Dr Karl Schneider George Macready.McLeod is a belligerent character who detests criminals and believes that beating confessions out of them is perfectly justifiable. He's tortured by his past as his father was a criminal who treated his mother so badly that she ended up in an insane asylum and a suspect who he once showed mercy to subsequently committed a murder. This left McLeod with a very rigid perception of right and wrong and since that time his treatment of wrongdoers has been consistently harsh.Endicott Sims Warner Anderson who is Schneider's lawyer visits McLeod's superior officer Lieutenant Monaghan Horace McMahon and announces that his client is prepared to voluntarily hand himself in to face the murder charges against him. Sims is very anxious however that Schneider should not be physically harmed whilst in police custody.When Schneider arrives at the police station an accomplice who has agreed to identify him changes her mind because Schneider has bought her off with a fur coat. McLeod then sets out with his suspect to a nearby hospital to see one of the doctor's patients who can identify him. During the journey McLeod is told that the young woman has died and so his case against Schneider has virtually collapsed. The doctor is very smug about this and the volatile McLeod reacts by beating up his suspect.Sims had hinted that McLeod had personal motives which made him likely to be violent with his client and Schneider tells Monaghan that McLeod is pursuing him relentlessly because of a man named Tami Giacoppetti Gerald Mohr. These remarks lead Monaghan to investigate the matter further and he discovers that McLeod's wife Mary Eleanor Parker had previously known married gangster Giacoppetti became pregnant by him and subsequently lost her baby whilst being operated on by Schneider. It also emerges that the accusations made against McLeod by Sims and Schneider were unfounded because McLeod had known nothing about this episode in his wife's past.McLeod gets incredibly angry when he hears Mary's confession about her previous contact with Schneider and Giacoppetti and cruelly calls her a tramp. This episode leads to Mary leaving and McLeod being unable to either forgive her or come to terms with losing her and the consequences of this prove to be tragic.Detective Story is based on Sidney Kingsley's play of the same name and most of the action takes place in one room. This looks stagy but actually works well as it adds even more intensity to the already very dramatic events being depicted. McLeod's story is told at the same time as a number of subplots are being played out and this style of presentation realistically portrays the gritty and sometimes chaotic nature of the detectives' work. Among the other characters featured are a woman who is caught shoplifting a young man who's stolen money from his employer and two men who've carried out a burglary.Kirk Douglas is very believable as a man whose intolerance and bitterness feed an inner turmoil which makes him prone to violent outbursts. The supporting cast are also consistently good.The adult themes dealt with in this drama led to some problems with the Production Code but fortunately a satisfactory resolution was achieved so that this powerful story could be told in a way which retained its realistic edge.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is mostly talk which is no surprise since it's taken from a play. I usually don't go in for that sort of thing but the characters were so intense that it kept my interest. Having said that it still could have used a little more action and a change of venue more than on one quick scene. This was truly a play not a crime movie in the normal sense. By the way the story was changed from the play. In the play the doctor was an abortionist. To my memory that isn't mention in the movie yeah Hollywood's always been run by Liberals so they would hide that fact about the abortions. In the movie the doctor is simply portrayed as a poor one who delivers babies on his own as some sort of adoption ring for unwed mothers or something like that.The scandal is that that Kirk Douglas' wife had a baby two years out of wedlock before her relationship with her husband. Today this would be no big deal sad to say. Douglas plays the intense main character Dr. James McLeod. His character is actually super intense and some of the other cops are pretty toughsounding guys too.The movie also made a goat out of a gungho law and order cop making him look heartless. I guess this film was ahead of its time as we have seen that over and over since the 1960s.Some of this movie reminded of the old TV comedy series Barney Miller where all these oddballs would wind up at the police station. However in this film that sort of thing wasn't played for laughs. There is no humor in this movie.Excellent acting  and a deep cast  made this film watchable but not enough to be a keeper for me. However if you enjoy stage plays you should enjoy this movie.".

	schema:headline " Great vehicle for Kirk Douglas' acting talents";
	schema:reviewBody "Kirk Douglas has always excelled in roles where he plays the maverick loner walking the fine line between anger and insanity. Thus his role as Det. Jim McLeod in Detective Story is a real showcase for his acting talents. This is not a crime drama in the conventional sense where there is any real action or crime to solve even though you have a room full of New York City police detectives on screen for just about the whole movie. Instead it is a character study of Jim McLeod played by Kirk Douglas. McLeod's motivation in his work is not to solve crimes or even protect the innocent. Instead he is motivated by a desire to root out evil by his definition of the word. Evil is something McLeod claims that anyone can easily spot. McLeod's world view doesn't differentiate between the onetime bad act of a basically good person such as Arthur Kindred Craig Hill a young man who impulsively stole from his employer in a last ditch attempt to impress a girl he believed he loved versus the misdeeds of a lifetime criminal such as the homicidal maniac Charlie Arthur Kindred that has also been apprehended by the detective squad that same day.When confronted by a mistake in the past of the person nearest to him his own wife McLeod is equally unforgiving. His rage and disgust is so great you're not sure what bothers him more  the discovery of his wife's past or the failure of his own nose to sniff out the misdeed prior to this. By the time McLeod realizes his own inflexibility and lack of empathy have cost him what he loves the most it is too late to undo the damage and this leads to one last tragedy.This is Douglas in an early fine if not huggable role and is recommended viewing for that reason alone. William Bendix makes up for the lack of likability in Douglas' character as Detective Lou Brady who likes to temper the letter of the law with a little humanity. Then there's a very young Lee Grant as a shoplifter who just can't stop babbling. Finally there's Horace McMahon as Lieutenant Monaghan head of the detective squad and the kind of boss we'd all like to have.".

By the time McLeod realizes his own inflexibility and lack of empathy have cost him what he loves the most it is too late to undo the damage and this leads to one last tragedy.This is Douglas in an early fine if not huggable role and is recommended viewing for that reason alone. William Bendix makes up for the lack of likability in Douglas' character as Detective Lou Brady who likes to temper the letter of the law with a little humanity. Then there's a very young Lee Grant as a shoplifter who just can't stop babbling. Finally there's Horace McMahon as Lieutenant Monaghan head of the detective squad and the kind of boss we'd all like to have.";

	schema:headline " The spiritual ancestor of Dirty Harry";
	schema:reviewBody "Detective Story is a film noir which tells the story of a day in the life of a New York police station. There are a number of strands to the plot dealing not only with the detectives who live there but also with various people who are arrested on suspicion of crime including an abortionist a young embezzler a pair of burglars and a female shoplifter. The main character is Detective Jim McLeod. He has been described as an embittered cynic but that is probably inaccurate. He is a man with strongly held moral principles he is a devout Catholic who holds criminals in contempt and will do anything to obtain a conviction including using the sort of strongarm methods to force a confession which even in the fifties would have been frowned upon by his superiors. We learn that Jim McLeod's attitude towards criminals derives from his own troubled past and his hatred of his father himself a criminal who habitually abused McLeod's mother. An important strand in the plot involves the embezzler Arthur Kindred. Arthur is a young man of previous good character who was tempted to steal from his employer in order to impress his girlfriend a successful model used to leading the high life. We never see this girlfriend in the film but her younger sister Susan who seems to be in love with Arthur herself arrives at the precinct with 120 hoping that if she can repay the stolen money the employer will agree to drop charges. The man is willing to do so until he is bullied into pressing charges by McLeod who believes that if you show mercy to a first offender he will go on to commit further crimes. We learn that Arthur has a distinguished war record but in 1951 anyone with five years wartime military service would have had to have been rather older than the 24yearold Craig Hill. Perhaps the action is supposed to take place at an earlier date shortly after the end of the war. An even more important plot strand involves the abortionist Dr Karl Schneider. The film in fact never actually uses the words abortion or abortionist which at the time would have been forbidden by the Production Code and instead makes vague reference to baby farming. Reading between the lines however there can be little doubt that Schneider has in fact been carrying out illegal abortions. Although McLeod despises all criminals he has a particular hatred for abortionists especially Schneider whom he sees as a butcher and killer of young women and has no compunction about subjecting the doctor to physical violence. It is suggested that McLeod's passionate loathing of Schneider must be rooted in some episode in his past.In some ways McLeod can be seen as the spiritual ancestor of Dirty Harry Popeye Doyle Frank Bullitt and the other tough guy cops of the late sixties and seventies who took a similarly robust attitude towards law enforcement. Detective Story however is not simply a tough guy cop film made a decade and a half before they became fashionable. It was based upon a successful Broadway play and betrays its theatrical origins for the most part it is set in a single building the precinct itself and there is little physical action apart from the final denouement. Perhaps more importantly it takes a different attitude towards crime and punishment to that taken by the average tough guy cop thriller. Whereas the scriptwriters of the seventies generally took an admiring view of the likes of Harry Callahan in Detective Story McLeod's uncompromising stance towards criminals is criticised even by his own wife as harsh unforgiving and at odds with his professed Christian faith.The film was nominated for four Oscars including Best Director for William Wyler but did not win in any category. The Best Actress nomination for Eleanor Parker as McLeod's wife Mary was welldeserved although I thought that Lee Grant was rather fortunate to be nominated for Best Supporting Actress in a very minor role. Surprisingly there was to be no Best Actor nomination for Kirk Douglas's performance as McLeod one of a number of characters he played during this part of his career who were forceful aggressive and often to some degree unsympathetic. Others include Midge Kelly in Champion and Jonathan Shields in The Bad and the Beautiful. Douglas was to be unlucky in his relationship with the Academy receiving only three Oscar nominations in his distinguished career and never winning.Detective Story has its faults it is at times too melodramatic and it is overreliant on coincidence. I won't give away the rather implausible set of circumstances on which the ending depends as I don't want to write a spoiler. Overall however it is a decent film with some good acting especially from Douglas some powerful dialogue and something worthwhile to say about issues of wrongdoing guilt and forgiveness. 710".

The film in fact never actually uses the words abortion or abortionist which at the time would have been forbidden by the Production Code and instead makes vague reference to baby farming. Reading between the lines however there can be little doubt that Schneider has in fact been carrying out illegal abortions. Although McLeod despises all criminals he has a particular hatred for abortionists especially Schneider whom he sees as a butcher and killer of young women and has no compunction about subjecting the doctor to physical violence. It is suggested that McLeod's passionate loathing of Schneider must be rooted in some episode in his past.In some ways McLeod can be seen as the spiritual ancestor of Dirty Harry Popeye Doyle Frank Bullitt and the other tough guy cops of the late sixties and seventies who took a similarly robust attitude towards law enforcement. Detective Story however is not simply a tough guy cop film made a decade and a half before they became fashionable. It was based upon a successful Broadway play and betrays its theatrical origins for the most part it is set in a single building the precinct itself and there is little physical action apart from the final denouement. Perhaps more importantly it takes a different attitude towards crime and punishment to that taken by the average tough guy cop thriller. Whereas the scriptwriters of the seventies generally took an admiring view of the likes of Harry Callahan in Detective Story McLeod's uncompromising stance towards criminals is criticised even by his own wife as harsh unforgiving and at odds with his professed Christian faith.The film was nominated for four Oscars including Best Director for William Wyler but did not win in any category. The Best Actress nomination for Eleanor Parker as McLeod's wife Mary was welldeserved although I thought that Lee Grant was rather fortunate to be nominated for Best Supporting Actress in a very minor role. Surprisingly there was to be no Best Actor nomination for Kirk Douglas's performance as McLeod one of a number of characters he played during this part of his career who were forceful aggressive and often to some degree unsympathetic. Others include Midge Kelly in Champion and Jonathan Shields in The Bad and the Beautiful. Douglas was to be unlucky in his relationship with the Academy receiving only three Oscar nominations in his distinguished career and never winning.Detective Story has its faults it is at times too melodramatic and it is overreliant on coincidence. I won't give away the rather implausible set of circumstances on which the ending depends as I don't want to write a spoiler. Overall however it is a decent film with some good acting especially from Douglas some powerful dialogue and something worthwhile to say about issues of wrongdoing guilt and forgiveness. 710";

On the debit side by today's standards all of the most intense performances seem more than a little melodramatic. And that includes Douglas and Parker.Yet the film remains fascinating. Kirk's character a man of rigid principles with a strict moral code is unable to forgive his wife for her past indiscretions and his wife realizes that she can't live with a man who's unable to let go of his accusing nature.LEE GRANT does a brilliant job as a nerdy shoplifter although her New York accent seems a bit forced at times. All the precinct characters including WILLIAM BENDIX and FRANK FAYLEN are marvelously well cast as is CATHY O'DONNELL as the sweet young thing who wants to do the right thing for a good guy nabbed for embezzling.It all works beautifully as directed by William Wyler with the melodrama reaching a fever pitch once certain disclosures are made involving Kirk's marital problems.Summing up Outstanding performances and riveting story make this a must see.".

This movie is much more than stylish  it has oodles of substance. The story unfolds largely within the confines of a police station and much of the action occurs within one large room. The pacing is brisk and most of the characters are introduced fairly early. Kirk Douglas turns in an intense performance as Jim McLeod  a ruthless crime fighting cop who has a stark view of the world as made up of good guys and bad. He and prosecutes all crime no matter how minor with a brutal zeal. He does not believe in extenuating circumstances. The first half of the movie leads you to think that you are watching an entertaining crime drama where McLeod is the upright cop who whilst chafing at the bounds of permissible legal conduct seeks to bring an influential wealthy and welllawyered crook to justice. In his mind McLeod has convicted and damned the crook with a ferocious loathing. It is the sudden midstory twist that brings this film into its own. McLeod's relentless persecution precipitates a personal crisis that will alter his own life forever. In the second half the movie grapples with surprising emotional intensity with eternal questions  who are we to judge in damning others do we damn ourselves and how do we bring ourselves to forgive? I was so engrossed that I postponed my loo break until the very end. This is a fantastic movie  loved it.".

Having seen A Walk to Remember I figured it'd be another Mandy Moore chick flick  not bad but nothing special.This movie just didn't work. Using two different teen novels as a basis for a plot didn't work. The plot was all over the place my friend also a seventeen year old female and I would stare at the screen and whisper What the hell was that? every five minutes. This movie had every cliche imaginable teenage pregnancy divorce marriage birth death car accident. If reading that seemed random try watching it. It's ridiculous. Oh and I neglected to mention the pot smoking grandmother.Here are a few examples about what just didn't work in this movieAbout 1015 minutes into the film a boy collapses on the soccer field. He's clutching his stomach and my friend and I both immediately thought Oh appendicitis. Next shot this is after he passes out and people are surrounding him he's on the ground clutching his chest. Dramatic voiceover is something along the lines of him dying of a heart defect.Insert my friend and I and other audience members saying What the hell?Another scene. The best friend is pregnant. She and Halley Mandy Moore are talking afterwards and Scarlett the friend is wearing a tank top with four pictures of the GERBER BABY. What the hell?!It goes on and on. Honestly if we'd realized 20 minutes into it how disorganized and poorly put together it was going to be we would've left. The only reason we stuck around the whole time was because we'd sat through it for so long that we couldn't get our 9.25 back if we left.As far as the acting goes Mandy Moore was decent but I didn't really get her character. As I haven't read the two novels this movie was based on I don't even know if she was playing two different characters or one. Actually when Halley would do a total 180 between scenes my friend and I joked whether they pulled the scene from novel one or novel two. As for Trent Ford...I'm not going to discuss his looks other than in this statement because I don't think criticizing an actors appearance does any good. As far as the actual acting went...It was pretty rough. Didn't do anything for me. A couple of the supporting characters played by Allison Janney and Alexandra Holden were ok others Mackenzie Astin Mary Catherine Garrison were as terrible as Trent Ford.One can only hope that if Mandy Moore wishes to be taken seriously as an actress she'll accept a better script next time because she's not a terrible actress.I gave it 310 and that's only for the noncomedy induced laughs my friend and I as well as several other members of the very small audience had.".

Her best pal does but is heartbroken when her boyfriend drops dead on the football field of a heart defect err...like me. Halley's parents have split and found others her sister is engaged to some guy and all they do is argue. It seems like the best way to deal with love is to avoid it.All that changes when Halley meets Macon stupid name a geeky Star Wars nerd. He seems like a dweeb at first but his character grows on you as he does Halley. He's played by Trent Ford and on the cover he's wearing a white vest and is marketed as a sexually neutral nonthreatening pretty boy Orlando Bloom Justin Timberlake etc but that ain't him or his character at all and he never appears in a vest at any point in the movie. I expected to hate him just because of the cover but that ain't so. In the course of her steadily strengthening relationship with Macom really what a stupid name! Halley learns how to deal with teen pregnancy being a bridesmaid her dopesmoking grandmother car crashes stepmoms stepdads etc. Stuff that every kid learns. Real kids not the kids that make love to pastries or live in mansions which are the only 2 types of kids Hollywood thinks exist.Taken from 2 separate novels by Sarah Dessen called 'Someone Like You' and 'That Summer' it's possible that How to Deal might have a sequel. And if it does its literary roots guarantee it will a better sequel than most.I recommend How to Deal for anyone who is sick to death of endless American Pie clones or Harold and Kumar or Maid in ManhattenLaws of AttractionTwo Weeks NoticeSweet Home Alabamablah blah blah. It's not a romantic comedy not by a long shot. It's far more realistic than that and it doesn't insult your intelligence. Give it a go.The DVD is in greatlooking 1.851 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby 5.1 sound. The extras are actually quite good for a change one of them focusing on Young Adult Literature and it's definitely a good DVD for the price.".

	schema:reviewBody "I actually had decent expectations for this one but found myself cringing throughout most of the film. There's really no goal in this movie. As I contemplated the hollow feeling of having wasted a couple hours watching the film I switched from passive viewer into active reviewer mode to determine why HTD didn't work on so many levels. First of all I wanted to empathize with Mandy Moore's character but there was nothing about her struggles that resonated at all. There was no growth pattern aka character arc to be found in her either she was just a whining disenchanted stereotype. Moore's character is the caricature of the frustrated teen who doesn't want to risk being loved for fear of getting hurt. Another factor that worked against the film was that they tried to cram too many subplotscharacters in and the main story did not benefit from most of that peripheral crap. Let's see we had the pregnant girlfried...the doper grandma...the father and his new wife...the mother and her new love interest...Halley's aloof but totally undesirable hippie boyfriend...the sister and her fiance's socioeconomic wranglings. It was headacheinducing fare to be sure. Halley's love interest just kept popping up never with a context or sense of why he was where he was. What did we know about the guy? Nothing. We didn't observe his home life. Didn't really learn his interests. He was simply inserted into different settings parking lots stores backyards etc. as though required by movie convention. The few scenes that were probably intended to endear us to the loser such as the funeral speech scene were presented pathetically with no emotional weight whatsoever. Third the lazy writing for this film threw so much overused tripe at us. For example you know a film is struggling when they have a dog hump one of the principle character's legs. Also the dopesmoking grandma seemed such a tired bit as well. After those ridiculous and unfunny insertions any attempts at serious drama in this schizophrenic film were greatly compromised. Casting and chemistry were certainly some weak points of the film as well. My significant other and I agreed that Mandy Moore did not seem in any way conceivably to be a blood relative to the mother in the film. They looked nothing alike. Granted this is hard to gauge but then I started to realize that other films pull this off very well. The lack of character changegrowth and of any conceivable end goal also made any attempts to generate a conflict or climax to the film moot. Toward the end when the boyfriend avoids her for a while it was merely yawninducing. This is supposed to be tension? This is supposed to make me concerned? Hardly. The film's efforts toward the end to generate some artificial excitement were particularly cloying and lame. In particular when the boyfriend forced his way on to the radio station's air waves as though he had to do something desperate and gritty to get Halley's attention I wondered why he hadn't thought to simply go to her house or call her on the phone. There was no indication that he had made any other more reasonable attempts to contact her. Therefore what could have been a sweet moment came off as a stunt and portrayed the love interest as a buffoon and social retard.I can only hope that Mandy finds better vessels for her talent in the future. Churning out garbage like this will do nothing for her reputation and continued employment in the film industry.".

	schema:reviewBody "How To Deal was a movie that I even as a guy highly anticipated long before it's release. With a wellselected and not overdone cast and a promising trailer I looked forward to seeing Mandy Moore's second leading role in a film. Her performance in A Walk to Remember was excellent reguardless of the fact it was her debut. Allison Janney is another actress I respect ever since her small role as the grouchy secretary in 10 Things I Hate About You. Her role did not require as much involvement as Mandy's and Trent's but she did well and contributed to this movie's good quality. Trent Ford was a debut and his acting was the bets in the whole movie. I also respect Alexandra Holden probably the most because unlike some young actresses like Hilary Duff she is building up a slow steady solid foundation of experience and fame as she climbs up the Hollywood ladder of sucess. I think she will be a very big star by the end of the year.Anyway I personally found this to be one of the best movies in a long time. Yes it was tacky pervasive and thematic at many times with it's dismissed and glorified themes of teen sex teen pregnancy and teen drug use but it conveyed itself in a way that has not been used as often lately and in a way that i truly enjoyed.I don't know if it was the tone cinematography costumes art direction or a little bit of each which made How to Deal a pleasantly enjoyable movie. It just was in its feeling that made me and others who enjoyed this movie forget about the abrupt and awkward wrapup of the story towards the end.The story is thick in subplots characters and their problems and relationships to others. This is what made it seem like a less of a thin movie than some may argue it was.The plot was interesting and almost kept you on the edge of your seat as you watched Hally struggle and hoped things would work out for her.This movie should have done much better and received better reviews than it did because it was quite a new experience that few appreciated. I give How to Deal an honest generous 910".

	schema:reviewBody "How to Deal is not a good movie.  It's a stab at a more adult and grown up teenage film and while it doesn't suffer from bad acting it does suffer from a horribly written script and what is most likely apathetic directing. Mandy Moore is a decent actress not great but decent and aside from Peter Gallagher she isn't put up against too many big names so she holds her own.  The problem is that all of these actors are trapped inside a poorly written movie.  There are too many specific instances where this film just doesn't cut it.  It boils down to this Mandy's character has to deal with her parents divorce her sister's wedding her father's remarrying her best friend getting pregnant with her deceased boyfriend's baby it's not what it sounds like and the fact that despite her misgivings about love falling in love with the high school clown named Macon.  Yes his name is Macon. The point is there is way too much going on and the movie does not adequately set up any of these events.  At one point Haley Mandy Moore's character blows up over her Mom not believing that she could remember the last time Haley's comet passed by.  She claims no one believes her when she tells people how she feels.  Unfortunately we never see anyone not believing her in the film and it seems more like the director told Mandy to blow up and get angry in this scene without telling her why.  Other problems include a random car crash into a tree head on that leaves a Honda Civic hatchback with nothing but a cracked windshield.  It leads to laughter it what is supposed to become an emotional scene.  There are a few funny moments but not many.  Allison Janney as Mandy Moore's mother is quirky but not funny although she has the only laughs in the movie. There is just too much wrong with this movie for anything to be right.  It has no real point or plot the acting is mediocre and you will laugh at parts that are supposed to be dramatic.  I can't think of anything good to say at this point so I probably should say nothing at all.".

It dealt with real problems that teenagers go through people die people get pregnant and people get broken hearts. Unlike most sleazy teen movies this one is realistic and the audience will most likely connect and understand what the characters are going through. Mandy Moore does a great job potraying the sweet and innocent Halley and there were also very funny performances by Alison Janney who played Halley's mother and Nina Foch who plays the stoned grandmother. Handsome newcomer Trent Ford doesn't do a bad job either and cutie Alexandra Holden is great too. I would give How to Deal 710.".

	schema:headline " A piece of love propaganda";
	schema:reviewBody "How to Deal would work so much better as a teen film refusing to conform to cookiecutter ideology if it didn't always seem like it was contradicting what it originally set out to do. Whether this issue was brought on by Sarah Dessen the author of That Summer and Someone Like You which the film is based off of or screenwriter Neena Beber is up to debate but for whatever reason How to Deal feels like a rebel being proved wrong foolish and worthless and I doubt that's how it was originally conceived.The story revolves around seventeen year old Halley Martin Mandy Moore who becomes disillusioned with the concept of love because of how it appears in her own life. Her mother is going through a rocky time after divorcing Halley's dad a senseless manchild of a radiojockey and her sister's forthcoming marriage with another man that seems to be made up of nothing but fighting and bickering. So because of these two things Halley simply doesn't believe in love anymore and goes on with her life with that mindset.This right here should be the plot of How to Deal but strangely Beber or Dessen perhaps decides to throw the film for a loop and have Halley be the subject of a love story with the geeky hunk Macon Trent Ford. This is where How to Deal seems to be contradicting itself. The film should be revolving around Halley's life rejecting love perhaps embracing hobbies becoming more artistic and sociable in her life and at school or even just being more comfortable around guys with the conflict potentially being rejecting her family and mistaking her family's love for ingenuous behavior if something were to go wrong in her life.Instead the film brings up a romance which feels offputting because it gives the message to young teens who maybe have questions about love the impression that if they think real love doesn't exist they are wrong and foolish because it does. How to Deal plays like love propaganda in the sense that its goal appears to be convincing a segment of the population who have rejected romantic notions and the idea that love makes people blind to reality usually hardhearted realists or mature pessimists see the stupidity of their ways and rethink their initial thoughts.Early on when the film is still trying to show us that Halley may be on to something with her ideology before pulling a complete threesixty with the story we get a glimpse at Halley with her close friend watching Halley's sister argue with her ex. Halley makes my aforementioned statement about love making people blind to reality by showing that while they fight and argue they will kiss and make up in a contrived way in just a few minutes. Such a thing unfolds. Right there the film has just proved Halley's point by saying that love makes people ignore or lessen the bad in life because they are so in awe with the person they are with. However just a few scenes later Halley is seen falling for Macon in a way just as contrived as the events we just saw unfold.Because of this little additional features about How to Deal can be admired with the exception of the cast's uniformly solid performances in making their characters at least somewhat believable in their personalities. Not every person in high school is like the cast of American Pie and How to Deal tries if stumbling in the process to show this segment in a way that doesn't appear condescending. Mandy Moore seems to be born to play the role of a rebellious teen girl questioning conventions within society and conformity due to a heavilypraised idea. It isn't her fault that the potential impact of her character is cheapened by a screenplay that has an abrupt change in its message halfway through the film.Another compliment as backhanded as it sounds is that How to Deal is never boring despite what I find to be a glaring inconsistency with its story and message. Many poorlydone romantic comedies become tired early on and very repetitive but the characters and their actors decide to be upbeat about their roles and all seem committed to the material. Perhaps they saw something I'm missing. This is an entry in the new genre I'll call love propaganda and I'm hoping another film won't fall into that category.Starring Mandy Moore Allison Janney and Trent Ford. Directed by Clare Kilner.".

Jordon is an innocent guy who gets swept into big time trouble after sharing a cab with an operative named Janet Dunn Kathleen Quinlan who's being pursued by traitorous American thugs. They desperately want their hands on a valuable computer tape and will do anything to get it. Wilder's reallife love Gilda Radner plays the young woman eager to help him out and she has her own reason for doing so although he won't be aware of this for a while. Not only are these spies out to get him but the cops in NYC assume him to be a killer. When WILL innocent movie characters learn not to pick up murder weapons? Knowing that Hanky Panky was originally intended as a reunion of director Sidney Poitier and actors Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor after Stir Crazy makes one wonder what could have been as the comedy fireworks would certainly have been even greater. As it is Wilder and Radner who's cute and adorable do have an energetic chemistry. The movie itself is pretty entertaining and energetic itself moving along very well and offering up some good action sequences Poitier does a nice job with the material. The movie actually takes itself rather seriously much of the time but there are still some good comedy moments especially when Michael steals a tuxedo and while aboard a bus realizes it belonged to a magician and the sequence with a sickly airplane pilot where Michael has to take the controls. Suffice it to say there aren't many people who can freak out as well as Gene Wilder. Hanky Panky finds him in fine form and the supporting cast features a slew of recognizable and reliable actors. Richard Widmark as the chief heavy shows that he still had great villainous presence on screen well into his 60s. Also appearing are Robert Prosky Josef Sommer Johnny Sekka Jay O. Sanders and character actors Pat Corley James Tolkan Beau Starr Frankie Faison Larry Pine William Sadler and Victor Argo in small roles. This is of course no North by Northwest but it's not bad at all either remaining agreeable entertainment for a lively 108 minutes. At the least it's worth noting that this is where Wilder and Radner met. Seven out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "I can be short about this movie Hilarious. It made me laugh so much that I almost ran out of oxygen.Of course the story line is thin and the musical score is just horrible.... but it is about the slapstick the over the top panicking and the making fun of and the trying to escape from the otherwise in real life quite scary and threatening situations.Of course the airplane scene is the most funniest scene I have ever seen in a movie. It appeals on everyone's fears that when in an airplane you could crash and that the pilot is just a person of flesh and blood who could become ill or whatever. I am sure that every airplane passenger with a little bit of fear of flying has thought about this.And the airplane scene is not funny because the pilot is belching like I read in a review. That would mean this film would be on the level of the Naked Gun series. The belching is just the introduction to this scene the warming up. You think that this must be the funny part and you start to laugh a little bit while thinking Is this supposed to be funny?. But when you know Gene Wilder's humour you know it can not stop there.No the comedy starts after this when the pilot dies. When Gene Wilder just does not want to know the truth and just does not want to face reality and chooses to deny reality to which audiences can relate everyone at least at one point in their lives chooses to put their head in the sand. But when Gene Wilder does it he does it in such a hilariously hysterical funny way.This film always stayed with me over the years. And I just saw it again and it made me laugh just as hard as it did before when I was in my teens.So go along with the make believe do not demand a solid script and just go with the slapstick and the hysteria. And laugh!".

Oh did I forget to mention the really beautiful scenery of the Grand Canyon when flying within the Canyon was still allowed? This flight is really a wild ride and there are some lowlevel laughs in the cabin how much intestinal gas can a fat pilot stand before he suddenly dies of what? in midair? If you're in for computer history observe the excessive use of data tape and the by then stateoftheart 3Dgraphics. Actually this movie has its very funny moments but by today's standards its pace is slow despite the fact that WilderJordan is frantically running away from someone something or else all the time. And the DVD is too expensive for not featuring any special features except of a full screen trailer.

	schema:reviewBody "In 1982 Gene Wilder took a break from writing and the director's chair to solely serve as the star of Sidney Poitier's 1982 film Hanky Panky. Pairing with him as a female lead was Gilda Radner. The two first met on the set and love quickly blossomed culminating in a marriage a few years later. It all began on Hanky Panky where the two principles become two people one wrongly accused of a crime running from the law together to protect their names and solve a mystery while they're at it. Michael Jordon Gene Wilder is an architect visiting New York on business when he jumps into a cab with a distressed woman Janet Dunn Kathleen Quinlan. Through flirting and trying to get Janet to have a drink with him she tells him she is on the run and asks him to put an envelope into a mailbox for him. Michael obliges and unwittingly puts himself in harms way delivering this package. to try to clear things up Michael travels back to the hotel she was staying in only to find her in a scuffle with another man. Being filmed on camera at the scuffle with a gun in his hand he is believed to be the nefarious character she was fighting with. With everyone chasing him despite his innocence Michael tries to evade seeking refuge in the apartment he was staying in while in New York. As he is packing his suitcase in the apartment a woman Kate Hellman Gilda Radner comes in and believing she is a burglar Michael fights her until the lights are turned on and the two realize neither is a danger. When the police show up at the apartment Michael has to leave immediately and Kate decides to come with him to both aid in clearing his name and investigate her brother's death personally. Neither can expect just what they will have to do to get these goals accomplished but are in it together as long as it takes. It is almost magical to see a real life romance blossom onscreen. Gene Wilder and Gilda Radner's incredible chemistry is apparent even if one is only half watching the film. The chemistry is sensational you can really tell the two are falling in love and makes Hanky Panky all the more fun to watch. There were also a number of great comedic gags in the film. The scene in which Michael takes over flying a plane is almost as hilarious as the scene in which Michael needs a change of clothes and takes a magic suit and can't find his change on a bus. The comedy was not without its flaws however. For instance there is so much going on in the film that not everything gets fleshed out by the film's end. The entire mystery is never solved or revealed to the audience so it is a little hard to become too invested in the film. That being so Hanky Panky is a good Saturday night comedy that you won't regret watching even if it's only to see Gene Wilder and Gilda Radner fall in love.".

The chemistry is sensational you can really tell the two are falling in love and makes Hanky Panky all the more fun to watch. There were also a number of great comedic gags in the film. The scene in which Michael takes over flying a plane is almost as hilarious as the scene in which Michael needs a change of clothes and takes a magic suit and can't find his change on a bus. The comedy was not without its flaws however. For instance there is so much going on in the film that not everything gets fleshed out by the film's end. The entire mystery is never solved or revealed to the audience so it is a little hard to become too invested in the film. That being so Hanky Panky is a good Saturday night comedy that you won't regret watching even if it's only to see Gene Wilder and Gilda Radner fall in love.";

	schema:reviewBody "This will not be numbered among the better films made by Sidney Poitierdirector Gene Wilder star nor Richard Widmark supporting actor all of whom have been involved with superior films but will provide a solid base for an evenings entertainment. The plot is of the genre in which Bob Hope Danny Kaye Red Skelton Gene Wilder himself and many others before and since have made excellent use for laughs the spy thriller comedy. I don't know that I would call them a spoof on the serious film sinceoften they do have their own brand of suspense and thrills but they can be very funny indeed. In this case the writers have relied far too much on some of Wilder's trademarked vocal emissions and far too little on his ability to deliver comedy lines and gestures. In fact it is as difficult to find a funny line in the film as it is to find a novel plot device. Wilder does as well as could be expected under the circumstances which for me was the major source of fun though not laughs. Gilda Radner was completely wasted given no opportunity to do more than any third rate actress could have equaled. Richard Widmark is menacing early on but becomes wooden as the dialogue and action descend to Perils of Pauline levels. There are a number of other highly capable actors who sink under the weight of the script. This is also a wonderful movie where you can see the comedic chemistry between Gene Wilder and Gilda Radner.Overall rating 7 out of 10.".

Of course Gilda Radner is no Eva Marie Saint in fact Gilda is surprisingly subdued in Hanky Panky.Gene is an innocent schnook who is subletting an apartment from a man who gets killed. Wilder is from Chicago and by being there gets himself involved with the poisoning of National Security chief Robert Prosky and the shooting of Kathleen Quinlan and has the cops and everyone else chasing him. The Hitchcockian McGuffin is a computer tape with all kinds of secret codes that can't be copied except it has. Richard Widmark who has reverted here to one of those villainous types from his early days in film is working for a high level traitor who we only learn the identity of in the last minutes of the film.Wilder's hysterical style was a bit over the top.

It is a mess of a plot with familiar character players popping up in minute long cameos. It took a while for this to get off the ground and I breathed a sigh of relief when Gilda showed up. Unfortunately there aren't really any major laughs and far too many plot twists none of which are thick enough to fill up the holes.

It is a mess of a plot with familiar character players popping up in minute long cameos. It took a while for this to get off the ground and I breathed a sigh of relief when Gilda showed up. Unfortunately there aren't really any major laughs and far too many plot twists none of which are thick enough to fill up the holes. Gene and Gilda deserved a lot better than this especially in a film directed by Sidney Poitier.";

Really this movie takes itself way too seriously and really amongst this seriousness the story is very vague or tells us little about why Quinlan bought itwhere more is known near the end.

It seems that a town legend of the Tooth Fairy is haunting his imagination and Walsh had similar experiences. Is the Tooth Fairy more than just a childhood myth? It's so much fun watching films multiple times. It's very rare that my opinion remains the same on a film from one viewing to the next. Sometimes my rating goes down sometimes it goes up and sometimes it stays the same but I like or dislike the film for different reasons than I did on my first viewing. Darkness Falls 2003 is a case where my rating has gone up quite a bit since my last encounter with it. I think the difference this time was for two primary reasonsone when I first saw this in the theater it was in the midst of a slew of horror films that had similar themes and maybe I was getting tired of it by the time I watched this one and two I think the positive aspects worked well enough for me this time that I was more forgiving of the few flaws the film has.And it does have flaws. Let's get those out of the way first. The main flaw for me was some of the superfast editing during the horror action scenes. Occasionally it was so fast that I couldn't very well tell what was going on. However I also realized this time that at least occasionally the editing is perfect for the scene. For example there is a scene set the small town police station that is inherently chaotic. Chaotic editing is the only thing that would fit.The other flaw is that there are occasional lapses in plot logic. The most crucial for me occurred during the climax where there were a couple actions taken that I was a bit confused about. It didn't help that the climax is also slightly marred with hyperactive editing.However in both of those cases the good stuff far outweighed the bad for me. The villain in Darkness Falls is excellent in conception and design. The backstory is captivating. When it's initially told through a slideshow during the opening credits I was thinking that I would have preferred them to give me a 10minute historical prologue but in retrospect I'd prefer to see an entire film that's a prequel telling the villain's story. I loved the small town setting of the film and the interactions of the characters in the script. They seemed like real people to me with entwined pasts. I loved the three main characters and thought their performances were very good. Since I'm a big Buffy The Vampire Slayer fan that might have supplied Emma Caulfield with some unconscious bonus points but I loved her acting here.What really matters in a film like this is the horror material and director Jonathan Liebesman handles it skillfully. Although I'm not usually a fan of modern films having shorter running times it was more understandable back in the days of literal A and B films on the same bill at a theater Darkness Falls is compact because there is little dead time between the suspenseful material. Liebesman only spends as much time as necessary with serious drama to amplify the horror. These types of scenes were handled well enough to make me either forget or not care if there were any rules broken when it comes to keeping the villain at bay.Although I'm not someone who finds films scary I can see Darkness Falls working for many viewers in terms of frights. Many primal fears are touched upon. There is an excellent extended bit in complete darkness you only hear the soundtrack and of course darkness and things coming out of the darkness is a major theme throughout. You also get scenes of claustrophobia loss of control elevators hospitals and many other situations that should work on more receptive viewers' sensibilities.This one is worth seeing but approach it more in the frame of mind of a fun rollercoaster ride than a literary masterpiece.".

	schema:reviewBody "As a young boy Kyle Walsh Chaney Kley claims to have seen the fearsome Tooth Fairy kill his own mother. He also claims that having seen her she wont stop until she kills him also. Years later and still haunted by the experience of that night Kyle must return to Darkness Falls to aid his childhood sweetheart Caitlin Greene Emma Caulfield and her kid brother Michaelwho seems to be at risk from the Tooth Fairy this time around. Can Kyle confront his fears and end the 150 years of terror that has blighted Darkness Falls?Pretty much despised by the discerning horrorphile Darkness Falls to me at least is a creepy interesting and totally enjoyable thrillerghost picture worth reappraisals. From the excellent and chilling opening credits where we nicely have a back story to work from to the final confrontation Darkness Falls ticks most of the ghostly requisites that is asked of it. Scary demon troubled children 9night terrors should be explored more in cinema I feel cannon fodder bullies cannon fodder obnoxious coppers and a constant sense of unease and dread. All of which is provided in Jonathan Liebesman's 9The Texas Chainsaw Massacre The Beginning film. It's with the sense of dread that I feel Darkness Falls deserves a better reputation. Hand on my heart I know the film isn't a scary boo jump picture something that is unforgivable to many genre supporters but atmosphere goes a long way to creating a good thrillerghost story picture. Darkness Falls has it in spades. It's also a film that is a nice antidote to the blood beast torture subgenre of film's that seep out from the multiplexes on a seemingly weekly basis.Any expectation of an outright horror film should be quickly extinguished prior to a first time viewing and if noise annoys and staccato editing bugs you? Well stay away. Also don't line up if one demands great acting in a budget restricted piece such as this since both Kley  Caulfield are adequate at best. But give it a go if you understand that a preposterous plot and preposterous set pieces are a prerequisite for horror films of this type. I say that since I've seen many comments decrying Darkness Falls for it's unbelievable elements  only to then search their other comments to find praise for even more ludicrously plotted pieces! Or give it a go knowing it's more about the creeping stalking menace side of horror or that it's also an action thriller as well as an uneasy story. Maybe just maybe you will enjoy it for what it is? Otherwise I guess you will be looking forward to Hostel 22 or another Jason Attacks The Eiffel Tower movie... 710RIP Chaney Kley aged just 34.".

	onyx:emotionText "As a young boy Kyle Walsh Chaney Kley claims to have seen the fearsome Tooth Fairy kill his own mother. He also claims that having seen her she wont stop until she kills him also. Years later and still haunted by the experience of that night Kyle must return to Darkness Falls to aid his childhood sweetheart Caitlin Greene Emma Caulfield and her kid brother Michaelwho seems to be at risk from the Tooth Fairy this time around. Can Kyle confront his fears and end the 150 years of terror that has blighted Darkness Falls?Pretty much despised by the discerning horrorphile Darkness Falls to me at least is a creepy interesting and totally enjoyable thrillerghost picture worth reappraisals. From the excellent and chilling opening credits where we nicely have a back story to work from to the final confrontation Darkness Falls ticks most of the ghostly requisites that is asked of it. Scary demon troubled children 9night terrors should be explored more in cinema I feel cannon fodder bullies cannon fodder obnoxious coppers and a constant sense of unease and dread. All of which is provided in Jonathan Liebesman's 9The Texas Chainsaw Massacre The Beginning film. It's with the sense of dread that I feel Darkness Falls deserves a better reputation. Hand on my heart I know the film isn't a scary boo jump picture something that is unforgivable to many genre supporters but atmosphere goes a long way to creating a good thrillerghost story picture. Darkness Falls has it in spades. It's also a film that is a nice antidote to the blood beast torture subgenre of film's that seep out from the multiplexes on a seemingly weekly basis.Any expectation of an outright horror film should be quickly extinguished prior to a first time viewing and if noise annoys and staccato editing bugs you? Well stay away. Also don't line up if one demands great acting in a budget restricted piece such as this since both Kley  Caulfield are adequate at best. But give it a go if you understand that a preposterous plot and preposterous set pieces are a prerequisite for horror films of this type. I say that since I've seen many comments decrying Darkness Falls for it's unbelievable elements  only to then search their other comments to find praise for even more ludicrously plotted pieces!

	schema:reviewBody "A couple of years ago Teeny Bopper horror movies were the ones that made the most money. Now it seems that there has been a slight variation. Teenspeople in their young 20ies are now pitted against mythical monsters instead. Jeepers Creepers was the first of these and this Darkness Falls is the latest.While I didn't enjoy Jeepers Creepers I did actually find the sequel Jeepers Creepers 2 if you didn't know quite enjoyable. So a couple of weeks after renting JC2 I went back to the video store and saw Darkness. I had seen it on the shelves before but back then it had not sparked my interest. But now I rented it and along with some chips I went back to my house hoping that this would be a good movie.The first thing I noticed was that I had picked the wrong kind of chips. Then I popped the DVD into the player.The plot is quite simple and something we have heard a hundred times before. An old lady used to live in the city of Darkness Falls about 150 years ago. The people around town used to call her the tooth fairy cause she used to give children money when they had lost a tooth. One day she was accused of having killed two children and was hanged by the townsfolk. With her last breath she cursed the town of Darkness Falls.Fastforward to present time well almost. Young Kyle Walsh has just lost the last of his child's teeth and merrily hops into bed thinking he'll get some cash for it. Instead the murderous tooth fairy emerges and even though Kyle manages to escape by staying in the light his mother bites the dust.Fastforward again and we find Kyle now in his early twenties living alone very disturbed by his constant nightmares of the tooth fairy. We learn that she is still haunting him trying to kill him since he has seen her. But by staying out of the darkness and in the light the tooth fairy cannot enter the light he has survived. Kyle gets a phonecall from an old girlfriend from his childhood Caitlin Greene whose brother has the same symptons that Kyle has. Kyle goes back to the city of Darkness Falls in hope of helping this poor kid out. But that's when the tooth fairy appears again and kills pretty much everyone who Kyle meets.The beginning of the movie where Young Kyle is attacked by the tooth fairy is immensly scare and tense. Very well done. I loved it. Unfortunetly after that the movie went downhill. Very downhill. The following 40 minutes has Kyle simply walking around talking to folks in his old town and telling his past to his ex Caitlin. This part of the movie is OK. But about 50 minutes into the movie we realize that this movie is utter garbage. Suddenly what started as a very good horror film has turned into somewhat of a... I don't really know what to call it. But Kyle travels from diffrent locations in the town at night and meets about 20 diffrent people. All of which are killed off in. One each minute. It's awful. At this point of the movie the plot is completly abandoned and all we can comprehend is Kyle yelling Stay in the light! Pitch Black anyone? and people being grabbed by the tooth fairy and dragged into the darkness.It's to bad this movie turned into such a stinker. It had alot of promise. A cool villain some good actors a very nice soundtrack and some nice directing and editing in the FIRST part of the movie. Bottomline is don't even rent this film. If someone you know happens to own it ask if you can watch the first ten minutes of it then turn  it off. Believe me it's not worth watching the whole movie even though it's only 82 minutes long and that includes ending credits of ca 11 minutes3  10.".

	schema:reviewBody " out of I find it rather hard to believe that in the past year we've had five movies dealing with vengeful supernatural spirits andor curses. It began with Feardotcom then Below The Ring easily the best of the bunch Ghost Ship and now Darkness Falls which could very well be the worst. In the latest example of PG13 horror there's nothing here that's the slightest bit scary or thrilling. The atmosphere is nonexistent the premise really isn't very promising and the execution is even more lackluster.The film has a very simple premise old lady killed over a hundred years ago is now a restless spirit who goes around murdering children who've lost their first tooth they also have to see her face first or something like that not like the movie was holding my attention. Anyway after the film dispenses with TWO prologues which takes up nearly fourteen minutes of running time we settle with our protagonist Kyle Walsh Chaney Kley who encountered this evil tooth fairy as a child and wants to help his former girlfriend's Emma Caulfield younger brother through the same ordeal. Naturally no one believes Walsh and they'll live well not for long to regret it. Horror is probably my favorite genre and while last year did give us The Ring simply one of the scariest films I've ever seen and Below an excellent ghost ship thriller that's much better than Ghost Ship most of these big studio genre offerings don't seem to realize what it is that makes horror films so fun to watch. They don't have to be bonechillers they just have to be easy entertainment which is what Darkness Falls strives for but fails at almost miserably.First I'd like to mention the preposterously short running time. Without the end credits this puppy runs for seventyfour minutes shorter than your average TV movie sans commercials. Then knock off the prologues and we've got approximately an hour of material that focuses on the lead actors and their plight. This is obviously a movie that doesn't have much in the way of plot but you probably figured that when you saw the town's name was Darkness Falls groan. The Ring worked because of its chilling atmosphere engaging mystery and fine performances. To a lesser but still formidable extent the same goes for Below. Darkness Falls doesn't have the look and feel of a horrorthriller it certainly doesn't have enough plot and what story it has is peppered with plot holesyou'd think a town this cursed would have almost a minute population but it's a rather bustling little place and the acting is subpar. Director Jonathan Liebesman seems perfectly content with trying to give us boo scares which aren't the slightest bit effective loud noises lots of fast camera movements and lots of running and chasing.Running and chasing is exactly what fills up the movie's last twenty minutes when it suddenly opts for thrill ride mode but even that is as completely unengaging as all the material that came before it. Part of this has to do with how predictable the film is. You just know who's going to live and who's going to die. And even worse because it's PG13 you can't even be tantalized by the promise of gore and gratuitous nudity two staples of 80's horror which I'm starting to miss more and more.The major studios are still capable of making effective horror thrillers as evidenced by The Ring and Below and let's not forget the superb Jeepers Creepers or Joy Ride. Watch any of those films instead of this steaming pile.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie about a dead psychotic tooth fairy is surprisingly ordinary. It's Alienlike plot consists of the tooth fairy carefully tracking down and killing everyone in her path to kill a kid. You'd think she would be satisfied after killing three dozen people to get to the kid but even then she's not happy. Her pathological inhuman attention to detail kind of reminds me of Martha Stewart. Oh and she also wears a porcelain mask because she was burned really bad when she was alive once and the light hurts her face. Well I'm here to say that sunlight doesn't hurt burn victims so right there is one of the dumbest premises in the whole film. She isn't even remotely scary.The producer spared no expense for a great script. The movie's eighteenyearold high school scriptwriter wrote dialog such as thisShrill female actress Call the cops! Dopey male actor They're dead. Shrill female actress incredulously All of them? Dopey male actor Pretty much.So what happens at the end? Well like every other horror and action movie over the last twenty years the end takes place in a warehouselike setting in this case a lighthouse which looks like a warehouse on the inside. The main character Dumbo the action hero sets his arm on fire and uses the light from his burning arm to hurt her face. She's impervious to the twelve thousand bullets fired at her throughout the film but her weakness is fire. That and teeth. Okaaaaaay. Why watch Darkness Falls when you can watch the movies that inspired it Alien and Pitch Black. There's nothing this movie has that wasn't already done a hundred times better.".

Why is the evil tooth fairy killing everyone?!?! Isn't she supposed to kill only the children who peeked at her? Why kill the mother or in the present time everyone that's around the guy? It's beyond stupid. And the way the filmmakers play with the concept of how the evil tooth fairy is afraid of light is something straight out of Scooby Doo! This film reminded me a lot of GRAVEYARD SHIFT that terrible Stephen King movie. The pacing the look the blandness of both films and the awful script are very similar in quality.But the thing that's really disappointing is that the idea of an evil tooth fairy is actually cool. Everyone HATES going to the dentist. No one likes having teeth pulled etc. There is an underlying builtin fear in all of us about anything having to do with teeth  and had the concept been handled better it could have worked brilliantly. The concept is good but the execution is horrendous! This PG13 movie never exploits this innate fear and the whole thing ends up being ridiculous and overwrought. The Brothers Grimm knew how to take something from our childhood that was innocuous and twisted it enough to make it look creepy  terrifying. Had the producers had a smidget imagination and had turned the story into a Grimmlike horror story it would have worked.It's truly a pathetic attempt at horror certainly when filmmakers put children in jeopardy as recklessly as this one. The whole bland thing made me think that this was a christian produced horror film.".

DON'T BOTHER WATCHING DARKNESS FALLS AGAIN!For what it's worth here is the basic story A long time ago Matilda Dixon was known as the Tooth Fairy in the local community  for her friendliness to children. Unfortunately after a misunderstanding the townspeople done did her wrong and she died in less than ideal circumstances  fried. Oh yeah the town is called Darkness Falls.As you would expect she was pretty pd with events as they transpired being burnt alive and all. As you may not expect unless you've seen a horror film before she decided to come back to the town for a visit and she now kills anyone that sees her. We are told this by a very earnest narrator in a very serious sounding voiceover. I was already thinking So far  So hokey. The remainder of the movie turns to present day but raises more questions than it answers.We move to a young boy's bedroom he is say 13 years old and is hitting the sack. He has lost his last baby tooth that day as he prepares to jump into bed a shadowy figure flashes past his window left to right when he goes closer to investigate it turns out that the flash was his sorta girlfriend.Question 1 The bedroom is on the first floor how does she flash from left to right across the window? Question 2 Does any child realize when they lose their last baby tooth? Speaking for myself I had no idea until many years later but even then I only assumed that as it had been so long they all must have gone by now.The young boy is Kyle his girlbuddy is Kat and in around two minutes they have their first kiss and setup their first date and then Kat then. Nothing. I tell you NOTHING moved that fast when I was in my teens or my twenties for that matter.Shortly afterwards Kyle hits the hay and almost immediately enter stage left is the Tooth Fairy who I am sorry to say has a severe breathing problem. I can only surmise that the Tooth Fairy is hanging out with the chick from The Grudge cos she gurgles and sputters through the whole pic.The scene has one really good jump scare cheap but good. Kyle understandably cries out for Mummy who also understandably comes running. Mummy cops it. Kyle is accused as he is the only survivor in the house he is taken into care and ends up spending years with the psychiatrist.12 years later.Kyle and Kat is all growed up. Kat's little bro Michael sadly enough now has night terrors and it turns out that Kyle never got over his teen experience which shouldn't be that amazing if you think about it. Kat approaches Kyle to see if what he went through might give her a clue how to handle Michael's situation. Kyle gives it a shot but once it is evident that Michael is going through the real deal he backs away. I don't really have a point here but Michael must be about 10 or 11 and he tawks wike an absowute baby. Surely a speech counselor or perhaps his parents might have tried to rectify his speech impediment?Moving on once Kyle leaves the hospital people start dying around him again as a previous suspected offender he is under the microscope. Meanwhile at the hospital the doctor's have decided that reverse psychology is the go and will put Michael through tests that involve him immersing him in total darkness.It is about this time that it becomes clear that The Tooth Fairy TF from here can only operate in total darkness and light is her only enemy so from here on in we have another lights go off randomly film.Again like The Grudge we have a situation where the baddie manages to appear wherever the principal actor is even after they drive for an hour and it is evident that the TF is targeting Kyle and Michael almost exclusively every kill in the film though occurs with those that are fraternizing with either one of them.Question 3 What has Kyle been doing for 12 years if the TF has been gunning for him the whole time? Has he bought a lifetime pass at a tanning salon?What follows from here causes Kyle to stop by at a police station and a hospital where at both locations the lighting is cut off. Again the TF is hot on his tail and picking off anyone who sees her and plenty who don't for that matter despite Kyle repeatedly warning them of exactly what not to do.Question 4 If the Tooth Fairy only kills those that see her why not sit in the corner with your eyes shut until she leaves on Kyle's trail? Question 5 Why does neither the Police Station or especially the Hospital have better back up power?So we get another half hour or so of dialogue like thisOh no the light is dimming.Oh no the lights went out.Now the torch is dying.Now the lighthouse ! light is fading! Until I was happily saved by the onset of 10 full minutes of credits. This always amazes me a 70 minute movie with buggerall special effects requires 10 minutes to tell the viewer who was responsible for their creation?Final Rating  5.5  10. Another Uhoh. Lights went off again movie.If you liked this or even if you didn't try oneguyrambling.com".

	schema:reviewBody "Stars operating at the level of Halle Berry and Penelope Cruz are bound to disappoint critics along the way especially when the critics are just waiting for some sign of weakness upon which to feed. While there is nothing wrong with any of the acting in this film  these are not the kinds of roles Oscar winners and nominees are expected to indulge in. What's more Berry and Cruz signed onto a film made by a production team which has typecast itself with some fairly disappointing ghost stories  horror films involving bignames in the recent past.Finally this is one of those cases where the trailer was so good that the film could not possibly follow it. So what? If you approach this film without expectations and with an open mind you will be entertained. It's a tight disturbing psychologicalsupernatural thriller which though a little predictable at times nevertheless offers some frightening imagery and a few good solid scares. That said this is not a film for people who have trouble paying attention or for people who need straightforward answers. If you don't really pay attention to what is going on in this film you could easily dismiss it as a more adult version of Sixth Sense or just another dumb ghost story. This film deserves more credit than that. Personally I don't think it's a ghost story at all but that is a question best left open.I have seen a number of films by this team  House on Haunted Hill 13 Ghosts and Ghost Ship. Of these I found 13 Ghosts and the House on Haunted Hill to be entertaining but not very intelligent. Ghost Ship was tremendously disappointing  even Gabriel Byrne could not save that film. Gothika is easily the best of the lot and also the darkest. The film is shot in dark blue black and gray tones and the use of lighting is nothing short of artistic. Despite the clich title the occasional plot clichs and all the negative publicity generated by critics I found this film to be surprisingly entertaining intelligent and disturbing. Most of the 'plot holes' cited by some reviewers here on IMDb are more likely gaps in the attention spans of the viewers themselves or intentional ambiguities designed by the production team. This unlike any of this team's previous work does not provide unambiguous explanations.Cruz and Berry are respectively patient and psychiatrist in a high security prison for the criminally insane. The Gothic environment of this facility is not meant to be realistic but surreal and the effect works. From the first time you see the place you question its own reality. The film constantly manipulates mood through cinematographic techniques like this. Shortly after the film opens Berry finds herself experiencing what some of her allegedly delusional patients talk to her about. Robert Downey's portrayal of her friend and now therapist is uneven but satisfactory.To describe the rest of the plot would require spoilers so I won't bother. Suffice to say that even the occasional predictability of this film did not detract from my enjoyment of it. The film uses just enough ambiguity to permit the audience to wonder whether what they are seeing is really happening or whether it is a product of our protagonist's subconscious mind. And then in the end the film makes you question whether it matters.".

Let me just say it is not a waste of time. in fact the film was very enjoyable. it was shot well and the special effects were sophisticated and well handled. The cast was full of surprises such as Bernard Hillgreat actor but a strange role. The story was interesting and there was genuine tension throughout.Berry's character is a doctor in a mental institute. she wakes up to find herself an inmate in the very place she works. Her colleague and friend played by robert downy jnr tells her that she has committed a horrific crime and nobody knows why. so the plot begins to wind its way towards a shadowy truth. However without giving anything away the key scenes where important truths are revealed to the audience are simply too clumsy. information is just handed over visually on a plate and leaves little to the imagination. some of the tension built up inthe first half of the film is lost. and the truth isn't quite as gripping and terrifying as we would have hopedalthough thats not tosay it is pleasant.Robert Zemeckis was one of the producers and i think it shows..there is some great camera work and some really interesting ideas but gothika doesn't have some of the subtle touches that What Lies Beneath had but its easy to see some of the parallels between the two films.Even though halle berry wears the same look of shocked disbelief throughout the film she plays it with conviction. and a supporting role from penelope cruz certainly doesn't take anything away from berry.all in all gothika provides a good story an average screen play and enough innovative ideas to keep its audience. but i would have been disappointed if i had paid to watch it at the cinema.".

	schema:headline " You need to see it more than once to appreciate it . . .";
	schema:reviewBody "I'm not sure why so many critics hated this movie. I suspect that it has a great deal with how the movie was marketed. It is not a horror film plain and simple. It isn't quite a ghost story either. It is most definitely a psychological thriller. But most important I actually think the film delivers a series of important message about what truth means what sanity means and what the costs are of seeing and understanding the world only with logic and not with your heart and intuition. When I first saw the film I was confusedI did not fully comprehend the whole ghost component perhaps bc of the misleading marketing. Nevertheless I was intrigued and have since seen it several times. It gets better. I am using it to teach film specifically ghost films in a college level class because it uses and sometimes breaks with cinematic conventions in a way that is rather intelligent. The cinematographic technique is handled well and I appreciated the artful use of tracking shots match cutting closeups. I didn't feel that any one type of shot was overused or misused. Lighting is another example. Some may find the use of light heavy handed in this film. But I think it is used effectively to underscore the film's themes academicknowledge vs. intuitive knowledge science vs. spirituality the supernatural sanity vs. madness and where the truth fits into that. I also found the lighting downright pretty to look at. I have read some critiques that mention that the film is preposterous and unbelievable hinting that these problems stem from the film completely ignoring the conventions of realism. OF COURSE the film is not realistic. No correctional facility would ever be as dimly lit no psychiatrist would ever be allowed to be incarcerated with her former patients. I didn't think the plot was preposterous. It's outrageousnessthat someone so accomplished as Doug or as boring as the sheriff could actually be sadistic and violent is part of the message . . . all is not as it seems. The film relies heavily on convention. But I actually found that the intentional use of these conventions very satisfying. Water imagery lightning storms eerie music lightdark DevilGod visionthey were all used purposely and to good effect. A good example is the flickering lightseveryone knows that ghosts have electromagnetic effects in ghost movies but it's how they are used and set up as part of the science vs. supernatural theme that makes it interesting. So I wouldn't call this film clichd. I would say stylized and very selfconscious. The other think I liked upon further viewing is the juxtaposition of normalcy with the cinematic atmosphere of creepiness. There are realistic touches in several scenesfor example Miranda and the guard's chitchat about swimming and her comment Say hi to your wife and the sheriff's Say hi to Doug for me as Amanda pulls away from the roadblock for a truly lifechanging detour. But these are clearly placed ON PURPOSE into the heavyhanded ominous setting for effect. The effect on me was very decentering and I found in retrospect that technique itself foreshadowed Miranda's transition from the sane to the insane.Other details struck me as well the way you are right in Miranda's head in her relationship with the nurse. In the beginning they are just typical colleagues complaining about the lighting problems. But when that nurse came in to give Miranda her breakfast of meds she was so freakin' annoying I could really feel how an asylum might actually enhance insanity. Then the nurse goes on to tell Miranda to take a shower and Wash away her sins. Never caught that sadistic little exchange on the first viewing. Againclichd? I would argue intentionally stylized. I'll mention one more detail because I think it says a lot. When the guards are searching for Miranda and circling the pool they are carrying on in Miranda's old sane worldjoking chatting. And one of them comments Do professors always nail their pretty students? This provides a glimpse into Miranda's past life the assumption being that Doug may have seduced her while she was his student at the same time that it contrasts the sane world of the joking guards and the insanity that Miranda is beginning to understand. Finally I think the movie is a strong statement to beware of what we think of when we think of mental illness. This is tied to a feminist messagethe film uses the stereotype of women as representative of intuition the soul heart and spirit and men as the representation of logic law God and academic knowledge. During the course of the film the male world is exposed as potentially sadistic and violent Miranda integrates her female heart and intuition to prevail. The movie stays away from making this purely stereotypical since Miranda is in the world of logic at the outset. Robert Downey is a liminal character that prevents the movie from saying that all men are sadistic butchers. Plus Miranda makes a clear choice at the end of the film. She knows and accepts that she can see ghosts i.e. use her feminine powers but she clearly chooses to return to her masculine work rather than chase those ghosts. If she had fully integrated those two sides and ran off with Robert Downey Mr. Liminality? Now THAT would have been boring.".

On the way home one evening she has to take a detour and has a supernatural experience that winds up with her being an inmate in the same psychiatric prison now a patient of her former colleague Pete Graham Robert Downey Jr.. Gothika is an exploration of what happened to Miranda as she gradually uncovers a mystery.This was a very effective combination of a horror film and a suspensethriller for me. I rated it a 9 out of 10 only subtracting one point for a somewhat awkward beginning. While it's not anything particularly groundbreaking films do not need to be unprecedented for me to enjoy them a lot and give them high ratings.Visually Gothika follows the late 90searly 00s trend of desaturated films that have a predominant colorblue in this case. It creates an atmosphere that works very well for a horrorsuspense film of this type and that is heightened by the Gothic sets and production design the one shot we get of the exterior of the psychiatric prison makes it look like an old castle. Although the overall structure is more along the lines of a pedestrian thriller the film adeptly weaves horror and unusual stylistic elements throughout its length creating a whole greater than the sum of its parts. The performances are good and the script and direction will keep you guessing most of the time. My only other slight negative criticism is that the ending is somewhat abrupt and could be seen as leaving some loose threads. However it wasn't enough of a misstep that I subtracted another pointmy score remains 9 out of 10.This is a Dark Castle film so it's perhaps not surprising that some of the horrorrelated effects have a similarity to Thirteen Ghosts 2001 House on Haunted Hill 1999 and Ghost Ship 2002. It's also a safe bet that if you liked those films I loved all three and the idea of melding them with a thriller you'll like Gothika as well.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm a big fan of horror movies but deliberately tend to avoid the ones starring Alist actors and actresses. One of the most essential yet unwritten rules of the genre states the bigger the names involved in the production the weaker the shocks and the tamer the blood  gore effects. If this statement were an exact science then Gothika would be one movie to avoid at all costs with its allstar ensemble cast including Halle Berry Robert Downey Jr. Penelope Cruz Charles S. Dutton Bernard Hill and John Caroll Lynch. But this really isn't a bad movie at all in fact and the acclaimed names seemingly didn't form any restriction for director Mathieu Kassovitz creator of The Crimson Rivers and the brilliant crime thriller La Haine. The good news is that Gothika is a surprisingly grim and darkly atmospheric ghost story with a handful of genuinely eerie set pieces and uncomfortable moments. Perhaps it's the influence of the French director but it honestly feels like the movie aimed for chills  shock rather than to come across as politically correct. The bad news however is that the script is weak and incredibly predictable. The first twenty minutes still manage to be somewhat mysterious but as soon as the ghoststory aspects begin to unfold the denouement already becomes obvious to slightly experienced horror fanatics. Miranda Grey is a professional psychiatrist working in the same allgirls asylum as her husband Dr. Douglas Grey. She strongly believes there's a rational explanation for everyone and doesn't really listens to what her patients Chlo in particular have to say. Whilst driving home one rainy night Miranda becomes involved in a nasty car accident because there's a girl in the middle of the road. Next thing she knows Miranda wakes up as a patient in her own asylum and she's accused of murdering her husband. Shortly after she has ghostly visions again of the girl she saw on the road and it seems as if she's trying to tell Miranda something very important so she better learns to really listen. Even in spite of the sadly transparent and derivative plot Gothika manages to remain compelling and even somewhat engaging. Halle Berry is a marvelous actress as well as one of the most ravishing women on the planet and a joy to behold as the 'dame in distress'. She receives excellent support from the alwayscool Robert Downey Jr. and I never saw Penelope Cruz deliver a better performance. If I were her I would accept more crazylady roles. This certainly isn't the kind of stuff nightmares are made of but it's a worthwhile little thriller nonetheless.".

The first twenty minutes still manage to be somewhat mysterious but as soon as the ghoststory aspects begin to unfold the denouement already becomes obvious to slightly experienced horror fanatics. Miranda Grey is a professional psychiatrist working in the same allgirls asylum as her husband Dr. Douglas Grey. She strongly believes there's a rational explanation for everyone and doesn't really listens to what her patients Chlo in particular have to say. Whilst driving home one rainy night Miranda becomes involved in a nasty car accident because there's a girl in the middle of the road. Next thing she knows Miranda wakes up as a patient in her own asylum and she's accused of murdering her husband. Shortly after she has ghostly visions again of the girl she saw on the road and it seems as if she's trying to tell Miranda something very important so she better learns to really listen. Even in spite of the sadly transparent and derivative plot Gothika manages to remain compelling and even somewhat engaging. Halle Berry is a marvelous actress as well as one of the most ravishing women on the planet and a joy to behold as the 'dame in distress'. She receives excellent support from the alwayscool Robert Downey Jr. and I never saw Penelope Cruz deliver a better performance. If I were her I would accept more crazylady roles. This certainly isn't the kind of stuff nightmares are made of but it's a worthwhile little thriller nonetheless.";

Miranda goes to the girl to see if she's OK then... well then Miranda wakes up in the mental asylum where she once worked. Fellow psychiatrist  friend Pete Graham Robert Downey Jr. tells her that she is the prime suspect in the brutal killing of her husband Douglas Charles S. Dutton all the evidence points to Miranda  the fact she can't remember anything after she crashed doesn't help. While in the asylum Miranda starts to see ghosts that seem to want something unfortunately talk of ghosts by a mental patient isn't exactly given much credence by the staff...Directed by Mathieu Kassovitz along with with Thom Oliphant who has an 'Added Scenes' credit I thought Gothika was an OK supernatural murder mystery but nothing spectacular. The script by Sebastian Gutierrez plays like a cross between a ghost film like Poltergeist 1982  an Agatha Christie murder mystery it's a somewhat uneasy pairing  the two distinct genres never gel together or compliment each other that well. In my opinion it feels like a little haphazard. The film is a little drawn out too I'd have liked to have seen it as a 30 minute Tales from the Crypt 1989  1996 episode rather than a full length feature. The character's aren't that great with Downey being totally wasted as he just stands or sits in the background  does very little along with fellow mental patient Penelope Cruz who is totally surplus to requirements. I wasn't impressed with the twist ending either  I must admit that I guessed who the villains were quite early on after which it's just a case of dotting the I's  crossing the T's. Having said that it's a reasonable watch  if your stupid  don't guess the twists then it may surprise you.Director Kassovitz tries to make the audience jump at every opportunity  eventually it seemed like certain scenes were there solely to try  produce a cheap scare. There's a decent atmosphere  there's plenty of flashy camera moves along with it's 'nice to look at' visuals but this has to be the darkest mental hospital ever! It would be interesting to know the extent of Oliphant's involvement  what were the added scenes he directed. The whole film is a little bland  dull as it's very grey without much colour. Forget about any blood or gore this one tries to rely on scares  shocks rather than special effects.With a supposed budget of about 40000000 Gothika is well made  has that Hollywood look to it which is nice but at the same time it looks very staged  theatrical no hospital in the world has lighting like the one in Gothika. Personally I can't stand Berry as an actress as I don't think she can act  I don't think she's good looking either apparently she broke her arm while filming Gothika. The acting was alright but there was nothing special on show.Gothika is an OK watch in it's own way I suppose it's passable entertainment but it never gripped me engaged me or drew me into it's story. At the end of the day Gothika is all rather pedestrian big budget Hollywood flashiness with little substance just about worth watching I suppose.".

Miranda's car goes off the road but she manages to return to the young girl. The next thing we see is Miranda waking up in the asylum as a patient and not knowing why she is there. She is told that she is suspected of murdering her husband but can remember nothing. Dazed and confused and unsure of who to trust she begins to try and fill in the missing blanks of her memory. Has she really gone mad or did she actually commit the crime? She begins to have flashback visions especially after she learns the identity of the girl on the road that night. Is there an element of the supernatural at work here or is Mranda actually going mad? Director Mathieu Kassovitz keeps us guessing right up to the surprise ending. Berry gives a memorable performance as the confused doctor. She alternates between rational and irrational behavior in convincing fashion. Penelope Cruz plays a patient that Miranda had been treating and whom she meets on the inside. Downey does the best he can with his part as the doctor who might know more about Miranda's situation than he lets on. John Carroll Lynch plays Sheriff Ryan who had been close personal friends with the Greys and who turns on Miranda when she is charged with the murder of her husband.

	schema:reviewBody "I had such high hopes for Gothika. The trailers depicted a slick dark horror  thriller starring Halle Berry Penelope Cruz and Robert Downey Jr. The concept was especially intriguing as well. A psychiatrist Halle Berry at a women's penitentiary for the criminally insane has a horrible accident and wakes up as a patient in the asylum where she works I'm glossing over some spoilers here. From there she has to piece together why she is there and what is happening to her. As story ideas go it's really pretty good and mostly original.The first half of the movie moves along at a nice brisk pace and there's some decent jumpoutofyourseat scares thrown in for good measure. Penelope Cruz logs a credible performance as one of the more psychotic inmates at the penitentiary and Robert Downey Jr. in the role of another psychiatrist also does some nice work.I'd like to say that Halle Berry also puts in a good performance this film is her vehicle after all...but I can't. Though it's hard to say whether it's her fault or the limitations of the script. During her preaccident scenes she seems stiff and sterile in the role of criminal psychiatrist. It's like she's marking time until the meaty scary scenes start up. This makes it even harder for the audience to invest feelings into her character because Berry certainly doesn't. After she has the accident she spends a great deal of time running and screaming. It's a very operatic and aerobic performance but I wouldn't go so far as to call it acting.But these are not my biggest problems with the movie. Gothika actually does a good job of building suspense and mystery. You sit there thinking Wow! I wonder how they're going to tie all this together. And Gothika responds with a tenminute cinematic equivalent to the 50yard dash which reveals everything you need to know about the entire plot without actually thinking about it. There's none of the sly hints or gradual revelations we saw in The Sixth Sense. The film's whole plot lands at your feet like someone shooting a possum out of a tree. It would have been a little less disappointing had the big twist been believable or even interesting but it isn't. It just isn't.Unfortunately this happens a little over halfway through the movie and it's hard to imagine what they'll do with the remaining 45 minutes or so. The answer without giving anything away is Hollywood. It's a fast generic and an utterly lame conclusion that amounts to sticking a big gaudy red bow onto a movie that started strong but ends even more unbelievably than most lowbudget horror films.".

There's none of the sly hints or gradual revelations we saw in The Sixth Sense. The film's whole plot lands at your feet like someone shooting a possum out of a tree. It would have been a little less disappointing had the big twist been believable or even interesting but it isn't. It just isn't.Unfortunately this happens a little over halfway through the movie and it's hard to imagine what they'll do with the remaining 45 minutes or so. The answer without giving anything away is Hollywood. It's a fast generic and an utterly lame conclusion that amounts to sticking a big gaudy red bow onto a movie that started strong but ends even more unbelievably than most lowbudget horror films.";

There's that same claustrophobic sense of escapeproof doom closing in on one even more so here since it mostly occurs inside the one penal facility.  So long as you don't ask too many impertinent questions along the way it's not the worst little thrill ride ever.  But the ending oy vay....Halle Berry whose vehicle this clearly is plays a shrink working at an institution that looks and sounds like a prison at least the way Europeans like director M. Kassovitz envision our prisons but whose residents all seem to be female mental patients who've committed crimes.  She's married to Charles Dutton who runs the place and who seems too old for her but never mind.  Another shrink working there Downey seems to have a minor crush on her.  Driving home in a big storm Berry has to detour to a quaint little bridge the significance of which develops later where she has an encounter with a strange woman the trailer made it pretty clear she's a ghost. Next thing she knows it's three days later and she's on the other side of the locked door in her own facility accused of the murder of her husband.This switcheroo aspect was the most fascinating for me personally having known people who've been committed and the frustrations and indignities they endure in that anything they say or do is simply taken as further evidence of the conclusion that's already been reached about them. But we're also asked to swallow an awful lot e.g. that a respected staff member as Berry is depicted gets plopped down amongst the same people with whom she'd just been working with no regards for her personal safety with all her former colleagues ready to assume the worst about her.  Berry is great at what she's asked to do which is look confused andor terrified most of the time but it's a shame she wasn't required to do more.  One might have thought her supposedly bright character would have done better at putting her knowledge and experience to good use for herself especially since she clearly knew the Downey character had a crush on her.Since this is a Dark Castle production we expect a situation with not just frequent power failures and ghosts walking in herkyjerky motion but also Deep Dark Secrets to be uncovered.  Berry gets to do just that after one of the most contrived escapes ever recorded on film including a scene where she hides in a swimming pool for what seems half an hour she must have gills as well as lungs and since the guards walk AROUND the pool but don't think of aiming their flashlights INTO it they don't see her.  Then another guard instantaneously becomes her accomplice and even gives her his car keys presumably throwing his career away and risking prosecution but hell she's just so darn cute it's understandable.  She then licketysplit manages to learn ........................

Nice powers of observation Doc!  But we know how it is with guys and their hobbies right getting obsessed and all...After that it's mostly the standard catandmouse stuff as we wait endlessly for the second killer to get revealed we know it's not Downey 'cause that'd be too obvious  that really only leaves one candidate.  The bloody climax is staged pretty well but then ... HERE COMES THE LAME ENDING...................................................................... ............................................................................ ................. it's a year later and we see Berry and her chief patient played by Penelope Cruz from Vanilla Sky strolling and chatting merrily down the street. To remind us that time has passed Cruz's hair is a lot longer and Berry's is a lot shorter.  How Berry walked away from killing two people is neatly ignored unless maybe the ghost obligingly testified in her behalf. Cruz's character is also a killer and doesn't have any ghosts to blame but in Canada where this was filmed maybe it's like Europe and murder only gets you about a sevenyear sentence anyway.Bottom line for hardcore Berry fans this is a mustsee. For everyone else worth a look but don't spend more than the price of a matinee or wait for videoDVD.  If only they'd come up with a ballsy ending like the one in In Dreams or given Downey more to do.  I'll admit I'd rather have seen him in Singing Detective than this but when ya live in the boonies ya cope the best ya can.....Right at the end a shot of a boy and a bus hints at a sequel be forewarned......".

Now slap them together in your mind and picture what that would be like as a movie. Odds are it's at least twice as good as Gothika.Gothika is the story of Dr. Miranda Grey a psychologist at some sort of prison the best they have in fact clich 1.  She ends up becoming an inmate in that very prison when her husband is found brutally murdered and she is the only suspect yawn clich 2.  Many more clichs follow as the story unfolds.   Other characters include Robert Downey Jr. as the colleaguefriend who happens to be the 2nd best doctor at the prison who becomes her doctor and wants to help her because he loves her even though he doesn't believe her story and Penelope Cruz as the crazy inmateexpatient of Miranda's who becomes her only friend on the inside when everyone else thinks she's guilty andor crazy.  There are more but I won't name them all.The scares in this movie were cheap and blatantly telegraphed to the point where I laughed out loud at the people in the theater who jumped.  The plot twists were extremely predictable as well.  No real shock when the villain is revealed because if you just look at all the people in it this person is probably the most obvious choice to play a villain in a movie of this genre. Even if you can't figure it out the scene where it is revealed that this person is the villain is so drawn out that Halle Berry is definitely the last one to figure it out.As if we didn't have enough of a mess on our hands already now you have to figure in the supernatural elements of the film.  That's right ghosts spiritual presences whatever you call it it's there and it's utterly ridiculous.Overall the story couldn't seem to get out of its own way.  The story is like a bad rendering of what it would be like to throw The Sixth Sense Kiss the Girls The Life of David Gale The Fugitive and at least 10 other movies just like those into a blender and hit puree.The number one area where this movie fails is the writing.  The direction isn't all that great either but the writing is the big one.  The acting was decent.  Everyone did the best they could with what little they were given to work with.  Some of the characters seemed downright pointless when all was said and done namely Robert Downey Jr. and Penelope Cruz.I watched this movie with a group of friends and it was pretty clear that during the movie some of them were enjoying it while I was yelling profanities at the screen.  However one of them indicated to me that the determining factor in whether or not they would like it was how it ended. The ending was even worse than I had anticipated.  It left the five of us sitting in the theater scratching our heads saying What? Why?'".

There are more but I won't name them all.The scares in this movie were cheap and blatantly telegraphed to the point where I laughed out loud at the people in the theater who jumped.  The plot twists were extremely predictable as well.  No real shock when the villain is revealed because if you just look at all the people in it this person is probably the most obvious choice to play a villain in a movie of this genre. Even if you can't figure it out the scene where it is revealed that this person is the villain is so drawn out that Halle Berry is definitely the last one to figure it out.As if we didn't have enough of a mess on our hands already now you have to figure in the supernatural elements of the film.  That's right ghosts spiritual presences whatever you call it it's there and it's utterly ridiculous.Overall the story couldn't seem to get out of its own way.  The story is like a bad rendering of what it would be like to throw The Sixth Sense Kiss the Girls The Life of David Gale The Fugitive and at least 10 other movies just like those into a blender and hit puree.The number one area where this movie fails is the writing.  The direction isn't all that great either but the writing is the big one.  The acting was decent.  Everyone did the best they could with what little they were given to work with.  Some of the characters seemed downright pointless when all was said and done namely Robert Downey Jr. and Penelope Cruz.I watched this movie with a group of friends and it was pretty clear that during the movie some of them were enjoying it while I was yelling profanities at the screen.  However one of them indicated to me that the determining factor in whether or not they would like it was how it ended. The ending was even worse than I had anticipated.  It left the five of us sitting in the theater scratching our heads saying What? Why?'";

	schema:reviewBody "There are only very few actors who can play the ordinary man with extraordinary talent and skills. Shahrukh Khan is one such actor. While he is more known for his larger than life films such as 'Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge' 'Kuch Kuch Hota Hai' 'Devdas' etc it is in roles such as Sunil Raju of 'Raju Ban Gaya Gentleman' or Rahul of 'Yes Boss' that I prefer him most. 'Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa' is one of his greatest achievements and among his most underrated films. He beautifully brings Sunil to life and had I not been aware that I was watching a movie I wouldn't have known that Khan was acting. For me Sunil is one of the most unique and memorable characters in Hindi cinema yet he is so easily recognizable. He's not the son of a millionaire not an Agrade student not popular with women. He's vibrant. He's talented. He's carefree. He lies. He IS just a regular guy. One that you must have known sometime somewhere. I see a lot of myself in Sunil. His despair for Anna's love his passion for music his indifference towards his academic failure have all been displayed with gusto by Mr. Khan.Kundan Shah's direction is outstanding. He keeps everything including execution story props and setting simple and that's what makes 'Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa' so easy to relate to. His portrayal of Sunil's relationships with the people in his life that includes his family his band members the girl he loves a priest and his boss is very real and down to earth. Thankfully nothing is sugarcoated. Shah stays focused and does it all with a very subtle approach. Even the brother sister relationship which was given very little screen time flourishes beautifully on screen and in my opinion it is one of the best depiction of a sibling relationship.The background score flows very well with the film and the songs are great. My favourites include the ballad 'Sachchi Yeh Kahani Hai' and the soulful 'Ae Kaash Ke Hum' both of which have been beautifully visualized. Actually all the songs are nicely picturized including the funny 'Kyun Na Hum' and 'Anna Mere Pyar' the sad 'Woh To Hai Albela' and the romantic 'Deewana Dil Deewana'.Though 'Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa' is Shahrukh Khan's film most of the supporting cast is very effective. Naseeruddin Shah as the priestSunil's confidant is totally awesome. Tiku Talsania and Goga Kapoor are hilarious. Of Sunil's friend Kurush Deboo stands out. However Suchitra Krishnamurty and Deepak Tijori are merely okay. In a nutshell 'Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa' is one of my alltime favourite films. It's one of the rarest of its kind truly a gem of a movie.".

Sometimes you get something sometimes you don't sometimes it hurts but in the end you learn to come to terms with it. Kundan Shah's direction is outstanding.

The music is beautiful and all the songs are absolutely spot on. Though the film belongs to Shahrukh Khan the entire supporting cast is fantastic and every actorfrom the pretty Suchitra Krishnamoorthi to the evergreat Naseeruddin Shahdoes a fine job. Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa is surely an underrated gem. It is a film that reminds me of myself. It is a film that I can watch over and over again and still be excited saddened and encouraged. It is a film that teaches you how to look at life differently how to take things as they come and despite the pain be able to recover with a smile.".

Critics of SRK should watch this movie as SRK gives a Baadshah performance even though he plays the role of a simple Town guy. His act as Sunil so simple but yet so convincing.

It was after a gap of 10 years that Kundan Shah had come out with a movie and we couldn't wait to watch it. Though we found 'Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naan' to be OK but were disappointed as it was nothing like 'Jaane Bhi Do Yaaron'. But I give credit to Kundan Shah for his judgment on not trying to repeat 'Jaane Bhi Do Yaron' again because it is difficult to recreate magic.Caught 'Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naan' on cable couple of years later and since this time I knew what to expect I quite enjoyed the film. I watched it again and this time I enjoyed it more. That's the thing about this movie it grows on you. It's like a friendly face in the neighborhood that the more you see the more you like. Now I consider this as one of my favorite movies that I can watch from any point and enjoy it.It's the story of youth with all its elements the unrequited love the ambition to do something different the generation gap etc. But it is the characters and situations that are so real and so delightful that you can identify with most of them from your own personal life. The humor is subtle and will make you smile and at the most chuckle. Performance wise everyone does a fine job. Jatin Lalit's music is melodious and pleasant but I must admit that I have a bias against Kumar Sanu's voice so I would have preferred someone else to sing the songs.".

The movie is very heart warming and light hearted with a mix of comedy and romance. Shah Rukh Khan delivers a Fantastic Performance of his career. This movie ranks among His Greatest Movies.

Yet the emotions the movie invokes are so profound it turns into a huge deal. Sunil Shahrukh Khan is a college kid with only two desires  that he win the love of Anna Suchitra Krishnamurthy and that he become a successful musician. Anna love Chris Deepak Tijori who is a fellow band member. BTW  do not forget to watch out for Imran Ashutosh Gowarikar one of the other band members! Sunil makes every attempt to win Anna some attempts are above board others are less than ethical. Father Briganza Naseeruddin Shah is his compass and keeps trying to set him back on the right path. Does Sunil succeed in winning his heart's desire? Does he remain an immature young man or does he complete his journey into manhood? Can and should every human being be judged by the same yardstick? The movie answers these questions while providing us with valuable lessons about life...Shahrukh is astounding in the role of Sunil. If you do not see yourself in Sunil then you will certainly see a friend or sibling. He is childish spoilt loving mature conniving naive generous vulnerable tragic  he runs the gamut of emotions one experienced in the yoyo phase of youth and you feel for Sunil and identify with him at every turn. This is clearly one of the defining roles in the career of an actor who is now a megastar. Suchitra does a fine job as the bubbly Anna Deepak Tijori is good as the other guy Naseer Shah is brilliant  but do we expect any less? However this film belongs to Shahrukh and according to him remains one of his most favorite roles.Jatin Lalit provide excellent music that grows on you quietly. Deewana Dil Deewana Kyun Na Ham Mil Ke Pyara Kare Anna Tere Pyar Ko Sacchi Yeh Kahani Hai Sun Lo Meri Jaan Woh To Hai Albela are all very pleasing numbers but THE song of the film is Ai Kash Ke Hum Hosh Mein Aane Na Paayen. It is exquisite in composition execution and in the emotions expressed by the lead pair.Kundan Shah directs with a deft hand and produces a film that will tug at your heartstrings and remind you of that age of angst we all go through when life is beautiful yet every moment could be an extreme of emotions  extreme joy extreme pain.This movie is a keeper and worth many a repeat watch.".

I end of watching it with a smile on the face while strong feeling connected to what is happening on screen.It captures heartache and pangs of jealously beautifully not the dramatic in exaggerated way made with an intent to make you cry.

Such is the beautiful direction  we see in this movie that we accept this hero and we also love him too at the end too.I personally started liking sharukh after this movie. This movie is set in beautiful GOA with a love triangle very nice songs in the middle the movie never stops displaying us how we normal human beings with our ups and downs of life through a middle class perspective believe in love living for others and caring for the better and even with so much simplicity the movie still keeps us entertaining.

This was SRK before he became a star.As said by another reader SRK breathes life into the character of Sunil. Sunil is a guy we all know we all are. He is the common man. He has weaknesses he isn't rich or particularly handsome and he's sometimes willing to go the wrong way to achieve something.The movie is filled with ridiculous situations the Chinese theme bar!!! and characters Anthony Gomez but SRK fights it all and shines through. I recommend this movie to all people who watch SRK today and say that he keeps doing the same kind of roles. It is a brilliant performance.".

Now a days Actors play hero or I should say they follow a template in their movie and how they say their dialogue but it's not like that here you are so lost in characters of movie you won't remember who is hero but just character. Must watch movie not only for SRK fans but all the movie fans. It's my most favorite movie from Bollywood. And I just created IMDb account to write a review for it.";

Sunil Shahrukh Khan is a musician yet a failure at life as he never passes his grades and usually lies. His father labels him as good for nothing. Among Sunil's friendscumband members Chris Deepak Tijori Imran Ashutosh Gowariker Tony Aditya Lakhia and Yezdi Kurush Deboo Sunil is in love with Anna Suchitra Krishnamurthy for a very long time and always dream to tell his feelings towards her and marry her. However Anna is in love with Chris as Chris is in love with Anna. Whenever the two get closer Sunil is in despair and causes tensions between them just so they can separate. He also seeks help from Father Braganza Naseeruddin Shah Anthony Goga Kapoor Patel Tiku Talsania and his sister. However sometimes it leads to him depression of envy as he wishes he could be like Chris being wealthy and rich May be a typical story however what makes it so interesting is Sunil. He's not wealthy doesn't possess much money never passes his grades his passion for music and his love for Anna. You relate a lot of people like Sunil as you come across life. I relate myself with Sunil as well as most people. This is not your average boyconquersthe world chivalrousness related and your typical falling in love and getting married in the end type of movie. This movie explains a lot of realism and true concepts of people as it is still known nowadays. Hats off to Kundan Shah for bringing real life of people in a movie so excellently directed. Direction by Kundan Shah is just excellent as well as the story and screenplay. However let's not forget the performances. Deepak Tijori is likable as Chris as he portrays his character excellently. Suchitra Krishnamurty is beautiful as Anna and really shows her performance brilliant. Naseeruddin Shah is great! The rest of the cast is simply amazing including Ashutosh Gowariker. But this movie belongs to Shahrukh Khan. Who else could perform Sunil than the King Khan himself? His physique his expressions and dialogues really brought the realism in the movie. Music is just amazing as well! Ae Kaash and Deewana are the best songs in my opinion. The rest are worth listening too. Overall best SRK movie and do not miss it!".

	schema:reviewBody "Kabhi Haa Kabhi Naa is a film cowritten and directed by Kundan Shah. I saw this film because many people recommended to me that it is a good film. And yes it is. No because of SRK. But because of the way the story is written.Plot Sunil Falls in love with Anna. But Anna loves Chris. So who will Ann's be? Story and Direction At first the story looked to me as a romantic comedy. No but it has some elements of drama too. It is mostly centered around Sunil and his love for Anna. It is very beautifully shown that how he cares for Anna. Then we have Chris who too loves and cares for Anna.But still I feel for the Sunil character. The supporting characters like Father Briganza Don Anthony Sunil's band etc... are all etched out very nicely . I never felt a dull moment in the film. Even those who feel for Sunil there is a surprise package in the last scene. For which all credibility goes to Kundan Shah.Performances Shah Rukh Khan does an excellent job as Sunil. He impressed me quite a lot. Deepak Tijori was also great. I didn't expect him to do that good. Suchitra Krishnamoorthy as the heroine was OK. But since the film was about Sunil more so I could actually forgive that. Naseeruddin Shah was in quite a different role that showed how versatile an actor he is. Even Goga Kapoor stepped out of his villainous role known for Raavan character which was commendable. The rest of the supporting actors also fitted the bill perfectly.Music JatinLalit has composed the music. and they have done a wonderful job. 'Deewana Main Deewana' and 'Woh to Hai Albela' were some of my favorites. Even the background score maybe done by the same music duo was also great. I got a little disappointed in the song 'Sachi Yeh Kahani Hai' because it was a straight rip off of the Boney M song 'Ma Baker'. Even the lyrics too sounded the same.Favorite scene I guess it would be the very first one. It was a comedy of errors and a nice dream sequence.Verdict I enjoyed this film a lot. One number would be lessened from my side as of the song I mentioned before and Suchitra Krishnamoorthy too.I would give the film a 910.".

	schema:headline " My favourite SRK starrer";
	schema:reviewBody "Shah Rukh Khan is the superstar of today who started his acting career from TV serials and once getting the right break climbed to the sky of wealth and fame just like a fairytale. He has many superduper hit movies to his credit. However today I am reviewing the movie starring him which I like the most and which has a special place in a corner of my heart. This movie is Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa 1994.Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa sometimes yes sometimes no is the story of a youth with a heart of gold. He is Sunil Shah Rukh Khan who has neither any interest in the automobile repair business of his father Anjan Srivastav nor in his studies. He is interested in music and devotes maximum time in the activities of the theatre group of his friends. He is very close to a priest Father Briganza Nasiruddin Shah who understands him and always shows him the right path. However he keeps on bearing with the scoldings of his father in his home.But his heart and his life are brightened by the love in his heart for Aana Suchitra Krishnamoorthy a Christian girl. Sunil finds that Chris Deepak Tijori a rich youth is his rival for Aana's love. The tug of war between Sunil and Chris keeps on going with Aana being in the position of the rope. However in the end Sunil comes to know that Aana and Chris genuinely love each other. Now it's not difficult for the audience to guess what our hero with a heart of gold is expected to do.This movie is directed by Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro 1983 fame Kundan Shah who has cast the heroes of that movie i.e. Nasiruddin Shah and Ravi Baaswani in this movie also. I consider this movie as his best work after JBDY and perhaps the last good work done by him. This is a beautiful movie with lots of touching moments. The mood of the movie remains light for the most part of it but it's not a regular comedy all the same. It's an emotional movie. A saga of a youth whose pluses are ignored by his father who is errorprone but contains an ocean of sublime feelings in his heart who is ready to sacrifice his love for the sake of the love of his life only but who is still strong enough to move on in life after that.Whenever I watch this movie it makes me weep at many places. The scene of Sunil's arranging false markssheet to satisfy his father but admitting it in the middle of the party thrown by his father to celebrate his success is highly touching and reminds us of an episode from the life of Mahatma Gandhi the Father of the Nation of India. And then follows the song  Woh To Hai Albela which I am ready to listen to and see on the screen for 'n' number of times without getting bored or tired.The theatreplay in which a gangster's lifetragedy is presented on the screen from his pointofview is also damn impressive. And the ending scene in which Sunil becomes the Best Man in the wedding of Aana and Chris and the wedding ring is slipped from his hand. The ending scene in which Juhi Chawla in a guest appearance comes across Sunil in the style similar to that of the heroine who has gone out of his life is so amusing that this style of presentation with some highprofile heroine delivering a guest appearance in the ending scene of the movie was later copied in many Hindi movies.Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa is full of entertainment. There is not a single boring moment in the movie. The scriptwriters Kundan Shah and Pankaj Advani have done a splendid job. The story is told in such a way that the viewers starts relating to and getting associated with the hero and keeps on flowing with him in the stream of events as if they were happening to himself only. The filmmaker is able to create such a passion in the viewer through his storytelling that the viewer smiles with the hero and weeps with him as well.The movie does not boast of high production value and the complete milieu renders an air of simplicity but that is a huge plus point of the movie because it helps the audience in relating to the characters especially the hero. Technically everything is in order. The grip of the narrative remains so tight on the audience that the length of the movie is never felt.Music by Jatin Lalit is admirable. In fact during the nineties they composed damn good music for many SRK movies. The best song in my view is Woh To Hai Albela in the voice of Kumar Sanu Devki Pandit etc. Another song that stands out is also in the voice of Kumar Sanu only  Aye Kaash Ki Ab Hosh Mein Hum Aane Na Paayen.I can't imagine any other actor in the role of Sunil. SRK has lived this role and made it thoroughly reliable. He is the heart and soul of this movie. Undoubtedly one of his best performances it is. Suchitra Krishnamoorthy has done well as somewhat naive and ambivalent Aana. Nasiruddin Shah has done the role of a different flavour this time and he is also very impressive. Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa is a movie which has become an inseparable part of my heart. It lacks naturalness at many places because mainly it's been made for the purpose of entertainment in the form of a romantic comedy with a little dose of sentiments. Hence over the top things are there. If not for them I would have considered this extraordinary movie as worthy of five stars.".

The film misses out on a golden opportunity a lecturespeech kind of scene by Sunil which would've shown of him having finally learnt his lessons and become a mature man. Something like that would've been a cherry on top of which is otherwise an excellent film overall.The reason behind this being one of SRK's underrated films of the past or possibly the most underrated is obviously the fact that this wasn't the kind of film that he's famous for. People are used to seeing him in the other kind of roles and those are the ones that appeals to the public the most. So that's understandable.However I'm deeply impressed by this film given especially the fact that it was made 23 years ago. The stories the plots and everything on the mind of the filmmaker used to be very different those days. The kind of topic that it touches of a boy who lives in a bubble and hasn't manned up to face the realities of life and can never confront the truth is a story so true to almost every household. I can't remember from my memory of which the main issues lies in the main character's habit of hiding about lies. They never used to show anything such back then as the hero was always the most upright honest and brave man and if anything unusual was shown he was portrayed as a laughing devil who'd take the wrong path on purpose.Again this film deserves a lot of applause as does SRK for such a commendable performance as an anxious lazy and lookingforshort cuts teenager.".

It is the story of a simpleton who lives in a dream world of his own. His dreams are often shattered but he is admirable for his ability to bounce back after every disappointment. Even when he loses his biggest dream he shows his large heartedness by keeping his love before himself.The entire feel of the movie is sincere a slice of life with no attempts to thrill you. There are no superheroes or villains in the film just everyday people like you and me. And not to forget the wonderful music of the film. Probably the best of the nineties with my favorite heart touching Ae Kash Ke Hum.Then why my mediocre rating for this one? Simply because of SRK's acting. He is as superficial and overthe top as he is today. He is much better suited as the villain. A good actor in his place would have taken this film to the next level. Nevertheless a one time watch.".

One of many like institutions the asylums are run like prisons and young girls are forced to do workhouse laundry and hard labor. The asylum one of many that existed in theocratic Catholic Ireland is for supposedly 'fallen' women. Here young girls are imprisoned indefinitely and endure agonizing punishments and a long harsh working system which leaves them physically drained and mentally damaged. As the girls bond together it soon becomes clear that the only way out of the Magdalene convent is to escape but with twisted Sister Bridget running the wing any chances seem limited...";

	schema:reviewBody "The Magdalene Sisters is not as some have claimed a onedimensional antiCatholic film exploiting what are arguably especially gruesome atrocities.  It is a factbased drama about three teenage girls who found themselves in 1964 sentenced to work in a laundry run by an Irish religious order for an indefinite term and under conditions that made most audience members shudder.In three brief vignettes before the main title the girls are introduced. One is brutally raped by a cousin at a wedding while priests perform traditional Irish songs.  Immediately telling a woman instead of support she becomes the subject of a hasty conspiracy to spirit the rapist from the wedding and to place her in the Magdalene asylum.A second girl gives birth to a baby  in the not long ago past illegitimacy was the label.  She is pressured by a priest to surrender the baby boy and then she too is hustled off to the asylum.The third victim is in an orphanage where she gets under the director's skin for no other offense than she is pretty and boys from the neighborhood crowd a fence to call down to her.  Transfer to the asylum follows.The Magdalene laundries made money for the order running them and the asylum to which the three girls were committed is in this film  a moral charnel house.  Sister Bridget the head nun interviews the girls while fingering with almost erotic delight rolls of money. Her desk sports a photo of President Kennedy but a picture of Ilse Koch would have been a more suitable iconographic representation of her character.  She is a sadist first class.What follows is almost unrelieved tedium for the girls interspersed with brutal physical chastisement and agonizing sexual humiliation inflicted by perverted nuns.  Sexual orientation isn't my issue it's the awful victimization of helpless young girls.Through the fine acting of the cast the complexity of relationships and the nature of choices become engrossing. To accommodate or to resist.  To comply or to engage in sabotage even in small ways as a declaration of nonsurrender.  Sabotage is possible but can an inexperienced and angry teen foresee the consequences of a minor act of resistance?  An anticipated humorous defiance may well have tragic results.The film centers on the three girls as well as several other asylum inmates ranging from a young woman descending slowly into irreversible madness and an elderly crone who believes her lifetime of servitude guarantees entrance to the Kingdom of Heaven.  This tortured soul is the nuns' capo the inmate without whose help the asylum's strictures can't be enforced. Comparison to the Gulag camps and the Nazi concentration camps is apropos.The Magdalene Sisters doesn't portray all the girls as angels but it does show the nuns and the occasional male clergy as evil exploiters and sadistic hypocrites.  Is that fair?  The end credits report that some 30000 women were involuntarily placed in Magdalene asylums until the last one closed in 1996.  Were all inmates so tortured and beaten?  I don't know but these three girls certainly have had THEIR experience recorded for a population that appears to have turned a blind eye to what should have been a national scandal decades earlier.  Their life after the asylum is reported in the end credits. All paid a price for a stolen adolescence.The asylum in this film is pure evil religious doctrine run amuck in the quest for money through cheap labor and in the riotous unleashing of perversity.  English judges for centuries have often used a word rarely found in  American case law to describe persons and events the word is wicked.  This film projects an unending parade of wicked people performing wicked acts.  It doesn't condemn Catholicism it indicts the operation by the church in Ireland of one type of soul and body destroying evil.  The Church can no more defend the Magdalene asylums than it can the predatory pedophiles in the priesthood.  That's the simple reality.Audience members loudly gasped and a number cried during the showing. This isn't a film for the fainthearted or those who want their illusions about a bucolic and verdant Ireland filled with dancing and music unaffected by the reality of a genuine tragedy now coming to light.810.".

The scene captured in a brutal moment the truth that tyranny can only thrive with our collective fear. Religion like other totalitarian ideologies rules by internalized terror.

	schema:reviewBody "I inadvertently found myself watching a whole string of movies the other day about people being tortured or torturing themselves without even looking for movies like that. I saw The Magdalene Sisters Osama and that IMAX film Everest all in the same day and was surprised at their similarities particularly between the first two. The Magdalene Sisters and Osama are strikingly similar in that they are both about religious terrorism specifically centered around women. Osama was a look at how the Taliban keeps women under tight control not allowing them even the tiniest freedom indeed women could be arrested and severely punished for such crimes as walking alone in public or speaking to a man even for such dangerous statements as 'My father is sick.' while The Magdalene Sisters is about the Catholic Church in Ireland in disturbingly recent times severely punishing women as a result of what appears to be the Church's frothing and highly irrational fear of sex.The film focuses on the plights of three women in particular who have all committed 'crimes' of varying nature but who are all punished by being sent to the Magdalene laundry for an indefinite period of time. One girl Rose commits the greatest crime having a child out of wedlock which neither of her parents will even look at. Interestingly she had the child because an abortion would have been a sin. Bernadette makes the mortal mistake of flirting with boys outside the orphanage she lived in and Margaret is raped at a family gathering by a cousin only to be shipped off herself when she reports it to family members.At the Magdalene laundry the girls are subjected to psychological abuse and endless physical toil all under the old theory that it will cleanse their souls. Some of the women that the three girls in question encounter as they enter the laundry have been there for decades and they eventually figure out that the only way that they are ever going to get out of there is to escape. Bernadette is especially aware of this and makes increasing efforts to escape for which she is brutally punished.I am genuinely curious to know what path of logic leads people to believe that such practices in the name of religion can have any beneficial value. The Taliban has taken religious torture to its extreme debasing themselves and their religion by performing unbelievably inhuman acts in the name of their God and it appears that while certainly not on the same level of cruelty the Catholic Church has performed similar crimes against humanity. That the Catholic Church in Ireland promptly condemned the film is not surprising but if such things are being committed under its name and indeed continued being committed well into the late 1990s I should think that the Church would at least allow the film to be shown so that people would be aware of such abuses which tarnish the reputation of the Church. I believe that it would have been possible for the Church to defend its own validity while at the same time acknowledging abuses committed in its name especially if the accusations of cruelty were untrue although in this case they were not. Running however only makes you look guilty.The Magdalene laundry is presided over by a nun who is simply evil. She is an elderly lady and generally softspoken but this woman makes the wicked witch of the west look like a prancing schoolgirl. The viciousness of the rest of the Sisters of Mercy radiates off of this woman like some kind of sinister force delicately but successfully walking the line between illustrating the harshness of a brutal religious regime and creating a movie monster. Her character is human but she's not far from being a monster.It's disheartening to see the things that people do in the name of religion especially when the crimes are something as little as behaving like a normal person. There are natural and perfectly healthy behaviors that unfortunately are violations of arbitrary religious laws which are subsequently punished with outlandish punishments like those seen in this movie. Religion is thrown into reverse causing pain and suffering rather than offering an escape from it shown in a modern setting that is so backwards that it could just as easily have taken place in the 1600s.".

If you are in the mood for sadism and horror...this is the film for you!!I could not imagine that such a place as the laundry run by The Order of Magdelene Sisters could exist until I saw this film.  The four girls that the story focused on Rose Bernadette Margaret and Crispina existed. I have been to Ireland and seen the beauty of that country. I once envied the life of those lucky enough to live there. I don't any longer.The movie does not attack the Catholic faith so much as give a mindset of the 1960's in Ireland. My word here in the USA hippies were making love not war and these poor girls were only being human beings. I don't like to share the details of a film but consider that one girl was an orphan and sent to the Magdelene's because she liked to flirt!! One was sent because she was raped!! My goodness how barbaric can people be?  film. And these people were nuns and priests for heaven's sake. Ah and let me not forget the parents who sent their daughters to that place. I will never complain about my parents again. Promise. Please watch this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Peter Mullan's 2002 film is based primarily upon the TV documentary 'Sex in a Cold Climate' by Steve Humphries which was first aired on RTE Ireland and BBC England in 1998. The documentary records the recollections of four Irish women who spent their youth and a good proportion of their adult lives as involuntary guests of uncompromising Roman Catholic nuns.The film is set in a particular example of this institution which somewhat akin to the English workhouses of the late 19th and early 20th century became established in Ireland after the Second World War. The Magdelene Laundries took their name from the biblical figure of Mary Magdalene a 'fallen woman' whom Christ befriended.We join the main heroines of the movie  Margarette AnneMarie Duff Bernadette NorahJane No one Rose Dorothy Duffy and Crispina Eileen Walsh in cameo as their entrance scholarships for the Magdelene Laundry are being sat.What's most uncomfortable about this part of the movie is trying to work out what's going on. Trying to work out what it is that's being whispered and what will be the upshot of it and why. At first it seems like the soundtrack of the film and the contrast have failed. But before long it becomes obvious that the soundtrack of the film and the contrast have succeeded. The dark and deafening silence surrounding the circumstances under which these young women are being consigned to the unwelcome stewardship of the Magdalene Sisters comes through loud and muted.We follow their induction into the laundry by Sister Bridget Geraldine McEwan ably assisted by the Sisters Jude Frances Healy Clemantine Eithne McGuinness and Augusta Phyllis MacMahon who contrive with formally celibate gentlemen like Father Fitzroy Daniel Costello to represent a world in which God's greatest ideal is achieved through punishment and penitence.As the film progresses we begin to understand why it is no accident that these institutions should have been laundries. They could  after all  have been bakeries dairies canneries or places where mailbags are sewn.With every garment that passes through the process unmentionable filth is cleansed  if the Sisters are to be believed. And if the Sisters are to be believed the sins of the teenagers and the route to Heaven is bound up in hot water salt and flagellation.And as we follow these unsaintly girls on their hapless journey we finally learn that salvation is as straightforward as a letter we are not privileged to read and a brother who arrives with a suitcase  as if there is anything that anybody could possibly want to carry away from a place like this.This film is a powerful elegy to the suffering of these unfortunate girls who constrained to silence for so long have finally found a voice.".

I was constantly referred to as the green horn Englishmanmocked and imitated because of my accent and belittled because I didn't know the Canadian national anthem which we were required to sing every morning before lessons began  I'd only been in the country weeks  I soon learned it. I was kept behind after school regularly because my handwriting was unacceptable causing me to miss my bus home I had a long way to travel. I was once hit across the back of my head with the words you write like a boy you talk like a boy  you even look like a boy. I was eight years old.

I had to wait for this movie to be released on DVD before I got to see it....having waited patiently since I first read it won awards at the Venice Film Festival.I am so grateful that Peter Mullen took this project on and that it met with such controversy because that was exactly what was needed for the film to get recognized and viewed by as many people as possible. The more people who see the film the better! The wonderful advantage of having waited for the DVD release is that it came with the brilliant documentary Sex In A Cold Climate which inspired the movie. As a XRoman Catholic and a survivor of what I refer to as my incarceration...an oppressive Catholic educationindoctrination by the Sisters Of Charity 19571958 and the Ursuline Sisters 19591969 both old orders of the Catholic Church originating in Europe. I can state with battlescarred alacrity that behavior as depicted in this movie is not only factual but not nearly cruel enough to tell the true story. From my experience...the Nazi's must have taken lessons in depravity and wickedness from the Sisters Of Charity! These were old world religious orders with dogmas and superstitions that have not changed since Christ's time. The practitioners of this primitive cult like barbarism were mostly ignorant of anything resembling reason or logic not to mention...science. The comparisons to the Taliban is not all that far fetched. Of course there was one or two nuns who had an occasional bout of compassion but they were not only a minority they were also downcast within the system. I also realize that not all Catholic orders are of the same cloth as the strict Roman Catholic variety but I was born into the Irish Catholic variety...one of the worst.It took me years and a loving cheerful husband to undo the deep melancholia I felt from having grown up with this kind of repression. Now as a middle aged adult my depression has amalgamated into a outspoken and healthy anger at a religious institution and church that has been allowed for millenniums to abuse it's power. The psychological methods employed by The Catholic establishment is so devoid of compassion and full of hate that had it still existed today in America it would be considered illegal. The only reason these zealot fanatics got away with their brutal treatment of innocent children for so long is because the people they tormented were brainwashed with eternity in hell for even thinking of questioning such God given authority. I spit on that authority! This movie is not an exaggeration! And it's not restricted to the religious orders in Ireland. If anything it didn't go far enough in depicting the true story. Not enough nefariousness has been said of an institution that routinely turned it's eyes on child molestation and the persecution of women perpetrated by it's leaders. I am so glad that all these Catholic Church and School survivors are suing the church and therefore bringing the atrocities to light. And I applaud Peter Mullen for making such a forceful case against inhumanity in the name of organized religion of any flavor. Christian Catholic Islam Jew...they're all the same...it's all about control and power...and too often it's an aberration of it's original intent.".

I am so glad that all these Catholic Church and School survivors are suing the church and therefore bringing the atrocities to light. And I applaud Peter Mullen for making such a forceful case against inhumanity in the name of organized religion of any flavor. Christian Catholic Islam Jew...they're all the same...it's all about control and power...and too often it's an aberration of it's original intent.";

Along with a heartwrenching relentlessness by writerdirector Peter Mullan in revealing the details of the nun's cruelty and coldness there are a number of very good performances here.

While these questions weren't as forward and evident in this film as they were in Bergman's masterpieces often Mullan subtly brings these questions to light as the film progresses if God is pounded over and over and over into these girl's heads that they are here because they need to repent for their mortal sins such as being raped flirting having children out of wedlock and they are subjected to physical sexual and mental abuse by those who should be compassionate lifelong devotees to the faith where is God? This question actually comes to a big head in a scene that at first shows itself to be rather amusing when a priest gets a poison Ivy rash and then Crispina who got it from him in the worst way shouts out over and over 'YOU ARE NOT A MAN OF GOD!' and thus is silenced away to a mental asylum. Indeed this is the part of the film where the question gets the most light and it's the most harrowing scene in the movie among others and is one of the most powerful in movies this year. The only liability is the climatic ending to which is something against a Bergmanesque logic and while I won't reveal it here it tends to go to an appropriate timing that's akin to Cuckoo's Nest. Personally I felt the film should have ended with the Bergman logic instead of the Kesey spirit but that's neither here nor there since the bulk of the film in and of itself is contains some passionate drama and to those who see it will not only get an eyeopening view to the oldtime if oldtime is up until seven years ago Catholic ways but also to the great dangers of control over human life.".

	schema:headline " Powerful historical drama";
	schema:reviewBody "The Magdalene Sisters chronicles the experiences of three young girls in the infamous Magdalene Laundries. The Laundries were Catholic clergyrun organizations in operation from the 19th century up until the late 20th century in Ireland. Girls were sent to work in these institutions for suspicion of having sex outside of marriage showing provocative character or for simply being too pretty. Mullen succeeds in exposing the outright abuse that went on in these institutions at a time when the Church was seen to be Ireland's highest moral authority.The film focuses on the stories of three fallen girls who have all been landed in the Laundries for sins they didn't commit. What is most shocking about this film is the utter sadism and cruelty of the nuns who run the asylum. They force the girls to work beyond endurance in abysmal conditions and routinely subject them to humiliation of an unthinkable nature. In one scene the nuns line the naked girls up and judge who is the hairiest who has the biggest breasts etc. Mullen wanted the girls to appear natural and insisted that the they not shave themselves or pluck their eyebrows prior to and during filming. No one is wearing makeup and all the girls wear the same unflattering garb. This adds to the realism of the film and brings his asylum closer to the real Laundries. The clever polarization of character personalities made for some interesting clashes. There is Bernadette who is fiery and headstrong Margaret a responsible girl with a strong sense of morality. Rose whose good nature endeared me quickly to her. And Crispina who is just plain bonkers. I found the development of Margaret's character to be particularly interesting The more oppression she is subjected to the more she comes to value her independence. This all culminates until her brother finally comes to collect her after four years. Upon realising her newfound freedom she wont even have her brother tell her to hurry so they can get going Don't you dare tell me what to do! Don't you ever dare tell me what to do!Eileen Walsh was brilliant in this movie. Her portrayal of the simple but eccentric inmate Crispina certainly added a lot of colour to the film. Despite the obviously bleak theme there are some humorous moments in the film and these usually involve Crispina. This was a very difficult role to take on as Crispina's theatrical and overdramatic personality required Walsh to portray such a wide array of emotions. So convincing was Walsh's performance that I found myself feeling real compassion for the girl. She's not all there and is virtually clueless about the world which makes her fate all the more poignant. Walsh sacrificed vanity more than any of the other girls for this role which is also to be admired. Her performance stood out for me as one of the highlights of the film.This film should appeal to the secularminded and those who are critical of religion in general. I don't know if Mullen himself holds any biases in this area but he certainly succeeds in highlighting just how detrimental an effect fundamentalism can have on a society. It has torn the girls' families apart stripped them of their independence and for some of them has resulted is the considerable deterioration of their mental health. The girls enter the asylum as strong healthy individuals who over time come to forget how to interact properly with other people and find it difficult to distinguish what is real and what isn't. One of the prevailing themes in The Magdalene Sisters is the hypocrisy of devout Christians who claim to model themselves off of Christ yet are so un Christlike in their treatment of the fallen in society. This is especially true of the nuns who are supposed to serve as women of Christ yet fail to follow in his example of forgiveness and love.One aspect of this movie I found particularly interesting was its depiction how society viewed women in the era. The treatment of the Magdalene girls raises questions about the injustices and doublestandards which existed in the early 20th century. Even though the girls of Magdalene are not at fault for being raped getting pregnant or simply being attractive it is the women who are punished and ostracised.The crew did a great job of recreating the atmosphere of the old Irish Laundries. Most of the film is shot in dimly lit conditions to emphasize the bleak and gloomy feel of the place. We get a brief glimpse of the beautiful Irish countryside when Margaret steps outside the grounds of Magdalene and becomes disorientated as she surveys the outside world. She is startled by the light and beauty of freedom which is in stark contrast to her confinement in the Laundries. Sound is also manipulated to great effect. I really got the feel of an old spacious dank church as every sound is clearly heard resonating off the stone walls. I think the echo was supposed to simulate that constant feeling of being alone which pervaded the asylum.The shocking nature of this film may prompt the viewer who has had no prior knowledge of the Magdalene asylums to question how accurate a representation it is of the actual Laundries. Indeed I myself found it hard to accept that the asylums could be this bad until I watched Steve Humphries' 1998 documentary Sex in a Cold Climate on which this film is based and found the reality to be just as harrowing as the adaptation. In fact one of the inmates told Mullen that the reality of the Laundry was much worse than what is depicted in the film.I really can't recommend this film enough. It was moving entertaining and shocking enough to hold my attention until the final credits rolled. Expect to have a seething hatred of Irish nuns instilled in you. 1010".

You will learn of a country where great swathes of the population are unquestioningly subservient to a Catholic Church that preaches piety but practises repression cruelty paedophilia avarice and selfindulgence on an industrial scale. 30000 Irish women were sent away to these institutions so the Church could make money from slave labour and many were kept imprisoned until they died. The last Catholic Laundry in the Republic of Ireland closed less than ten years ago in 1996! Bravo to the people who made this film and to everyone connected with it.

Each character each scene was done so realistically it will make all who see it fill with empathy for those girls I even think that the nuns who ran these asylums would be shocked at what they actually did if they were living in these times. It reminds me in a way of the film Schindlers List the way the nuns inspected the girls bodies and laughed about them both the Holocaust and these asylums were apparently doing what was right yet causing great pain and suffering at the same time. Watch this film it is definitely worth it.".

There is some nudity in this movie. It is justified in the shower scene to show what psychological torture the teen girls went through at the hands of socalled nuns. A girl's pubic area is shown and breasts are shown too. This is not done in a pornographic way. These girls are shown to be victims of circumstance. I thought this scene was powerful because it showed how the naked women were helpless and innocent but the nuns in heavy clothes were cruel and devious.

Instead I'm going to share my impressions of it speaking as a casual observer The first thing that comes to mind is... What the f!? I mean girls can you imagine being sent to a place like The Magdalene Sisters for erm being pretty flirting with guys or being a single mother? No really  WTF? It seems utterly ridiculous and inconceivable. What about your family disowning you and selling you into slavery if some bastard molested you? I guess if such twisted pseudoreligious extremism was in place today 95 of today's' women would have to be confined to an asylum.I was quite bothered by the fact that Margaret's family chose to send her off to that awful place after she was brutally raped by her cousin instead of calling the rapist to justice and helping their daughter cope with the crime she fell victim to. I don't know what kind of religion condones rape and to add insult to injury considers the victim a sinner. I can't imagine how brainwashed and fed up people back then must've been. A teenage girl is taken advantage of yet SHE is the one being punished and getting disowned by her family while the perpetrator the rapist just gets away with it and goes on as if nothing had happened. Where is the logic behind this and what holy book preaches such morals? And Bernadette? She is confined to the asylum merely for the fact that she is moderately attractive and extroverted. This is just totally out of order seriously.Speaking of Bernadette... she was obviously the highlight of the movie. I only wish she would've hit one of the despicable nuns as she and Rose Patricia were escaping.I also liked AnneMarie Duff  the actress has a certain je ne sais quoi.The most tragic of all was certainly Crispina. It was clear from the start that she's not like the other girls  she's already broken beyond repair and her mental health issues are irreversible. It's no surprise that she perished at 24... and of anorexia! How sad indeed...The Magdalene Sisters asylum seemed like a devilish concentration camp rather than a religious organization. I don't think there was ever anything remotely Godly about an institution like that. Moreover reallife survivors have reported that the conditions were actually much worse compared to those portrayed in the movie. Oh the horror! It's an excellent movie though. They couldn't have picked a better cast. I can't imagine anyone else playing Bernadette... well anyone except for Sherilyn Fenn who has exactly the same dark sultry look. The other cast members were also chosen perfectly and though none of them are megafamous in fact  most are relatively unknown the performance surpasses that of wellknown Hollywood stars by miles.Anyway I was impressed with the movie and would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone interested in the subject matter.".

The beginning is a little slow and that's lethal for those out there with ADD.

You have seen the physical dramas where the girl is kidnapped and needs rescuing and you've seen the emotional dramas where the girl is in the abusive relationship and he saves her from it and you've seen the really farfetched movies where there's some kind of Monster Cyborg Evil Psycho trying to Kill Maim Eat her and the lead male saves her from it but rarely if ever do you see one of these wellwritten not so surreal movies wherein the girl wears real clothes people make mistakes and things are sometimes awkward.  On purpose.It's refreshing to see even if it means getting corny at times.  There are few ways around cornball moments in life.  Making life into film or even the dream of life and avoiding them is near impossible.Personally I'd recommend this movie to anyone looking for a serious rewarding reallife type fictional romance.

Ione Skye is so beautiful and very talented. She played the lonely girl perfectly. I cannot imagine a better actress for her part...her eyes said something to me while watching as did her heart and soul she put into this role. Jennifer Aniston whom I'm not a big fan of was actually well written and her knack for switching accents though out the film was quite funny. The standout character was David played by Mackenzie Astin.He's a nice guy plain and simple. His dialogue was witty charming and never went over the pretentious mark. His character actually meant something to me and for once I agreed with his role. I think he has a bright future ahead of him and I even think he is a better actor than his older sibling Sean.I loved the romance that built between David and Frankie. Even though we have seen this kind of mushy clap trap on screen several times before it just seemed to work differently here.Overall this is a surprisingly sweet well acted and nonpretentious romance film that deserves more recognition.I loved it very much.".

	schema:reviewBody "Dream for an Insomniac is not a bad movie nor is it a particularly good one.  WriterDirector DeBartolo in her first attempt at doing either produces a film that has bright moments a few good ideas very little meaningful dialogue and some moderately entertaining scenes.The blackandwhite to color transition when Frankie first meets David Schrader is perhaps the most metaphorical and artistic achievement this movie makes. It is unfortunate that it is neither touching as a metaphor nor very artistic.The majority of the film centers around the interplay between Frankie and David.  The interaction between the characters is labored and unbelievable the dialogue being little more than witty banter and archaic quotes swapped back and forth.  If DeBartolo had any intentions of the audience empathizing with the characters she failed to write them in such a way to elicit such empathy.  Frankie remains reminiscent of a lovestruck schoolgirl throughout the film a glutton for punishment while David Schrader feels twofaced reluctant to leave his girlfriend but quite friendly and flirtatious with Frankie who is quite obviously in love with him.  If these characters existed in the real world they would both seem too neurotic emotionally unstable needy and selfcentered to spend time getting to know.  And yet in spite of this DeBartolo manages to put together a film that is not terrible. Aniston's character an aspiring actress who speaks in false accents during conversations to become believable in them provides a solid supporting character that is much needed throughout the film.  Juice the slacker musician finds his way on screen just about exactly when some comic relief is due.  Some of the conversations especially the one concerning the Holy Trinity of rock and roll seem similar to something that could actually be heard in the real world or at least the world of Generation X.  And the subplot of Rob the coffeeshop waiter reluctant to tell his father that he is a practicing homosexual is actually quite endearing and entertaining.Dream for an Insomniac would have been a much better film had DeBartolo stepped down the massive intellectual undertones running rampant in the dialogue given both main characters a healthy dose of Prozac and focused on the basic but meaningful theme of romance in the 90s instead of showing off her obviously impressive knowledge of memorable quotes through her characters.  If anything less than extraordinary is a waste of your time then so is Dream for an Insomniac.  If however you are willing to settle for a decent first attempt at a movie by a newcomer to writing and directing lay down a couple of bucks for this film at your local video store.".

In a similar but yet different way Ione Skye plays strange roles in the same way that Hilary Swank has done. Pamela Anderson BE GONE! I'll vote for the actresses who can portray interesting intellectual characters and who are not silicone enhanced bombshells with only two or three working brain cells.Ione and Hilary will probably never make many covers of the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue or Playboy but they CAN ACT! I could name a bunch of other actresses who do do not get by on just their looks but Ione and Hilary seem to be almost akin in many ways. Go figure.bambi own thousands of movies seen lots multiple times deer".

When I watched it again last night I had the same reaction.The actingespecially the adorable Mackenzie Astin who was such a cute kid on Facts of Life nice to see he grew up so wellmore than make up for the sometimes awful lines that the luminous Ione Skye has to mutter. She's such a good actress that I actually cringed at some of her dialogue. It's the earnestness in which she says it that made me not laugh out loud though. Instead of coming off as a pompous pretentious poser Skye portrays Frankie as a hopeless romantic. She's a lonely dreamer who finds her soul mate at just about the time she's given up on the notion that he is out there. So when she meets David Astin her world is rocked. Love at first sight happens for both but there is one glitchhe has a live in girlfriend. Of course David is so sensitive and sweet that one has to wonder what he's doing with a cold pragmatic law student named Molly Monday. Of course he just has to give in to his desire to be with Frankie even if it means relocating yet again to another city.The fact that David spends loads of time with Frankie and leads her cousin Michael Landes in what should have been a break out roleand friends to think that he has a thing for her despite hiding his relationship means nothing to her though. Instead of seeing him as someone who can't be trusted Frankie is determined to break up his relationship and claim him for herself. She doesn't want to hear her friend Allison played brilliantly by Jennifer Aniston tell her that there are other fish in the sea. She only wants the David Shrader fish. Who could blame her? Astin plays this role with grace and sensitivity even when David acts like a weasel. It's hard to dislike his characterhe's captivating and brilliant. No one is perfect and neither is this movie. Silly dialogue aside it's close to it. I give it an 8 out of 10.".

And I was also very impressed by the high production values.Don't know how much Zanuck spent on it but it was all up there on the screen. The Technicolor of those times is always lovely to look at too. Of course it came out in the middle of World War II so a slight excess of flagwaving is to be expected.

Of course the character is shifted from the reality a stunningly racist intellectually isolated scholar to a preFDR who talks of all races working together and whose every motive is pure and well thought out. The Wilson of this film is pure hero and always right if shown as a touch stubborn.But I was engaged despite it all. And the 1912 Convention scenes early in the film are brilliantly done.

Considering the era and that the only biography at the time was the uncritical one by Ray Standard Baker this is hardly surprising.  Thank God however they cast the unknown Alexander Knox rather than an established star such as Gary Cooper for the title character when you see the film you can't imagine anyone else playing the part.  This movie proves that the Hollywood era could do films with some integrity beyond the standard fare from MGM or Warners.  TwentiethCentury Fox's Zanuck was the only mogul who had the guts to make a motion picture as expensive as this with an unknown in the lead and on a President who unlike say Teddy Roosevelt strikes many people as a cold fish.  I love this film despite its simplifying of history and its wartime propaganda because it's very special in many ways.  There are plenty of movies like JEFFERSON IN PARIS or YOUNG MR. LINCOLN or ABE LINCOLN IN ILLINOIS or THE PRESIDENT'S LADY etc. but aside from NIXON Zanuck and King's WILSON seems the only theatrical film that dramatizes a President's life while he served in office.  For those of you who find it undramatic think again it's a film to cherish".

	schema:reviewBody "Let us be certain of one thing Thomas Woodrow Wilson 1856  1924 Academician Historian Orator President of Princeton University Governor of New Jersey and 28th President of the United States is a very important political figure in American History.  He is usually credited to be one of the top ten great Presidents of our history but these lists of historians are prone to change when new research shows previous ideas were wrong or too hagiographic towards the former President.  In Wilson's case historians of his period are confronted with the problem that he had a great contemporary rival the 26th President Colonel Theodore Roosevelt.  Both men at their best were terrific figures who accomplished a great deal of positive social legislation they and Robert LaFollette dominate this period the Progressive Era and both with Roosevelt's predecessor William McKinley made America a great power.  But T.R. and W.W. were both great egotists and had defects in personality and views that make their achievements questionable.  T.R. loved the strenuous life but he also loved war too much  to the point that his youngest son got sacrificed in France in the First World War.  Wilson helped get the Clayton AntiTrust Act and the Federal Reserve set up but he was a Southerner who backed Jim Crow Laws.  He did try to keep America out of World War I as a boy he lived in Virginia and South Carolina during the Civil War and saw Columbia South Carolina destroyed  probably by Sherman's men.  But he was willing to use our troops to straighten out Latin American countries Mexico twice Haiti the Dominican Republic. His creation of the first international peace organization the League of Nations was great but flawed due to the U.S. not becoming a member  a flaw that Wilson's egotistic fight with Senator Henry Cabot Lodge over accepting the Treaty of Versailles guaranteed.This film was made in 1944 by Zanuck a Democrat.  It emphasized Wilson as the farsighted peace seeker the forerunner of FDR who was planning the United Nations.  FDR actually was in Wilson's administration he was Assistant Secretary of the Navy like his cousin TR had been in 1897 under McKinley.  The audience of the time would have been aware of this.  As most of the audience would be white Protestant and of anglosaxon background it would be assumed that the film would be well received.  Actually it wasn't.  In the midwest with the heavy connections to Germany or MiddleEurope and in IrishAmerican centers Wilson was cool towards Irish nationalismthe audiences recalled the unpleasant intransigence and pigheadedness of the President.  Zanuck had the film opened in his home town in Nebraska only to find that few were interested in the premier of the film  they told him they had not liked Wilson while he was in office.As it is the film is excellent in terms of production and cast starting with Alexander Knox as the President.  His is a great performance which merited his Oscar nomination.  But the film is only positive about Wilson and correspondingly unfair to Lodge who may have had doubts about the Treaty of Versailles but was not conspiring to destroy Wilson  he only had to let Wilson do himself in!.  As for the racist side of Wilson to get a glimpse of it see THE GREAT WHITE HOPE where the Wilson administration is determined to drive the black heavyweight champion based on Jack Johnson and played by James Earl Jones out of the title he deserves to keep.".

Unfortunately it was not so pleasing to the ear and mind.There's really not much to Wilson from an intellectual point of view. It gives a very school book depiction of the man as the Ivy League President turned United States President. You can tell they tried to humanize him by putting a great deal of emphasis on his relationship with his family especially in the first half but in general the 28th President came off as dull and overly pious. I applaud Alexander Knox's effort but it came up short for the most part. In general the depiction of the characters came off as twodimensional clich and generally hokey.When you factor that along with the overly sappy score consisting of heavenly choirs and slow orchestral strains of patriotic tunes and terrible pacing the movie was a little over two and a half hours but it felt much longer it's no wonder why it bombed at the box office. In an era when audiences had a much higher tolerance for over sentimentality this one pushed it too far.".

This is an extremely wellmade movie on just about every level.  It largely gets the history right except where things have to be fudged to maintain the great man's image.  One fact that's never mentioned for example is Wilson's reimposition of Jim Crow laws in the District of Columbia.Perhaps most interesting is how the film handles Wilson's  remarriage. His first wife died in 1914 and Wilson remarried in less than two years.  His new wife was younger and more glamorous than the first Mrs. Wilson.  The filmmakers include a scene in which the dying Mrs. Wilson tells her daughters that their father is a strong and good man but that he needs the love of a woman.  She thus exculpates Wilson from the unseemliness attendant with remarrying so quickly though this  haste was the subject of considerable gossip at the time.Wilson is a wellmade entertaining and interesting period piece that provides some accurate history.  Compare its treatment of President Wilson with the way in which presidents are depicted in film today  Oliver Stone's Nixon for example.  And can you imagine a widower president carrying on a romance in the White House in today's intolerant political and moral climate?".

	schema:reviewBody "It's interesting to read the reviews here of this film. For the most part either quite positive or quite negative. And I have to come down on the negative side.First the film is so historically inaccurate. What else could it be when you include anything positive about the subject but exclude anything negative about the subject. And with Wilson  despite the fact that I'm a middleoftheroad Democrat there's a whole lot of rather unsavory racial issues and a sense that a president should be autocratic and above it all that is left out of this film. There is no mention of his racial beliefs. There is no mention that he felt that his decisions were made through him by God. This is the sort of Wilson biography you might expect to read in an elementary school history book back in the 1950s...that all Presidents were good or even great.And then there's the fact that the film is just playing boring...or should I say tedious? Perhaps the only parts that I truly enjoyed were the scenes at the convention. Not sure how accurate that was but it was interesting to see how conventions might have been a hundred years ago. And what about his health? Throughout the film there is no mention of health issues and then suddenly he's not supposed to go on his speaking tour because of his ill health. No groundwork had been laid for that.Alexander Knox was a fine actor but it seemed as if Hollywood never quite knew what to do with him. He does well here as Wilson. The film has a pretty good cast but beyond Knox on one has a particularly strong part. If I had been Thomas Mitchell or Charles Coburn I would have been particularly disappointed in their weak parts here. Perhaps Geraldine Fitzgerald as the second Mrs. Wilson did deserve a mention.Production standards were high and it shows. Rather lavish. The award winning photography was hard to see in the version being shown on TCM...it really needs restoring of the clarity and crispness.I'm glad I saw it but I'll never watch it again.".

Knox gives very endearing powerful and emotionally resonant performance.  He makes Wilson a real character that comes through even the thick layers of propaganda.  The rest of the cast is good as well especially the women in his life but it is Knox and King that carry the movie.See it for Wilson's excruciatingly intense final political speech.

Why? Because it's downright inconvenient to liberals to focus on their KKK members. Wilson's encouragement of the KKK was fully credible in light of his dark past all but eradicated in most history books.Wilson resegregated the Navy and quickly disposed of most Black employees of the government. Those who remained were sectioned off into separate buildings if not separate office space. Colored rest rooms and drinking fountains were introduced in the federal workplace. If you doubt this just Google something like Woodrow Wilson Black Government Employees. I dare Liberals to check this but bet 10 to 1 they won't.Wilson was also a false image of a peacemaker. He used our armed forces liberally to fight our Latin American neighbors.

Worldwide as well this was not a great year as I could only find A Canterbury Tale Ivan the Terrible and Henry the V as memorable films made that year you could add Laura and a couple of Preston Sturges comedies. Blame it on the war. I was also interested in watching a color film made in 1944 in order to compare it with the great British color films made at that time. All in all the cinematography was very good but the film was dull as hell I suppose because Wilson was boring as hell and was interpreted by Alexander Knox who gave a performance boring as hell. I heard Henry Fonda was considered for the part and that would have certainly helped the quality of the film and its box office which was terrible. Regarding historical accuracy I leave that to others who have studied the matter.".

	schema:reviewBody "Unfortunately for younger viewers whose knowledge of history and geography is already minimal if they happen to view this movie they should be warned when it was made and why it was made. I've just read one of the latest biographies of Wilson which focused on the last years of his Presidency. The legend of Wilson was resurected during WWII because we were fighting the same county Germany. Understandibly you wouldn't want a movie that told some of the hard facts about WWI and Wilson's role in moving us towards a war that most Historians now agree that Wilson's failures in concert with the other Allies gave us Hitler Mussolini and Tojo. The movie fails to show that Wilson could have had the US join the League if he had been willing to compromise with his primary adversary Senator Lodge who in fact had proposed an Organization called the United Nations in 1915. Wilson in the movie is portrayed as an impeccable man of principal when in fact he allowed the British to maintain their empire including Ireland which was fighting its own war with the British Empire during the War. The movie also does not give the impression that Wilson had some very racist opinions about the Japan Italy Eastern Europeans and Blacks in our country and abroad. He didn't particularly like Germans either which is understandable since all of his grandparents were born in England. I don't like to judge a man born in the 19th century by 21st century standards but in my opinion Wilson's proEnglish bias is what got us into WWI and WWII and the Cold War may have been avoided. Younger viewers who happen to see this movie should realize that. As a movie I thought it was rather dull. Alexander Knox probably got the role because of his looks. The real shocker about this movie is that its production cost more the Gone With the Wind made just 5 years earlier.".

Zanuck's personal project created after he returned from his service in WWII. Zanuck supervised every phase of production and wanted to give Americans a film about an American that personified the ideals they were fighting for in Europe and in the Pacific  those of the equality of all men and that Americans value peace but will fight if confronted and when they do fight they pull out all the stops. In 1944 if one was to make a biopic about such a man the obvious choice would be Woodrow Wilson. FDR might be a more obvious choice today and his legacy has largely eclipsed that of Wilson but at the time FDR was still alive and the sitting President so portraying him in a biopic would be inappropriate.Alexander Knox was a perfect choice to play Wilson looking moving and even talking just like him. Most might find this rather long at two and a half hours and the Technicolor will not impress in the year 2013 and Wilson's views on race have been conveniently omitted but I think it's time well spent to remember a President a film and an actor not often remembered today.

	schema:reviewBody "I recently saw this film on cable and I was surprised by how much I liked it and how good it was. Wilson is portrayed by Alexander Knox as a prickly sort who is much easier to admire than like. He was a brilliant man but ultimately a naif outfoxed and outgunned in Europe by the likes of Clemenceau and at home by the likes of Lodge. The films only flaw is that it lets Wilson go on too long with his preachy rhetoric but this can be forgiven because after all it was made and released during wartime. Well worth seeing.Rating 810".

	schema:reviewBody "My main reason for wanting to watch this film was to see how they depicted the politics of the signing of the Federal Reserve Act signed into law by president Wilson on December 23 1913. There was but a brief acknowledgment that yes he did sign it into law. But this single act by Wilson changed the future course of the United States in a more profound way than all the presidents and all the wars that have followed. It was this Act that funded those wars. It was the signing of this Act that gave the United States the ability to 'generate' literally unlimited amounts of money. I could go on but I'm drifting off topic. The main emphasis points of this film's 'Wilson' consisted mostly of his rise to the presidency and his actions as president during the buildup of World War I and his involvement with the League of Nations. In my opinion the complete lack of emphasis on the signing in of the Federal Reserve Act is a concerted attempt to downplay the significance of what it does and who it gives power to. Yet it defines the fundamental structure of American society today. This act was the billion volt shock that jolted the United States into the world power that it is today. Without the Federal Reserve Act the world would be a completely different place. Someday someone will make a film about itbut this one's not it. The beast that 'The Fed' has become since then is a whole other story.".

His latest film starts and ends with this poor innocent taxi driver who in 2002 was taken to the Bagram airbase in Afghanistan. Five days later he was dead.Dilawar's death was the spark which ultimately led to the international awareness of what the Bush administration was doing to its detainees in the war on terror. Gibney's film however decides to look up the tree not down to discover who was really responsible for these unpleasant developments.Gibney's film is bolstered by frank and interesting interviews with some of the troops on the ground. Their remorse is clear as is their disgust. And disgust is the right word. This is by no means an easy watch. The use of the appalling footage which has been generated by the recent conflicts is necessary because if anyone is in any doubt about how morally reprehensible these tactics are this film will make it abundantly clear.However this film's real strength is the structure of its attack on the tactics that are employed. Gibney demonstrates that the tactics used are hopelessly inadequate and never yield effective information. There is a cutting and brilliant comparison with the old techniques and the new where an interviewee a former FBI interrogator uses his old tools of interrogation  words  and you can feel yourself being persuaded.This is not just a polemic. It is a human story and a powerful and wellconstructed argument. It should be essential viewing as what has happened at Guantanamo Bagram and Abu Ghraib should never be forgotten. This is excellent important filmmaking.4 Stars out of 5".

There is a cutting and brilliant comparison with the old techniques and the new where an interviewee a former FBI interrogator uses his old tools of interrogation  words  and you can feel yourself being persuaded.This is not just a polemic. It is a human story and a powerful and wellconstructed argument. It should be essential viewing as what has happened at Guantanamo Bagram and Abu Ghraib should never be forgotten. This is excellent important filmmaking.4 Stars out of 5";

	schema:headline " Pointing out serious problems does not make this film AntiAmerican";
	schema:reviewBody "There is something you need to know about this film it is not about real insurgents or terrorists or about real soldiers and it is certainly not an antiAmerican film.It is about how senior military and civilian officials demand results from their subordinates even if the results are to be obtained by unconscionable immoral and illegal means up to and including torture and murder. The fact that many of these results  what the military like to call the mission  are faked or just wrong is of no particular concern to them. Naturally you'll never find a document signed by any of those officials advocating torture and murder. The most you'll ever find is a reference to enhanced interrogation techniques i.e. torture. And if a detainee dies the senior officers and officials always benefit from plausible deniability and claim that it must be the fault of junior bad apple troops. If terrorists are murderers some of our own troops have certainly engaged in murder too. To reveal this is not antiAmerican it's just a simple fact. Because the troops often do it in a group they think they're not murderers. Just as I imagine someone who participates in gang rape does not consider himself individually to be a rapist. While most Military Police MP troops are fighting hard on the ground every day in Iraq and Afghanistan one group of troops which this film examines are those Military Police who are used as prison guards. The other troops examined in the film are some military intelligence MI troops employed as interrogators in prison camps.If you don't know already Military Police are usually despised by their own troops. If you give a soldier special power over his fellow soldiers he will often abuse it. I still recall an Australian friend of mine mentioning that many of the Aussie Red Hats MPs who sailed for home after WWII never made it back their fellow troops threw them overboard.The old saw about military intelligence being a contradiction in terms is never more apparent than in the case of interrogators. When you hear the word intelligence here you must forget all about spies codes and the stuff of James Bond novels. The interrogators of MI are an example of soldiers who are ill prepared in general to carry out work that would normally take years to master. They are mostly lowranking enlisted men and women privates and sergeants almost none of whom speak with any proficiency the language of the detainees they're interrogating.So imagine the scenario senior officials demanding intelligence no matter how it's obtained unqualified interrogators using whatever means they can think of to satisfy their superiors' demands and MP prison guards who have the power of life and death over their detainees with almost no restrictions on what they can do to them. Behind all this is the unwritten understanding that if something goes wrong the troops will probably not be prosecuted. God help the innocent person swept up into this sadistic bureaucratic system. But as we all know if you've been arrested you must be guilty. Right? The elephant in the closet in all this is the Central Intelligence Agency an organization that regards itself as above law morality and civilized behavior. It gets away with much of what it does by having the military foreigners and contractors to do its dirty work for it. And when somebody has to take a fall well that's what privates and sergeants are for. If your kids are MPs interrogators or just in the military advise them always to watch their backs around those people.This may be a disturbing film for civilians but it won't include many surprises if you've served in the armed forces or on a police force or in a prison. Those are the people who know about this but they're not about to tell you. No wander the USA has pulled out of the War Crimes Treaty. But what officials do not want to admit even to themselves is that war crimes are war crimes no matter if you're a treaty signatory or not.".

	schema:headline " Impacting film that stands as a good summary of the issue";
	schema:reviewBody "In 2002 taxi driver Dilawar was picked up by US forces with his passengers in the desert and taken to Bagram prison in Afghanistan. Five days later he was dead. Injuries to his legs were compared with those he would have sustained if he had been run over by a truck  had he lived it was likely that his legs would have had to have been amputated due to the damage. With this as the starting point this documentary tells the story of the role of torture in the war on terror from Abu Ghraid to Guantanamo.Having put Gibney's documentary on Enron as one of my ten favourite films of 2005 I eagerly took up the opportunity the UK and much of Europe had to catch this on television ahead of the full release in the US in 2008. Shown as part of the BBC's excellent Why Democracy series of films this one opened with the caption question can terrorism destroy democracy?. To the casual listener the question appears to be about the ability of terrorists to bring down what we see as Government ie by crashing planes into it but really the question in regards this film appears to be more about whether our idea of freedom and democracy can survive the way we fight terrorism. As a result this film is about the use of torture against terrorist suspects specifically focusing on the United States.The reader may be wondering why the focus in the title on Dilawar. Well I did too because he died in Bagram and his story sadly ends there while the vast majority of the film focuses on the infamous examples of torture and inhumane treatment in the other places. Well it turns out that Dilawar is a device and one that the film uses very well. The morality of the use of torture is not black and white and of course the usual ticking time bomb scenario is thrown up the film does counter this by suggesting that the weekly scenarios in Fox's 24 are not the norm to say the least but the best answer to most of the moral questions are simply to refer back to a taxi driver who died after five days in captivity with horrific injuries  the film doesn't say he was innocent but it doesn't need to  nobody suggests he was evil or a key player either but yet he is dead. This hangs over the film even though he is not the focus after the first twenty minutes.What the film does from then on in is paint a picture of lack of respect for humanity lack of respect for international laws lack of accountability and lack of transparency. The film plays a clip of Rumsfeld speaking on the then allegations of mistreatment and says that it will be looked into so that the world will see how a free system a democratic system functions and operates well he was right  and it is not pretty viewing. As with Enron Gibney does betray his politics and the film has very little in the way of even handedness about the debate. This is a little disappointing in regards the debate but the overwhelming nature of the presentation of arrogance and carelessness did make wonder how you would balance these issues  certainly the quotes I have heard down the years from politicians have not been able to convince. Certainly a clip of Bush talking about suspected terrorists who have died or as he says put it this way  they're no longer a problem to the United States the fact that he acknowledges they are suspects rather than convicts but yet sees their death as a good thing says it all.Considering this issue is everywhere in the media Gibney does very well to structure his film to build it from the ground up. Not only does he use the words of the Bush administration against them the only thing I know for certain is that these are bad people but he also details the wider political picture beyond the blame that was dumped onto Lynndie England Charles Graner and others. He does this very well bringing in the input of John Yoo and the terribly smarmy Alberto Gonzales. Even after the photographs in the paper seeing the unedited video and hearing firsthand accounts from both sides is shocking and disturbing affair  again how would you set out to balance these? Beyond the issue of torture I found the lack of accountability and ownership to be just as shocking as privates are floated down the river while those in charge never face worse than early retirement. The biggest challenge with this material is to keep it as a valid piece of work even as the topic grows daily and that many will be tired of hearing about it  just this last week or so we have seen more debate and also the CIA deleting old tapes of interrogations tapes that Bush has no recollection of existing however Gibney brings the film to a close well making it feel like something that can stand still and still work  the personal touch of his late father's comments at the end himself a WWII Navy interrogator talking about how we should be different than them making for a suitable summing up of why the film is important.Another strong documentary from Gibney despite the lack of balance and the challenges with the topic. It deserves to be seen by a bigger audience than it has been even if it won't make the difference it should do. Depressing to think that decades from now people will look back on this and wonder how on earth we allowed our leaders to do this in our names and let them get away with it.".

I know the burnout rate is high on these which is probably why I almost did not bother but nothing else was showing. Man was I happy I saw this! It has rekindled my hate for the Bush administration which had turned to apathy over the last year. This tells the story of an Afghani taxi driver that is mistakenly picked up as a Taliban supporter but before they find out he was innocent he has been beaten to death by his American torturers.This film has interviews from all of the guards that were responsible JAG officers FBI people CIA agents on the ground etc. And you see that all of the blame lies with Ashcroft and the Bushies who gave one vague order after another that they wanted confessions and they wanted them quickly with a wink and a nod about what kind of methods to use. So you have these frustrated high school dropouts presiding over these people thousands of miles from anywhere and they won't confess. So beatings and humiliations follow. And when the crap comes out the Bush administration passes a bill that absolves all higherups from any responsibility and they start to bust the enlisted men and women who were following orders. Pathetic. Of course we also find out that over 95 of the prisoners being held were captured by Pakistanis and Northern Alliance people WHO were paid by the US government for each person they turned over guilty or not guilty. And you wonder why meaningful confessions were so hard to come by. It reminds me of the scene from Full Metal Jacket where the psycho army guy shoots the Vietnamese farmers from his helicopter. He says the ones that run are VC the ones that don't run are well trained VC. Very tragic.".

So you have these frustrated high school dropouts presiding over these people thousands of miles from anywhere and they won't confess. So beatings and humiliations follow. And when the crap comes out the Bush administration passes a bill that absolves all higherups from any responsibility and they start to bust the enlisted men and women who were following orders. Pathetic. Of course we also find out that over 95 of the prisoners being held were captured by Pakistanis and Northern Alliance people WHO were paid by the US government for each person they turned over guilty or not guilty. And you wonder why meaningful confessions were so hard to come by. It reminds me of the scene from Full Metal Jacket where the psycho army guy shoots the Vietnamese farmers from his helicopter. He says the ones that run are VC the ones that don't run are well trained VC. Very tragic.";

It's uncontainable to think how all of this started grew exponentially and resulted ultimately in the horrors at Abu Gharyb and Guantanamo Bay in that it is nestled in the twisted criminal yes folks criminal 'policies' of the Bush administration. But Alex Gibney's approach isn't narrowminded but multifaceted he's interested in what a complex ugly organism torture has become the psychological just as much as the physical and he has a man at the center of it. Dilawar an innocent taxi driver from a poor farm in Afghanistan was swept up by three other Afghan soldiers and sent to Bagram prison where along with other supposed terrorists or terrorist collaborators was tortured in his case especially in brutal fashion as we learn in graphic description from those who participated firsthand and died from the trauma.His death was a controversy but not one that ever got the kind of attention it deserved until this documentary I never even heard of Dilawar or even much about Bagram prison. Yet it was at this prison as well as the first biggie interrogation of the wouldbe 20th hijacker of the plane on 911 to crash in Pennsylvania which by false confession led to an overexcited but falserooted assumption that Al Quaeda had links to Baghdad that led to Abu Gharyb which revealed the horrors of soldiers in unyielding terror over their subjects but more importantly the virus that spread through the chain of command. Gibney's approach is approximate and expertly probing it's not enough to just focus of Dilawar even as his story could make up a whole legitimate documentary alone or on Abu Gharyb. As in his previous film Enron The Smartest Guys in the Room it's essential to dissect this wretched beast from top to bottom to see not simply the soldiers firsthand accounts but straight from the horse's mouth the words from Cheney Rumsfeld Powell and Bush himself.Because in reality there is something to feel sorry for with these soldiers. It can be argued and not without just cause that what the soldiers did at Bagram Abu Gharyb and to an extent even at GITMO was wrong and rotten and they could have said no and so on and so forth. However as with the ground war situation in Iraq it's all about the chain of command and the fact that no matter what the parties initially responsible are not held accountable for any of their actions. It's almost frightening to forget the amount of footage available with these men like Rumsfeld and Gonzalez and Cheney where they not only admit to being fine with torture tactics  and whether or not it's psychological torture or not is besides the point as ALL torture IS torture albeit a facet that Gibney brilliantly chronicles in the history of the CIA to its 'logical' extension in recent years  but set it up in legal wrangling so as to not get it any trouble for what they've done which is of course breaking Geneva conventions and whatnot.If I sound like I'm sounding bias with this then you should leave this review right now. There is no bias when it comes to this issue or rather there SHOULD be no bias as for a split second McCain showed until he relented recently that torture isn't as bad as he used to think. What one sees as the line between what is proper interrogation of a subject and outright abuse to get that ticking timebomb is revealed by Kloogman from the FBI who paraphrases how an interrogation would usually be done and lays it on the line that this form has actually had results  not pain and death or at best a bull court at GITMO where it's like a joke Kafka wouldn't write. Gibney presents all the information with the bluntness that's required with testimony footage from press conferences and commissions i.e. that cringeinducing bit with Gonzalez where he has a horrible pause when trying to answer a simple question about whether or not to condone torture and it's presented lucidly edited for a cumulative effect and with the skill of a filmmaker in total trust with his subjects to take all of the pieces into a whole that shakes one to the core.And all of this would be powerful enough to make an impact but with the recent explosion of news coverage on waterboarding  and that the CIA has admitted to torturing three subjects  Taxi to the Dark Side remains startlingly relevant. In fact it's even more tragically relevant than last year's Sicko or even No End in Sight. From the tragedy of Dilawar to the tragedy of Abu Gharyb which was like Salo turned into as shockingly real as could never be imaginable the Bush administration has put the US into even more danger than ever before by resorting to the lowest form of humanity condoning acts to the soldiers that sixty years ago would never be committed in the harshest of circumstances on our side. This again isn't some silly bias this is just fact. It's enough to make one sick to one's stomach and as long as a film such as this exists the pain can't be brushed aside or dulled by diverting network news.".

	schema:reviewBody "Taxi to the Dark Side doesn't contain anything wholly new just more complete detail and important clarifications such as the fact that Guantanamo uses very much the same basic methods to Abu Ghraib though the location is cleaner and of course was not formerly used by Saddam Hussein. Dilawar the Afghan taxi driver was essentially beaten to death by American soldiers in the Bagram prison. He did not live long once his illtrained but plainlydirected captors got hold of him but his final hours were terrifying and horrible. They kicked his legs till they turned to pulp and would have had to be amputated had he lived. A heart condition caused an embolism that went to his brain and was the cause of death which on the official US papers given to Dilawar's family in English so they did not know what they meant was homicide but the officer in charge of the prison denied this when queried. Gibney who was responsible previously for the documentary Enron The Smartest Guys in the Room presents interviews with some of the American soldiers responsible for Dilawar's death. They were of course only following orders. Other talking heads clarify the fact that the gloves are off policy by US authorities following 91101 goes back to Cheney approved by Bush carried out with gusto by Rumsfeld and sent directly down the line to the lowranking and inexperienced people whose behavior after the Abu Ghraib scandal emerged was claimed by authorities to be that of people on the night shift or a few bad apples. This film thoroughly disproves that claim.Gibney shows how the US administration has become willing to blatantly disregard the rule of law domestic as well as international to fight their war on terror in ways that involved extreme cruelty and murder. In doing this they had the assistance of various corrupt or immoralor if you prefer simply very misguidedmen of the law and the judiciary.The practices have been illegal. They may also have been variously unwise. The photos of Americans mistreating Muslim prisoners at Abu Ghraib are good recruiting material for antiUS terrorists. But torture also simply doesn't work accomplishes nothing useful. Much time is given to Alfred McCoy author of a book called 'The Question of Torture' and a professor of history at the University of Wisconsin. McCoy recounts that the CIA has been working on methods of coercion for all the decades of its existence but their experiments have yielded little except lawsuits from victimized guinea pigs. Another authority a former CIA operative asserts that the best method to obtain information is to gain the confidence of the prisoner and convince him you can help him.But post 911 high value prisoners were clearly tortured with anything their captors could think ofand then confessed to anything they could think of. The film clarifies that psychological experiments by Donald Hobb at McGill University in the Seventies proved sensory deprivation is the most effective means of torture at least according to Hobb it can induce psychosis within 48 hours. The film shows that basically all terrorism suspects here and abroad have been subjected to sensory deprivation. That is what covering the ears head and hands does and it was and is standard treatment to continue this for hours and days. This is more effective than pain. But effective at doing what? Breaking down the prisoner not obtaining reliable information or any information for that matter.Hence the widely spread US policies are not only harmful dangerous immoral and illegal but stupid and in intelligencegathering terms worthless.The extraordinary rendition waterboarding sensory deprivation etc. don't work in practical terms but they have a political purpose. They convince people that the US is getting tough on its enemies. But the US has not been holding real enemies. If it were the useless prisoners or wrongly captured would be filtered out as Dilawar ought to have been. He was innocent. And now the US authorities are in a bad position. They cannot acquit even those few Guantanamo prisoners they are putting up for show trials because to do so would reveal that they had been held for six years for no reason. That would look bad. Varieties of Orwellian terminology have been devised to describe these prisoners. The film also shows tours of Guantanamo and deflates the claims of the tour guides.One reason for all this is who's been in charge a group of draft dodgers who never served in a war. Senator McCain is shown in the film as a man who opposes torture for good reason because he experienced it during his years in a North Vietnam prison.Another issue American has a developed a culture of guiltyascharged of hysterical attacks on imagined enemies. An example the popular jingoistic TV program 24 starring Kiefer Sutherland as a CIA agent who saves millions by torturing mad terrorists with ticking bombs in Times Square. A Dark Side talking head says that there has never been such a person captured and suggests that if there were such a person would have the commitment to die rather than reveal information about his plot.I do not know if torture never gets you information though the assertion that insinuating oneself into the confidence of a prisoner is more effective makes sense. What is clear enough from Gibney's powerful and disturbing film which contains many images not for the squeamish is that the torture and wrongful imprisonment and lawlessness of the US as a nation post911 indicate a country that has become very cruel and very stupid.Andrew O'Hehir of Salon.com recounts that at a postscreening QA when Gibney was asked what he would like his film to accomplish he said I hope it provokes some rage. Well says O'Hehir it worked on me. May it work on everyone who sees it.".

	schema:reviewBody "There is ample evidence of torture at Guantanamo Abu Ghirab and Bargam Airforce Base. This is undisputed. It embarrassed the Bush administration when evidence of their secret was finally leaked to the public in the form of photographs. Would it have been better if these photographs of American soldiers committing torture had never come to light? This documentary is substantiated with facts. Yet some still find the truth too much to bear. On IMDb a reviewer wroteStupid biased AntiAmerican and unbalanced.... Those who hate the USA Israel and are sympathisers with the Taliban and Muslim extremists will love this film.So to document American War Crimes is antiAmerican? Can this opinion really be held? Another reviewer wroteWhere were the American suicide bombers  did I miss them? I was also waiting to see how the evil Americans use suicide bombers to kill innocent men women and children in markets on buses in schools and any and every other public place. Oh wait silly me. Americans don't use suicide bombers.In fact there is documented evidence that British SAS working for British Intelligence dressed in local Arab clothing tried to explode a car bomb in Basra in 2005. BBC The British Government apologised to Iraq over the incident. Also in 2005 American Soldiers disguised in Arab dress were captured in the act of setting off a car bomb in a Bagdad residential area. Mirror World. I am sure these soldiers had no intention of killing themselves in the blasts but the objective is clear cause chaos and bloodshed then blame your enemy.Another reviewer that states he served in Iraq had this to say It's War The liberals will have you believe that America is and always will be the cause of so much unrest in the world today. We aren't. Rogue nuclear nations and terrorists without borders are as much to blame. I am sure some detainees at Guantanamo were in the wrong place at the wrong time and I am sure that some were members of Al Queda. Again consider the events of 911 and consider how difficult it is for the foot soldier to identify friends and foes in the fog of war. Let them do their jobs as best as they can or else there may be another 911.He continuesThe documentary ignored the yield of interrogations. Did they save American lives on the battlefield or at home? Did they make a difference? I personally served in Iraq and I consider myself wellversed in modern media trickery. Had the documentary given any attention to what resulted on the battlefield from any intelligence obtained then HBO's antiwar meaning would have been lost.So America is not the cause of so much unrest in the world today? Then who is?With the preemptive and some would say illegal invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq millions have died mostly civilians and as a result the credibility of America has suffered considerably. With the American use of torture the Bush administration legitimised rogue states to use the same methods with impunity. What is made clear in this documentary is that torture almost assures that prisoners once released will seek revenge. What effect carpet bombing phosphorous bombs daisycutters napalm and tons of incendiary bombs will have on recruiting more terrorists is uncertain. I am sure some detainees at Guantanamo were in the wrong place at the wrong time and I am sure that some were members of Al Queda. So that is 5050? Half are terrorists and half are not. Not really a sure thing is it? This equates to gamble rather than a concerted effort to find real suspects. Brigadier Roger Lane Commander of British forces in Afghanistan stated that his troops had yet to find capture or kill one member of Al Qaeda. We haven't captured any Al Qaeda. We haven't killed any. he said to the BBC. Top US commander in Afghanistan General Stanley McChrystal said that he sees no indication of any large Al Qaeda presence in Afghanistan. So the existence of this phantom enemy popularised as Al Queda is itself in question.Let them the Soldiers.. do their jobs as best as they can or else there may be another 911. So soldiers should be unhindered by media scrutiny because it will affect their performance and so result in another attack of the magnitude of September 11th 2001? I don't think so. What is needed is sound intelligence military leadership and considered plans of operations. Requirements that seem to have had been of little consequence for Bush Cheney and Rumsfeld. The documentary ignored the yield of interrogations. Did they save American lives on the battlefield or at home?The documentary did in fact show the yield of torturous interrogations. That prisoners undergoing torture will say anything to stop the suffering. As was shown by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed admitting a link between Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden when clearly there was none simply to stop induced drowning by waterboarding. Colin Powell later admitted the information taken from Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was incorrect. As a side note Khalid Sheikh Mohammed interrogations are mentioned as a source in the 911 Commission report 211 times.Saving American lives is no more important than saving anyone else's and history has proved that information taken under torture is totally unreliable.I find it hard to understand how anyone would not want their armed forces to perform with the highest principles of bravery and honour. To apologise for the use of torture is inexcusable and if these tortures become institutionalised then it will only be a matter of time before they will be used on citizens at home.".

Taxi to the Dark Side is an exceptionally meticulous documentary that takes the case of an Afghan taxi driver who was beaten to death by interrogators at Bagram base in 2006 and puts it in the context of American antiterror policy.

This documentary makes a compelling suggestion that popular entertainment has helped spread the idea of justified and reliable torture.Taxi to the Dark Side won the Oscar for best documentary and nobody saw it.

	schema:reviewBody "In addition to objectively painting a portrait of a given subject matter a documentary is usually expected to be an expos of said subject matter a story you've never heard or a story you've heard before but not in this way. Though engrossing and often gross the real weakness of Taxi to the Dark Side is the fact that it's the same story told in pretty much the same way we've always heard poor leadership within the U.S. administration led to poor decisionmaking on the ground which led to poor detainees being treated poorly. Everyone's guilty but no one is to blame. This circuitous chaos is the subject matter and not the fault of Alex Gibney but I hold him accountable for not telling me anything I didn't already know about it and for thoroughly confusing me with years and locations. If there was ever an instance of preaching to the choir this was it. Why did I expect more? Because Gibney's Enron was a triumph  as much as you knew about that scandal which was probably not much he laid out a linear exacting argument that left no room for debate. As ironic as it seems to say so Taxi to the Dark Side is not going to convince anyone of anything. You either think torture is bad or you think torture is good. I really don't see a middle ground and if you're in the second group you won't change your mind from what Gibney presents you'll just shrug your shoulders. For a brief moment he actually starts to get creative as we hear from a former FBI interrogator whose interrogation techniques were effective and peaceful as much as he exaggerated. That started to be convincing so why did it end? And what about the 30 second insight into how torture has been embraced by the American public thanks to the likes of 24? That's an interesting place to go but we're left with more polarizing soundbites from Bush. How about the flashquick glimpse into the future repercussions from torture survivors? Gibney even pushes his own personal connection to torture to the credits. Where was that the whole time? The short of it is by focusing on the same old details and using some pretty tired arguments Gibney prevents his merely good work from achieving real excellence. Though it's a good excuse to get angry for a few hours Taxi to the Dark Side can really only be recommended for anyone who has had their head in the sand for the last five years.".

And more often than not whenever I mention this people pepper me with insults because they believe that's what documentaries are designed to do. I beg to differ. Let me show you what I mean.There are some seriously stilted documentaries that look at one side and ONLY one side of an issue and never give credence to the other. How about an interview with someone who opposes the views that the documentarians are putting forth? How about some information that might refute what is being told? This onesidedness is just too easy to find. Things like AFTER INNOCENCE THE FUTURE OF FOOD and RELIGULOUS are prime examples there are tons more but I don't have the time nor inclination to mention them.Occasionally  if not extremely rarely  a documentary will come along that allows both sides to speak. And such is the case with the Academy Award winner TAXI TO THE DARK SIDE.The story starts and ends with the murder of Dilawar a taxi cab driver in Afghanistan who is mistakenly picked up by U.S. forces and sent to Guantanamo Bay Cuba for interrogation. Once there he soon dies from injuries sustained at the hands of his captors. The middle of this documentary is the meat and potatoes of what went horribly wrong with the U.S.'s war on terror. It's a serious eyeopener. Not because it focuses on the problems the U.S. had with its detainees after 911 but because it allows everyone to speak about the successes and failures of torture. Yes torture.From the men on the ground staff sergeants and privates to the President's advisory attorney at the U.S. Dept. of Justice John Woo we get to hear from just about everyone on the topic of the incarcerated detainees and their treatment at the hands of untrained and unprepared interrogators. It is astonishing too to learn that not a single person above the rank of sergeant was punished for the death of Dilawar nor any other detainee who was abused. You mean to tell me that these grunts were responsible for ...everything? Give me a break! I don't delude myself any longer. The U.S. either overtly or covertly now uses enhanced interrogation techniques e.g. torture. Make no doubt about it. We do it because we want to protect ourselves. But at what cost to our own moral compass? We claim to follow The Geneva Convention but do we? Not as far as I can tell. And don't take my word for it. Watch ALL of the people in this documentary talk about this very subject and come to your own conclusions.".

	schema:reviewBody "Originally filmed to be one of the documentaries to take part in BBC British Broadcasting Service 'Why Democracy?' 2004 film series which consists of ten documentary films from around the world questioning and examining contemporary democracy. Taxi to the Dark Side really outshine the other films to become one of the best documentary films ever. Directed by filmmaker Alex Gibney the film examines the USA's policy on torture and interrogation in general specifically the CIA's use of torture and their research into sensory deprivation by showcasing the story of an Afghan taxi driver named Dilawar whom was beaten to death by American soldiers while being held in extrajudicial detention at the Parwan Detention Facility during the first years of War in Afghanistan 20012014. However due to its controversial nature of opposition to the use of torture from political and military opponents and its failure to gain a television station to broadcast after its production end its message was shelf for years. It wasn't until 2007 that people got to see it in limited theaters. Even with that not a lot of people saw it. It wasn't until 2009 that this documentary finally got broadcast with Discovery Channel to the majority of mainsteam audiences with warnings of disturbing images and content involving torture and graphic nudity. It was here that I finally got to see it. Without spoiling the movie too much I have to say Taxi to the Dark Side accomplishes what a documentary like this is supposed to do. It shows the utmost disgusting things about the war in multifaceted way. The film approach isn't as narrowminded as some critics make it out to be. It shows a lot of things. While the movie is mostly about the 2002's Bagram torture and prisoner abuse it also showcase the facts that lead to the Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse in Iraq in 2003 and the abuse at Guantanamo Bay detention camp. It also displays the legal loopholes that upper government officers were doing so not to allow capture terrorists to have the same rights of normal capture soldiers which is protect under the standards of the Geneva Convention. Yes I do understand the film would seem a bit onesided and bias to certain audience members since some of the rigorous interrogation tactual do work. However in my opinion all these crude acts is morality wrong no matter how much they say that torture works. Also this movie also shows the flaws of torture. What makes this story even more tragic is how Dilawar was an innocent man who was at the wrong street at the wrong time who had no information about any attack or terrorists. It's sad to hear that brutal things happen to him for a crime he didn't committed. This shows that sometimes the information gather by torture victims is unliable and full of mistakes. It's also sucks to hear that most of the higher ups that allowed this torture to happen on these bases were never prosecuted for their crimes. Many of them were pardon by laws they made or by blaming the blame on lower enlisted personnel scapegoats. Despite that in my opinion the best thing about this movie is how it shows positive solution to the problems such as asking for stronger methods to the government uphold the standards of the Geneva Convention forbidding torture and allowing more peaceful negotiation. I also love how this film was able to get interviews from most of the people involve with these cases. All of the talking heads gave some very important information. I also how welledited 'Taxi to the Dark Side' was. All of the reenactments mixed with archive footage was wellcrafted. It's hard to find a fault about this film. If anything I didn't like how certain imagery were reappear over and over again frequently out of context. Another is how badly structure the film points are. Its message seem to jump around a lot. Despite that it was a good movie. The film was so good that it won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature in 2007. Overall I have to say this complex wellresearched  welldocumented film is a real eye opener. It's a mustwatch for anybody whom is interested in what happening in the world today. I highly recommended 'Taxi to the Dark Side'. Go see it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Because this is a documentary I have to go about writing this review differently. First I will write about how it's constructed and the information it provides then I will write my own personal response to the film.Alex Gibney's Taxi to the Dark Side is a tellall about how the U.S. government's position on torture really operates. There is no doubt that this is a controversial subject but it is essential viewing.Credit has to go to Gibney for not trying to make an attack on the Bush Administration and its practices. Unlike Michael Moore he lets the information speak for itself. If there is something that deflects blame from someone that we previously thought should be held accountable he still uses it. On the flip side he lets no one who is guilty of something get away with it.The information comes fast and furiously but it is clearly illustrated. Voiceovers images and interviews are used to great effect. Taxi to the Dark Side is a tad long but Gibney has a lot to say.Now for my thoughts...You put people in a crazy situation and people do crazy things.one of the former interrogators interviewed.Indeed the times we live in are crazy especially for the armed forces fighting overseas. It seemed that after 911 everything changed. The terrorist attacks on that day shocked the world and the American people wanted justice. As an American I can't blame them.But the question I ask is at what cost do we want justice? If we don't uphold the values that we are governed by then what are we protecting? What's the point of fighting if we can't live the way we want to and the way that millions have given their lives for us to be able to live like in the past? After viewing the film it seems to me that this stemmed from us wanting quick justice even though it couldn't be obtained. The pressure to do so caused us to act irrationally and this is the result. Everyone knows that torture doesn't work as victims are more likely to say what their abusers want to hear than that we simply don't know. But we bypass all the laws to get answers to prove that we're doing something.Yet this answer seems like incomplete reasoning. If this is the case than why would John Yoo who authored memos that exploited loopholes to give Bush and his cabinet expansive powers on this issue and to give us leverage to disregard the Geneva Convention which is supposed to protect people from these kinds of interrogation. Just because they may not be protected by the Geneva Convention does that mean that we can torture them? Do they not have the same rights as someone who is? While we can blame people like Lyndie England who committed the torture Gibney says while their actions were reprehensible and they did take their actions too far and I think they should have been punished he also portrays them as scapegoats. The soldiers had no real training and were given vague at best guidelines at how to interrogate them.Furthermore Gibney proves how important our right to a trial is. A shocking number of terrorists are kept in detention and tortured because they were handed over to the US by the Pakistanis and Iraqi army. But they were put in detention without a trial and most with no evidence and sometimes they were given a huge bounty in exchange. So how can we really know that these people are actually insurgents? Some are but how many? Even if you're liberal or a conservative this is a must see.".

The information from torture is often wrong false and unreliable. Water boarding is actually tame compared to the techniques used in this documentary. You must see it to believe it and understand. Torture is wrong on every level.";

The focus is on a taxi driver named Diliwar who was abducted and endured a Kafkaesque nightmare of inhuman treatment at the hands of a few people who belong in jail for the rest of their natural lives. Dilawar was a twenty two year old man who weighed 122 pounds. He was chained to a wall with his arms in an upright position. A hood was placed over his head to restrict breathing and the sadists punched him in the abdomen and struck him at his knee caps over one hundred times. He was kicked in the groin and deprived of sleep. He died within five days. The autopsy showed that the severe beatings had pulpified his legs to the point that had he survived his legs would have been amputated. The documentary is chilling and a must viewing for anyone working for the Pentagon. As an American I am ashamed of the conduct of our self appointed guardians of liberty as they destroy our reputation around the world. Thank You Alex Gibney for your courage in seeking the truth.".

The term is merely one of ironic affection. What they are are modern gypsies living on the fringes of society plying their ancient trade. Perhaps they were lovers in the past. Clearly they are a team dependent upon one another. In particular what these small time con artists do is go to conventions medical dental farm equipment salesman conventions find a target and con the poor dupe out of some of his money.Some. The film begins at a roulette table on the French Riviera with Betty stringing along a not entirely bright lawnmower salesman whom she invites for a drink. She slips some knockout drops into his drink and quickly invites him up to his room where after he is out cold Victor follows. They take some of his money. Victor insists on always playing it safe and using a rather strange but plausible psychology which will figure later in the movie of making the man think that perhaps he wasn't robbed since if she had intended to rob him would she have only taken part of the money out of his wallet? They do forge his signature on a check but he will only find out about that later and indeed might not be sure about how that happened.So this is a small time con. Trouble begins for our vagabond thieves when Betty meets the CFO of a big corporation who is transferring five million Swiss francs in cash out of the country. She senses the chance for a big score and after the mark falls in love with her she thinks she brings Victor into the scheme. With some tricky exchanges of the metal suitcase containing the money Betty and Victor end up over their heads in some very hot water.The plot is a little on the unlikely side as thriller plots tend to be but the thing to keep in mind is the idea of taking only PART of the money. This is what fools the bad bad guys as opposed to the good bad guys who are our vagabond duo Betty and Victor.Any movie starring the incomparable Isabelle Huppert La Pianiste 2001 Merci pour le chocolat 2000 La dentelliere 1977 and many more  is worth seeing and any movie directed by Claude Chabrol Une affair de femmes 1988 Betty 1992 La ceremonie 1995 etc. will have something of interest in it. Add a fine performance by Serrault one of the great veterans of the French cinema and Rien ne va plus is definitely worth seeing. However the role played by Huppert does not challenge her and Chabrol's more famous films some of them also starring Huppert are decidedly more interesting.But see this for the lighthearted chemistry between Huppert who is sublimely fetching and Serrault who is clearly past the age of any pretension. Such a quasiPlatonic union based on the love that still warms the embers in a dying fire has become almost a staple of directors past their prime. See Claude Sautet's Nelly and Monsieur Arnaud 1995 which also featured Serrault for another example.Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!

	schema:headline " Chabrol Huppert and Serrault concoct a sophisticated amusing and satisfying con game";
	schema:reviewBody "It's hard not to like clever con games even when they're violent The Usual Suspects or unpleasant House of Games. They're just about irresistible when they're amusing and surprising Nine Queens. That we're part of who is being conned is a major part of the pleasure. Claude Chabrol's The Swindle Rien ne va Plus isn't especially violent well there's the matter of a spike in a man's eye but he's dead when we see him but The Swindle is definitely sophisticated amusing and very clever. Two of the reasons it works so well and is so satisfying are the lead players Isabelle Huppert as Betty and Michel Serrault as Victor. Who are these two? Betty is in her forties elegant cool and smart. Victor is in his early seventies shrewd and clever. They are smalltime con artists who work the conventions and upscale gambling houses. Victor sets up the scams and Betty seduces the mark but only to the point of slipping a mickey into a drink. When the mark passes out in his room Betty lets Victor in and they take the money...but only enough to make the mark believe later that he may not actually have been robbed. Then off they drive in their big fully equipped RV back to Paris. We observe all this during the first third of the film with growing delight in their humor their logic and their professionalism. Are they lovers? Are they related...perhaps father and daughter? Are they old friends? Are they just affectionate partners? Because of the chemistry between the two characters and between Huppert and Serrault we're never quite sure. Betty you know I love you but I can live without you Victor says at one point. We instantly like these two although we'd better be sure where our wallet is if we go out with them some evening. They know their limits and they're careful with their business. But then we notice that Betty may have a plan of her own. When the two meet at Sils Maria near St. Tropez to work a dentists' convention Betty has already developed a relationship with a goodlooking selfassured man who she tells Victor is a courier who will be delivering 5 million Swiss francs. He could be the biggest con they've ever attempted...but Betty seems to be working both sides. Victor is showing signs of jealousy. And the man in question is actually a courier for the mob who is planning to leave France with all that money for himself with Betty on his arm. Who is scamming whom? This threeway puzzle gets complicated. Chabrol shows us all this with such cool sophisticated humor that it becomes a great pleasure just to sit back and watch Victor and Betty  and Chabrol who also wrote the screenplay  move the pieces around the board. Huppert and Serrault are such fine actors and work so well together that their relationship as Betty and Victor becomes a very satisfying and intriguing part of the story. Victor knows they are stepping out of their league but he loves a challenge...and he has been good enough to get the better of anyone he considers stupid. We hope that will includes a vicious mob boss and his thugs. Still as Victor says It's easy to swindle someone who thinks they have the upper hand. The movie ends as it began with a charming little scam this time involving just Victor and Betty. May they have a long life together taking advantage of all those foolish marks.".

Claude Chabrol's The Swindle Rien ne va Plus isn't especially violent well there's the matter of a spike in a man's eye but he's dead when we see him but The Swindle is definitely sophisticated amusing and very clever. Two of the reasons it works so well and is so satisfying are the lead players Isabelle Huppert as Betty and Michel Serrault as Victor. Who are these two? Betty is in her forties elegant cool and smart. Victor is in his early seventies shrewd and clever. They are smalltime con artists who work the conventions and upscale gambling houses. Victor sets up the scams and Betty seduces the mark but only to the point of slipping a mickey into a drink. When the mark passes out in his room Betty lets Victor in and they take the money...but only enough to make the mark believe later that he may not actually have been robbed. Then off they drive in their big fully equipped RV back to Paris. We observe all this during the first third of the film with growing delight in their humor their logic and their professionalism. Are they lovers? Are they related...perhaps father and daughter? Are they old friends? Are they just affectionate partners? Because of the chemistry between the two characters and between Huppert and Serrault we're never quite sure. Betty you know I love you but I can live without you Victor says at one point. We instantly like these two although we'd better be sure where our wallet is if we go out with them some evening. They know their limits and they're careful with their business. But then we notice that Betty may have a plan of her own. When the two meet at Sils Maria near St. Tropez to work a dentists' convention Betty has already developed a relationship with a goodlooking selfassured man who she tells Victor is a courier who will be delivering 5 million Swiss francs. He could be the biggest con they've ever attempted...but Betty seems to be working both sides. Victor is showing signs of jealousy. And the man in question is actually a courier for the mob who is planning to leave France with all that money for himself with Betty on his arm. Who is scamming whom? This threeway puzzle gets complicated. Chabrol shows us all this with such cool sophisticated humor that it becomes a great pleasure just to sit back and watch Victor and Betty  and Chabrol who also wrote the screenplay  move the pieces around the board. Huppert and Serrault are such fine actors and work so well together that their relationship as Betty and Victor becomes a very satisfying and intriguing part of the story. Victor knows they are stepping out of their league but he loves a challenge...and he has been good enough to get the better of anyone he considers stupid. We hope that will includes a vicious mob boss and his thugs. Still as Victor says It's easy to swindle someone who thinks they have the upper hand. The movie ends as it began with a charming little scam this time involving just Victor and Betty. May they have a long life together taking advantage of all those foolish marks.";

The ambiguity extends to the relationship between the two protagonists which appears to be fatherdaughter although the movie often seems to be hinting otherwise  the long lingering final shot is probably the final tease in this respect.

	schema:reviewBody "I have seen this film on several occasions and its wry slightly surreal humour never fails to captivate. It survives multiple viewings. Each time that I see it I notice even in subtitling more of the wonderful asides and throwaway lines in the dialogue often by characters just passing out of the camera that cover references to current affairs history and even intertextual references to a wide range of other films. The film also hovers delicately on a tightrope between realism and wish fulfillment fantasy. It even treads delicately into a milieu that is more associated with the James Bond films when the central couple tangle with a global Mr Big in the Carribbean and again points to the fantasy elements in the Bond films and renders them even more fearielike and magical. It also has a lightness of touch that is sometimes missing in modern French language cinema's earnestness and search for a nonconventional bohemian non bourgeois non commercial positioning. The only time that it jolts out of its unified and deftly handled aesthetic is in the execution of the courier. The starkness of this scene indicates its nonHollywood origins. Plotwise Victor and Betty don't miss a beat despite this confronting warning. We all cheer when Victor with Betty still handcuffed to him is knocked out by the minders on the beach. There is of course a great final twist.Whilst there are many affectionate cinematic tributes to conpeople with hearts of gold or lovable criminals this is one of the very best. There is a great charm in this tale about two small time criminals with their somewhat principled crimes seeking to enter the big time. Rien Ne Vas Plus should be far better known to a general audience".

	schema:reviewBody "Claude Chabrol is the master from the French New Wave who specialized in mysteries with sordid characters but aside from only a few hints of Chabrol's flare this is a predictable Swindle film. Story is about an older conman named Victor Michel Serrault and a woman named Betty Isabelle Huppert who are clever but mainly smalltime thieves. We see Betty at a casino flirting with a businessman and when he's not looking she spikes his drink. They end up in his hotel room and he passes out. They steal some but not all of his money so that when he wakes up he won't be sure if he gambled it away or not. Then Betty decides to run a scam on a financial courier Francois Cluzet for a crime syndicate who is suppose to transfer 5 million Swiss francs but of course they plan the old Switcharoo. After this happens the head of the syndicate named Monsieur K JeanFrancois Balmer escorts the two of them to his place and wants his money back! This is definitely not Chabrol's best effort but its not because its not well made it is. But the material is so familiar that at times the film seems run of the mill. There are some nice touches like Victor always being mistaken at the hotel for an employee. The script does have you guessing about certain things like the relationship between Betty and Victor. Are they lovers? Is he her father? A few times during the film Betty calls him Father but it might be a pet name and they might also be tutor and student. And the caper itself is never clearly defined as we suspect that Victor had the whole thing planned ahead of time. Usually the characters in Chabrol's films are complicated and challenging for the viewer but thats not the case here. Its definitely a lightweight effort and while its mildly interesting mainly for watching another reteaming of Chabrol and Huppert its nowhere near Chabrol at his best.".

This is an Isabelle Huppert who is almost wholesome  fully wholesome when compared to the sleaze for which she seems to have a penchant  which means she's so good to look at that any acting she throws in  and that's plenty  is a bonus. She and Michel Serrault have a wonderful rapport and it's clear they enjoyed working together but Francois Cluzet is able to hold his own against the formidable duo for the middle third of the movie in which he appears. As someone has already pointed out this is primarily a fun movie and isn't trying to be profound or pretentious just put a smile on your face from reel 1 and keep it there more or less throughout with the possible exception of a couple of minutes when Huppert discovers Cluzet wearing an arrow where it will do the most good. This is one that will probably stand a subsequent viewing after several years.".

	schema:reviewBody "As films about con artists go this movie by Claude Chabrol is among the most interesting because it puts two minor leaguers Isabelle Huppert and Michel Barrault into a situation where they are plainly in the big leagues and over their heads. Huppert and the much older Barrault specialize in bilking notquitebright convention goers of relatively small amounts. The questionable element of their approach is that Barrault never takes the whole amount available. He leaves enough behind so the victim might not notice. That's an extremely doubtful assumption. However when the con turns on five million Swiss francs and Barrault leaves 2.8 million behind that's apparently enough to persuade the vicious men behind the transfer of funds that Huppert and Barrault should be allowed to live. Since their captors have already put a spike through the eye and into the brain of the guy who was planning to make off with the whole five million it seems highly unlikely that they would give the minor league team a getoutofajamfree card. But that's the story elevated by nicely manipulated suspense and excellent performances by Huppert and Barrault. The relationship between the two stars is mysterious and left uncertain. She calls him Papa but he is clearly not her father. If as seems likely they have been lovers as well as partners Barrault seems curiously unaffected when Huppert takes time off to have an adventure which includes setting up an intense love affair with the man intending to steal the five million. As a sucker for these kinds of films I enjoyed it quite a bit despite the improbabilities. After all The Sting wasn't quite likely either.".

	schema:reviewBody "Claude Chabrol made some of the best thrillers of all time in the late sixties and early seventies with such classics as La Rupture This Man Must Die and Wedding in Blood under his belt. The Swindle is the most recent of all the Chabrol films that I've seen and while it has to be said that it doesn't capture the brilliant complexity of his earlier films this is still an excellent exercise in suspense and trickery well handled and bolstered by a very capable central cast. We focus on Elizabeth and Victor a pair of scam artists. They pull off a successful scam and the female of the pair decides she needs some time on her own and they decide to meet up again after a ten day break. They meet up at a hotel during a dentist's convention and Elizabeth has already found a mark named Maurice who is transporting five million Swiss Francs on behalf of his company. The two make plans to steal the money under Maurice's nose...however there may be more to the game than either of them realised.This film has been described as 'lightweight Chabrol' and I'd agree with that as compared with his earlier films there just isn't all that much to this one. However there's still plenty about this film to enjoy. The main point of interest is the relationship between the two central characters. Chabrol never directly tells us exactly what this relationship is her calling him 'papa' appearing to merely an affectionate term. The two central actresses are superb with the demure and attractive Isabelle Huppert acting well alongside the older Michel Serrault. The plot flows well and although it never really picks up Chabrol keeps things going at a nice pace and always ensures that his audience wants to see what's coming next. The film is rather lightweight and enjoyable for the first hour or so and takes a darker turn towards the end which does actually fit the film well despite the change in atmosphere. Overall this is not vintage Chabrol by any means but it's a well made and entertaining thriller and I'm sure Chabrol fans will appreciate it.".

Through sometimes silly sometimes clever trial and error means the protagonist starts coming up with an escape plan.

JUST USE THE POT!!!.In the end the two story lines meet to give the audience a bigger picture. The ending still came as a surprise although in hindsight it makes complete sense.

But all he sees is something that looks like a button in the wall.. when he presses it hundreds of naked angelboys appear before him only to disappear back into the wall..except their penises! He then proceeds to press the penises and finds out that something mysterious happens every time he does so! Holes open in the walls and random things are thrown into the room be it furniture gadgets food or even living things! All that happens inside the room is apparently a personal voyage for the man but it also effects other people's lives at the same time most notably the Mexican wrestler and his family which we discover near the end of the film. But it really is something that should be watched to be completely understood  and even then it's not even certain that you'll be able to understand what happened  or why.Highly recommended film. Very unique and entertaining throughout even though the last fifteen minutes get really bizarre and too artsy for my taste. This movie is not to be missed. You will probably never see anything quite as weird and funny like this. 810".

	schema:reviewBody "How can I explain such a simple yet complex film such as Symbol? It's not easy but I'll give it a try.Symbol seesaws between two stories and is shown in three chapters which are labeled Education Implementation and Future. There's the story of an outofshape Mexican wrestler known as Escargot Man as he prepares for a title fight in some tiny dusty little village. And simultaneously there's the story being told of a Japanese man who awakes to find himself in a large all white rectangular room with no doors or windows.Just how are these two stories connected? The answer is an existential journey into the energizing and inventive script of Matsumoto. For those who have seen his first feature Big Man Japan in where a solitary middleaged man periodically transforms into a giant to defend Japan from an array of monsters you might have a little clue as to what you're getting into with Symbol. Let me assure you right now that Symbol is definitely its own monster and perhaps one that will make both fans and newcomers to Matsumoto's work say WTF.Perhaps the best film I could compare Symbol to would be Stanley Kubrick's scifi masterpiece 2001 A Space Odyssey. Yes it's a bold comparison but an apt one as well. Just substitute Kubrick's towering monolith and epic wormhole sequence for Hitoshi Matsumoto's room full of baby penises and a penis wall climbing ascent into the future and you're basically looking at the same film.".

Or can it be a set of expectations you bring into the theater with you? I ask because Symbol seems to be deliberately riffing on all of these things trying to find the line where familiar tropes become well symbols. It plays both with a familiar sub genre and a lessfamiliar setup that's on the verge of becoming a sub genre at this point you could even argue that this is the movie that pushes it over.For most of its running time Symbol seems to be two completely unrelated movies running parallel to each other. One is a Mexican Lucha Libre movie or maybe short film is more appropriate given the relatively small amount of running time it involves. It's perfectly conventionally shot and with a simple narrative the wrestler Escargot Man prepares for a tag team match while a kid in the audience cheers him on.The other storyline is deliberately seemingly perversely different. A nameless Japanese man comedian Hitoshi Matsumoto who also wrote and directed wakes up in a featureless white room about the size of a bachelor apartment wearing a set of candycolored pajamas and a ridiculous bowl cut. He has no idea how he got there. Exploring the room he finds exactly one notable feature a button on the wall shaped like uh male genitalia. Pressing it triggers an explosion of cherubs from the wall who leave behind...more penisshaped buttons. Pressing those buttons in turn triggers a bizarre and seemingly useless array of objects that come shooting out of the walls along with other generally disagreeable effects like one which turns into a butt and farts toxic fumes at him. Eventually though some of the buttons start to reveal their potential usefulness in mounting an escape...except that whoever trapped him in this room seems determined to screw with his head.Believe it or not all this weirdness turns out to be headed somewhere relatively straightforward. I mean it's still a weird movie that I'm sure even Matsumoto wouldn't be able to explain completely employing as it does Lynchian dream logic and a love of the absurd for the absurd's sake. But the two threads do end up coming together in a way that...well makes sense might not be the way to put it but they do come together to make a point. The movie makes an attempt at profundity near the end which is a lot more palatable for being weird and slightly inexplicable.Up until then aside from the slight and seemingly straightforward Luchadore subplot the movie is a oneman show. Matsumoto unfortunately depends a little too much on mugging and acting zanily idioticthe character he's playing makes a number of choices that reveal him to be a dimbulbbut the situation is a natural one for humor especially as the faceless forces that control the room seem to enjoy tormenting him. There's also a hilarious recurring sequence in which comic book panels narrate Pajamas Guy's various plans for escape while Matsumoto grooves out in the foreground. And the narration is in English for some reason! I'm not sure if Shinboru has some other shading of meaning that doesn't translate well into EnglishI'm assuming that the Symbol of the title refers to the little penisbuttons yeah I knew writing this review was going to be awkward but it also seems to relate to the various motifs and elements we expect in a genre story and the storyteller's attempt to break free of them. In that sense this is an extremely meta movie. One thing's for sure if the movie's about helping to define genres than its clearly staking out a patch of ground under bizarre Japanese mindfu.".

	schema:reviewBody "One of the weirdest movies you'll ever see and El Topo meets 2001 Space Odyssey meets Nacho Libre meets a routine by Steven Wright or Eddie Izzard are just some quotes used to describe Hitoshi Matsumotos second film Symbol Shinboru the word I've been using to describe it to people is just weird.Symbol begins in Mexico where a family is eating breakfast. The father is wearing a wrestling mask and is soon picked up by a swearing Nun who has a severe case of road rage to take him to where he'll be fighting that night. The film then cuts to a Japanese man wearing spotty pyjamas who wakes up in a large completely white room. He doesn't know where he is or how he got there and he begins to search the room for any clues. He pushes what he thinks is a button and hundreds of laughing naked cherubs appear out of the walls they soon disappear back into the walls leaving nothing other than remnants of their tiny willies on the paintwork the man starts to scream and the craziness begins!The man presses a willy and a toothbrush is thrown into the room from a wall he continues to push many of them around the room and all sorts of objects appear jars sushi magazines a person who runs from one side of the room to another a whole array of random objects. He soon realises that one of the willies reveals a door in the room but it always disappears by the time he gets to it what then unfolds is him trying to find a way to escape from the room using different objects for different purposes it seems almost like a video game.In Mexico everyone is doubting that the father wrestler who's stage name is Escargot Man will win the fight but it's soon revealed that he's secretly got someone to help him in the fight. The film is set half in the white room and half in Mexico during the film it appears the two stories have no relevance to one another but by the end they do.It's a very funny script and excellent acting by all characters but especially by director Hitoshi Matsumotos who plays the main unnamed Japanese character in the film. You have to have patience to watch this film it takes quite a while to get into but once I got past the What is going on? stage but I really enjoyed it. It's quite silly in its jokes so don't go into the cinema thinking you're watching a serious arty film because it's anything but.".

Imagine my surprise when I found this movie to be a guaranteed 100 cult classic masterpiece for the future. It is difficult to describe and analyse all the ingenious subtleties of this yet another wonderful piece of modern cinematic treasure into which Japan's movie industry has been evolving for a number of years. Some of the most creative pieces of modern cinema have certainly come from Japan during the past 10 years or so.This movie is also weird very weird in fact no question about it. But it is so fabulously done the jokes are funny they are very funny. All that which shows us this movie is not only brilliantly thought out it is even more astonishingly executed it is even more difficult to find any actual goofs from this one as it is from most Japanese movies  Every single prop seems to be always in it's right place! There are way more thoughts and semantics in this movie than just a few obscure references to the direction humanity is evolving into. The outline of a man trapped inside a room which he is clearly destined to escape from is only faintly veiled depiction of humanity itself which is only given purpose by creating comedy when seemingly random objects start popping out of the walls if we bother to manipulate or pull the right levers as in life in itself in the real outside world. The comic slapstick routines which Hitoshi Matsumoto so superbly and funnily pulls off are truly funny obviously the work of a master comedian who knows extremely well the physical side of comedy as well as the importance of sounds facial expressions movements and timing. And while you're watching the movie unfold you will most certainly notice that you will start yourself imagining the infinitely various ways how he could or should escape from the room using the objects found in the room. And at the same time you can only smile and laugh for how much fun and comedy one can pull from a bottle of soy sauce toilet plunger sushi and a hanging rope.The other worthy observation is the parallel story line which from the outline has absolutely nothing to do with our antagonist in his bright white room this fact is even underlined by showing us that it happens as far away from Japan as possible in Mexico in the world of Luchador wrestler's family and work place the wrestling ring. Naturally this so far removed place with its people who are so far removed from our antagonist must somehow be tied together at point which the movie evolves into completely different spheres becoming more surreal and fantasy driven. The viewer however is not left out in the cold as if you were watching closely from the beginning you will understand everything when the movie ends.What a brilliant weird intelligent clever and hilarious movie!".

	schema:reviewBody "What the hell did I just watch? That is the immediate reaction I am sure most will feel when first watching Symbol. It was certainly the first thought that came to my mind. Believe it or not it's not a reaction I have often. Most movies even badly made movies have a certain respect for story structure or lacking that a regard for the audience's ability to make sense of what's going on not so with Symbol. A third of the way through I was elated with the fact that for the first time in a while I was watching something completely new. It is my personal belief that the difference between a genius and a vagrant on the bus mumbling halfformed thoughts and conspiracy theories is an audience. If you come into this Japanese import with that mindset I'm confident you will find something to like if not outright love about Symbol.The movie begins with Matsumoto an unnamed Japanese man who wakes up in a large empty windowless room. As he gets up an examines the white room the only abnormality he finds is a small phallic protrusion sticking out of one of the walls. He taps it with his finger spooky ominous music swells. Suddenly a mess of cherubs appear slowly from out of the walls and giggle as he stands petrified. They morph back into the walls leaving only their own protuberances signaling they are all a type of switch. The man screams smells his finger and continues to scream. There are vignettes of other stories chopped into the film one in particular we return to constantly involving an aging Luchador anxiously awaiting his last battle. Largely though we're left with Matsumoto flipping switches in a frantic bid to get out of the room.Hitoshi Matsumoto is apparently something of a big time celebrite in his homeland often playing opposite longtime partner Masatoshi Hamada. Since the eighties Matsumoto known as the boke or funny man and Hamada the tsukkomi or sadist have dominated sketch comedy TV in Japan through their Downtown Owarai act and various variety hour like comedy shows. Despite a partnership that is rivaled only by maybe the South Park 1997Present guys the two Japanese darlings find being around each other after the show awkward. This would certainly explain why Hamada is in no way involved with Symbol yet his influence is felt in every slapstick situation. There is some borrowing from the Manzai comedy tradition here but there are more visual themes associated with Bunuel and Jodorowsky not to mention a heavy dose of Kafka. It's not surprising that despite no film release in the west the movie has been more warmly received stateside than in its native Japan.There are various levels of subtext and metatext at play here yet I'm inclined to belay all that and simply recommend this bizarre little trip as strongly as I can. This movie is as absurd as you're liable to get so for those who don't see the humor in a loudly dressed Japanese man struggling to escape from a humansized Skinner box don't bother. Those of you who are curious to see one of the goofiest wackiest most nonsensical movies ever committed to film you need to see Symbol. It's hard to find online so if you find a version sans subtitles snatch it anyway. This movie is one of those rare foreign movies you don't need a translation to understand or rather not understand what's going on.".

There is some borrowing from the Manzai comedy tradition here but there are more visual themes associated with Bunuel and Jodorowsky not to mention a heavy dose of Kafka. It's not surprising that despite no film release in the west the movie has been more warmly received stateside than in its native Japan.There are various levels of subtext and metatext at play here yet I'm inclined to belay all that and simply recommend this bizarre little trip as strongly as I can. This movie is as absurd as you're liable to get so for those who don't see the humor in a loudly dressed Japanese man struggling to escape from a humansized Skinner box don't bother. Those of you who are curious to see one of the goofiest wackiest most nonsensical movies ever committed to film you need to see Symbol. It's hard to find online so if you find a version sans subtitles snatch it anyway. This movie is one of those rare foreign movies you don't need a translation to understand or rather not understand what's going on.";

	schema:reviewBody "This is very surreal film. I suppose this is to be expected from the mind of the Matsumoto Hitoshi whose comedy style regularly utilizes absurdity.It is difficult to describe this film without giving spoilers and far more difficult to explain it. The best descriptionexplanation I can provide is that this film uses fantasy to showcase human psyche as we watch Matsumoto who is never identified with a name deal with a situation which he wakes up into with no understanding of how he got into it who is controlling the situation or what he is supposed to do or not do to escape from it. However beyond my perhaps pretentious interpretation I honestly cannot describe it further. Maybe there is no explanation for it and it might be fair to say that Matsumoto was biting off more than he could chew in an attempt to create a deep philosophical work which ultimately was just baffling. Or maybe it is intentionally nonsensical for no other reason than to be entertaining. It has to be seen to be believed.The film that is closest in style to it that I can think of as I write this is perhaps 2001 A Space Odyssey although that film can at least be explained to some degree. This one however cannot be adequately explained as far as I can fathom outside of each viewer's own personal interpretation of it.This film has quite good graphic effects which is always a positive thing nothing makes a film lose credibility more than dated graphics. It also has decent comedy elements throughout again to be expected from Matsumoto and the plot was certainly intriguing.It is difficult to determine if this film is better or worse than the rating I gave it since it is so uniquely weird that there isn't really any kind of yardstick to compare it to. Nevertheless it was certainly engaging and definitely did not have lowquality production value so it surely can't be called bad.I can't say that I enjoyed the secondary storyline since it only becomes relevant at the very end and even then only in the most minimal albeit hilarious way so the frequent jumps from the primary story to the secondary one was jarring and quite frankly rather boring and irritating. I used these moments as a chance to go and make a cup of tea. Mercifully though these frequent interruptions are brief lasting only about a minute or so at a time.In my opinion this film is worth watching if for no other reason than to experience its insanity but it is not something I would suggest lightly to someone. I recommend watching this film if 1 you enjoy surrealism andor 2 you are a fan of Matsumoto Hitoshi. Otherwise I struggle to advertise it to a wider audience as it is definitely an acquired taste. I will likely watch it again sometime in the future just because it is so strange that it cannot be ignored.Bizarre.".

Is the film a comedy? Well not really unless you have a very bizarre surreal or just Japanese sense of humour. It's certainly not a drama or a thriller. A comic fantasy perhaps complete with toilet humour? It's certainly weird enough at least not to be boring and at the end the two totally unrelated stories meet in a mildly amusing if highly imaginative way.

It's rather curious how you never grow tired of the way Lewis displays the gore in his movies! The sequences here in which female bodies are disemboweled impaled or even crushed with an industrial punch press are overlong monotonous and completely implausible yet you stare at the screen with a gigantic smile on your face. Of course these are the only significant scenes in The Wizard of Gore as the rest of the film hangs together by lousy acting embarrassing dialogues and a shortage of decors. By the year 1970 and after having unleashed a handful of similar horror movies already Lewis still couldn't care less about building up tension or continuity and went straight for exploitative grossness.

This is easily one of the stupidest most unbelievable disturbing and hilarious movies that I have ever seen in my entire life. You'll find yourself laughing out loud as you vomit at the sight of people having swords shoved down their throats being done in with punch presses being chainsawed in half and every other disgusting thing you can possibly imagine. Only in the world of cinema can things this ridiculous happen. That's what I love about movies they take you into a different world and this movie does just that. Aside from the gore what really makes this movie stand out is it's evil villain 'MONTAG THE MAGNIFICENT'. After watching this movie my friend Jason and I decided to start worshipping him and revelling in his badassness. Also what totally rules about this movie is just how terrible the acting is. Ray Sager is actually the worst actor of all time. It made me laugh the entire time I watched it yet at the same time his presence has an unnatural creepiness to it. The ending has to be seen to be believed.Truly a unique horror film that should be seen by fans of bad cinema or just anyone who wants to be totally grossed out and given nightmares.My personal rating is 1010".

The frames are not normal  but they have a very queer charm. The effects are very  unreal but this is part of the ideology. The crowd is not shot together with Montag. But really why be picky. This is also part of the laugh and this film is very funny. Ok so Herschell didn't have much money. So what?Monatg had me panicking. No this is not only about gore. This is about destroying the line between illusioncinemareality. About viewing and seeing. About the conscious and subconscious. We all take part in Montag's horrible show.I watched the film with a few friends and we all liked it a lot but I guess I am the only one who really has nightmares ever since. I don't know why. This film touched some very deep point in my psyche probably but I can't get over montag. Over the horror of the girl screaming her pain and the crowd not hearing cries.Watch it 10 Points!Ido".

	schema:reviewBody "When I was a kid I couldn't get enough of the Horror genre. Renting Horror flicks on the weekend from everywhere from Blockbuster to the smaller places like Video Warehouse. It wouldn't take too long to plow right through every Friday The 13th every Elm Street and yes every watereddown Halloween disappointment among countless others. Eventually it would come to my attention that there is a whole other universe an alternate universe if you will of Horror. I had discovered the wonderful world of vintage BHorror. You know stuff like Basket Case Messiah Of Evil and Burial Ground. Needless to say it didn't take long to discover the groundbreakingly cheesy flicks of good ol' H.G. Lewis. Known mostly for his earlier stuff like Blood Feast and Two Thousand Maniacs Herschell Lewis would later go on to make a movie that really stood out for me. One of the goriest and might I add one of the least wellthoughtout Exploitation flicks of the 70's. This is The Wizard Of Gore.I sure am glad I like gore because magicians are kinda lame. And if nothing else this 1970 goreepic teaches us this. If you like 'em unrealistic and confusing then I assure you you will approve of this lamebrained story which involves you guessed it a magician. Montag The Magnificent. Played by Ray Sager a man 30 years younger than what the role calls for. No problem. Nothing a little white spraypaint and fakelooking uneven white eyebrows can't fix. Ridiculouslooking eyebrows are the least of Montag's problems. Because this guy is rude irritable kinda loud and just plain unpleasant. In other words Montag is a real bummer. This old codger who is clearly in a bad mood spends the first 10 minutes of the movie explaining to everyone why his magic doesn't suck. None of that saw a woman in half stuff... Well actually that's exactly what's gonna happen. Except it's gonna be authentic and gory as all hell. And basically it's just gonna be real except this chick just gets up and walks off unharmed. So that's basically why Montag's magic doesn't suck. Montag as a person on the other hand does suck. because the magic or whatever takes hold later on in the evening and said chick literally falls apart in all her gory glory. No cgi here gang. Just excessive fakelooking gore complemented by awkward inept acting along with the usual stupid dialogue. It was beautiful I tell you.And might I add the old grainy VHS that I had originally seen this on was much more suitable for a movie such as this. The cleaned up pristine look of the screen totally ruins it in my opinion. However owning a movie you love on DVD is kind of necessary considering all the cool little extras involved. The commentary being a good example of that. In the audio commentary Herschell makes mention of his disdain for this film which is funny considering he's the guy who made How To make A Doll and Blastoff Girls. And now this should be the part where I warn you of the evils of the remake from a couple years ago. I could present my own separate rant dedicated to my hatred for this film. Instead I'm just gonna let you know that I only made it about a half an hour through and let you make up your own mind. what a shame that Herschell's next film The Gore Gore Girls would turn out to be his last for 3 decades. Herschell's longawaited next project Blood Feast 2 would end up 10 or hell even 11 times gorier than anything he'd done before. As if things couldn't get any better I would imagine a DVD release for Herschell's next film is right around the corner. So if you happen to dig lewis you may want to keep an eye out for The UhOh Show! starring Lloyd Kaufman and the legendary Joel D. Wynkoop. But first things first. If you've seen Blood Feast andor Two Thousand Maniacs and you got the Lewis fever The Wizard would be the next logical step. Passionately recommended to Gorehounds young and old. 1010".

More explicit than any of the blood trilogy which his reputation rests on but without a tenth of the entertainment value. In fact I'd say it's even worse than his nongore turkey 'SheDevils On Wheels'. At least that one had one or two laughs. Ray Sager plays Montag The Magnificent and could be Lewis' most wooden leading man which is saying a lot!. He plays a magician who causes a sensation by dismembering female volunteers on stage then apparently making them whole again and none the worse for it. However afterwards the girls turn up dead injured as they were in his illusions. An ambitious TV talk show host Judy Cler and her sceptical sportswriting boyfriend Wayne Ratay try and solve the mysterious deaths and determine just what if anything Montag has to do with it. Some people seem to inexplicably rate this snoozefest very highly but if it was the first H.G.Lewis movie I'd ever seen it would probably be my last. The acting is terrible as expected and the gore is ridiculously unconvincing but this time round the plot drags and I found the whole thing terribly unamusing. For Lewis beginners I'd recommend you avoid this one and go straight to his hillbilly horror 'Two Thousand Maniacs!'. It may not be as inyourface as 'The Wizard Of Gore' but it is a lot more fun.".

As a friend of mine said he is the Ed Wood of gore films. I have to agree completely. The editing is always choppy and horrible the music is poorly placed the acting seems to be straight out of a junior high play and nothing seems believable. This brings me to the gore. If HGL only got one thing right in his career it was gore. The gore in this film is awesome and cheesy. He may have made bad films but they sure are entertaining.Sorry for going off on so many tangents I'll get back to this movie. The story follows a TV reporter and her boyfriend who attend a magician's show of blood and dismemberment. They become suspicious of several deaths being linked to the show. It's a simple story but it is a lot of fun. I really like the magician theme. The bad acting factor definitely applies in this movie. I often wonder where HGL found these people. But as always the gore is magnificentno pun intended and almost saves the movie.

I would have passed on writing any more reviews of them until I and a few friends spent and I mean spent in the sense of exhausted used up wasted an evening watching The Wizard of Gore. Naturally I had seen it before but my attention was always focused on the extremely inept yet still revolting gore effects. Then one of my friends watching pointed out just how dull the bits in between the gore scene were. Quite true. Even the leadins to the supposed shock scenes crept along at a snail's pace completely dissipating any tension there might have been. It is almost impossible for anyone to pay attention to this film because for most of the film nothing happens. Then when the gore scenes come you haven't been engaged by the film in any way. You really just don't care about what happens next. The Lewis cult people should give it up. Lewis is incompetent as a director and his movies are not innovative  just dull repulsive little cinematic abortions.".

I would have passed on writing any more reviews of them until I and a few friends spent and I mean spent in the sense of exhausted used up wasted an evening watching The Wizard of Gore. Naturally I had seen it before but my attention was always focused on the extremely inept yet still revolting gore effects. Then one of my friends watching pointed out just how dull the bits in between the gore scene were. Quite true. Even the leadins to the supposed shock scenes crept along at a snail's pace completely dissipating any tension there might have been. It is almost impossible for anyone to pay attention to this film because for most of the film nothing happens. Then when the gore scenes come you haven't been engaged by the film in any way. You really just don't care about what happens next. The Lewis cult people should give it up. Lewis is incompetent as a director and his movies are not innovative  just dull repulsive little cinematic abortions.";

	schema:headline " Not the worst thing Hershell Gordon Lewis ever made....though that certainly isn't saying much!";
	schema:reviewBody "Although I have read countless accolades for many of the gore films of Hershell Gordon Lewis I found the gore in this film to be incredibly stupid. Sure there was a lot of fake bloodbut the gore?! It often consisted of obviously fake mannequin heads and cow guts that just looked nothing like people guts. Perhaps in 1970 people thought this was realistic but today with improved technology and an increase in the level of gore in films this and other gore films of Lewis just seem dumb despite their receiving a plug in the recent film JUNO. This isn't to say every one of his films was bad...just all but 2 or perhaps 3. 'Genius' is a word way too casually used for Hershell Gordon Lewis. I prefer to use words like 'schlockmeister' or 'wizard of crap'.In this film a stage magician specializes in gory tricks. He saws women in half or drives spikes in their headsand yet they are just fine after the trick is complete. Oddly hours later they collapsedead with injuries sustained from the tricksas the injuries reappear. The problem for me is that the guts are just stupid looking and the guy starring as the magician Ray Sager is a truly awful actor. Sager yells his lines and annunciates in a strange mannerand sports hair that looks like it was colored white using WhiteOut! This act comes to the attention of a local TV personality and her reporter boyfriend. She wants to book the magician on her show and later he wants to investigate him because all of his stage volunteers keep coming up dead hours later. It all culminates in a TV appearance where he tries to use his evil psychic powers on everyone in the studio AND at home! And when it ends the movie actually isn't quite complete. There are lots of mistakes made due to the littleknown fact that Lewis is a lemurthis would explain the sloppy direction. Here are a few examples the woman who collapses dead at a restaurant is still clearly breathing the newspaper that you see at the 43 minute mark looks nothing like a real paper the font and style are all wrong and you can see the different cut and pasted portions peeling off if you pay attention.There is a tiny germ of a good story here but because the entire production is so sloppy and stupid I can't recommend it to anyone except bad movie fans or those who actually believe that Lewis could direct. I could also see that many see this movie just as misogynistic as it's a film showing contempt for women as you see them hacked to pieces. But considering how bad and stupid and poorly acted it all is most who MIGHT be offended might just instead see the whole thing as a waste of time as opposed to something patently offensive.".

I'd also like to say a few words to those who have criticized the effects in Mr. Lewis' films. Herschell Gordon Lewis is the FIRST director to bring us in your face blood and guts such as those effects in this film and therefore he had no preset standards to go by in fact he set the standards as low as they may have been for many of the genre films today. Many of the horror films of today use godawful CGI effects most of which are MUCH more fake in appearance than anything I have ever seen in one of Herschell Gordon Lewis' films. If it weren't for films like The Wizard of Gore there would be no Freddy Kruger no Jason Voorhees no Leatherface and no Michael Myers. On a side note this film is also notorious as being the first horror film to have a chainsaw murder in it years before Last House on the Left or The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. A remake of this classic starring Crispin Glover in the title roleis currently in postproduction stages and it is being reported that the very same company that is producing this remake is also producing a remake of She Devils on Wheels. There is also an idea being pitched that would cast many of Mr. Lewis's most infamous villains including Montag the Magnificent from The Wizard of Gore in lead roles. Watch for Mr. Lewis next film Herschell Gordon Lewis' Grim Fairie Tales which puts the eightysomething yearold director back in the director's chair where he belongs!".

The Wizard of Gore is another movie from the awesome Hershell Gordan Lewis and is filled with ridiculous gore bad acting and a storyline so out there you have to wonder what was going on in his head at the time.Ray Sager plays Montag the Magnificent a magician who does more then just pull the old rabbit out of the hat. No Montag likes performing tricks that involve sawing women in half with a chainsaw or ramming a metal spike through a woman's head I think you get the idea. The magic part comes in when he is able to murder these women without the audience knowing. To the audience it is nothing more then a trick. To us the viewer we see the goriness of what is really happening. Apparently the women being murdered don't even realize they are dead until long after the performance is over when they just drop dead in public places. Will the police figure out what is going on and who is committing these horrible crimes?Ray Sager's performance as Montag is a lot of fun as most of his performance is him yelling and boasting. Obviously Montag has quite an ego. The gore effects are what you can expect from any HG Lewis film cheesy but extremely gory and bloody nevertheless. The acting is truly hilarious and is just awful but this all works to the movies charm and the style. Let's face it this is no award winning film here.I heard that a remake is in it's post production. I am not sure what to make of this as most remakes just suck. But on rare occasions we get a decent remake.Anyway The Wizard of Gore is a great gore film and should not be missed. 810".

Herschell Gordon Lewis is a cult figure in the world of horror and exploitation films. His 'Blood Feast' and 'Two Thousand Maniacs' are famous examples of his craft. Both of those films I have to say are better than this one. At least Two Thousand Maniacs has that toetapping And the South will Rise Again opening song.Wizard of Gore is of course a terrible TERRIBLE film. But it will raise more than a few smiles which is why it fits nicely in the so bad it's good basket. But then again it's so deathly boring! Between each outrageously gory yet incredibly fakelooking murder scene are stretches of dialog and ham acting that beggar belief for sheer boredom. At least the Wizard himself Montag the Magnificent played by the illustrious Ray Sager is entertaining for some of the WORST acting you've ever seen in your life. I wanted to slap him and scream 'spit your lines out man'. He lingers over every lame sentence each and every word is delivered so painfully slowly and painfully badly. Seriously your DAD could act better than this. And you've seen him try on those few rare embarrassing occasions after a few too many beers at a family barbecue. Well that's how bad Ray Sager is here! The gore scenes are rightfully notorious. Well if someone fingering entrails the local butcher's finest and grinning salaciously is what qualifies as gore. There's plenty of guts on display but it's hardly convincing. Actually it probably couldn't be LESS convincing. Especially considering after each shot of the viscera being fondled we cut back to a full shot of the victim without a drop of blood on them let alone guts hanging out. The sword swallowing scene is particularly badly done. The actresses almost seem to giggle at times. They know how ridiculous it all is.Aside from Montag's onstage gore fantasies the highlights for me are his Mesmer stare with powdered eyebrows that don't match the ones he usually 'wears' which supposedly represents him hypnotizing his audience or a hapless volunteer the journalist with the crime scene photos who visibly glances at someone off camera several times perhaps to read his lines the way the victims suddenly fall down dead after the show in the most awkwardly edited ways...I could go on.So yes it's a WOEFUL film but it's so bad it's an entertaining watch. But really it's just awful AWFUL filmmaking in every department. Be prepared to fastforward through all the dialog and everything in between Montag's eyebrow closeups. The only thing Mr H. G.

	schema:reviewBody "Please disregard the above review. Either the viewer likes being spoonfed his films or was not paying attention. Note that the viewer didn't even attempt an understanding of the title Belly which was the central theme of the film. The viewers others comments can stand for themselves.In all honesty the first time I watched this film I actually turned the volume down  I was enraptured by the way each scene was composed on the frame. Visually this movie is stunning. The director has a striking style and besides that he is PRODIGIOUS  there appears to be no end to the ways that he can make his compositions rich in visual entertainment and information. I can enumerate a list of techniques he used here but that will be an exercise in boredom for today's cybernauts. Even more important the compositions are never created for their own sakes which was my initial criticism the first time I saw it  they really do propel the film. The style is integral to the story. Get the film and you will see what I'm referring to if you disagree say so in your review.80 of the film seems to be a riff on the hiphop video aesthetic never mind the fact that the director greatly defined the recent shape of this aesthetic and myth. In it's third act however it uses the very same conventions  outlaw figures ostentatious style and violence  to confront and question these aesthetics. In the climactic ending this criticism is embodied in the confrontation between one of the heroes of the film DMX and a figure symbolic of actual figures from black history. The director actually used an anachronism to face down a contemporary hero and argues for the relic.What the film argues for as embodied by the final speech of the Minister character is a message so powerful and relevant  particularly to the very people who will associate themselves the most with this film  that it will leave you breathless. It is a timeless message passed down from antiquity framed by the most daring and contemporary of directors. It is an exhilarating juxtaposition.What of the title Belly? A belly is what a pregnant woman has it is the external shape of soontobeborn child. It is the womb the source of life. It is the promise of what is to be as well as the origins of what is. If you abstract it it's shape will be that of a circle  the symbol of wholeness of the journey to individuation. It is the same difficult journey that the movies' antiheroes take.BELLY is a powerfully visual yet simple tale about redemption. Not to be missed.".

	onyx:emotionText "Please disregard the above review. Either the viewer likes being spoonfed his films or was not paying attention. Note that the viewer didn't even attempt an understanding of the title Belly which was the central theme of the film. The viewers others comments can stand for themselves.In all honesty the first time I watched this film I actually turned the volume down  I was enraptured by the way each scene was composed on the frame. Visually this movie is stunning. The director has a striking style and besides that he is PRODIGIOUS  there appears to be no end to the ways that he can make his compositions rich in visual entertainment and information. I can enumerate a list of techniques he used here but that will be an exercise in boredom for today's cybernauts. Even more important the compositions are never created for their own sakes which was my initial criticism the first time I saw it  they really do propel the film. The style is integral to the story. Get the film and you will see what I'm referring to if you disagree say so in your review.80 of the film seems to be a riff on the hiphop video aesthetic never mind the fact that the director greatly defined the recent shape of this aesthetic and myth.

But Belly is way more than just a rap videogang banger movie. Yes the elements of both are there which only add to an even better storyline. Because Hype Williams is a director of music videos helps him incorporate those styles into the film which are unbelievable.Although it may not seem so the acting by DMX Nas and Method Man was real and well done. Unlike many other films of its genre BELLY actually maintains a positive message throughout the film and gives a sign of hope rather than doom. The combination of superb camera work slammin soundtrack and complex story made it a mustsee in my opinion.It does contain endless scenes of numbing violence but that only adds to the strong reality of the film. I hope to see more from Hype in the future looking forward to it!".

I found it to be one of the better urban movies to come out in the 90's not better then boyz n da hood or menace II society. But It was the best one that centered around life in New York's crime underworld. I also think it's DMX's best movie so far. The movie is stylishly filmed by Director Hype WIlliams and the characters are extremely realistic. The dialog is also realistic. The movie might fall short when it comes to how the plot is set up and the overall development of the characters. That is not to say that the movie doesn't have an overall significant meaning because it does. It addresses some of the problems that face inner city youth today. Most people that don't like this movie fail to realize this fact. The minister character in the movie is not important but rather what he is saying is. With that said I feel that the movie takes bold steps to show how certain ways of life are wrong and why they should be changed. The movie is also not your typical crimedrug movie however it does have some of those moments that could have been rethought to be a bit more interesting. With all that said I recommend the movie to be at least watched once because if nothing else the movie does have a great soundtrack and decent plot.".

Although I can tell you the little bits that I got from it. Two gang members are living the high life with sex booze drugs and money. Soon they both realize that they are heading down the wrong path one wants to go back to Africa to get in touch with his roots and tries to convince his girlfriend to join him while the other gets all religious.I was told to watch this film because it was and I'm quoting The Black Scarface. Let me say that this is not anywhere near the calibre of Scarface. The one and only way I can ever see someone making this strange comment would be because in one particular scene they directly ripoff Scarface. It involves a man who is on drugs seeing on video cameras strangers entering his house. He grabs guns and then goes on a killing spree. Exactly like Pacino in Scarface. The guy doesn't even make it out alive he dies like Pacino from behind.Nothing in this movie is worth commenting on I'm hurting right now trying to write this review because I have to think about the film. Why is it that rappers think they can have an acting career? LL Cool J can pull it off because he is actually decent at acting. The people involved in Belly give Busta Rhymes a run for his money as worst rapper actor. DMX who is in random martial art flicks Cradle to the grave Exit Woods is playing the exact same character he does in every other movie. Seen one seen them all. Nas for some random reason wants to go back to Africa in the film I found myself on the floor in tears both fro laughter and sadness. I don't think he raises his voice once in the entire movie.Hype Williams is a music video director. He directs rap videos which is evident here because this movie is just one big overly long rap video. If Williams were to have more films under his belt he may be able to reach Uwe Boll's credibility. Yes this movie is worse then House of the Dead or even Alone in the Dark. I rank Belly as the second worst film I have ever seen the worst goes to the atrocious Carnivore.There is no substance to Belly it tries to be all style. The opening sequence isn't ALL that bad but it isn't good either. My entertainment level went from mediocre to negative zero after the first robbery. It never recovered and I'm kind of ashamed to admit I've seen this trash. Belly gives Showgirls and The Matrix Revolutions a run for their money for the worst sex seen in cinema history. It's over before it begins and you can't make out what is even going on.With a horrible script and director that has no credit to his name you'd think the movie would be bad...but this goes beyond that. It's as if when the director had nowhere else to go with the movie he would throw in random shootout scene simply to add more minutes to the already too long running time which isn't even that long but it sure as hell seems like it. Nobody in the cast makes an effort to entertain us or even try to be remotely believable. Here's a suggestion for Williams and his future film making if there is any future film making. Get real actors not your friends. Also try filming a movie with a decent script that is easy to follow. Belly goes all over the place with random events. More then once I was sitting there wondering who this person was and why they are on the screen.So if you happen to see this sitting on the shelf at your local video store do yourself a favour and rip out your eyeballs for even looking at the box cover. The only thing that this is good for is taking a bat to it or flushing it down the toilet maybe even leaving at a friends house in hopes it will never come back. I was haunted in my dreams the week after watching Belly and every now and again I get a headache when someone mentions the film. I'm taking Tylonol Extra Strength right now finishing this review up. Let's just hope the so called sequel never sees the light of day.".

Film and Art is very subjective and is not like math where if you are right you can be proved right but in Art there is no such proof. Also there is something I think that many would not agree with me is that when White people see a movie that is not made by a White Person they have subconscious prejudices that are transferred to the film and in some cases may rate a film poorly just because they feel a Black Person can NOT make a movie better than a White Person.

DMX is not a bad actor and Taral Hicks gives a truly inspired performance as his devoted noBS girlfriend. TBoz and NAS could really use some schooling and seem horribly out of place.The whole movie is nothing more than an urban ripoff of the superior but nonetheless highly overrated Scarface.  Firsttime film director Hype Williams makes some poor cinematographic choices that though they may work in videos do not pay off in a featurelength project. The colors are murky and dark and many of these scenes seem just plain empty no aesthetic value to them at all.The plot of the movie involves Nas and DMX struggling with living a good decent life that may lead them nowhere or taking the more dangerous road of drug dealing guns and money.  Hmmm...which would you take?  Apparently they haven't seen the 5 million other movies that have dealt with the same subject matter.  If they had they would have known that drugs guns and fast women are just so gosh darned evil.  They would have also known that in the end they would see the light from a goodhearted preacher man who would show them the evil of their ways.  Duh!Oh yeah and the druglord with the heavy island accent is completely unintelligible.  What's his point in this movie?  Oops I forgot  it's to add at least one plot point to the otherwise pointless drudgery that is Belly.  My guess is the writers got their storyline AND dialogue from the back of an inner city antidrug pamphlet.  Give me a break!If you want to see a real gangster movie see Goodfellas instead. It's a lot more original in its storytelling and the characters are far more believable and entertaining.  If urban dramas are what you're looking for rent the excellent Boyz N the Hood.  It's a lot more inspiring and is filled with rich imagery and great storytelling and direction.".

My main problem with this movie is that it's like Hype's current music videos it glorifies crime and the drug game. It's quite obvious that Hype needs go to Director Boot Camp and improve his skills. The acting is on the level of a Soft porn flick with only DMX giving a decent performance. But don't get me wrong he's definitely no 2 PAC rapping or acting.

It's a whole lot of style and not enough substance but that's the problem with most of director Hype Williams' music videos so I decided to finally catch Belly to find out if the guy was actually any good at telling a story or not.  Most of his music videos look the same you see with absolutely no content whatsoever.  Then I saw the way he took the time to tell an actual story with his images in No Doubt's ExGirlfriend and I realized the man actually had talent and not just a fisheye lens.I don't think much of Williams as a writer.  But I will compare this film favorably to another movie that's not very good Nomads written and directed in 1986 by John McTiernan.  There's another filmmaker who can't write but made incredible beautifully directed films from the popcorn Predator to the dramatic The Hunt for Red October to both at the same time Die Hard.The acid test of any music video director is can they direct actors?  Is their visual flair all they've got Kevin Bray Jake Scott or do they bring actual theatrical talent to the table F. Gary Gray Spike Jonze? Belly is inconclusive as the editing and camera covers up everyone's performance so that both the bad and good actors appear to give equal performances.  The intrusive blah blah blah voiceover which reminded me of a Terrence Malick film didn't help either.Hopefully Williams will take another crack at it and leave the writing to the professionals.  This one lacked character subtlety or any emotion other than anger and hate except for the final 2 minutes and by then I didn't care anymore.  These are all writing problems but then the scenes that he didn't leave out for no reason are actually quite fascinating in a morbid sort of way.Of course ten years later McTiernan's career suffers and no matter what anyone tells you so does Spike Lee's.  Whatever Hype's spent the last 4 years doing I hope he gets a good script soon.  The potential is staggering.But this film isn't.  610.  nice sets".

You probably wanted the movie to be good so badly that you convinced yourselves that the actors were doing anything more than just reading their lines. I would give the plot 4 out of 10. Not only is the basis of the plot unoriginal but it also reinforces the incorrect idea that us blacks will sell drugs and commit crimes until the Nation of Islam comes along to rescue us from ourselves.Even sadder is the fact that the real actors in this film could not shine because they had such poor costars. I've been reading through the crap that you folks are trying to support the film with but this was a selfserving film for the main starts and directors more concerned with making a hiphop movie by the way hiphop is NOT a legitimate film genre full of big names in music than creating a solid motion picture. It fulfilled a superstar prerequisite by giving everyone involved at least one film credit and sadly convinced DMX that he should keep acting. So you've got a cast that's short on acting abilities a director that could care less and a target demographic that will try to convince themselves that their heroes were great in the film just because they like their music. This was a win for the filmmakers because their money would be made by music fans not film fans and you have proved my point with your overly positive reviews. Rather than see the film for what it is you are digging deep trying to find a way for this debacle to somehow serve a purpose. Give it a rest.

	schema:headline " Misunderstood overlooked hard to watch but compelling";
	schema:reviewBody "I say this film was and still is largely misunderstood mainly because it has a number of layers that seem to struggle with each other at times especially on the first viewing. Often taken as nothing more than a stylized urban actionthriller it seemingly contains elements of film noir running in the background that are often overlooked in reviews of this film. Furthermore the film has very bleak undertones throughout that are juxtaposed by the stunningly vibrant visuals which may distract many first time viewers.On the surface the film tells a familiar tale of two friends Tommy DMX and Sincere Nas who are engaged in cycles of violence that we see early on in the film turn from violent robberies to a foray into drug dealing. However this film does not follow traditional rules of the narrative. It is almost as if we are stepping into a story that has begun. The characters are barely introduced there are no humble beginnings to offset their climb in the drug scene their motivations are not made explicitly clear there is no clear antagonist. While some may see the absence of such film traditions as a fault from the director I feel that this may have been intentional to challenge the viewer and to help deliver the films message and I personally found it refreshing.As the characters are not initially distinguished through their introduction in order to understand the characters it is important to make note of their environment and of the dialog between the characters. This is key to understanding the film. For instance in the beginning of the film we see the homes of both Tommy and Sincere. Tommy's home is visually very dark and cold almost feeling isolating and heartless meanwhile Sincere's home is much warmer and vibrant and he is greeted by his wife and child. From these environments we can also garner Tommy's motivation for materialism and Sincere's desires for security. The environment is an important aspect of the film.Aside from the reoccurring graphic violence the film is very slow moving and the characters slowly become more clear as the film progresses. It seems as though the characters are often propelled by their circumstances as opposed to leading the story. Again I feel this was intentional to the film. The first two acts it seems as though the story is unfolding and the characters are powerless players within the story only able to assert their power in acts of violence. It is the third act where this begins to change which is really the strength of the film. As the characters become more self aware they are able to play greater part in determining their own futures.If you can make it through the first two acts which admittedly can be hard to sit through the third act is one of the greatest and most memorable I have seen in a film of any genre and really separates this film from other films of the gangster genre. While some claim the film promotes the Nation Of Islam as the only saviour for Black people I do not agree with this assessment. The character of The Minister does not express a specific religious belief and could be seen as much part Martin Luther King Jr as he is Louis Farrakhan. I believe the greater meaning presented is that we all have the power to create our own future once we begin to see ourselves as not merely products of our environment but as producers of that environment. The final 5 minutes of this film are perhaps the strongest critique of the violence and gangsterisms of modern urban culture I have seen in a mainstream film.I also found the character of Tommy to be one of my favorite film characters. On the surface he is strong violent controlling and aggressive. However from the moment he pleads to Sincere for help in escaping capture we begin to see beneath his shell. For the latter part of the film we see that beneath his exterior he is scared isolated and alone.Admittedly this film is not for everybody and I can understand why some do not like it. It moves slow does not follow cinematic conventions has a number of seemingly unrelated stories being told has a rather overpowering visual presentation and contains a number of very violent and sometimes uncomfortable scenes to watch. However the conclusion ties everything together. It becomes clear that everything in the film was there for a reason. Also this film does seemingly resonate strongly with a cult following amongst its target audience so I believe this film has much worth.This film is not character driven and also not really story driven it is something different all together. The story of two friends engaging in the drug trade is not the primary purpose of this film. It is not about the ups and downs of dealing drugs. This film is a critique of the way that we interact with our environments both as products and producers.While it may at times be difficult to follow if you approach this film with an open mind and can last until the closing scene you may find something really special.".

Nas DMX Method Man and others all prove to be great convincing characters in their roles as big time new york gangsters whose run of good luck in crime is about to run out. This has got to be one of my favorite gangster films of all time. It boggles me that this film got such a low score apparently by people who don't appreciate cinematic art when they see it. It amazed me when I saw that Nas who is my favorite rapper of all time actually got a big part in developing this film to mainstream society Nas is misunderstood and criticized by all media and the industry much like this exceptional film. But to those who know real music and real movies they recognize that Nas is the best rapper out there and Belly is one of the best gangster movies out there. What I most love about this movie is the nostalgic sense of the late 1990's that it brings out a time where everything was changing. From the cars MercedesBenz CLK 500 and the Lexus GS300 to the visual hip hop movie style that makes this film encompassing and exceptional as well as nostalgic. Nas is an excellent narrator as well as en excellent actor and an exceptional writer and artist. The scene from One Love has got to be one of my favorite scenes of all time. The scenes in Jamacia are 100 real and the dangers and the high life of crime are depicted sincerely in this movie. This movie sends out so many good messages about society that I cant list them all the soundtrack is excellent the cinematography is excellent the acting is excellent and the plot is excellent. So many memorable scenes to list. Overall one of the realest movies of all time and one of the best if not the best gangster film ever. I still never get tired of watching this movie especially with a blunt to pull on.Supra Rating 9.510".

	schema:headline " Brilliant sequel to Universal's classic!";
	schema:reviewBody "Producer Carl Laemmle Jr changed history of horror cinema when he hired director Tod Browning to make the first official adaptation to Bram Stoker's classic novel Dracula. This was the beginning of Universal Studios' tradition of Gothic horror that reigned triumphant through the 30s and early 40s. Robert Siodmak's Son of Dracula an alternative sequel it doesn't make any reference to the earlier Dracula's Daughter to Browning's classic is probably the last classic in the long line of films Universal produced about the monsters they gave life in the 30s.Son of Dracula takes place decades after the first film when the Dracula's story is now considered a mere myth. The story begins with the arrival of Count Alucard Lon Chaney Jr. to America as the mysterious Carpathian noble has been invited to the country by Katherine 'Kay' Caldwell Louise Allbritton a young rich woman with a morbid interest for the supernatural. Soon Kay finds herself in love with the strange Count something that worries her boyfriend Frank Robert Paige and family's friend Prof. Brewster Frank Craven as they suspect that there's something wrong with the strange foreigner.Director of many BMovies before this job Robert Siodmak would become Universal's most important exponent of the noir style and Son of Dracula definitely forecasts his brilliant future in the genre. The film shows his great talent to combine haunting and atmospheric visuals with a great screenplay by his brother Curt Siodmak and it moves away from the series' roots in German Expressionism to what would be called Film Noir creating what seems to be the missing link between Universal's horror films and their subsequent Noir movies.While Robert Siodmak's talent is almost unquestionable the films owes a lot of its success to Curt Siodmak's cleverly written script. Just like in his previous The Wolf Man the story is charged with a dark pessimistic feeling of dread that gives the film a unique feeling contrary to most Universal horrors there's almost no comedy that rather than making the film dull or boring it enhances its captivating charm. With clever plot twists and a good dose of suspense Siodmak's plot also feels like horror themed hardboiled fiction.Many has been written about Siodmak's choice of Lon Chaney Jr. to play the Count's descendant but while there's no doubt that he was not the best choice for the role he wasn't really too bad in it. Sure Chaney's appearance suits better the bulkier monsters but he gets the job done and his sad face suits the dark theme of deception the movie has. Robert Paige as the film's hero for lack of a better word is very effective and his usual costar Louise Allbritton makes a great femme fatal. Frank Craven and J. Edward Bromberg are brilliant as the vampire hunters and it could be said that despite the miscast of Chaney the whole cast makes a great job.Son of Dracula is a topnotch film considering it was conceived as a Bmovie. Robert Siodmak makes great use of his resources and the film rivals the first film in quality and overall composition. One of the better sequels of the Universal Studios' films it's main flaw may be that those expecting a typical Universal horror may be disappointed by its dark Noir theme and its pessimistic tone.Often forgotten among the many other films in the series not unusual considering that the first two Frankenstein sequels were masterpieces Son of Dracula is a worthy sequel to Browning's classic and definitely superior to the previous Dracula's Daughter. A must see for fans of Robert Siodmak who will find the roots of his style deep in this film. 810".

Robert Paige as the film's hero for lack of a better word is very effective and his usual costar Louise Allbritton makes a great femme fatal. Frank Craven and J. Edward Bromberg are brilliant as the vampire hunters and it could be said that despite the miscast of Chaney the whole cast makes a great job.Son of Dracula is a topnotch film considering it was conceived as a Bmovie. Robert Siodmak makes great use of his resources and the film rivals the first film in quality and overall composition. One of the better sequels of the Universal Studios' films it's main flaw may be that those expecting a typical Universal horror may be disappointed by its dark Noir theme and its pessimistic tone.Often forgotten among the many other films in the series not unusual considering that the first two Frankenstein sequels were masterpieces Son of Dracula is a worthy sequel to Browning's classic and definitely superior to the previous Dracula's Daughter. A must see for fans of Robert Siodmak who will find the roots of his style deep in this film. 810";

	schema:reviewBody "I thought Son of Dracula was the pits when I was a kid. I simply found it slow and tedious and lacking in the kind of mesmeric atmosphere that makes the best vampire entertainment really tick. But reviewing the film recently I found myself enjoying it thoroughly. Go figure...It's still no masterpiece of course. Shoehorning Count AlucardDracula into a Louisiana swampandplantation setting has always struck me as a weird and arbitrary move. Though Dracula does get some interesting dialog about how he's attracted to America because it's a youthful and vigorous land. And the human protagonists are too drippy for my tastes. The supposed hero is Frank Stanley but his character is too thinly developed to be truly sympathetic. In fact in an early scene he expresses a sort of jerky glee when the local voodoo woman drops dead of a heart attack so I suppose you could say he's aggressively unsympathetic! As usual the vampires stand head and shoulders above the boring humans. Some people are critical of Chaney's performance but I think he's pretty good. He's definitely a different sort of vampire from Lugosi  he's less ethereal and more aggressively powerful. You could say he foreshadows Christopher Lee's forceful portrayal of Dracula in the 1950s70s films from England's Hammer Studios. Louise Allbritton is even more effective in her role as the female vampire and in an interesting twist she's allowed to have a set of motivations and ambitions that are totally different from Dracula's. In fact in many ways she's the main character.In the end then I think this movie stacks up pretty well to other films in the Universal series. It's not as eerie as Dracula or Dracula's Daughter probably because it's a more modern and technologically advanced film. The primitiveness of the early entries in the series actually makes them scarier! But it's certainly easier to watch than its predecessors thanks to its more glossy look full music score and occasional nifty special effects. You gotta love that mist stuff...On a side note I do think that Cheney is playing Dracula's son and not the original Dracula himself. I'm surprised to see so much controversy about that point on this site. The film is called Son of Dracula after all and J. Edward Bromberg identifies Alucard as a descendant of Dracula. Sure Alucard admits to being a Dracula at one point but not necessarily THE Dracula. As father and son they would have the same surname  right? Oh never mind this is giving me a headache! One more odd matter of continuity. Bromberg's character says at one point that Dracula was destroyed in the 19th century. But since the Universal films had a contemporary setting wasn't he destroyed in the 20th century in this particular universe? Just thought I'd mention that.".

Its star Lon Chaney Jr. famous for his previous role in the horror cycle as Lawrence Talbot in THE WOLF MAN Universal 1941 which would be followed by some more sequels throughout the 1940s might have seemed an unlikely choice in playing the blood sucking vampire but on the contrary Junior Chaney brings new life into the old vampire sporting the usual black cape and an added touch of a mustache. Overlooking the hypnotic glassy eye stare created at best by Bela Lugosi in Dracula Universal 1931 he very well has proved himself as the fine horror film actor for the time being anyway.Unlike the previous Dracula outings Dracula and Dracula'S DAUGHTER which had taken place either in Transylvania or England SON OF Dracula is set on American soil and stays there. It begins somewhere in the South where Frank Stanley Robert Paige and the family physician friend Doctor Harry Brewster Frank Craven are at a train station awaiting for the arrival of an honored guest to Katherine Caldwell Louise Allbritton Count Alucard whom she had met previously while visiting in Budapest and is to be driven over to the Caldwell estate but all they find are his crates and boxes some of which consists of his native soil. That very night after a gathering in her home Katherine's father George Irving mysteriously dies with Dr. Brewster examining the body and finding two marks found on the late colonel's neck. Having noticed earlier on one of the crates that the name of Alucard spelled backwards is Dracula Brewster decides to telephone Professor Lazio J. Edward Bromberg the wellknown authority of the Count Dracula legend who after learning telling him all the details warns Brewster that Katherine is in great danger and intends on leaving Memphis to pay Brewster a visit to see what can be done. But it's too late. Katherine who has a morbid fascination with death and eternal life has already abandoned her fianc Frank whom has loved her since childhood to marry Count Alucard. They ghoulish couple obtain a honeymoon cottage in an old house at Dark Oaks. Frank follows them there to get Katherine back and threatens Alucard to leave town. Ignoring his threats this leaves Frank to take out his revolver and shoot Alucard but in turn he has killed Katherine who was standing behind her husband. Finding that the bullets have gone through Alucard and into Katherine Frank rushes out of the house to tell Dr. Brewster what has happened. Brewster comes to the cottage to find Alucard and much to his surprise sees Katherine very much alive. When Frank arrives with the authorities they find Katherine dead in her coffin. After the arrival of Professor Lazio more dark secrets are eventually revealed.Reportedly dismissed as just another horror film upon its release SON OF Dracula does have its share of bonuses that would have made the 1931 Dracula a visual experience had such advanced technology in special effects been available along with some real clever touches including the visiting count using an alias by spelling his name backwards a very creepy musical score compliments of Hans J. Salter dark atmospheric background and fine effects ranging from a cloud of vapor forming into the presence of Dracula to his transformation from bat to human figure etc. Aside from Lon Chaney's carnation of Dracula Louise Allbritton stands out a close second with her creepy appearance ranging from her unusual dark and gloomy hairstyle to icy facial expressions. Even before she becomes the wife of the mysterious Count her Katherine is already obsessed by the supernatural. Her sister Claire played by Evelyn Ankers is the logical half of the Caldwell sisters and although she doesn't get to belt out a scream or two as she did in the aforementioned films her presence adds to the story as does J. Edward Bromberg's Professor Lazio the authority of the Dracula legend. Bromberg's role could have very well been Professor Van Helsing as previously played in the first two Dracula films of the 1930s but instead his role was inspired by him. Robert Paige another Universal contract player does well with his Frank Stanley performance rising above the usual mediocre love interesttypes of the day. The supporting cast includes Samuel S. Hinds Judge Simmons Etta McDaniel Sarah Patrick Moriarty The Sheriff and Adeline De Walt Reynolds as Queen Zimba the fortune telling gypsy who after warning Katherine of her destiny and danger in marrying a corpse she is met with a destiny of her own when encountered by a vampire bat that puts an end of her fortune telling forever. Reynold's brief bit as the fortune telling old hag is reminiscent to the kind of role Lucille LaVerne of silent and early talkies that made her famous. Regardless of the misleading title Count Alucard is never mentioned as Dracula's son but as Count Dracula himself. SON OF Dracula at 78 minutes is the last really good and near original Dracula film of the 1940s. Before Bela Lugosi would do one more encore as Dracula in 1948's ABBOTT AND COSTELLO MEET FRANKENSTEIN the Dracula character would be revived again in two quickie installments HOUSE OF FRANKENSTEIN in 1944 HOUSE OF Dracula in 1945 with John Carradine taking over as the Count but only minor secondary performances. SON OF Dracula which played on the cable television's SciFi Channel American Movie Classics and Turner Classic Movies TCM premiere October 1 2017 as well as availability on both video cassette and DVD is recommended viewing for a dark and gloomy Halloween night or any night for that matter particularly for classic horror movie fans.

A finale of marked and deeply felt tragedy as a darkly romantic musical score swells the camera treks in on Mr. Paige's blank despairing gaze his empty eyes lit by the shadows of the flames.Son of Dracula is a deeply romantic dark dream of a film. Recommended.".

To abet these characterizations and to conceal what seems to be a somewhat paltry budgetary outlay by Universal director Sidiomak fills the screen with interesting visualsMiss Allbritton's unforgettable trek through the nocturnal bayou to visit the gypsy the gypsy's ensuing death in a bat attack Chaney gliding across the misty swamp and unsettling shadowy closeups of an unhinged Mr. Paige speaking through the bars of a prison.Photographer Robinson is with him all the way and composes and lights his shots to consistently interesting effect note the superb introduction to Dark Oaks with the camera panning through a creaking gate at night whilst the whole frame is overlaid with the violent twist of brambles and vines by foregrounding his shots with interesting objects on right or leftthereby lending depth and texture to his visual tableaux.The ending with Mr. Paige finding his former love Miss Allbritton literally buried within the childhood detritus of her own attic to which after placing his ring on her finger he sets afire provides a fitting finale. A finale of marked and deeply felt tragedy as a darkly romantic musical score swells the camera treks in on Mr. Paige's blank despairing gaze his empty eyes lit by the shadows of the flames.Son of Dracula is a deeply romantic dark dream of a film.

Carl Laemle oversaw Universal in the early 30s when they created some of cinema's most iconic creatures Dracula FRANKENSTEIN and THE MUMMY along with a few sequels BRIDE OF FRANK Dracula'S DAUGHTER. By the later 30s he had been ousted and the studio he created taken over. This new leadership began to revamp their monster movies in a way that we would now call reboots by taking the same monsters and putting them in entirely new story lines and settings with new characters. This essentially starts with the success of SON OF FRANKENSTEIN which led to THE MUMMY's HAND. After creating a new monster icon in THE WOLF MAN Uni finally set its' sights on their original monster success the one and only Dracula who gets his own reboot in SON OF Dracula.They cast Lon Chaney Jr in the title role the only man to have played all 4 of the classic Universal monsters and brought him to the US much as they did with the Mummy series in a story that sees Dracula begin an unholy matrimony with a morbid young woman who will ultimately prove to be his undoing.As a lover of Universal monsters I enjoy all of them and their sequels for the Saturday night fun they provide and the memories of how I responded to these movies as a kid. As a current viewer I can see that this movie is really a mess. After the success of the original Dracula Uni never seemed to know what to do with the character which becomes even more evident with the Carradine portrayals in the monster mashes. Unlike the much better plotted Mummy and Frankenstein series there is no real continuity at all in the Dracula story. Moving the story to the states takes away a sense of the sinister mystery that made the original movie work so well. I can understand that they were going for the same foggy exotic atmosphere in a cheaper budget setting but the vampire just feels so out of place here.Lon Chaney is one of my favorites from this era but just doesn't do a suitable job as the Prince of Vampires. There is none of the suave romanticism or any sense of pure evil. He's essentially a guy in a cape who can transform into a bat now and then. I will give credit for the bat transformations which naturally seem a bit hokey now but must have been revolutionary at the time and still have a certain charm to them. The other actors are just as bad. None of the main characters are really likable in any way. Our heroine would be a goth girl in today's movies and comes off just as pretentiously obsessed with things in which she really doesn't seem to have any real knowledge. Her boyfriend comes off as a jerk on more than one occasion and is not someone I want to win in the end. The only characters who seem to resonate at all are the doctor and the professor our Van Helsing roles.I love the Universal monsters and would even count some of the 40s sequels as among my favorite classic movies but I put this towards the lower end of the output. Yes it's a fun movie for monster kids but not one of the studio's best efforts.".

But now the film is readily available and the truth is easy to see it's pretty good. Not brilliant but pretty good. Chaney's performance is actually one of his best for Universal certainly his most atypical. Chaney excelled at characters who were out of control and childlike but his Dracula is supremely in control and seething with menace. It is his iciest most restrained performance. Those who still berate Chaney for his lack of range should be forced to admit that he played Dracula far more effectively than Bela Lugosi could have played Lennie. Interestingly the rest of the cast is equally miscast doomed hero Robert Paige was normally a musical leading man while femme fatale Louise Albritton was usually a blonde comedienne. Both are quite effective in the horror genre. Frank Craven does well as the folksy doctor who is forced to take on the Van Helsing role though J. Edward Bromberg is the official Van Helsing surrogate. This is one of the most unusual Universal horror films in that it is more horror noir than melodramafitting given that it was directed by noir master Robert Siodmak. It also represents the only time Dracula or any relation thereof is seen outside of Europe. Son of Dracula contains one of the creepiest scenes in any Universal horror film the one involving Queen Zimba played by the delightfully ancient Adeline de Walt Reynolds and the most downbeat ending. All in all Son of Dracula is one of the most interesting Universal efforts from its second horror cycle and the fact that it has endured such a bad rap over the decades is totally unfair.".

Anyhow He travels under the alias Count Alucard Dracula spelled backwards to America to marry a woman who is secretly just trying to gain eternal life so that she can spread it to her real love interest who she was supposed to marry in the first place.This is a pretty original story. And it's the only one of the Universal classic Dracula films where we actually see the vampires turn into mist and the first one where we actually SEE Dracula turn into a bat. I like this film.There's an on going debate as to whether the Dracula in this film is supposed to be the same Dracula that Bela Lugosi played. I disagree. The reasons being because we saw Bela Lugosi's Dracula killed and burned in the previous two films. And the vampire expert in Son of Dracula Dr. Lazlo said that this one is probably a descendant of the original Dracula. Lastly I think the title says it all  although there are people who seem to think that this is just a common sequel title used back then and is not meant to be taken literally. But it was taken literally with Son of Frankenstein and this is a follow up to Dracula's DAUGHTER who really WAS his daughter so... But anyway on the back of the video case it says that Lon Chaney is playing the son of Dracula. So I don't think it can be more clearer that the Dracula we see in Son of Dracula IS the SON of Dracula like the title suggests.In the end this film is worth watching if you can take it in its historical context. Otherwise you won't enjoy this film because it's not up to today's standards of horror. But for the time period this film was a good horror film.8 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Even though I consider myself a classic horror fan and a fan of the classic Universal horror movies in particular I readily admit that Dracula 1931 is not among my favorites. In fact I prefer almost all of the Dracula sequels to the original. And I consider Son of Dracula the best of the bunch. Why? I'm prepared to write about three areas in Son of Dracula that work almost perfectly for me the atmosphere the mix of genresstyles and the cast.Atmosphere  Son of Dracula positively drips with atmosphere. The misty swamps the expertly lit interiors the luscious sets the eerie music and Robert Siodmak's direction all contribute to the richness and underlying sense of taboo and dread. One scene that perfectly demonstrates the film's atmosphere is the rise of Dracula from the swamps. The coffin rises from the swamp floor a vaporous mist comes forth eventually changing into Dracula's solid form he glides effortlessly across the swamp to meet his mortal love and future wife  man you could bath in the atmosphere.Mix of genresstyles  Throughout its history horror has often been combined with other genres or styles of movies. Most obvious are the great number of horrorcomedies or horrorscifi films you can find. Sometimes horror is mixed in more unusual ways. For example there are horrorWesterns and even horrorromance films. Son of Dracula is one of the very few movies that I would call a horrorfilm noir I know that film noir isn't necessarily a genre but humor me here. All the film noir trappings are here. To begin with Son of Dracula has that look generally associated with film noir. Just take a look at the use of shadows and you'll see what I mean. But a better example is Kay Caldwell as the femme fatal and Dracula of all people as her dupe. The way Kay uses Dracula to do what she wants would have made even Phyllis Dietrichson proud. Kay uses Dracula to kill her father so she can get the estate and then tricks him into marriage to gain immortality. Finished with Dracula he becomes disposable. She turns to old flame Frank Stanley to help her destroy Dracula. In the end all three  Kay Dracula and Frank  are either dead or damaged beyond repair. Take away the supernatural elements of the story and you've got a typical 1940s film noir.The cast  A lot of people tend to focus on Lon Chaney Jr. suitability for the role of Dracula. The criticism is almost always related to Chaney's physical appearance. I'm convinced that some of these people can't get past his size long enough to take a look at his performance. And I've always thought of it as a rock solid performance. Equally mysterious is Louise Allbritton in role of the manipulative Kay. She's fantastic as she winds both Dracula and Frank around her finger. As for Robert Paige as the doomed Frank he's perfect. He plays the tragic figure so well. Beyond these three the film also features solid supporting performances from Evelyn Ankers J. Edward Bromberg and Frank Craven. All are terrific. Everyone involved in the cast really comes out of Son of Dracula looking good.In the end I do not hesitate to rate Son of Dracula a 910. Other than some minor quibbles I have with how quickly Dr. Brewster comes to believe in and accept that Dracula is in their presence the film is near flawless to me. And it gets better with each successive viewing. Watching tonight I realized I was enjoying it even more now than ever before. It's a great movie!".

	schema:headline " Moody supernatural film is tragic love story of vampires and mortals";
	schema:reviewBody "This underrated film is often surprisingly effective in evoking a believable atmosphere of the supernatural. Count Dracula arrives in a small Southern town in the U.S. in the early Forties to marry a wealthy heiress. Their strange courtship and the jealousy of her former fianc set in motion the mysterious and startling events that follow.Lon Chaney Jr. is effective in the role of Dracula affecting a rigid slow moving style of body language and an underplayed manner of speaking seldom raising his voice and standing almost immobile most of the time. The moment when he effortlessly flings the jealous Frank Stanley across the room with a slight movement of his arm while standing impassively barely moving is extremely effective.The effects are well done with some good scenes of Dracula transforming from man to bat and back again. The backgrounds and interiors are excellent with the music contributing to the eerie tone of the story. The acting is good throughout with performances of unusual strength for a low budget horror picture of this period.Louise Allbritton is incredible in the role of the vampire bride. Like Dracula her soft voice and low key manner do not conceal a dangerous quality both alluring and frightening.The movie isn't quite as good as it could have been but is nowhere near as bad as some have described it over the years. It works well as a thoughtful atmospheric little horror picture with plenty of imagination and talent behind it. Well worth seeing for vampire movie fans and lovers of old Universal movies.".

	schema:reviewBody "One of the better latterday entries in Universal's famed horror series 'Son of Dracula' is a short fastpaced flick with some nifty special effects and a surprise ending. It also marks Lon Chaney Jr.'s sole appearance as the Count Chaney was the only actor to portray all four of Universal's major horror figures Frankenstein's Monster the Mummy Dracula and of course the Wolfman for which he was most famous. Some said he was miscast as the Transylvanian vampire he was too big and bulky or not debonair enough. Personally I think he does just fine particularly during the final scene when he finds his coffin ablaze and rails at Robert Paige's Frank Stanley yelling Put it out! Put it out! He exudes real menace and great strength his voice a roar of anger and pain. Speaking of Robert Paige he certainly earns his paycheck as the tormented Frank. The script puts him through the wringer both emotionally and physically. He is engaged to marry Kay Caldwell Louise Allbritton only to find out she has fallen under Dracula's spell even before the Count arrives on the scene. Frank goes from disbelieving suitor to infuriated killer to hounded victim to incarcerated suspect to willing vampire wannabe then back to normal. There are the requisite discussions about the undead and explanations of Dracula's mysterious powers and they become more mysterious every time they're explained. I've never been clear for example on how Kay becomes a vampire it appears to me that she's shot dead before Dracula ever bites her on the neck. Oh well. And then there is a befuddling conversation between Professor Brewster and Professor Laszlo the vampire expert as to why Kay fell under Dracula's spell in the first place. It's decided it was because she was 'morbid.' That's right operator she was morbid. Sounds good to me. The special effects include a fake bat that gets more screen time than it should but some of the cooler images include the first ever battoman transformation as well as a great scene in the swamp where Dracula's coffin rises to the water's surface then Dracula himself floats across to the other side where Kay is waiting. It's really well done for the time very atmospheric and eerie with appropriately spooky music. 'Son of Dracula' is very enjoyable and is a good example of why the Universal horror series is so fondly remembered. The actors writers and production crews had these characters and films down to a 't' and they rarely disappointed.".

The special effects were top notch for the time period and the sets were wonderfully moody and mysterious. The male costuming was good but the female costuming was excellent with flowing dresses.

He was actually a descendant of Dracula. Honestly what do think sounds better? Great Great Grandson of Dracula or Son of Dracula? This movie is very different. It takes place in America and not in Germany Transylvania London or Whales but it's very interesting. Instead of a constable or inspector you get a sheriff. No villagers carrying torches either.

A new plotline is introduced as we have a morbid woman played wonderfully by Louise Allbritton who wants to use the Count for her own scheme. It's original even by today's standards and a good horror movie.";

Plot finds the mysterious Count Alucard Chaney Jr. arriving in the Deep South of America at the invitation of Katherine Caldwell Allbritton. Seems that Katherine is pliant to a bit of occult like dalliances while the Count is after new soil and territory after having exhausted his use for Europe. Pretty soon the two are united in coupling which greatly annoys Katharine's boyfriend Frank Stanley Paige.

Lon Chaney Jr. is miscast as AlucardDracula very much so but he gives it a good go and really when viewing the film these days it barely matters. Also lets note right now the film's claim to fame for being the first to show the battoman transformation of a vampire John P. Fulton continuing to amaze with his special effects work. So what of the film as a whole then? With a 7 year gap between this and the poor Dracula's Daughter to help erase the memory Son Of Dracula pretty much starts afresh. As a film from the studio of shriek it's standard 1940s stuff tho this does throw in some twists and new touches to the legend as we previously knew it. The effects team deal in some nice mist moments to keep the atmosphere suitably eerie and with the gorgeous Allbritton's portrayal of Kay Caldwell Universal Monster Movies slips into film noir territory. This is after all directed by Robert Siodmak who a year later would embark on a run of film noir movies that would contain genre classics like The Killers  Criss Cross. Yes some of it's bonkers I mean Dracula getting married and hoodwinked in one movie? And there still remains the odd moment of unintentional hilarity but if you can get past the Chaney miscast factor? Then Son Of Dracula is a bunch of creepy fun.Hell for the coffin in the bogmistrise and glide sequence this deserves a pat on the back. 710".

	schema:headline " Well... at least it LOOKS good.";
	schema:reviewBody "Probably the best thing that I can say about this film is that it was near as I can recall the thing that first got me interested in Zeppelin history when I was about 9 years old.  That's been over a quarter of a century now and the old armchair Zep historian trip is still a favorite hobby of mine.It would be really easy for me to go into Ubergeek mode and nitpick every little thing about this flick I'll try my best to spare you folks that and save it for when I've knocked back a few with a couple of my Zep buddies but when it comes right down to it this movie could be a lot worse.I mean yes it has a lot of flaws not the least of which is its reliance on a fictionalized version of a sabotage theory which itself is perhaps one of the most elaborate ethicallysuspect works of fiction presently connected with Zeppelin history.  The story goes that a young crew member named Erich Spehl renamed Karl Boerth in the movie apparently for legal reasons fell in with the antiNazi resistance via a mysterious older woman he was dating at the time of the disaster and the two of them cooked up a plan whereby he would sabotage the ship at its mooring mast at Lakehurst in full view of the American press so as to get international publicity for the resistance movement.  The Hindenburg was late in landing the timer on the bomb malfunctioned neither of the two authors who originally flogged this theory in their books ever really worked out that little detail of how the bomb went off as the ship landed and the ship burned killing Spehl in the process.As I said this theory is definitely hogwash and I've come to suspect that those who originally concocted it and passed it off as historical fact probably knew it was hogwash too.  But this is the sort of plot that sells books and puts asses in theatre seats so this is what Wise and his screenwriters decided to go with. They didn't invent the theory they merely optioned a book The Hindenburg by Michael Mooney which was a retelling of the original Spehl theory which appeared in A. A. Hoehling's Who Destroyed The Hindenburg?Purely as a 1970s disaster film this one isn't bad.  It's got all the bases covered lavish sets and costumes bigname stars portraying a cast of characters from various walks of life complete with various interconnecting personal dramas designed to heighten the pathos of I wonder who gets it in the end? for the audience and a specialeffects laden disastrous climax.As far as the execution of the whole thing goes it's definitely a mixed bag.  The script could have used a good bit of work before they shot it but then that also seems to be par for the course with most 1970s disaster flicks.  A lot of the dialogue is fairly stilted and some of the lines are just terrible.  Perhaps the one that bugs me the most is when Ritter the Luftwaffe colonel in charge of security finally gets Boerth the saboteur to tell him where the bomb is Boerth replies with the meaningless phrase Repair Patch 4 and Ritter who apparently had never set foot on a Zeppelin before the beginning of the flight conveniently runs straight to where the bomb is hidden... under a tiny inflight repair patch on the side of Gas Cell 4 which itself was 1015 stories tall.  That the big Aha! moment when Ritter finally learns where the bomb is hidden is garbled by lazy sloppy writing like this always makes me cringe when I watch this movie and unfortunately that's fairly indicative of the level of screenwriting throughout the film.Various characters are renamed versions of actual passengers and crew from the last flight some are amalgams of a couple different actual people some even retain the same names as the people on whom they're based... and others are simply invented for the sake of the movie.   Colonel Franz Ritter George C. Scott is based upon a Luftwaffe colonel named Fritz Erdmann who was aboard the last flight to observe longrange navigational practices used by the Hindenburg's crew and who was erroneously presented in at least one historical Hindenburg book as having been assigned to the flight to watch for saboteurs crewman Karl Boerth William Atherton of course is based on the sabotage theory version of crewman Erich Spehl  the Countess Anne Bancroft seems to be very loosely based on a passenger by the name of Margaret Mather Gestapo snitch Martin Vogel Roy Thinnes was basically invented as an obstacle for Ritter to have to deal with the Breslau family was based on the reallife Doehner family crewman Ludecke Peter Canon seems to be something of a loose amalgam of a couple of reallife Naziconnected crew members who flew on the Hindenburg but basically he was invented as a flunkie for Vogel.And on and on and on.A few things about the film do work for me.  First I think that George C. Scott was one of those actors who could lend even the worst film a bit of dramatic weight and in this movie he actually takes what was written as a fairly onedimensional character and breathes some real life into it.  As a Luftwaffe pilot who is ill at ease with the increasing excesses of the Nazi regime Scott creates a rather human sympathetic character.  His scenes with Anne Bancroft are some of the few which actually seem to work in this movie.I also quite like David Shire's music score.  Most of the musical pieces in the film are variations on the Main Title Theme though there are a few distinct separate themes notably the romantic piece played during the scenes between Ritter and the Countess the piece played while the crewmen repair the ripped fabric on the fin and what I always think of as the Gestapo theme which seems to be used when the film cuts back to Germany for scenes such as the one where Boerth's girlfriend is arrested in Frankfurt.  And then there's the odd little vaudeville tune performed by Reed Channing and Joe Spah at the concert Channing holds for the passengers and crew.  It's certainly consistent with what an American might have thought of and known about the Nazis in 1937 concentration camps for example were already in use for political dissidents and intellectuals by '37 but it still feels kind of like the producers just said We want a show tune in here... write us something!  By and large though the music in this film is quite good.  I only wish it were available on CD.Finally and most importantly the set design in this film particularly the fullsize recreation of various parts of the interior of the Hindenburg is absolutely amazing.  If you want to see what it looked like to walk around inside the Hindenburg watch this movie.  There are a few minor inconsistencies with the actual design of the ship a pair of ladders which led down into the lower fin of the actual ship was changed in the film into a long set of stairs running up inside the leading edge of the fin I assume for dramatic purposes but for the most part Wise's set designers used the original designs of the ship and recreated them right down to the rivets in some places.  The only thing that they apparently got wrong unintentionally is the dark bluegreen color of the girders in the interior of the ship. They seem to have gotten this from pieces of girder salvaged from the actual Hindenburg wreck and what they recreated was the scorched color of the original bright turquoise blue lacquer which coated the girders of the actual ship. But most everything else is spoton.  I've stood in the control car recreation which has been restored and is now on proud display out at Lakehurst and from having seen photos of virtually every part of the real Hindenburg control car I can say that the set designers really nailed this again right down to the rivets on the elevator and rudder wheels.  The passenger decks are pretty much identical to the real ones the layout of the lower keel is frighteningly accurate... a modernday movie about the Hindenburg would have to essentially rebuild the same sets if they wanted to be accurate.  For this alone I like to throw my DVD of The Hindenburg in the player a couple times a year.Again not a great movie overall and the sabotage theory the screenwriters use is based on a load of dreck dreamed up under rather questionable circumstances a decade or so before the film was made and which implicates a young man who unfortunately died in the fire and was not around to defend himself nor did he have any close family to do it for him at the time the story first emerged. It may make for an interesting movie plot but it didn't happen that way at all.  I also don't buy the exploding paint theory that's been run up the flagpole over the past several years as it simply requires too much cherrypicking of eyewitness testimony and photographic evidence to work... but that's a whole 'nother story.Not a terrible film overall due to the painstakingly accurate set design but not that great a film either.  I'm a bit biased obviously but I always find myself wishing that they'd spent even half as much energy on writing a good script for this thing as they spent recreating the interior of the ship.  It could have been something a lot more special than just another disaster flick if they'd put the effort into the story. But as 1970s disaster movies go this is probably one of the best. It's certainly worth a watch.".

	onyx:emotionText "Probably the best thing that I can say about this film is that it was near as I can recall the thing that first got me interested in Zeppelin history when I was about 9 years old.  That's been over a quarter of a century now and the old armchair Zep historian trip is still a favorite hobby of mine.It would be really easy for me to go into Ubergeek mode and nitpick every little thing about this flick I'll try my best to spare you folks that and save it for when I've knocked back a few with a couple of my Zep buddies but when it comes right down to it this movie could be a lot worse.I mean yes it has a lot of flaws not the least of which is its reliance on a fictionalized version of a sabotage theory which itself is perhaps one of the most elaborate ethicallysuspect works of fiction presently connected with Zeppelin history.  The story goes that a young crew member named Erich Spehl renamed Karl Boerth in the movie apparently for legal reasons fell in with the antiNazi resistance via a mysterious older woman he was dating at the time of the disaster and the two of them cooked up a plan whereby he would sabotage the ship at its mooring mast at Lakehurst in full view of the American press so as to get international publicity for the resistance movement.  The Hindenburg was late in landing the timer on the bomb malfunctioned neither of the two authors who originally flogged this theory in their books ever really worked out that little detail of how the bomb went off as the ship landed and the ship burned killing Spehl in the process.As I said this theory is definitely hogwash and I've come to suspect that those who originally concocted it and passed it off as historical fact probably knew it was hogwash too.  But this is the sort of plot that sells books and puts asses in theatre seats so this is what Wise and his screenwriters decided to go with. They didn't invent the theory they merely optioned a book The Hindenburg by Michael Mooney which was a retelling of the original Spehl theory which appeared in A. A. Hoehling's Who Destroyed The Hindenburg?Purely as a 1970s disaster film this one isn't bad.  It's got all the bases covered lavish sets and costumes bigname stars portraying a cast of characters from various walks of life complete with various interconnecting personal dramas designed to heighten the pathos of I wonder who gets it in the end? for the audience and a specialeffects laden disastrous climax.As far as the execution of the whole thing goes it's definitely a mixed bag.  The script could have used a good bit of work before they shot it but then that also seems to be par for the course with most 1970s disaster flicks.  A lot of the dialogue is fairly stilted and some of the lines are just terrible.  Perhaps the one that bugs me the most is when Ritter the Luftwaffe colonel in charge of security finally gets Boerth the saboteur to tell him where the bomb is Boerth replies with the meaningless phrase Repair Patch 4 and Ritter who apparently had never set foot on a Zeppelin before the beginning of the flight conveniently runs straight to where the bomb is hidden... under a tiny inflight repair patch on the side of Gas Cell 4 which itself was 1015 stories tall.  That the big Aha! moment when Ritter finally learns where the bomb is hidden is garbled by lazy sloppy writing like this always makes me cringe when I watch this movie and unfortunately that's fairly indicative of the level of screenwriting throughout the film.Various characters are renamed versions of actual passengers and crew from the last flight some are amalgams of a couple different actual people some even retain the same names as the people on whom they're based... and others are simply invented for the sake of the movie.   Colonel Franz Ritter George C. Scott is based upon a Luftwaffe colonel named Fritz Erdmann who was aboard the last flight to observe longrange navigational practices used by the Hindenburg's crew and who was erroneously presented in at least one historical Hindenburg book as having been assigned to the flight to watch for saboteurs crewman Karl Boerth William Atherton of course is based on the sabotage theory version of crewman Erich Spehl  the Countess Anne Bancroft seems to be very loosely based on a passenger by the name of Margaret Mather Gestapo snitch Martin Vogel Roy Thinnes was basically invented as an obstacle for Ritter to have to deal with the Breslau family was based on the reallife Doehner family crewman Ludecke Peter Canon seems to be something of a loose amalgam of a couple of reallife Naziconnected crew members who flew on the Hindenburg but basically he was invented as a flunkie for Vogel.And on and on and on.A few things about the film do work for me.  First I think that George C. Scott was one of those actors who could lend even the worst film a bit of dramatic weight and in this movie he actually takes what was written as a fairly onedimensional character and breathes some real life into it.  As a Luftwaffe pilot who is ill at ease with the increasing excesses of the Nazi regime Scott creates a rather human sympathetic character.  His scenes with Anne Bancroft are some of the few which actually seem to work in this movie.I also quite like David Shire's music score.  Most of the musical pieces in the film are variations on the Main Title Theme though there are a few distinct separate themes notably the romantic piece played during the scenes between Ritter and the Countess the piece played while the crewmen repair the ripped fabric on the fin and what I always think of as the Gestapo theme which seems to be used when the film cuts back to Germany for scenes such as the one where Boerth's girlfriend is arrested in Frankfurt.  And then there's the odd little vaudeville tune performed by Reed Channing and Joe Spah at the concert Channing holds for the passengers and crew.  It's certainly consistent with what an American might have thought of and known about the Nazis in 1937 concentration camps for example were already in use for political dissidents and intellectuals by '37 but it still feels kind of like the producers just said We want a show tune in here... write us something!  By and large though the music in this film is quite good.  I only wish it were available on CD.Finally and most importantly the set design in this film particularly the fullsize recreation of various parts of the interior of the Hindenburg is absolutely amazing.

	schema:reviewBody "This film is a unique illustration of the Hindenberg disaster which occurred on the evening of May 6 1937 in Lakehurst New Jersey when the gigantic hydrogenfilled zeppelin exploded on landing. Although a common theory for this event's cause was a discharge of electricity from the atmosphere triggering the fire here it is suggested as form sabotage. As a result of the explosion 36 people one third of those onboard the German airship were killed.The movie goes along quite well in the way it is presented as a series of chronological events leading up to the explosion. The cast is flawless and in turn so is the superb and vivid acting. George C. Scott as Colonel Franz Ritter a German security officer and Anne Bancroft as the reluctant Countess seem to be very suited and prepared for their parts as the main characters in the film. Other passengers to watch for include Gig Young as the sly Edward Douglass Burgess Meredith as gambler Emilio Pajetta and Robert Clary from the hit sitcom Hogan's Heroes as Joseph Spahn a comedian. These and many others provide an enjoyable overall performance in the movie while not only based on historical accounts also provides other common genres of drama suspense comedy and even elements of romance between the two main characters.This film may have a general theme of seriousness as Colonel Ritter proceeds to investigate an array of people aboard who are suspects to an antiNazi conspiracy yet it also resolves to make way for other moods as well. For example midway through the film there is a very amusing sequence in which passenger Reed Channing Peter Donat plays on the airship's famous baby grand piano and sings a song entitled There's A Lot to be Said for the Fuhrer while Joe Spahn performs. This scene obviously demonstrates how both passengers are clearly against the Nazi party and here it is also interesting to note that during WWII actor Robert Clary actually was confined to the Nazi concentration camps as countless other unfortunates were subject to during the Holocaust. There are also several humorous oneliners spoken throughout the film such as Next time we'll take the Titanic! followed by other memorable quotes.As the film progresses complications arise in the piloting of the Hindenberg as the crew and passengers encounter a brief experience with turbulence and St. Elmo's fire a flickering bluish glow sometimes appearing during storms and repairing a rip in the fabric cover on the port side of the airship as it hovers over the frigid Atlantic Ocean. Events such as these and Colonel Ritter's continuing investigation prove to bring together desired elements of suspense which certainly add up nearing the movie's climax ending.Shortly before the Hindenberg's doomed landing Ritter finally discovers the suspected sabotage and the passenger behind it in a perplexing turn of events. In doing so he also finds that this wellplanned demolition is i n the form of a timedbomb that has been hidden in the airship's structure and that it is up to him to reach in time for deactivation. The last few thrilling seconds before the explosion in which Colonel Ritter slowly struggles to defuse the bomb have enough apprehension to make it seem an eternity as he meticulously works but to no avail. From the moment in which the bomb goes off there is enough action to keep you on the edge of your seat until the movie's end. The last few minutes which combine both color black and white images and still frames of the fire as innocent passengers attempt to escape the flames are exceedingly well filmed as well as both exciting and horrific. Through this vivid portrayal one may wonder just what it would have been like to witness this tragic disaster. To any viewer its plain to see just why The Hindenberg received a special achievements award for its sound and visual effects and nominations for best cinematography and film editing.With excellent writing credits provided by Nelson Gidding and under the careful direction of Robert Wise The Hindenberg proves to be a genuine and enjoyable movie to watch. This is a film that will undeniably age well still seeming as timeless as it was the first time through. One of my favorite movies of all time The Hindenberg can be highly recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "The 1970's were the age of the disaster films. Films featuring man made and natural calamaties with flashy special effects and big name stars were the in thing back then. Irwin Allen was the master of these when he made The Posiedon Adventure and The Towering Inferno. Jennings Lang also made an epic disaster film with Earthquake. In 1975 Robert Wise got into the act with The Hindenburg. Wise is one of our finest directors and I was so happy when he won the American Film Institute's Lifetime Achievement Award several years ago. Everyone loves a good mystery and the Hindenburg disaster is certainly one of them. What caused the explosion? We will probably never know. What we do know is that politics had a lot to do with it. The Hindenburg was filled with volatile hydrogen gas instead of helium. Helium is so safe it would actually smother fire. The American government did not wish to give the Germans helium because they feared they would use it for military purposes. This film has a first class cast with George C. Scott leading the way as the heroic Colonel Franz Ritter. Only a fine actor like Scott could have made a Nazi likeable. There are so many other fine thespians in the cast like Anne Bancroft and Charles Durning as the Captain. A very fine character actor named William Atherton is the rigger who plants the bomb. Wise is a master of suspense because we all know what is going to happen and the ship is going to blow up and yet you are on the edge of your seat as Ritter desperately races time to find the bomb. I would also like to mention how much I enjoyed Wise's masterful use of actual film footage of the disaster which he intermingles with scenes of the various actors trying to escape the burning ship. One of the fun things about these disaster films is watching who lived and who died at the end what is really funny is that those near the top of the cast usually lived the longest!. There was indeed a theory that a rigger on the airship named Eric Spehl they called him Karl Boerth in the movie had indeed sabotaged the Hindenburg. The surviving crew members said that they had heard a sudden pop over their heads and looked up to see a circle of bright light that looked like a flashbulb igniting. It was near the axial gangway and this rigger was one of only a few who had acess to it. Spehl was known to have anti Nazi views. Did he plant a bomb? The theory is that Spehl had timed his explosive device really a flashbulb attached to a photographic timer to go off after the airship had landed. But the landing was delayed by a storm and he could not get back in time to re set it. Spehl was killed in the disaster and thus we will never know. The most chilling part of this film is where they play Herb Morrisons recording. He was the WLS Chicago reporter who was there to witness a routine airship landing and instead it was one of the most famous recordings ever made. Morrison lived until 1988 and resided near my home in West Virginia.".

Wise is one of our finest directors and I was so happy when he won the American Film Institute's Lifetime Achievement Award several years ago. Everyone loves a good mystery and the Hindenburg disaster is certainly one of them. What caused the explosion? We will probably never know. What we do know is that politics had a lot to do with it. The Hindenburg was filled with volatile hydrogen gas instead of helium. Helium is so safe it would actually smother fire. The American government did not wish to give the Germans helium because they feared they would use it for military purposes. This film has a first class cast with George C. Scott leading the way as the heroic Colonel Franz Ritter. Only a fine actor like Scott could have made a Nazi likeable. There are so many other fine thespians in the cast like Anne Bancroft and Charles Durning as the Captain. A very fine character actor named William Atherton is the rigger who plants the bomb. Wise is a master of suspense because we all know what is going to happen and the ship is going to blow up and yet you are on the edge of your seat as Ritter desperately races time to find the bomb. I would also like to mention how much I enjoyed Wise's masterful use of actual film footage of the disaster which he intermingles with scenes of the various actors trying to escape the burning ship. One of the fun things about these disaster films is watching who lived and who died at the end what is really funny is that those near the top of the cast usually lived the longest!. There was indeed a theory that a rigger on the airship named Eric Spehl they called him Karl Boerth in the movie had indeed sabotaged the Hindenburg. The surviving crew members said that they had heard a sudden pop over their heads and looked up to see a circle of bright light that looked like a flashbulb igniting. It was near the axial gangway and this rigger was one of only a few who had acess to it. Spehl was known to have anti Nazi views. Did he plant a bomb? The theory is that Spehl had timed his explosive device really a flashbulb attached to a photographic timer to go off after the airship had landed. But the landing was delayed by a storm and he could not get back in time to re set it. Spehl was killed in the disaster and thus we will never know. The most chilling part of this film is where they play Herb Morrisons recording. He was the WLS Chicago reporter who was there to witness a routine airship landing and instead it was one of the most famous recordings ever made. Morrison lived until 1988 and resided near my home in West Virginia.";

The usual cast of colorful characters played by terrific actors George C.

Wise used the actual newsreel footage shot it freezeframe style and spliced it in with the characters as they try to escape death. The best part of the movie by far!The Hindenburg does drag in some spots but the viewer needs to pay close attention to what is going on who everyone is what issues they have why they are on the zepplin and how this adds to the story. Pay close attention to The Countess played by Anne Bancroft by far the best character in the movie.This happens to be my favorite disaster movie for a number of reasons. First off the sabotage plot unfolds nicely and I actually believe that the Hindenburg was downed as an act of sabotage. I have always believed this. Second I love the detail Wise's team did with the ship's interior sets you actually feel as if you are flying on the ship and the third the last sequence with the explosion occurs. Effects were pretty damn well done! If you want to see a true disaster come about revolving around a suspenseful story with great characters rent The Hindenburg".

	schema:headline " There's Not a Lot to Be Said for The Hindenburg";
	schema:reviewBody "Apart from the sinking of the Titanic the loss of the German airship Hindenburg at Lakehurst New Jersey in 1937 was perhaps the most famous disaster of the twentieth century so it is perhaps unsurprising that this film should have been made during the 1970s the Golden Age of the disaster movie. There is however a difference between The Hindenburg and the standard seventies disaster flick in that it is a period piece based on a reallife disaster most such films were set in the present day and told fictional stories.There is another difference between this film and films like The Towering Inferno The Poseidon Adventure or the various versions of the Titanic story. In those films the disaster happened over a longer period of time the Titanic for example took over two hours to sink after hitting the iceberg so when James Cameron filmed the story he was able to use the second half of the movie to show the disaster as it happened in virtually real time. The fire which destroyed the Hindenburg by contrast took only a few minutes to consume the airship and only takes up a small part of the film's running time. The filmmakers therefore needed to come up with something else to make a fulllength feature film out of the disaster.The true cause of the Hindenburg disaster remains unknown to this day but the film explores the theory that the airship was destroyed as a deliberate act of sabotage by forces opposed to the Nazi regime. The main character is Franz Ritter a Colonel in the Luftwaffe and the Hindenburg's security officer. Ritter discovers that there is a plot to destroy the airship and works desperately to thwart it. He himself however is becoming disillusioned with the Nazis whom he originally supported so has some sympathy with the antiNazi opposition. In reality no firm evidence for sabotage has ever been found but there is also no firm evidence which would definitely rule it out so this aspect of the film is not so much a distortion of history as an exploration of a possible if unproven theory. In some respects however the filmmakers do alter the facts to suit the story. For example in the film the airship's captain Max Pruss delays his landing because of adverse weather conditions a key plot point whereas in fact no such delay took place.The film's main drawback is that it just does not work as a thriller. We all know that the Hindenburg was indeed destroyed and we therefore realise that Ritter's efforts to prevent its destruction will prove vain. It therefore generates very little tension. Films about the Titanic disaster suffer from the same drawback but both Cameron and the makers of the earlier 1953 film about the sinking are able to overcome this problem by creating characters we can care about. The important question therefore becomes not will the ship sink? we know it will but rather can Jack and Rose or the Sturges family survive the sinking? The Hindenburg does not give us any characters we can identify with in this way. Most of them including the saboteur are fairly sketchily drawn. The only one to be fully developed is George C. Scott's Ritter and even he is not particularly sympathetic. A man who has taken four years to realise that Hitler might not actually be the great saviour of the nation he was hoping for makes an unlikely hero for a Hollywood blockbuster. The other major star in this production is Anne Bancroft as Countess Ursula von Reugen an old friend of Ritter but she does not have a lot to do.

	onyx:emotionText "Apart from the sinking of the Titanic the loss of the German airship Hindenburg at Lakehurst New Jersey in 1937 was perhaps the most famous disaster of the twentieth century so it is perhaps unsurprising that this film should have been made during the 1970s the Golden Age of the disaster movie. There is however a difference between The Hindenburg and the standard seventies disaster flick in that it is a period piece based on a reallife disaster most such films were set in the present day and told fictional stories.There is another difference between this film and films like The Towering Inferno The Poseidon Adventure or the various versions of the Titanic story. In those films the disaster happened over a longer period of time the Titanic for example took over two hours to sink after hitting the iceberg so when James Cameron filmed the story he was able to use the second half of the movie to show the disaster as it happened in virtually real time. The fire which destroyed the Hindenburg by contrast took only a few minutes to consume the airship and only takes up a small part of the film's running time. The filmmakers therefore needed to come up with something else to make a fulllength feature film out of the disaster.The true cause of the Hindenburg disaster remains unknown to this day but the film explores the theory that the airship was destroyed as a deliberate act of sabotage by forces opposed to the Nazi regime. The main character is Franz Ritter a Colonel in the Luftwaffe and the Hindenburg's security officer. Ritter discovers that there is a plot to destroy the airship and works desperately to thwart it. He himself however is becoming disillusioned with the Nazis whom he originally supported so has some sympathy with the antiNazi opposition. In reality no firm evidence for sabotage has ever been found but there is also no firm evidence which would definitely rule it out so this aspect of the film is not so much a distortion of history as an exploration of a possible if unproven theory. In some respects however the filmmakers do alter the facts to suit the story. For example in the film the airship's captain Max Pruss delays his landing because of adverse weather conditions a key plot point whereas in fact no such delay took place.The film's main drawback is that it just does not work as a thriller. We all know that the Hindenburg was indeed destroyed and we therefore realise that Ritter's efforts to prevent its destruction will prove vain. It therefore generates very little tension. Films about the Titanic disaster suffer from the same drawback but both Cameron and the makers of the earlier 1953 film about the sinking are able to overcome this problem by creating characters we can care about. The important question therefore becomes not will the ship sink? we know it will but rather can Jack and Rose or the Sturges family survive the sinking? The Hindenburg does not give us any characters we can identify with in this way. Most of them including the saboteur are fairly sketchily drawn. The only one to be fully developed is George C. Scott's Ritter and even he is not particularly sympathetic. A man who has taken four years to realise that Hitler might not actually be the great saviour of the nation he was hoping for makes an unlikely hero for a Hollywood blockbuster. The other major star in this production is Anne Bancroft as Countess Ursula von Reugen an old friend of Ritter but she does not have a lot to do. Although both Scott and Bancroft were big stars in their day and had leading roles in many films both today are largely remembered for one single role General Patton in his case and Mrs Robinson from The Graduate in hers.On the plus side the final scenes of the disaster are reasonably convincing as is the period reconstruction of the 1930s and there is a witty comic song called There's a Lot to Be Said for the Fuehrer actually an ironic piece of antiNazi propaganda which sounds like something .

	schema:reviewBody "The Hindenburg is a speculative thriller by Robert Wise. Wise often picked interesting material and this one revolves around a supposed conspiracy which took place aboard The Hindenburg the famous German airship which was destroyed by fire on May 6th 1937. The Hindeburg was and still is the longest flying machine ever created by man.There's something crass about using a reallife disaster for a thriller plot but ignore this and the film has some interesting elements. For most of its running time for example Hindenburg functions like an Agatha Christie styled mystery actor George C. Scott playing a Luftwaffe security agent tasked with protecting the airship from various threats. In this regard the first half of the film delights in laying out several redherrings and false leads we the audience unsure as to which of the airship's passengers or crew may be plotting its demise. Scott himself suspects that antiHitler terrorists are plotting to symbolically blow up the Hindenburg but what's unique here is that he sympathises with the saboteurs and has no scruples with them carrying out their actions.Mostly though the film works best when it's completely ignoring its thriller plot. Scott who spends the film brooding awesomely like a noir detective a kind of pensive ageing Bogart has various romantic encounters with middle aged women which Wise suffuses with wistful dialogue and magnificently melodramatic tunes courtesy composer David Shire. Another good scene features a satirical antiNazi song. Even better are the film's evocative special effect shots most of which were done by Albert Whitlock regarded by many as the best matte artist of all time. His work is beautiful and convincing and the film's shots of bulbous airships skylines landing strips and landscapes are at times special particularly a few shots in which Whitlock recreates famous photos of the Hindenburg flying over Europe and the New York skyline. You have to be an aviation buff to like this stuff.Unfortunately whatever merit the film has is completely undermined by its climax. The film's last act is horrible Wise intercutting real footage of the Hindenburg's demise with poor special effects shots and much silly carnage. He also makes the decision to shoot the calamity in blackandwhite so as to match up with historical archival footage. It's a poor decision. If you can't render the airship's destruction convincingly with special effects omit the destruction altogether. Have it alluded to in some other way. The film's climax ruins the entire film.Airships have a certain beauty about them. They conjure up a very specific type of romanticism the romanticism of the 1930s of flying of newfandangled air machines heroic pilots and aviator sunglasses. It used to be an adventure to fly glamorous even. Now airmachines are antiseptic and airports have all the allure of bus terminals. Incidentally outside the Hindenburg the most famous airship is perhaps the Graf Zeppelin a massive German passenger airship which circumnavigated the globe in 1929. It had a spotless safety record was made famous by various newsreels and documentaries which delighted in capturing its gigantic mass as it heaved itself over cities oceans and skyscrapers but was ultimately dismantled by the Nazis at the outset of WW2. As America had a monopoly on nonflammable gas and as the public lost faith in the use of flammable hydrogen post the Hindenburg disaster Germany's age of airships eventually ended come the 1940s. Before this many interesting plans were made to retrofit skyscrapers and buildings in London and New York. The top floors of the Empire State Building for example were to house the docking ports and headquarters of American Zeppelins. So cool.7.910  Worth one viewing. See The Sand Pebbles.".

Smaller versions called blimps are still used to spot drug smugglers and illegal immigrants by TV cameras.They seem like a nice way to get from one place to another by air don't they? The travel slowly placidly even and low enough so that you can savor all the features of the landscape you're flying over.The problem was that they kept falling apart in storms collapsing for unexplained reasons or blowing up like the Hindenburg. In this case the problem was the gas used to provide buoyancy. Hydrogen gas is the lightest element there is and the first to be created after the Big Bang. After 1937 it was replaced by helium the second lightest element with an atomic number of 2 and inert. There's a Big Bang in this movie too but it's not caused by God but rather by a bomb hidden aboard the zeppelin by an antiNazi character Atherton assisted by George C. Scott. The point is to destroy spectacularly the pride of Nazi Germany. Unfortunately there is a delay in landing and the bomb goes off prematurely before the passengers and crew can diszeppelin. But not to worry. The two monstrous little kids who must always be among the passengers of jeopardized flying machines survive. So does the stupid dog. I think George C. Scott doesn't make it and it's too bad because his intentions are of the best he's polite and generous and he plays the role of the disillusioned Nazi in a subdued fashion. Atherton doesn't make it either but I'm not sure he really wanted to. The Countess played by Anne Bancroft survives her kickshaws intact and that's good because she's an intelligent and striking actress now that she's gotten past her early roles as a sexpot or gorilla bait. What a wide and welcoming smile she has and sexy too.So it's May 1937 and the bloated thing arrives at the Naval Air Station in Lakehurst New Jersey and bursts into flame just as it's being moored. The cinematic presentation must have given director Robert Wise a problem. Video footage of the explosion and collapse is widely available. Everybody has seen it. That makes it difficult to create in model form and there are no CGIs in 1975. So Wise chops the newsreel footage up into sections some magnified of this magnificent disaster. Each section of newsreel lasts a few seconds and stops on a freeze frame. Then for a minute or so we cut to the passengers that we've come to know scrambling desperately for their lives amid the flaming falling wreckage. Then back to another few seconds of the original news footage. Then back to the passengers for a minute or so. What took only about a minute of real time is stretched out to about ten minutes on the screen.The Nazi vs. antiNazi plot is to be expected. The other back stories are routine including the shell of a romance between Scott and Bancroft. More interesting are the scenes inside the airship  the cat walks the gas balloons a dangerous extravehicle trip to repair a rip in the outer canvas. And then there are the picturesque ice bergs near Newfoundland the smokestacks of New York City and snotty remarks about New Jersey where I was born being a land of moonshiners. I'm here to tell you that there were no moonshiners in New Jersey in 1937 just truck farmers growing tomatoes and other vegetables to be sold to the corrupt and sophisiticated urbanites of New York City. I suspect the Hindenburg chose to blow up where it did because Manhattan was simply not GOOD enough for it to happen there. Better for it to provide an unforgettable spectacle for those Godfearing sons of the soil living in the Garden State.".

When doing a film about an incident the filmmakers are challenged to keep our interest high despite knowing how it all comes out.The problem with The Hindenburg and it's a big one is that the filmmakers have created a possible though unlikely scenario to explain why the infamous blimp exploded just prior to landing in 1936. The scenario created is that the explosion was caused by sabotage via a mad bomber. This would have worked fine had they remembered one thing. We already know coming in that the Hindenburg exploded and killed 36 people. Any tension that could have been created is then lost. When George C. Scott as a sympathetic?

The 70s was a time for disaster pictures it seemed that one was churned out every year not all were great movies for sure but some actually were viable entertainment and with The Hindenburg we get good old fashioned story telling character build up and the pay off actually well pays off!Running at just over two hours long first time viewers should be aware that for a good 100 minutes of the film it's all about the set up there are characters to meet and journey motives to explore all passengers are under suspicion and we live thru this courtesy of George C Scott's wonderful here as usual Col. Franz Ritter the man assigned to ensure no sabotage can take away the pride of Germany. The film has flaws for sure the array of passengers are the usual disaster picture assortment of beings and of course some situations beggar belief but this is a disaster flick after all and director Robert Wise pulls it all together nicely for the films finale and what a finale it is. Using stop frames and inter cutting film of the actual disaster itself the finale grips with a sense of realism the plot line may well be merely one of the reasons put forward but the crash is indeed a thing of fact and it closes the film in a very sombre and impacting way. 710".

The 70s was a time for disaster pictures it seemed that one was churned out every year not all were great movies for sure but some actually were viable entertainment and with The Hindenburg we get good old fashioned story telling character build up and the pay off actually well pays off!Running at just over two hours long first time viewers should be aware that for a good 100 minutes of the film it's all about the set up there are characters to meet and journey motives to explore all passengers are under suspicion and we live thru this courtesy of George C Scott's wonderful here as usual Col. Franz Ritter the man assigned to ensure no sabotage can take away the pride of Germany. The film has flaws for sure the array of passengers are the usual disaster picture assortment of beings and of course some situations beggar belief but this is a disaster flick after all and director Robert Wise pulls it all together nicely for the films finale and what a finale it is. Using stop frames and inter cutting film of the actual disaster itself the finale grips with a sense of realism the plot line may well be merely one of the reasons put forward but the crash is indeed a thing of fact and it closes the film in a very sombre and impacting way. 710";

	schema:reviewBody "This is a pretty good dramatization of an historical and tragic event based on theory only and not all factual is known about that fatal day on May 06th in 1937. George C. Scott is very good as the leading actor as is Anne Bancroft as the leading actress.There are some very suspenseful scenes in the film that grab the audiences attention and you cannot let go until you see what happens next. An example of which is when the flight crew discover there is a gaping hole in the outer skin of the Hindenburg and two brave crew men go out on top of the Hindenburg as it is flying low and slow. The two crew men are tied to a rope around their waste in an attempt to seal the gaping hole before the captain of the Hindenburg gives the order to go full throttle to avoid the Hindenburg crashing and killing everyone aboard.Hindenburg began its last flight on May 3 1937 carrying 36 passengers and 61 officers crew members and trainees. It was the airship's 63rd flight. The film quality on Blu Ray is excellent and the film makers designed the Hindenburg's seating and viewing area identical to the actual air ship. Although this is more of a dramatization of certain events the facts are true that the Hindenburg exploded at Lakehurst New Jersey on May 6 1937 caught fire as it was filled with hydrogen and burned to the ground. This was a very tragic day for aviation history and it caused the deaths of thirteen 13 of the 36 passengers and twentytwo 22 of the 61 crew who died as a result of the zeppelin's crash.Historically there is no evidence of sabotage that was ever found and no convincing theory of sabotaged has ever been advanced. George C. Scott plays the lead investigator Colonel Franz Ritter charged with determining if the written warning the Kremlin received prior to the Hindenburg flight departing that the Hindenburg was going to be destroyed and Colonel Franz Ritter's known relationship with the passenger Countess Ursula von Reugen Anne Bancroft who chose to travel on the Hindenburg in an attempt to escape to New Jersey with her most valuable jewels to stay with her daughter who was away at boarding school.Will these two characters and the many other interesting passengers survive and who is responsible if there is in fact a bomb aboard the Hindenburg? This is a suspenseful film worth watching.I give The Hindenburg a 710 rating.".

	schema:headline " Impressive and depressive Airport '37 !";
	schema:reviewBody "The disaster movie was a trend in the 1970s. The Airport movies that took place in the 1970s with titles that referred their years of releases became a series in specific. Apparently that brought some money. So why not making an Airport movie yet with a different time vehicle premise and true story ! The Hindenburg was the answer for all of that. It took place in 1937 while the Nazi Germany was turning into an international ogre with a tyrannical fascist policy that forced many to run away or think of running away and an active propaganda machine that used the German airships as a giant flying ad for the Third Reich's technological development. Moreover we're introduced to a zeppelin sort of a hotel in the sky that's full of rich people exactly like what the plane looked the year before in Airport 1975 1974. However it's bigger this time with fabulous interior and grand internal. The plot utilized an excitement of Who has the bomb? What's his or her motive? When it's going to explode? And how can we stop it?. The detective searching for the criminal was sure missed in the Airport series and added thriller beside disaster in this movie's genre with more heat and attractiveness. And finally the fact factor since this movie retells a real story with the same events and nearly characters let alone presenting its own point of view concerning the reason of The Hindenburg's blowup which's embarrassing Hitler's regime by the hands of its very men who  at one point  preferred to be its resistance.This formula generally worked. The movie is nonstop thriller making me on the edge on my seat for every minute. All the time we're searching for the bomb living a timebomb pace ourselves. Unlike all the Airport movies where the characters are just a drama sideshow or relief they are used here smartly as a long list of suspects. Although The Hindenburg has its share of Excess Baggage like uninteresting characters an old pregnant wife a man with a pen full of diamonds etc.. and redundant scenes the police asks about someone on a ship ..and ponies ! but the editing managed to create a graceful movie with no flabbiness or bore. George C. Scott is a perfect lead. His seriousness carried the movie all along. He was the most charismatic actor around with the best character too. The line of I hate Nazism was well served saving for instance some irony for Scott to play. And I liked how it propounds a theory to explain the historical disaster disagreeing totally with the much known declared reason nothing but a technical error. It makes The Hindenburg precede movie like JFK in terms of being a political paranoia with a theory to present.The different age provided the image with nice details that were very elegantly cinematographed. The airship's dcor impresses highly you can't find similar visions in the Airport movies. The special effects were no less than great. The shots of the airship flying over many places day or night seemed so real seeing this movie for the first time in 2012 I personally thought that they used a fullsize airship not a small model as I read later !. And the final sequence was inflaming literally. Its factualness while cutting to the actual Newsreel footage was undoubtedly freaky. I just hated the matter of freezing the Newsreel footage for seconds it's where the documentary feel contradicted the drama feel badly.Speaking about badness while achieving a good moment like in which Scott facing himself in the mirror with a deep guilt seeing himself as a monster albeit he's serving Nazism participating in one of its massacres he doesn't believe in it losing his son somehow due to it too some of the other moment's cinematic depiction wasn't effective or taken care of originally like the moment of discovering the real bomber. Then the unintentional comedy which includes a row of shameful moments at the end  The swindler gambler acts like a gentleman and makes way for the countess while all hell is breaking loose! Richard A. Dysart as Capt. Lehmann walks some steps while looking around then falls on his face with smoke coming out of his back it fits a slapstick !. The picture of the dog comes up among the other passengers' ones while a venerable voice says Survived! Or when the bomb explodes because the clumsy Scott didn't think of delaying its time of explosion or got scared when his loyal Nazi coinvestigator shouted his name! Well Roger Ebert said that this movie makes people laugh out loud at all the wrong times. Hmm few times Rog only few !Still the biggest flaw this movie has is its end. Not for being known but for being a bit depressive. Yes almost all of the passengers we knew survived but the idea of the ideal lead getting killed as randomly as we've seen is pure turn off. Let alone the matter of patriotic cause like embarrassing the Nazi which  without a given statement  got eventually lost. At its time The Hindenburg was a sacrifice for some hungry angry reviewers. However despite its minor flaws and depressive sense this is big and absorbing kind of Airport movie that left me stunned. And it will live longer than many similar disaster movies due to its nature as a political paranoia. Proved to be right or wrong someday its theory endows it with a load of interestingness.".

Moreover we're introduced to a zeppelin sort of a hotel in the sky that's full of rich people exactly like what the plane looked the year before in Airport 1975 1974. However it's bigger this time with fabulous interior and grand internal. The plot utilized an excitement of Who has the bomb? What's his or her motive? When it's going to explode? And how can we stop it?. The detective searching for the criminal was sure missed in the Airport series and added thriller beside disaster in this movie's genre with more heat and attractiveness. And finally the fact factor since this movie retells a real story with the same events and nearly characters let alone presenting its own point of view concerning the reason of The Hindenburg's blowup which's embarrassing Hitler's regime by the hands of its very men who  at one point  preferred to be its resistance.This formula generally worked. The movie is nonstop thriller making me on the edge on my seat for every minute. All the time we're searching for the bomb living a timebomb pace ourselves. Unlike all the Airport movies where the characters are just a drama sideshow or relief they are used here smartly as a long list of suspects. Although The Hindenburg has its share of Excess Baggage like uninteresting characters an old pregnant wife a man with a pen full of diamonds etc.. and redundant scenes the police asks about someone on a ship ..and ponies ! but the editing managed to create a graceful movie with no flabbiness or bore. George C. Scott is a perfect lead. His seriousness carried the movie all along. He was the most charismatic actor around with the best character too. The line of I hate Nazism was well served saving for instance some irony for Scott to play. And I liked how it propounds a theory to explain the historical disaster disagreeing totally with the much known declared reason nothing but a technical error. It makes The Hindenburg precede movie like JFK in terms of being a political paranoia with a theory to present.The different age provided the image with nice details that were very elegantly cinematographed. The airship's dcor impresses highly you can't find similar visions in the Airport movies. The special effects were no less than great. The shots of the airship flying over many places day or night seemed so real seeing this movie for the first time in 2012 I personally thought that they used a fullsize airship not a small model as I read later !. And the final sequence was inflaming literally. Its factualness while cutting to the actual Newsreel footage was undoubtedly freaky. I just hated the matter of freezing the Newsreel footage for seconds it's where the documentary feel contradicted the drama feel badly.Speaking about badness while achieving a good moment like in which Scott facing himself in the mirror with a deep guilt seeing himself as a monster albeit he's serving Nazism participating in one of its massacres he doesn't believe in it losing his son somehow due to it too some of the other moment's cinematic depiction wasn't effective or taken care of originally like the moment of discovering the real bomber. Then the unintentional comedy which includes a row of shameful moments at the end  The swindler gambler acts like a gentleman and makes way for the countess while all hell is breaking loose! Richard A. Dysart as Capt. Lehmann walks some steps while looking around then falls on his face with smoke coming out of his back it fits a slapstick !. The picture of the dog comes up among the other passengers' ones while a venerable voice says Survived! Or when the bomb explodes because the clumsy Scott didn't think of delaying its time of explosion or got scared when his loyal Nazi coinvestigator shouted his name! Well Roger Ebert said that this movie makes people laugh out loud at all the wrong times. Hmm few times Rog only few !Still the biggest flaw this movie has is its end. Not for being known but for being a bit depressive. Yes almost all of the passengers we knew survived but the idea of the ideal lead getting killed as randomly as we've seen is pure turn off. Let alone the matter of patriotic cause like embarrassing the Nazi which  without a given statement  got eventually lost. At its time The Hindenburg was a sacrifice for some hungry angry reviewers. However despite its minor flaws and depressive sense this is big and absorbing kind of Airport movie that left me stunned. And it will live longer than many similar disaster movies due to its nature as a political paranoia. Proved to be right or wrong someday its theory endows it with a load of interestingness.";

	schema:headline " Unconventional Comedy That Gets A Bad Wrap";
	schema:reviewBody "I look up all of the movies I watch on IMDb and I'm surprised that this one is so disliked. I think the main reason is that with a cast of such comedy legends as Chevy Chase Dan Aykroyd and John Candy people were expecting a more conventional comedy. Most of their audience was probably expecting something along of the lines of The Couch Trip Delirious or Fletch. I think people like me who appreciate campy horror films like 2001 Maniacs The Butcher and any of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre series are more likely to find some humor in this film.Thanks to the remarkably bland title I had no idea that this was a comedy with a horror twist when I found it on a cable channel. The completely pointless start of the film which involves a party and some sort of talk of some sort of business deal also doesn't hint at what the film is really about. It isn't until the protagonists get arrested that all of the fun starts.What follows is something in between comedy and horror. It skews more towards horror with tons of grossout scenes thanks to Dan Aykroyd's various grotesque characters. There are tons of bones but not a lot of blood. Unlike conventional horror movies where bodycounts are generally in the double digits only one group of ne'erdowells end up slaughtered over the course of the film. Even the two annoying ancillary characters who are along for the ride who would be dead meat in any real horror film end up getting a reprieve and a happy ending.By far the strangest part and my personal favorite is the musical performance in the middle of the film. When I saw a limo pulling up in a scene halfway through the film I thought okay here come some more victims. I was surprised to say the least that the occupants of the vehicle turned out to be the entire Digital Underground crew including the instantly recognizable Shock G aka Humpty Hump! Instead of being murdered they all perform a song unfortunately not their one major hit the far superior Humpty Hump. You can even see the lategreat Tupac Shakur as one of the members of Digital Underground before he started his solo career. I would recommend this film to anyone just for this surreal moment but if you have no idea who Tupac or Digital Underground are then you probably won't enjoy it as much.After a few fake endings and the actual goofy cartoon ending the movie is over. All in all it doesn't have that many laughs and it's definitely not scary but it is rarely boring. The Digital Underground cameo is excellent and the cast plays their roles well. This is certainly not the best movie I've seen but I would rank it better than any bad comedy and most bad horror movies. In fact I'd say this film is just a few buckets of blood and a few crazy grossout scenes away from a cult classic.".

I think people like me who appreciate campy horror films like 2001 Maniacs The Butcher and any of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre series are more likely to find some humor in this film.Thanks to the remarkably bland title I had no idea that this was a comedy with a horror twist when I found it on a cable channel. The completely pointless start of the film which involves a party and some sort of talk of some sort of business deal also doesn't hint at what the film is really about. It isn't until the protagonists get arrested that all of the fun starts.What follows is something in between comedy and horror. It skews more towards horror with tons of grossout scenes thanks to Dan Aykroyd's various grotesque characters. There are tons of bones but not a lot of blood. Unlike conventional horror movies where bodycounts are generally in the double digits only one group of ne'erdowells end up slaughtered over the course of the film. Even the two annoying ancillary characters who are along for the ride who would be dead meat in any real horror film end up getting a reprieve and a happy ending.By far the strangest part and my personal favorite is the musical performance in the middle of the film. When I saw a limo pulling up in a scene halfway through the film I thought okay here come some more victims. I was surprised to say the least that the occupants of the vehicle turned out to be the entire Digital Underground crew including the instantly recognizable Shock G aka Humpty Hump! Instead of being murdered they all perform a song unfortunately not their one major hit the far superior Humpty Hump. You can even see the lategreat Tupac Shakur as one of the members of Digital Underground before he started his solo career. I would recommend this film to anyone just for this surreal moment but if you have no idea who Tupac or Digital Underground are then you probably won't enjoy it as much.After a few fake endings and the actual goofy cartoon ending the movie is over. All in all it doesn't have that many laughs and it's definitely not scary but it is rarely boring. The Digital Underground cameo is excellent and the cast plays their roles well. This is certainly not the best movie I've seen but I would rank it better than any bad comedy and most bad horror movies. In fact I'd say this film is just a few buckets of blood and a few crazy grossout scenes away from a cult classic.";

Aykroyd's characterization of the Shire Reeve origin of the word Sheriff totally makes the movie as does Mr. Bonestripper soupedup police cars and John Candy playing against type as the nicebuttough Chief Constable. Some really amazing sets here preCGI. In my opinion this movie has only two weaknesses 1. It's a little slow getting started with a protracted dinner party prologue and 2. The two giant mutant baby grandchildren that live out in the junkyard are just too cartoonish and not funny at all. But the rest of the movie is great well worth your while. I particularly enjoy anticipating what ruling the Reeve is going to hand out with each case and the conclusion of the State Police raid is also a great moment!".

	schema:reviewBody "Before seeing this I was put off by the subject matter but this is not your average triumph over adversity story. Although this is technically about blind Tibetan kids climbing Mt. Everest there is so much more to it. This movie shows the very strong often contradictory personalities of two highly accomplished blind adults leading the children Erik and Sabriye. Erik is an American blind mountain climberathlete and Sabriye is a blind German academic who started a school in Lhasa Tibet. They are both exceptional in their own ways but disagree on what will really build confidence in the kids. Erik wants them to reach the summit while Sabriye wants them to enjoy Erik as a role model and take pleasure in moment. The nuances are complicated and one walks away not really being sure who was right or if the whole climb was a mistake or a great idea. The most profound scenes are with the Tibetan children themselves and the hardships they faced before finding their way to the school. The most moving for me was the story of Tashi a frail teenager who grew up on the streets after his parents abandoned him. I could watch a whole movie on his life and was happy to learn that thanks to the school he is now running a successful small business with some of his fellow students. If you liked Spellbound or Murderball you will love this.".

	onyx:emotionText "Before seeing this I was put off by the subject matter but this is not your average triumph over adversity story. Although this is technically about blind Tibetan kids climbing Mt. Everest there is so much more to it. This movie shows the very strong often contradictory personalities of two highly accomplished blind adults leading the children Erik and Sabriye. Erik is an American blind mountain climberathlete and Sabriye is a blind German academic who started a school in Lhasa Tibet. They are both exceptional in their own ways but disagree on what will really build confidence in the kids. Erik wants them to reach the summit while Sabriye wants them to enjoy Erik as a role model and take pleasure in moment. The nuances are complicated and one walks away not really being sure who was right or if the whole climb was a mistake or a great idea. The most profound scenes are with the Tibetan children themselves and the hardships they faced before finding their way to the school. The most moving for me was the story of Tashi a frail teenager who grew up on the streets after his parents abandoned him. I could watch a whole movie on his life and was happy to learn that thanks to the school he is now running a successful small business with some of his fellow students. If you liked Spellbound or Murderball you will love this.";

Blindsight is a gripping adventure of six blind Tibetan teenagers who set out to climb the 23000 ft mountain right next to Mount Everest. The teenagers are brought together by Sabriye Tenberken who opened a school for the blind in Tibet. She and her students with the help of Erik Weihenmayer the first blind person to summit Everest set out to prove that they are no less able than their seeing counterparts.This film captures both the arguments of the climbers as well as their frustrations despair and exhilaration towards the end.Blindsight is a must see for everyone! Visually it is riveting and the landscape is nothing short of breathtaking. When I saw this film in Toronto it was a really moving experience and one that I would recommend to everyone. Well done to those involved!!!".

	schema:headline " Inspirational. Moving. But So Much More...";
	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film at the Toronto International Film Festival. I loved this and not just for the obvious reasons. Blindsight is a documentary about a group of blind Tibetan teenagers who attempt to climb one of Mount Everest's sister peaks. Now this kind of thing is usually a can't miss. Inspirational. Moving. Pretty standard right? And even if the film were just that I'd still have liked it. But it was so much more. Blind herself German Sabriye Tenberken established a school for blind children in Tibet in a culture that sees blindness as a curse as evidence that a person did bad things in a previous life. Many of the children at the school have been shunned their whole lives and at best are a burden to their families. As part of their education Tenberken shares with them the story of American Erik Weihenmayer the first blind person to reach the summit of Mount Everest. She sends him a letter inviting him to come and visit her students. Instead he comes up with a plan. He'll arrange an expedition for them to climb 23000 foot Lhakpa Ri and provide all the guides and equipment. Sabriye finds six willing participants and this is when the fun starts.Erik's team are mostly American mostly male and mostly sighted. As experienced mountaineers they're TypeA personalities very gungho and goaloriented. Sabriye is European female and blind and the students for her are more than a project no matter how wellintentioned. Additionally the students are Tibetan and not old enough or confident enough to always stand up for themselves. As the expedition unfolds they become pawns in between the two adult sides wanting to please both while at the same time wanting to gain the confidence that comes from accomplishment. As an additional obstacle other than being blind that is they are speaking English as a second or in most cases a third language and struggle to understand and make themselves understood.When it turns out that none of the students have any climbing experience and that some are much more coordinated than others it begins to unravel Erik's original plan for them all to reach the summit together. As both students and teachers begin to suffer the effects of high altitude decisions must be made as to whether to continue on or to send some down the mountain. Among the effects of high altitude is increased irritability and you can see how this feeds the conflict between the adults. At the risk of oversimplifying on one side are those for whom the destination is all and on the other are those who just want to enjoy the journey. I won't tell you how it all turns out except to say that this was one of the most surprising and thoughtprovoking stories I've seen in a long time.The film also weaves bits of each climber's story into the narrative and this was sorely needed since once on the climb the kids tended to keep their heads down and their mouths shut. With all the drama going on around them that wasn't surprising. The backstories are by turns charming and heartbreaking and I found it very strange that I found myself closer to tears at the beginning of the film than at the end. This was contrary to my expectations and another pleasant surprise.In addition to all the human drama to cover director Walker and her small crew had to contend with the frigid and oxygendeprived conditions herself lugging equipment up the mountains and hoping it wouldn't break down. As with all great documentaries the filmmaker was just lucky enough or smart enough or prepared enough to be at the right place at the right time and she's captured a very special story that has as much to say about people who want to do what's best for the kids as it does about the kids themselves.".

If you hear the concept you might get the feeling that this is one of those touchy movies about an amazing triumph covered with over the top music and trying to have us fully convinced of what a great story it is telling but then not letting us in. Fortunetly this is not that movie. The people tell the story! This does such a good job of capturing every moment of their involvement while we enter their world and feel every second with them. There is so much beyond the climb that makes everything they go through so much more tense. Touching the Void was also a great doc about mountain climbing and showing the intensity in an engaging way but this film is much more of a human story.

	schema:reviewBody "This film made in 1966 was a bold attempt at addressing the contemporary conflicts of race and identity as it affected an African American jazz musician during the turbulent civil rights era. Adam Sammy Davis Jr. is a celebrated yet self destructive jazz musician and womanizer. Possessing a mean temper with a short fuse he also has a serious drinking problem. In the opening scenes we are introduced to Adam leading his band in a sensuous slow number to an appreciative audience at a jazz club. When a drunken audience member insists he play something uptempo the volatile Adam abruptly stops playing and nearly assaults his heckler before storming out of the club and hopping a plane back to New York without explanation. Arriving home drunk with a sexy stewardess whose name he can't remember a very lovely Lola Falana in her first screen role which amounts to a brief cheesecake walkon Adam inconveniently discovers his apartment has been loaned for the weekend by his best friend played by Ossie Davis to a respected elderly jazz musician Louis Armstrong and his chaperongranddaughter a young civil rights activist Cicely Tyson. Honored by the presence of the senior musician and attracted to his grand daughter's sharp wit politicism and natural beauty unlike the other African American actresses in this film Tyson wears her hair in a short afro and wears little to no makeup. To his best friend's dismay Adam attempts to embark upon a serious relationship with the activist and to meet her challenge to him to be nothing less and nothing less than what what he is a man. With the support of his nononsense girlfriend and his young protg Frank Sinatra Jr. Adam's efforts to tame his drinking and his anger look promising until an unexpected confrontation with the police tips the scale. Neither the elder musician's Armstrong brand of courteous subservience nor Tyson's subscription to non violent protest works for Adam In an era where his art cannot shield him from the stigma and crisis of his race Adam is a timebomb waiting to happen. Davis' performance is riveting as is Tyson's. The issues presented in this film were raw at the time of its making and Davis and Tyson present African American characters that were almost unprecedented in their dramatic intensity and three dimensionalityan exception would be Ivan Dixon and Abbey Lincoln's startling performances in Nothin' But AMan 1961. Ratpack bad boy Peter Lawford joins the cast as Adam's powerful and vindictive agent who after twice being humiliated by Adam don't miss the scene in famed NY restaurant 21 blackballs him then forces him back to the humiliation of the segregated south. Also look for a brief yet strong performance from an uncredited Jan'et DuBois Willona on 1970s TV show Good Times as Adam's prideless sometimes girlfriend and Academy award winning actor Morgan Freeman an extra in a party scene featuring singer Mel Torme.".

In the opening scenes we are introduced to Adam leading his band in a sensuous slow number to an appreciative audience at a jazz club. When a drunken audience member insists he play something uptempo the volatile Adam abruptly stops playing and nearly assaults his heckler before storming out of the club and hopping a plane back to New York without explanation. Arriving home drunk with a sexy stewardess whose name he can't remember a very lovely Lola Falana in her first screen role which amounts to a brief cheesecake walkon Adam inconveniently discovers his apartment has been loaned for the weekend by his best friend played by Ossie Davis to a respected elderly jazz musician Louis Armstrong and his chaperongranddaughter a young civil rights activist Cicely Tyson. Honored by the presence of the senior musician and attracted to his grand daughter's sharp wit politicism and natural beauty unlike the other African American actresses in this film Tyson wears her hair in a short afro and wears little to no makeup. To his best friend's dismay Adam attempts to embark upon a serious relationship with the activist and to meet her challenge to him to be nothing less and nothing less than what what he is a man. With the support of his nononsense girlfriend and his young protg Frank Sinatra Jr. Adam's efforts to tame his drinking and his anger look promising until an unexpected confrontation with the police tips the scale. Neither the elder musician's Armstrong brand of courteous subservience nor Tyson's subscription to non violent protest works for Adam In an era where his art cannot shield him from the stigma and crisis of his race Adam is a timebomb waiting to happen. Davis' performance is riveting as is Tyson's. The issues presented in this film were raw at the time of its making and Davis and Tyson present African American characters that were almost unprecedented in their dramatic intensity and three dimensionalityan exception would be Ivan Dixon and Abbey Lincoln's startling performances in Nothin' But AMan 1961. Ratpack bad boy Peter Lawford joins the cast as Adam's powerful and vindictive agent who after twice being humiliated by Adam don't miss the scene in famed NY restaurant 21 blackballs him then forces him back to the humiliation of the segregated south. Also look for a brief yet strong performance from an uncredited Jan'et DuBois Willona on 1970s TV show Good Times as Adam's prideless sometimes girlfriend and Academy award winning actor Morgan Freeman an extra in a party scene featuring singer Mel Torme.";

Sammy Davis Jr. is Adam Johnson a trumpeter with a short temper and a messed up social life. Ossie Davis is his club owner friend Nelson Frank Sinatra Jr. is his Caucasion protg Vincent Cicely Tyson is his activist lover Claudia Louis Armstrong is her grandfather who's also a jazz musician named Willie and Peter Lawford is his agent Manny. All are very compelling in their roles which takes on many issues with racism and why Adam feels the way he does. Also interesting seeing such upandcoming stars like Ja'net Du Bois Johnny Brown both eventually of Good Times and Lola Falana in some roles. Oh and the director is Leo Penn father of Sean Penn. So on that note I highly recommend A Man Called Adam. Oh and I also loved Mel Torme doing his thing in one number.".

	schema:headline " Lowkey character study";
	schema:reviewBody "'A Man Called Adam' was tailormade as a vehicle for Sammy Davis's talents as a dramatic actor. He should have chosen a better script with a more sympathetic role. The main character in this movie wallows in selfpity and then turns out to do so for the wrong reasons.As a movie 'Adam' is slow and boring. As a showcase for some jazz performances 'Adam' is considerably better. In addition to some splendid trumpet solos by Nat Adderley dubbing for Davis's character there are superb performances by Louis Armstrong and Benny Carter which almost but not quite redeem this movie's considerable flaws. Also on hand is Mel Odious I mean Mel Torme exhibiting his usual smarm.This movie's painfully low budget actually works in its favour. Leo Penn's lowkey direction skilfully captures the downanddirty world of a jazz musician the brassy nightclubs seedy hotel rooms flyblown booking agencies and jam sessions.Adam Johnson Davis is a talented jazz trumpeter whose career is going nowhere fast. We're given to understand that he's a victim of racism and in 1966 this is certainly plausible. But a lot of Adam's problems are his own fault. He walks out on a club date at the last minute  a cardinal sin  and quarrels with his honest and hardworking agent. Adam also has a drinking problem which I found slightly disingenuous. In real life quite a few jazz musicians have substanceabuse problems but the substance is usually drugs ... not alcohol. Judging by this movie you'd think that booze is the most lethal substance in the nightworld of jazz.SPOILERS COMING. Eventually in a wellacted scene with Cicely Tyson Adam reveals his big secret. He used to have a wife and child but they both died in a car accident while Adam was driving ... he feels guilty that he survived and they didn't. Ever since he's been taking it out on himself and everyone else.I found this movie dishonest. I accept that there were many reasons for a black man in 1966 to be angry and resentful but Adam seems to be angry for all the wrong reasons. In the novelisation of this film there's a chapter in which Adam spitefully plays slow jazz when a white customer wants something uptempo. This whole film is like that with Davis giving us something that he knows we don't want.On the positive side Sammy Davis and Tyson give excellent performances with the bad material given them here. Ossie Davis no relation is less impressive. A lot of actors owed their success to some physical quirk for Ossie Davis it was an extremely deep and resonant voice. He has little else to offer here. I was pleasantly surprised by the performance of Peter Lawford as Adam's agent. I've always considered Lawford a notalent who got by with a handsome face a charming manner a pleasant speaking voice and some Camelot glamour by way of his marriage to JFK's sister. Here for perhaps the only time in his career Lawford gives a layered and nuanced performance in a credible role. He and Sammy Davis were good friends and Rat Packers offscreen perhaps their genuine affection enabled Lawford to do the scene here where he and Davis are at each other's throats.I was also pleasantly surprised by a scene in which Adam plays a jazz duet with white trumpeter Vincent played by Frank Sinatra Jnr. It's no revelation that Frank Sinatra Jnr's chief claim to fame is his father's name. Here he actually shows some talent in his own right ... synchplaying to someone else's dubbed trumpet music but showing easy rapport with Davis. I wish that this entire film could have matched the panache of their sequence together.I recommend 'A Man Called Adam' for some fine jazz music but not otherwise. My rating for this movie is 3 out of 10.".
