He offers to drive the antique Chevy across the desert to the sea where it has been sold to a local museum. As he sets off across the harsh terrain he discovers he's not merely transporting a battered vehicle but an old touring cinema. Along the way Vishnu reluctantly picks up a young runaway a wandering old entertainer and a striking gypsy woman. Together they roam the barren land searching for water and an elusive fair. The journey turns dire when they are waylaid by corrupt cops and a notorious waterlord. The key to their freedom is the eccentric collection of films and the two fortyyearold film projectors in the back of the truck. As in 1001 Nights if the films are good they live and move on. If the films are boring they face death in the outback. The journey proves transformative for each of the travelers but ...";

	schema:reviewBody "'Road Movie' is an extraordinary movie and one of the most beautiful films I've seen in recent years. This is the story of Vishnu Abhay Deol a young apathetic and carefree guy who hits the road in his old neighbour's very antique kind of a truck a 1942 Chevy with a traveling cinema in its back carrying Victoria film projectors. For him this truck is in a sense a way to escape his family's burden  selling Atma hair oil for his dad  and take a week of freedom while driving from Rajasthan to the sea. On his way Vishnu picks up several passengers who go on this journey with him a smart orphaned boy an old wise mechanic and a beautiful widowed gypsy. Even this barren place has its rulers however and they appear in the form of a sadistic policeman and cruel waterhoarding gangsters.This movie is visually stunning poetic artistic and completely real. Dev Benegal's direction is fantastic. In order to understand the true meaning of this symbolic piece one would have to figure out what every object in the movie signifies  the oil the water the well the people he meets and goes on this journey with the group of water searching women he always encounters on his way. This is the journey of life and everyone is free to interpret it the way they want. But it does not really matter if you just want to enjoy the film. The movie is just engaging mysterious and interesting without forcing you to find a hidden significance in the story. The situations the dialogue the characters the locations are so authentic and fascinating that the movie flows extremely well. I was captivated not only because it is visually stunning it is also perfectly paced and has an inexplicably understated sense of life.Road Movie captures the serene and peaceful beauty of the broad and desolate desert landscapes. It is done is a way that is so precise that there seems to be no way possible to take your eyes off the screen. This is aided by two aspects which are of the strongest in the film the exquisite cinematography and the superb background score. These two aspects done with sheer excellence by Michel Amathieu and Michael Brook respectively are perfectly brought together onscreen to create a breathtakingly mesmerising visual treat. The music complements the images and vice versa. I loved the sequences in which the group started screening different classic films used to relax the villains. From Deewaar 1975 to Jaal 1986 to Andaz 1971. And ironically Vishnu's father's damned hair oil somehow always comes to his rescue. As already mentioned the film is extremely realistic and the acting is roundly natural. All characters no matter how lengthy or brief they are look totally genuine. Abhay Deol leads this film and this brilliant actor yet again proves why he is possibly the finest actor of his age bracket. He is a brave actor as he is not afraid to be unlikable or look selfish and he does it exceedingly well. Mohammed Faisal plays the nameless boy who is in search of a better life with ease and conviction. Tannishtha Chatterjee is mindblowing as the mysterious and widowed gypsy woman. The scene in which she starts singing a beautiful folklore song is wonderful. However the one who steals the show is undoubtedly Satish Kaushik  he is simply outstanding from start to end. He makes his character so authentic likable and memorable. This is one of his finest performances and according to me the finest in the movie. In one of the film's most wonderful dialogues Satish Kaushik's character says something that really epitomises the power of this picture Ah the magic of cinema  lets you forget life pain worry... Takes you far away into a world of dreams. 'Road Movie' really is a lyrical tribute to the magic of movies  a breathtaking beautiful and fascinating gem. This is a spectacular picture.".

But the man who steals the show as the mechanic is veteran actor Satish Kaushik. Absolutely wonderful performance by him.Besides the cinematography is absolutely scintillating. Never has the rajasthan landscape been so beautifully picturised on screen. Michael Brook's background score is beautiful to say the least.A movie with international sensibilities but an Indian heart. Calling this Bollywood will be a shame.

So in this article I just plan to throw a few hints on the metaphors used in the movie. For the sake of exhaustiveness of this article I would like to mention that direction cinematography etc. etc. are superb.Superficially it seems that the story shows journey of a young boy 'Vishnu' Abhay Deol from his home town to Samudrabad on road. But actually this was a philosophical portrait of 'The journey of life' and subtle metaphors were used as colors.Every thing is very cleverly shown. 1.Huge stress has been given on 'water'. Does 'water' signify water or something else? 2.What do those weird characters group of water searching ladies water lord etc. portrayed by the director signify actually? 3.Things like the character of mechanic who always gives the right suggestion or the strange fair that suddenly appeared out of the blue an vanished in Shoonya mean something ? Or probably are the side effects of Director's Block . 4.What does the 'Atma means 'soul' in Hindi Oil' that magically and comically solves every problem signify? 5.At the very first thought Road Movie why this name? .....and the list of all those riddles which should spontaneously pop up in the mind of keen and intelligent viewer go on . Solving and linking these riddles brings to you a great philosophical discourse.Special mention The way in which the magic of the mesmerizing virtual world of film been picturized is simply admirable.So Please go and watch out this awesome movie with the attention and respect that this movie deserves.

	schema:reviewBody "There are just four characters in the movie. Vishnu played by Abhay Deol wants to do more than just waste his time selling herbal oil as his father does before him. So he volunteers for a friend to deliver across the desert an old truck which is a mobile cinema. The film is then about his journey the movies that he plays  more importantly the people that he meets on the way.We have seen bits of brilliance from Satish Kaushik in the past from Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro to Calendar in Mr. India but I think this is the one that he will be most remembered for as an actor. Cast as a veteran mechanic Kaushik plays a central role in taking the movie in a different direction than the protagonist has planned to. He has been cast very well along with the little boy that Vishnu picks up early in his journey. Both these characters provide for the lighter moments in the film while also inducing some thought provoking dialogue. There is also scope for a female lead. A tribal whose husband was slain over a water dispute some years ago. As she mentions that she too wants to get lost in the magic of cinema one can't help but wonder if there is a deeper meaning to this sentence. And this deep meaning dialogue is a standard feature of the film.Wide angle views of the vastness of the desert that lead to nothingness in the desert and a set of women treading along for days in search of water are brilliantly executed. And other than the road  the movies they are a common string throughout the film.The film exists at many levels. At the most superficial level it appears to be a subtle comedy with situational jokes and a bit of slapstick too. You dig a little and you find that it is a person's journey to finding himself by having to deal with an old truck rough dry weather and some people who have been through their share of pain  suffering and how they still manage to be at peace and look forward to some elusive tranquility.Dig a little deeper and you find the film is about some inherent social problems that still affect most of rural  tribal India. That something as basic as water can be a reason for murder  arson is hard to imagine but it is brought to us with a lot of sensitivity. How the lead characters almost die of thirst how they almost get killed for trying to steal water all help appreciate a problem that is alien to most of us.Dig a bit more and we find that Indian cinema is trying to usher in the seemingly selfish directors who make films from the heart with a message that they want to send across to anyone who tries to understand their cinema. There is no plot in the movie that would build up into something big. For a film like this there has to be no plot. Very few directors can do it and get away with it. It is a movie that should go down as one that shifted or at least tried to shift the paradigm of Indian cinema.That said there is much that the director could do better explaining  elaborating a little. Like what is the protagonist actually wanting to do with the truck how does a particular mela caravan fair disappear overnight and mostly why such a brilliant film seem a bit too long even for its 95 minute run time.It is most definitely a lesson in cinematographic excellence. One would just hope that it would be a complete movie in itself too.".

And other than the road  the movies they are a common string throughout the film.The film exists at many levels. At the most superficial level it appears to be a subtle comedy with situational jokes and a bit of slapstick too. You dig a little and you find that it is a person's journey to finding himself by having to deal with an old truck rough dry weather and some people who have been through their share of pain  suffering and how they still manage to be at peace and look forward to some elusive tranquility.Dig a little deeper and you find the film is about some inherent social problems that still affect most of rural  tribal India. That something as basic as water can be a reason for murder  arson is hard to imagine but it is brought to us with a lot of sensitivity. How the lead characters almost die of thirst how they almost get killed for trying to steal water all help appreciate a problem that is alien to most of us.Dig a bit more and we find that Indian cinema is trying to usher in the seemingly selfish directors who make films from the heart with a message that they want to send across to anyone who tries to understand their cinema. There is no plot in the movie that would build up into something big. For a film like this there has to be no plot. Very few directors can do it and get away with it. It is a movie that should go down as one that shifted or at least tried to shift the paradigm of Indian cinema.That said there is much that the director could do better explaining  elaborating a little. Like what is the protagonist actually wanting to do with the truck how does a particular mela caravan fair disappear overnight and mostly why such a brilliant film seem a bit too long even for its 95 minute run time.It is most definitely a lesson in cinematographic excellence. One would just hope that it would be a complete movie in itself too.";

	schema:reviewBody "Almost a decade after his last film 'Split Wide Open' and 15 years after the multiaward winning pathbreaking 'English August' Dev Benegal returns with his latest  'Road Movie'. From a director who has been a posterboy for independent Indian cinema and a cult figure amongst the young film makers in India his latest film reaffirms his credentials as a sensitive visionary film maker who is not afraid to challenge popular perceptions.'Road Movie' to begin with is a many layered onion that peels off gradually to reveal an awe inspiring stunning Indian landscape full of myriad characters stuck in their own microcosms fitting together like pieces of a jigsaw in a perfect tribute to an extremely diverse and colorful country. At another level it highlights the soaring human aspirations in a society undergoing rapid development and industrialization where each of the characters is running away from their past in search of a better life but is finding it difficult to let go of a hauntingly beautiful and fast disappearing rustic life.Abhay Deol's Vishnu  complete with an ipod and a Levi jeans represents the upwardly mobile yet selfishly aimless Indian youth. An orphaned child laborer played by real life orphan Faizal is clued into the interconnected world's lifestyle in a detached sort of way. A widowed gypsy woman sings melancholy songs of loneliness while hiding from danger a corrupt cop stuck in a miserable job is driven by lust and power while donning the uniform of a public servant and a mafia don has a selftaught management degree in doing business in the most precious commodity in the barren landscape  water .One of the most interesting characters in the film is played by Satish Kaushik. As a 'mechanic' he represents the much older wiser guardian angel to the group of 4 leading characters traveling in a 1942 Chevy truck carrying Victoria film projectors an odd selection of cinema reels and bottles of hair oil. The truck becomes a haven for these lost souls in their fantasy adventure on the Road and the Movies they show on the way help them navigate the fear of the unknown with aplomb laughter and humor.The film beautifully captures the stunning silent beauty of the vast barren haunting landscapes of Thar and Kutch regions of Rajasthan and Gujarat. Besides the humans the Chevy truck and the Landscape are equally important characters in the movie speaking volumes through the exquisite cinematography and soulstirring music. The film's director cleverly uses inanimate objects to build this poetic fable with a magical realism choosing to be subtle and sensitive sometimes sacrificing dialog to communicate through his visuals which get imprinted in your memory.This is a bewitching tale that is bound to linger on in your mind for months possibly years after you have seen it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Before going into the finer details let's study some important facts associated with 'Road Movie1. A widely appreciated project from Dev Benegal the director of English August  Split Wide Open.2. Featuring Abhay Deol in the lead who is now known for his offbeat choice of subjects and understanding of the medium. 3. Presence of the veteran Satish Kaushik in a hopeful comic role which sounds pretty exciting. 4. Refreshing promotional material with visuals of an old truck and inviting visuals of Rajasthan.5. And Sar Jo Tera Chakraye track from Pyaasa playing in the background.What an ensemble of exciting stuff associated with a single project and what a disastrous final product in the offering. To be straight I love artistic movies especially the ones which have the power to enlighten and are widely acclaimed in the festival circuits. But with Road Movie I was highly disappointed as it had nothing as compared to its striking promotional campaign and the earlier two movies from the director mentioned above. Now the detailed reviewOnce again as seen in many recent projects the movie starts off brilliantly with an artistic feel and ambiance. But right after the old truck comes into the story the film steps onto an escalator slowly moving downwards. Abhay Deol who is not interested in his father's oil business goes on to take an undisclosed assignment to drive an old truck to another unknown destination and keeps wandering in the deserts and plain regions with no living being in the sight. The viewer is never told why he took up this job what was the purpose of his voyage what goods he had to deliver and what was the actual destination he was heading for. Also it was quite weird to show that Abhay didn't even know that there was a projector and whole equipment of showing a movie in the truck he was driving. Moreover he very unintelligently takes up the job of driving an old truck through the lonely roads all alone without taking any helper along with him. That was indeed very daring thought put in by the writers.Besides all this confusion the project misses all those thrilling factors associated with a long road journey and its joy. The viewers who love travelling long distances through roads are sure going to be disappointed with the treatment given by the director to the theme. For instance one strongly misses the highway chills the roadside dhabas the occasional stoppages the view of wide barren lands along with great music running at the back children waving from the roadsides and risky one nights stays in the cheap hotels while watching this weak movie on Road theme. There is nothing stated above in the entire movie.In fact the director is more interested in his outdoor cinema being arranged from the projector in the truck and its craze among the villagers in his vaguely written movie. Along with that he also adds the plot of a mystified romance between Abhay and a nomad girl the tragic end of a good hearted mechanic and a silly sequence about a desert don running a watermafia. But sadly none of these subplots works in the movie. On the contrary each new development on the screen makes the viewer even more confused makes him wondering about what the director actually wants to convey? Especially the sequence about the grand fair in the lonely desert coming out of nowhere. This particular part is the most confusing one in the entire movie and is also left unexplained by the director just like that. May be he wanted the festival people to make their own creative conclusion about the same. Likewise the director never shows us any sound equipment being installed by anyone before screening the film in the outdoors. May be that was too a festival liberty taken by the director with style.The other major question which came to my mind while watching Road Movie was that why all the western filmmakers are still interested in showing the poverty villages and rural areas of India in their movies more than anything else. Unfortunately the worldwide success of Slumdog Millionaire has contributed a lot in this direction.At the same time all these talented directors simply forget the essence  culture of our country while shooting their intimate sexual scenes which seems to be quite funny. Like in Road Movie too at one end the director shows a nomad girl who has never watched cinema in her life. Yet in a later sequence he shows the same village girl smooching Abhay Deol in a pure western style and passion. Frankly speaking that was quite funny and amateur kind of direction from the experienced director.Technically the film stands out with its stunning visuals and great cinematography. But it moves at a very lazy pace which forces the viewer to look at his watch repeatedly. The screenplay falls flat and has nothing exceptional in store for the thinking viewer. Musically the film misses any special tracks to enjoy on a long drive as per its title and Pyaasa's  Tel Maalish song is also not used in any respectable context by the director. Talking about the performances Abhay Deol fits to the role as a T but the film would not prove to be another ace up his sleeve. His honest effort gets betrayed by a badly written script. Satish Kaushik is completely lovable. Mohammed Faizal Usmani shines with his witty dialogues and Tannishtha Chatterjee does her job well.In a nutshell Road Movie is not at all exciting as suggested by its title and eye catching promotional campaign. Its neither a thought provoking artistic venture nor an interesting novel project made on a different theme. Its just a tiring fruitless journey heading towards nowhere.".

May be that was too a festival liberty taken by the director with style.The other major question which came to my mind while watching Road Movie was that why all the western filmmakers are still interested in showing the poverty villages and rural areas of India in their movies more than anything else. Unfortunately the worldwide success of Slumdog Millionaire has contributed a lot in this direction.At the same time all these talented directors simply forget the essence  culture of our country while shooting their intimate sexual scenes which seems to be quite funny. Like in Road Movie too at one end the director shows a nomad girl who has never watched cinema in her life. Yet in a later sequence he shows the same village girl smooching Abhay Deol in a pure western style and passion. Frankly speaking that was quite funny and amateur kind of direction from the experienced director.Technically the film stands out with its stunning visuals and great cinematography. But it moves at a very lazy pace which forces the viewer to look at his watch repeatedly. The screenplay falls flat and has nothing exceptional in store for the thinking viewer. Musically the film misses any special tracks to enjoy on a long drive as per its title and Pyaasa's  Tel Maalish song is also not used in any respectable context by the director. Talking about the performances Abhay Deol fits to the role as a T but the film would not prove to be another ace up his sleeve. His honest effort gets betrayed by a badly written script. Satish Kaushik is completely lovable. Mohammed Faizal Usmani shines with his witty dialogues and Tannishtha Chatterjee does her job well.In a nutshell Road Movie is not at all exciting as suggested by its title and eye catching promotional campaign. Its neither a thought provoking artistic venture nor an interesting novel project made on a different theme. Its just a tiring fruitless journey heading towards nowhere.";

	schema:reviewBody "Dev Benegal's 'Road Movie' is quite an interesting film. It has potential it has a story to tell... but falters in one section which is It lacks the power that one expects from Benegal. Sure it's good but one expected much more from this celebrated filmmaker.A restless young man played by Abhay Deol itches to escape his father's faltering hair oil business. An old truck beckons He offers to drive the antique Chevy across the desert to the sea where it has been sold to a local museum. His journey thenafter is filled with ups and downs love and hatred. 'Road Movie' starts off very well but becomes a waste post 45minutes.

	onyx:emotionText "Dev Benegal's 'Road Movie' is quite an interesting film. It has potential it has a story to tell... but falters in one section which is It lacks the power that one expects from Benegal. Sure it's good but one expected much more from this celebrated filmmaker.A restless young man played by Abhay Deol itches to escape his father's faltering hair oil business. An old truck beckons He offers to drive the antique Chevy across the desert to the sea where it has been sold to a local museum. His journey thenafter is filled with ups and downs love and hatred. 'Road Movie' starts off very well but becomes a waste post 45minutes. The Yashpal Sharma track looks forced by the screenplay and even the climax leaves a lot to be desired.Coming directly to the acting department Abhay Deol is superb.

No doubt I may have missed the cinematography of the desert landscape on my TV screen. But I would like to comment on the content not on the visuals.I feel that the director has tried to give a message to the audience through this production. That one should not take things at face value. In fact I was reminded of Ancken's Seraphim Falls in which characters appear and sequences occur which are totally surreal and unreal. But entertaining nonetheless. And a big question mark remains at the end when the viewer is left wondering as to what the hell happened? For a change this movie deals with the stark desolation and horrors of Rajasthan rather than focusing on its forts and princes with their decadent lifestyles. But there are also many unanswered questions possibly deliberate. Or possibly just foolish errors. For example the truck guzzling petrol guessing from its model traverses the huge state without requiring a single filling of fuel. The protagonist is not well off but he has no problems with money according to his declarations. He embarks on a road journey but does not stock up on food or water or even a road map neither he or his family think of this. Was the hero a retard? The truck is his fathers' friend's. So was it gifted together with its content of film reels and projection equipment? Was it sold off in the end? For running the films he takes electricity from the police station. But subsequently he shows films in the middle of the desert. Where did the power supply come from? Was the fair an illusion? If it was how did the hero earn Rs 45000 from the poor desert inhabitants? These and many many other questions make the viewer wait for the end waiting for some answers. But the film ends with a jerk and the viewer is left hanging midair in this 'arty' movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Road Movie is director Dev Benegal's tribute to the magical realm of cinema. He is back in style after a decadelong sabbatical following Split Wide Open to show the world how much he has matured as a filmmaker. He adds his Midas touch to such an offbeat piece of celluloid giving it a western aroma only to take you on a journey that is sure to find you wherever you are and promises to take you wherever you want to go.Vishnu Abhay Deol is a young man who is sick and tired of the life that is thrust upon him. To escape from his father's hair oil business he volunteers to drive an antique 1942 Chevrolet truck across the desert to a museum only to experience the thrill of adventure amidst his humdrum life. On his way he picks up a young teastall boy Mohammed Faizal Usmani who wishes for a better life in the neighbouring city and a voluble mechanic Satish Kaushik who intends to attend a local fair. Vishnu's road trip is filled with its initial hiccups with the truck breaking down at the drop of a hat. He encounters a corrupt cop who looks for sport in Vishnu amidst the lifeless desert. This is when Vishnu discovers that his truck houses a movie projector and is a mini theatreonwheels. He trades their release with the cop who has a libido alive enough to watch blue films.The third character Vishnu picks up en route is a young gypsy woman played by Tannishtha Chatterjee of Brick Lane fame. Time and again amidst the droughtstruck desert Vishnu and his mates pass by a band of women frantically searching for water the imagery being heightened when they see Vishnu drink from a bottle. Vishnu's presence of mind is heightened in the climax when he dupes the desertdon Yashpal Sharma with his hair oil advertisement gimmick. Unfortunately after 97 minutes Road Movie comes to an abrupt halt leaving you desirous of much more.Road Movie as the name suggests is both about the life on the road and how the characters are rescued by the movies they screen. Cinematographer Michel Amathieu Paris Je T'Aime has captured the barren virgin deserts of Rajasthan with immense grandeur and lan and deserves the laurels for providing the visual imagery. The background score by Michael Brook Into the Wild is reminiscent of Gustavo Santaolalla in The Motorcycle Diaries and sets the tone of the journey. Production design by Anne Seibel Munich illuminates the sequences of the funfair amidst the dull and dry desert which sadly is just a dream sequence. The dialogues are hilarious and coupled with the comic timing of such seasoned actors trigger giggles and laughs especially those of the little boy and Satish Kaushik when he is verbose drunk on Old Monk and high on ganja!! The plot does have scope for improvement and could have been thickened. The characters could have been further developed. All but the protagonist are unnamed. Satish Kaushik is at his comic best. Tannishtha does justice to her limited screen time reaching her peak when she sings an impromptu gypsy song. Abhay Deol shows exactly why he was always who Dev Benegal had in mind. Abhay Deol has grown from strength to strength such that none of his cousins are even distant competition to him. He comes across as very disillusioned and enigmatic and unlike in Dev D he is shown in this movie searching and drinking water. His chemistry with Tannishtha seems coercive and feeble.This film is sluggishly slow just as the speed of the vehicle depicted and it requires tremendous patience to watch and appreciate it. The film conveys an important message of selfdiscovery and fulfillment albeit it loses direction. Road Movie is sure to tug at the strings of your heart and is a must watch for all ages. So get on the road and watch this movie. I am going with a 3.5 stars out of 5.Joydeep Roy for MuvieMadlyDeeply.com".

	schema:reviewBody "The Sky Pilot was an important film for director King Vidor in 1921 along with Love Never Dies which also survives. I was asked for a copy of this film and barely remembered it so I rewatched yesterday.Vidor had been directing films left and right from the midteens but by 1921 he had started to develop his own pace and visual style. He was also well enough established that he started getting good stories and good actors.The Sky Pilot slang for preacher arrives from Montreal in the Canadian Rockies where he attempts to set up a parish. The greenhorn John Bowers is befriended by a local ranch foreman David Butler who tries to help him set up shop in the local saloon. It's a disaster and Bowers is run out of town.But the men reconcile and Butler gets Bowers a job on the ranch where both men are rivals for Colleen Moore. There's lots of trouble from a local bandit and his men but after Bowers is rescued from a spectacular fall off a gorge bridge things settle down until Moore falls off her horse during a stampede and is crippled.The winter scenes are quite stunning so that when Bowers opens his church apparently built by Butler but is burned down the flaming church against the fresh snowfall is memorable. As is the redemptive ending.The use of location shooting is terrific here for Vidor. This is also the only time Moore worked for Vidor although they were lifelong friends. Indeed Moore was part of Vidor's quest to solve the murder mystery surrounding William Desmond Taylor. Vidor and Moore planned to produce a film about this famous murder but it never happened.Bowers is very good here. He was a fairly big star in silents but flopped in a few talkie attempts. His final film was a western in 1931. He committed suicide by walking into the Pacific in 1936 an event that supposedly influence the ending of A Star Is Born in 1937. He couldn't find work in Hollywood despite having appeared in more than 90 films.Moore has a smallish role here but just a few years from her careermaking role in Flaming Youth it's easy to see why she became one of the biggest stars of the silent era.The real surprise here is David Butler an actor I'm not familiar with. Never really a star he made his last film in 1929 and then turned to directing full time. He directed until the late 60s. He's excellent here as the caring cowboy and is in many ways the center of this film.My one gripe is that this film released on VHS by Critics Coice Video contains an annoying music track by David Schimmel on which he hums and sings several times. The churchysounding music is OK in and of itself but there's something innately wrong with a silent film accompanied by singing.".

	schema:reviewBody "The tiny western settlement of Swan Creek is assigned a preacher from Montreal idealistic John Bowers as Arthur Wellington Moore. He arrives on a dry day with an open umbrella and a mule. Since the Godless community has no place to worship Mr. Bowers sets up his first sermon at the local wateringhole. In the saloon Bowers meets rowdy ranch foreman David Butler as Bill Hendricks. The men have a wild brawl and wind up wrestling on the floor. It turns out to be classic malebonding. Afterwards Bowers gently wipes the blood from Mr. Hendricks' cheek and all is forgiven...Shortly thereafter when Hendricks cradles Bowers head after taking him to bed you wonder what is going on between the men director King Vidor shoots this like it's a love scene. The men look like they're about to kiss. Probably they're just dealing with some latent issues. Both also seem attracted to pretty Colleen Moore as Gwen. Sporting her preflapper Mary Pickford hair Ms. Moore is the most fetching female on film.

	onyx:emotionText "The tiny western settlement of Swan Creek is assigned a preacher from Montreal idealistic John Bowers as Arthur Wellington Moore. He arrives on a dry day with an open umbrella and a mule. Since the Godless community has no place to worship Mr. Bowers sets up his first sermon at the local wateringhole. In the saloon Bowers meets rowdy ranch foreman David Butler as Bill Hendricks. The men have a wild brawl and wind up wrestling on the floor. It turns out to be classic malebonding. Afterwards Bowers gently wipes the blood from Mr. Hendricks' cheek and all is forgiven...Shortly thereafter when Hendricks cradles Bowers head after taking him to bed you wonder what is going on between the men director King Vidor shoots this like it's a love scene. The men look like they're about to kiss. Probably they're just dealing with some latent issues. Both also seem attracted to pretty Colleen Moore as Gwen. Sporting her preflapper Mary Pickford hair Ms. Moore is the most fetching female on film. She suffers a mishap but Christian love may provide a cure...For those unfamiliar with the old titular term or the 1968 antiwar anthem Sky Pilot by Eric Burdon  the Animals The Sky Pilot is a minister who provides guidance for your trip to heaven.

In a series of just two films there is a 5050 chance that Scanner Cop II will be better than it's predecessor Scanner Cop 1994 right? Well unfortunately even with those odds it isn't although having said that it's not too far behind it  it's still a fairly decent way to pass 90 odd minutes. The script by Mark Sevi moves along at a nice enough pace but feels very similar to the original. Also like the original Scanner Cop II is as much a police thriller as horror  the decision to take Samuel out of uniform  into plain clothes as a detective was a bad one in my opinion this is just another cop in a leather jacket running around lifted straight from any number of 80's  90's low budget action films. The uniform gave Samuel a certain vulnerability  distinctiveness which is missing here as he uses his powers to sort situations out like freeing hostages  in the process defusing a bomb by simply staring at it. In the original Samuel had conflicts with himself  was a well developed character with more depth than usual but in this he is just your average 'savetheday' action hero with a bad hair cut.Director Barnett takes over from Pierre David who acts as producer here he directs with competence but Scanner Cop II has no real style to it. The special makeup effects could have been better  the gore is somewhat restrained there are some splitting bubbling pulsating skin effects  melted bodies but little else except for the obligatory head explosion which you have to wait until the last five minutes to see  frankly it isn't worth the wait  doesn't even come close to the fabulous exploding head from Cronenberg's original.With a very healthy sounding budget of about 4000000 Scanner Cop II should look a hell of a lot better than it does I mean 4 big ones is a lot of cash for a film such as this I really can't see where the money went. No major stars no big action scenes very limited special effects  only one split second head explosion? You tell me where the money went. The acting was OK  Kilpatrick has a certain intensity  makes for a good villain am I the only one who thinks he looks like Michael Ironside? but Quinn definitely isn't all guns blazing action hero material.Scanner Cop II is a decent enough way to pass 90 odd minutes but just don't expect any kind of classic worth a watch especially if you enjoyed the original.".

But other than that the movie was very entertaining in my opinion.  Carl Volkin played by the intimidatinglooking Pat Kilpatrick is an escaped criminal scanner on the loose trying to become the most powerful scanner in the world.  He accomplishes this by draining the life force of various scanners around the city resulting in some bizarre meltingdeath sequences.

There's a few coollooking facecontorting illusion sequences and a head explosion in the end of course.

But other than that the movie was very entertaining in my opinion.  Carl Volkin played by the intimidatinglooking Pat Kilpatrick is an escaped criminal scanner on the loose trying to become the most powerful scanner in the world.  He accomplishes this by draining the life force of various scanners around the city resulting in some bizarre meltingdeath sequences.

Unfortunately this entry in the series while not really awful is disappointing all the same. I will admit that the movie never has a boring moment and it boasts some good makeup effects and other gory moments. Despite this the movie comes across as quite cheap at times with shabby sets or locations that look like they were shot in abandoned warehouses. There is also a subplot involving the hero's long lost mother that seems awkwardly tacked on and is hardly worked on for the most part. The biggest problem is that much of the movie seems to be repeating itself with the villain doing the same things over and over.

His Captain Jack Bitters Forster supports him but Staziak is having some personal issues as he's trying to find his mother. Towards this end he's enlisted the help of fellow scanner Carrie Goodart who runs the TransNeural Resource Center sort of a nonprofit group by and for scanners. But a new threat looms in the form of Karl Volkin an evil malevolent scanner who's going around the city killing other scanners in his quest to be the ultimate scanner. Like a vampire he feeds off their power and is growing more and more strong by the day. Looks like it's time for the ultimate showdown Staziak vs. Volkin in a mindmelting duel to the death. Who will prevail? We liked Scanner Cop II or Scanners The Showdown as the VHS we viewed has it. As a scifi sequel we went in expecting the worst. But it's really not bad. There are a lot of interesting scannerbased ideas such as using scanning power for good or evil the vampiric scanner and the scanner killing other scanners for scanner domination. Did we use the word scanner enough yet? There are other ideas woven into the plot as well which helped immensely. If there are ideas that are reasonably wellthoughtout it's hard to go totally wrong and thankfully the writers knew that so they developed certain thoughts. It's all perfect for the video stores and pay cable outfits of the 90's. On top of that there are some cool and gory effects making Scanner Cop II better than expected.Patrick Kilpatrick usually plays a baddie and here you get to see him at the height of his evil powers. Robert Forster does almost a sitdown role but he adds color and professionalism to the proceedings. Kane Hodder and Jewel Shepard appear in small roles but the true star of the show isn't Quinn it's a man we think is named Julian Neil but we're not sure who plays Kidnapper Leader. This bad guy who is not important to the plot at all gives an insanely over the top performance. He has a highly comical Muppet voice and he just about steals the movie with his brief screen time. This guy should have gone far.We have a screener copy not to be confused with a scanner copy of this on VHS from Republic Pictures. In a packaging move we haven't seen anywhere else there's a gatefold flap that unfolds from the left hand side of the box. We don't know if it reached stores with this added value piece. It might be just for the screener or perhaps just for the Canada VHS which is where it was released as Scanners The Showdown. We thought this was worth mentioning because it was so unusual.In all Scanner Cop II was way better than we thought it would be.For more action insanity drop by www.comeuppancereviews.com".

After some starting problems the first Jamaican bobsledding team is formed and heads for Calgary.

It depends not at all on aggressive nationalism it couldn't afford to with a constituency of 2.6 million and people of all countries are free to participate in the Jamaicans' perfectly reasonable patriotism.  Probably even the Swiss whose bobsled team comes across as more than a trifle arrogant.  Nor is there any of that worship of a particular sport that makes baseball movies so unendurable for people outside of North America Cuba and Japan.  Not that I have any evidence that baseball movies are popular in Cuba or Japan.There isn't any powerofpositivethinking psychobabble either  at least it doesn't dominate.  The four Jamaican bobsledders are separate people with different goals and ways of thinking.  The coach played beautifully by John Candy who proves that he can act without playing the clown doesn't ram a particular ideology down his players' throats.  I doubt that any sports film has a more civilised and reasonable coach.It comes down to this we are given a reason to care about the characters unrelated to nationality and we are given a story that's worth following even if we would never follow the sport itself.  The clichs are fewer than usual and never offensive.  It's a sweet film and I doubt there's more than a handfull of people who could resist its charm.".

	schema:headline " One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made";
	schema:reviewBody "It might not be historically accurate  and you know what some of the best films aren't  but I believe hand on heart that Cool Runnings is one of greatest films ever made.Cool Runnings is absolutely hilarious with a wonderful blend of slapstick comedy one liners colourful characters and absurdity however its comic achievements are well documented and for this reason I will take them as read.Cool Runnings is an exploration of a number of the weightiest themes a film can deal with such as racism poverty pride passion forgiveness and selfbelief. Cool Runnings tackles all of these themes headon without losing an ounce of its charm humour or familyfun.A superbly played Joseph Gruel is the prime embodiment of the racism the Jamaicans face on the hill and his story is very moving. So too is the voyage of selfdiscovery and forgiveness embarked on by disgraced coach Erv Blitzer John Candy. The team themselves are a wonderful advert for teamwork and the little island of Jamaica. Each one is wise bold in the face of their respective adversity and has an intriguing story to tell.The ending of Cool Runnings also ranks as one of the greatest. It masterfully avoids the backslapping onedimensional and predictable ending it looks to be approaching a trap that so many other similar 'feelgood' films fall into. Instead Cool Runnings brings together all of the themes that have been explored in one emotionally charged final scene.99 will disagree with something I have written above. But I first watched the film 15 years ago and it has stayed with me ever since. I have watched it around 100 times now and I still shed a tear at the end...no other film has ever brought me even close to that.If you take nothing else from this review. Watch Cool Runnings. It is so much better than the cleverarsed blockbusterbiased critics will have you believe. Forget the highly forgettable cheese like Remember the Titans The Mighty Ducks and all the rest. Pull up a chair get the phone on divert and sit back and enjoy the only 'feel good' film worth watching.".

	schema:headline " Pretty fun sports movie";
	schema:reviewBody "This one of those familyoriented sports movies that I have fond memories of from my elementary school days. Off the top of my head I can name The Air Up There Iron Will and the Mighty Ducks in this category as well. They weren't masterpieces per se but they were pleasant fun and sometimes inspirational. The thing about a sports movie is that the passion that a dedicated athlete feels is usually something that can translate itself visually on screen. For instance if you were to make a movie about a passionate chess player it's not as exciting to watch the final climactic moment when the hero checkmates his opponent as it is to watch a game winning shot. What I'm getting to is that one of the draws of a sports movie is being exposed to that passion and desire in our hero. In this case the hero is Jamaican sprinter Derice Bannock who was accidentally tripped during the Olympic trials but is determined to make the Olympics anyway. Since track's no longer an option for him he figures why not start the nation's first bobsledding team since a bobsled team hasn't been fielded yet. He also is encouraged in the sport by the fact that a friend of his dad happens to be a bobsled coach and he might be able to help. The bobsled coach declines citing as his reasons that there's no ice in Jamaica that there's not enough time to train that Derice doesn't have 3 other people which is needed to form a team that he doesn't even think Derice was a good runner and that he doesn't even like coaching anymore.Nevertheless Derice manages to convince the coach and get three teammates consisting of his best friend the guy who tripped him in the trials and another sprinter who got tripped in the trials along with him. This is one of the better sources of entertainment in the film because the dynamics of this team are formed under such unusual circumstance. For instance Yul one of the two who got tripped during the trials still hasn't forgiven Junior the tripper.The film very cleverly finds a balance between the inspirational element of this story and the humor. Essentially Derice the most determined member of the group is a person who we come to admire for his persistence and maybe that's why it's a good family film someone kids can look up to. The humor comes from Derice's friend Sanka who says a lot of funny stuff. This really is the only way the movie could work because if Derice was funny and told jokes you wouldn't take him seriously and if Sanka was more determined about winning his jokes would sound out of context. The two guys in the middle of the bobsled both metaphorically and literally add to the film in their own ways but on a smaller scale. The late John Candy plays the coach and fills the part well. The other notable thing about the film is it's ending. Provided this is your first viewing it really does a lot for the movie. I won't give it away but the ending is unpredictable yet equally satisfying something I don't often see. However I wonder since this was filmed only five years after the Calgary Olympics how familiar would viewers have been with the actual event that inspired the film. If they knew the story of the '88 Jamaican bobsled team in its entirety than the impact of that ending would have been lost.".

However don't expect to see a ridiculous comedy with no content either because it still has a good story and plenty of emotions and excitement to offer. I reward this movie with an 810.".

But unlike all the other sports stories where the team always kicks but in a glorious win this is different. It also is fun to watch because of the Jamaican dudes speaking like surfers and saying man all the time. So see this movie. Vote for it and try to get it onto the top 250.Peace Man!".

But unlike all the other sports stories where the team always kicks but in a glorious win this is different. It also is fun to watch because of the Jamaican dudes speaking like surfers and saying man all the time. So see this movie. Vote for it and try to get it onto the top 250.Peace Man!";

Doug and John Candy going for Olympic gold in the bobsled.  I must admit I didn't know previous to seeing the movie that Candy was an expert on bobsleding although I can easily see why his severe obesity would allow him to be good at sitting on a sled and traveling down an ice covered path at an incredible speed.  Candy should have just had Doug E. Doug hang out with him for a year and put him on the same diet.  Plus you got to figure with all the pot Mr. Doug was smoking he would have the munchies constantly. Now Cool Runnings had all the makings of the greatest movie of all time. It had an Oscar winning cast Jack Nicholson DeNio Pacino Helen Hunt Vin Diesel etc. it had beautiful settings and costume design a great musical score with such hits as here is something you can't believe Jamaica we have a bobsled team... and a great director in someone who I don't know. Actually I really don't remember much of this movie.  I know I saw it though maybe even two or three times.  I also remember that Freshman year in college Siegel refused to study for an Econ exam because Fox was showing Cool Runnings.  Why Fox was showing this I have no idea.  Perhaps as a joke?Anyway I highly recommend that everyone see 'Cool Runnings' if you haven't already done so.  It is one of the last times one can see John Candy.  Well unless of course you want to dig up his grave.  But that's kind of gross plus I assume he's all decomposed and he is much funnier as a fat guy. Actually while you're at it rent 'Who's harry Crumb.'  That movie is awesome.  Altieri also really likes it and he looks like a female American Indian.".

That said the system of government and policing portrayed comes across as so amazingly inept and awful that it's almost like something straight out of a nightmarish scifi dystopia.If I had to compare it to other movies it comes off as a cross between Brazil Office Space and Full Metal Jacket. Not for the weak of stomach and you may find yourself greatly disagreeing with the ideals of various groups portrayed which I believe is part of the point but I would be enormously surprised if this movie doesn't make you think and give you something to talk about.".

The lives of Capitain Nascimento Neto and Matias are entwined along the next months first in the tough training period and then in action against drug dealers. Nascimento believes that Neto could be his substitute but his impulsive attitudes jeopardize his choice. Later the intelligent Matias seems to be the correct choice but he needs to prove that he has heart.Tropa de Elite is the most impressive and realistic movie I have ever seen about the police forces in Rio de Janeiro and the role of the society in Brazil. In a city surrounded by more than seven hundred slums actually lands without law and ruled by drug lords this movie depicts the corruption of dirty policemen the incorrect behavior of part of the society and the importance of the BOPE a team of well trained men that can be compared to the American SWAT. The narrative in off of Captain Nascimento follows his saga showing an obstinate man divided between his professionalism and love for his career and his family Neto an impulsive and honest military policeman but not smart to be a leader and Matias who is studying in law school and is very intelligent and also honest but is not totally committed with his responsibilities of policeman. The story is so realistic that seems to be a documentary with scenes very well choreographed. The direction of Jos Padilha is simply outstanding using a magnificent screenplay and excellent actors and actresses. In an inevitable comparison with Cidade de Deus City of God these movies complement each other. Cidade de Deus discloses the lives of criminals and Tropa de Elite of policemen and part of the society. This movie should be nominated to the Oscar but unfortunately what the Academy usually selects does not correspond to the best of the cinema.

Of course there might not be that many guns blazing in reality but I'd reckon this isn't very far off.We feel the pain the lack of morale and the despair and hopelessness. Photography is spot on the acting is both fantastic and realistic. Tropa de Elite never went into the big theaters here in Denmark which is rather unfortunate since it's a true gem. Instead we get loads of mainstream crap. Not to sound arrogant I watch loads of mainstream movies too voluntarily even but it's movies like this that made me love movies as fondly as I do.Do yourself a favour. Get this on DVD. See it.

This story has emotion feelings twists action romance and even comedy for those who understand Portuguese I would say Bota ai na conta do Papa is a real funny statement.

In fact it acts as its contemporary acting as if it exists on the same universe. It demands merit in its own right though as the film is well staged like its depiction of training the elite making it an involving exercise not seen since Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket.Immersive hypnotic and engaging Tropa de Elite guarantees Padilha to be noticed on a more mainstream circuit. Previously delivering Onibus 174 also tackling the same themes of nurture and consequence as a catalyst to violence he is able to comment on sensitive themes without being too preachy and also able to wrap it in a well produced package. Film is definitely an above average fare and is essential to be experienced on the big screen just for its sound design alone.".

Prior to its theatrical release this October Tropa was seen by an estimated record 11 million people who bought pirate DVD copies or illegally downloaded it on the net the biggest Brazilian boxoffice success in the last 25 years was 2 Filhos de Francisco with 55 million tickets sold.The reaction is passionately polarized some call it the best Brazilian movie since City of God  a definite influence here in the cinematography editing and screenplay structure with an omniscient narrator and use of mixed chronology  exposing the endemic corruption of Rio de Janeiro's police force and the unorthodox methods used by BOPE the selfcalled incorruptible elite squad of Rio's military police force created in 1978 and inspired by the U.S. SWAT that include torture and shootfirstasklater modus operandi in the ultraviolent evergrowing drug war in Rio's favelas. Others have publicly attacked it as fascist in its glorification of BOPE its sadistic depiction of torture and the reductionist simpleminded vision of the complex issues involving violence drugspolice corruption in Rio. Director Jos Padilha and cowriter Rodrigo Pimentel a former BOPE captain who left the squad for disagreeing with its praxis had collaborated in the extraordinary Bus 174 a multifaceted documentary on Rio's violence. In Tropa they controversially chose to give us a deliberately biased vision of the problem from the start we're stuck with one man the overstressed rebellious selfrighteous Capt Nascimento Wagner Moura in his journey into becoming a psychopathic sadist and hotblooded killer who believes drug traffic is caused by the druggie middleclass bourgeoisie as if the poor didn't do drugs! and claims the solution is to kill all traffickers. To Nascimento corruption is abominable torture isn't.Nascimento is the film's absolute protagonist narrator commentator and truthpuker. In his mind all nonelite policemen are corrupt and incompetent all charity NGOs in the favelas are coverup fraudulent enterprises all college students are useless doublefaced potheads and legal procedures are an inefficient waste of time. He's nearer to the traffickers' violent revengebased lawless ethics than he's ever able to realize.There's nothing wrong with shooting people if you shoot the right people used to say Clint Eastwood's Dirty Harry back in the 1970s and it could well be Capt. Nascimento's motto. He's a vigilante in uniform in the tradition of the executioners played by Eastwood Bronson Stallone and 24 Hours' Jack Bauer he's the heir to the 1970s' Brazilian military regime knowhow on torture. Yet the film tries hard at humanizing Nascimento his wife's pregnant his marriage falters he's moved to tears by the suffering of a mother who lost her son in the traffic war he's in medication for his panic attacks. AND he's trying to save the POPE's life no less! All the other characters are just rough sketches or caricatures. The one character who might be the classical narratorobserver like BuscapRocket in City of God is the idealist Foucaultreading aspiring police officer Mathias though it's hard to believe an aspiring officer could afford to attend Rio's most expensive law school. But Mathias too is finally coopted by the brainwashing FullMetalJacketlike BOPE training that changes him into an amoral beast fueled with rage.Padilha says he wanted to portray Nascimento as a monster and that audiences who are hailing Nascimento as a hero and BOPE as a model institution have caught him by surprise  oh really? Padilha is probably being sarcastic naive or silly everybody knows movie vigilante cops have been consistently idolized the world over and co writer Pimentel has publicly disagreed stating the Tropa is clearly proBOPE. The graphic sadistic scenes of torture  supposedly meant to inspire disgust  make the delight of a large vigilanteminded part of the audience. And Wagner Moura's extraordinary scary performance as Nascimento is unsettling we can't dismiss him as a stupid fascist the way we dismissed inarticulate stiffs like Bronson Seagal or Stallone. The fact is that there's now a BOPE cultfollowing with BOPE's logo a skull pierced by pistols and knives reproduced on tshirts and underwear BOPE officers being cheered in the streets in their armored glory and young kids from all social classes mimicking the film's baginthehead torture as a new bullying style. Militarists and pacifists will hardly change sides after the watching the film militarists will have multiple orgasms and pacifists will cringe in horror. The filmmakers aren't interested in seriously discussing the drug issue legalization is not even mentioned as an option. Nor in exposing Rio's drug traffic's multifingered interconnections the zilliondollar highly organized international business involving farmers moneywashing executives chemistry labs gunrunners bankers politicians accountants lawyers transport systems etc. Nor in showing the real victims the majority of the favela inhabitants who aren't involved in the drug business but have to live under its rules mere extras whose fate in movies and in real life is to be used humiliated segregated or worse woundedkilled by random bullets from BOTH policemen and traffickers. Tropa is a mustsee film but it's misleading and entrapping by opting for an open what would YOU do? ending probably influenced by the breathtaking finale of Paradise Now the filmmakers demands us to take sides about a very VERY complex issue they've shown us only ONE angle of. Tropa is cinematically dazzling but so physically and ideologically nauseating you'll need an antidote  be sure to also watch the faceted influential documentary Notcias de uma Guerra Particular and be aware of many other angles to a terrible reality that plagues not only Rio but most of Third World's chaotic noman'sland way outof control big cities.".

That's the way the director Padilha's sees this fight which is not entirely true. Although it shows how the corruption of the Military Police Force works out in Brazil how the system is used against itself and how the bureaucracy makes everything so difficult that it's almost impossible for honest people to deal with their own personal issues without dealing with corruption. And by the way that's entirely true.The baseline of the movie is the story of Nascimento's who is the captain of BOPE Special Forces Operations Battalion which can be compared to SWAT. Nascimento needs a replacement and he needs to find the right person someone who has all of the qualities the job demands. Two guys come up to be this person but none of them have all it takes. Neto has the attitude the heart but he's not smart and centered as he's best buddy Matias. The only thing they have in common which is mandatory for the job is the honesty and the will of changing things for the better.The movie has all the elements that makes us go to a movie theater. It has a storyline it has action thriller and it has a great performance from the cast all of them.If you are planning to spend your money in another blockbuster don't do it! Give a chance to this great movie that explores the WAR that we from Rio de Janeiro have to deal with everyday.

	schema:reviewBody "Remember Cidade de Deus City of God? Well I think that if you saw at least one time that 2002 film is for sure that you remember it so here is a new film that works on the same level comes and is about the same place of course and that you will never forget. With this sort of introduction you may think that Tropa de Elite is another Cidade de Deus but now from the side of the police and in a way you will be right but at the same time you will not because Tropa de Elite tells a story that involves and shows different points of views acts and the most important thing how different parts of the society works in a delicate but real problem in Brasil. That story has in Capito Nascimento Wagner Moura our narrator and the experimented one who knows how everything works in the criminal side of Rio and who works in the BOPE Batalho de Operaes Policiais Especiais the elite group of the Military Police. The situation in the film is the visit of the pope Juan Pablo II to Rio in 1997 and we are going the story before this visit through the eyes of different parts of the society the police the drug dealers and people from the favelas part of the high class young and of course the BOPE. The friends Neto Caio Junqueira and Andr Andr Ramiro are the other important characters in our story. They are new in the business and because of their honesty soon they will understand how everything works inside the police and how they will end fighting not only against criminals but against the entire police system where everybody steals from anywhere. With Andr a part of high class young will enter to the story when he start to study at one of the best universities of Rio but of course first they don't know who is really Andr so they can act in their regular way when the party time begins or when they visit the favelas in order to satisfy their addiction and their own drug business. Now you can suppose how this can end with corrupt cops making business with drug dealers and two honest cops trying to stop that and without real hopes. Here is when the BOPE enters the elite that is respected by the drug dealers and the one that the police goes when they can't deal with a situation inside the favelas which is always. And here we have a fantastic character study with our narrator. The situation is that he is going to be father and his beloved retirement of the BOPE is near but only if he can find a perfect substitute. Apart of this we have the terrific and probably realistic view to the BOPE itself showing the impressive training in order to be a Skull and their philosophy that confirms that the BOPE is only for honest people with real skills and desires to end with the crime so weak and corrupt cops MUST and will stay outside. Well the great story makes me write more about it than any other thing but is easy to describe the rest because is perfect the setting the impressive camera work I believe that some scenes are stronger than any of Cidade de Deus the direction the research although the film is based on the book Elite de Tropa and of course the powerful and for me unknown cast in Mexico the Cinema of Brasil as any other except the one from Hollywood is difficult to see on theaters or to get on DVD so personally and sadly this is only the second film from Brasil that I have seen but hell I love both a lot. Conclusion Tropa de Elite won the Golden Bear the top prize at the Berlin Film Festival 2008 and even I'm not the kind of viewer who cares about prizes that sometimes are unfair I do know how an important prize help in the distribution of a film but is true that if a film won at the most famous festivals Venice Berlin Cannes Toronto etc but is not at the Oscars the case of Tropa de Elite that film will not have any or the same attention in Mexico and of course in the US. So knowing that is very difficult to see a film from Brasil on theaters and knowing the amazing quality of Tropa de Elite is a shame that is not having a response in my country and is far of the popularity of Cidade de Deus back in 2003. Anyway the only thing that really matters is the fact that Tropa de Elite is by far the best film on theaters right now in Mexico City the best film that I have seen recently and probably the very best that I have seen this year. So this film is the film to catch this year when it arrives to your city. A MAGNIFICENT PICTURE!".

	onyx:emotionText "Remember Cidade de Deus City of God? Well I think that if you saw at least one time that 2002 film is for sure that you remember it so here is a new film that works on the same level comes and is about the same place of course and that you will never forget. With this sort of introduction you may think that Tropa de Elite is another Cidade de Deus but now from the side of the police and in a way you will be right but at the same time you will not because Tropa de Elite tells a story that involves and shows different points of views acts and the most important thing how different parts of the society works in a delicate but real problem in Brasil. That story has in Capito Nascimento Wagner Moura our narrator and the experimented one who knows how everything works in the criminal side of Rio and who works in the BOPE Batalho de Operaes Policiais Especiais the elite group of the Military Police. The situation in the film is the visit of the pope Juan Pablo II to Rio in 1997 and we are going the story before this visit through the eyes of different parts of the society the police the drug dealers and people from the favelas part of the high class young and of course the BOPE. The friends Neto Caio Junqueira and Andr Andr Ramiro are the other important characters in our story. They are new in the business and because of their honesty soon they will understand how everything works inside the police and how they will end fighting not only against criminals but against the entire police system where everybody steals from anywhere. With Andr a part of high class young will enter to the story when he start to study at one of the best universities of Rio but of course first they don't know who is really Andr so they can act in their regular way when the party time begins or when they visit the favelas in order to satisfy their addiction and their own drug business. Now you can suppose how this can end with corrupt cops making business with drug dealers and two honest cops trying to stop that and without real hopes. Here is when the BOPE enters the elite that is respected by the drug dealers and the one that the police goes when they can't deal with a situation inside the favelas which is always. And here we have a fantastic character study with our narrator. The situation is that he is going to be father and his beloved retirement of the BOPE is near but only if he can find a perfect substitute. Apart of this we have the terrific and probably realistic view to the BOPE itself showing the impressive training in order to be a Skull and their philosophy that confirms that the BOPE is only for honest people with real skills and desires to end with the crime so weak and corrupt cops MUST and will stay outside.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie will certainly be seen as another perhaps good thriller by most of the non Brazilian audience. But the movie is not just that in fact it's way more than that. Several good thriller movies plenty of violence and shootings scenes have been produced in the last couple decades. But one thing is to inject a lot of money to make a movie on gratuitous violence and rely on special effects to make it get good critics which then bring the desired money that moves the cinema industry. This is Hollywood and this is definitely not what Elite Squad is about. The movie has raised and keeps raising important social questions among Brazilian citizens. The way the director tells the story without taking part in any side is genial contrary to most north American movies there's no good or bad guy in the story the situation got to a point where things simply are the way they are. No particular point of view prevails and the viewer gets out of the movie with mixed sensations about what to think about all he sees. Victims of Brazil violence praise Captain Nascimento character to a level of national hero whereas he ends by being hated by many others who dispraise his ignorance on human rights. There's also a thesis in the movie sustaining that all the violence is fruit of drug commerce which would exist because the middle and high Brazilian classes buy the drugs to sustain their hedonistic life style. These are the same people that frequent movie theaters in Brazil create the public opinion and constitute the Brazilian intellectual society. Therefore  independently of the thesis being right or wrong  the movie somewhat also points the finger to the audience and blames it for all the violence. I think this is also genial but one has to live there to really feel the whip of this blaming again one must have a bit of Brazil culture to really appreciate this movie. While you sit with your popcorn and hope for watching a good thriller bear in mind that the violence you are seeing in Elite Squad is happening at this very moment and this is what distinguishes this movie from other violent movies you saw.".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Elite Squad";
	schema:reviewBody "I just love a good ol cops and robbers movie and Elite Squad shows that it indeed is a generous cut above the rest and along the way had snagged the Golden Bear at this year's Berlin Film Festival. If you're in for some gritty looking no holds barred movie that reflects the dangerous occupation of honest cops making a living in what's technically a war zone with the criminals then look no further than this movie.The movie works itself on many levels having its narrative flow giving equal opportunity to each of its subject matter. On the surface it looks very much like Hollywood's SWAT but only much better with its induction and training program where rookies get groomed from the mediocre to the cream of the crop in their attempts to join the BOPE and on another level it tells of the friendship between two newcomers to the police force where they're face with 3 options in an organization where corruption Is rampant  join in turn a blind eye or wage war. An additional level which held the movie throughout its different subplots is that of the headache when it comes to management succession.When you're doing a good job you find it difficult to either let go or if you've come to terms with the inevitable of leaving the job that you like finding someone appropriate to take over. It's like a father who intrinsically almost always disapproves of their daughter's boyfriends. Captain Nascimento Wagner Moura has this dilemma being the leader of the crack Alpha team he found that for the good of his family he has to leave the highly dangerous job where death is just around the corner each time they go on their missions. But in order to do so and to ensure his men have someone able and competent to step up and replace him he has to find new blood.Thus the story of two rookies Neto Caio Junqueira and Andre Matias Andre Ramiro who are best of friends but whose characters are on opposite ends of the spectrum. Neto's a hothead and acts on impulse qualities not befitting of team players but you cannot discount his courage. Andre's a lot more calculative and restraint but in dwelling too much on decision making might not be able to act decisively. These were the two options best left for Nascimento given the rest are either corrupt or inept to have made it through the tough training.Between Neto and Andre the latter has a lot more pathos crafted into his character such as his ambition in being a lawyer after his uniformed stint and this character was also based loosely on the consultant for the movie. What I particularly liked his character was how he subconsciously turned into the stereotypical view the citizens have of the cops  of being violent unreasonable and corrupt that save for the latter he unwittingly becomes transformed into that mold a disillusioned turn against his idealistic viewpoint of what a cop stands for of becoming one of many misunderstood honest cops.The BOPE are no angels and are quite heavy handed in their ways though one could also argue that extreme methods and operations are totally justifiable when in a war zone dealing with criminals armed to the teeth who have no hesitation to shoot first and to kill. Simon Yam might have left a memorable impression with his repetitive bitch slapping of a gangster at an arcade in PTU but here such slapping gets ten times worse with the hairdryer effect too. The BOPE officers knows no gentle negotiation techniques with arsenals such as the use of deadly force interrogation through the use of incessant slaps and the plastic bag for suffocation and if the suspect still doesn't crack there's still the good old broomstick shoved into the rear.Action junkies would find that Elite Squad has no lack of set action pieces though you might find yourself clamouring for more. These guys are highly trained and bears no qualms in exercising deadly force with no remorse and when their skull end knives emblem comes rolling around criminals flee in fear. Given that this is set in the gritty streets of Rio de Janeiro the shaky cam seems impossible not to be utilized so if you're those who feel nauseous at the erratic movement of the camera you might want to take the necessary precautions.For me it's not often always to have a movie like this work on all fronts from acting to action to a tightly designed and layered narrative. If I were to recommend a movie about cops then Elite Squad would join the ranks of personal favourites like PTU and Heat. Highly recommended!".

If you're in for some gritty looking no holds barred movie that reflects the dangerous occupation of honest cops making a living in what's technically a war zone with the criminals then look no further than this movie.The movie works itself on many levels having its narrative flow giving equal opportunity to each of its subject matter. On the surface it looks very much like Hollywood's SWAT but only much better with its induction and training program where rookies get groomed from the mediocre to the cream of the crop in their attempts to join the BOPE and on another level it tells of the friendship between two newcomers to the police force where they're face with 3 options in an organization where corruption Is rampant  join in turn a blind eye or wage war. An additional level which held the movie throughout its different subplots is that of the headache when it comes to management succession.When you're doing a good job you find it difficult to either let go or if you've come to terms with the inevitable of leaving the job that you like finding someone appropriate to take over. It's like a father who intrinsically almost always disapproves of their daughter's boyfriends. Captain Nascimento Wagner Moura has this dilemma being the leader of the crack Alpha team he found that for the good of his family he has to leave the highly dangerous job where death is just around the corner each time they go on their missions. But in order to do so and to ensure his men have someone able and competent to step up and replace him he has to find new blood.Thus the story of two rookies Neto Caio Junqueira and Andre Matias Andre Ramiro who are best of friends but whose characters are on opposite ends of the spectrum. Neto's a hothead and acts on impulse qualities not befitting of team players but you cannot discount his courage. Andre's a lot more calculative and restraint but in dwelling too much on decision making might not be able to act decisively. These were the two options best left for Nascimento given the rest are either corrupt or inept to have made it through the tough training.Between Neto and Andre the latter has a lot more pathos crafted into his character such as his ambition in being a lawyer after his uniformed stint and this character was also based loosely on the consultant for the movie. What I particularly liked his character was how he subconsciously turned into the stereotypical view the citizens have of the cops  of being violent unreasonable and corrupt that save for the latter he unwittingly becomes transformed into that mold a disillusioned turn against his idealistic viewpoint of what a cop stands for of becoming one of many misunderstood honest cops.The BOPE are no angels and are quite heavy handed in their ways though one could also argue that extreme methods and operations are totally justifiable when in a war zone dealing with criminals armed to the teeth who have no hesitation to shoot first and to kill. Simon Yam might have left a memorable impression with his repetitive bitch slapping of a gangster at an arcade in PTU but here such slapping gets ten times worse with the hairdryer effect too. The BOPE officers knows no gentle negotiation techniques with arsenals such as the use of deadly force interrogation through the use of incessant slaps and the plastic bag for suffocation and if the suspect still doesn't crack there's still the good old broomstick shoved into the rear.Action junkies would find that Elite Squad has no lack of set action pieces though you might find yourself clamouring for more. These guys are highly trained and bears no qualms in exercising deadly force with no remorse and when their skull end knives emblem comes rolling around criminals flee in fear. Given that this is set in the gritty streets of Rio de Janeiro the shaky cam seems impossible not to be utilized so if you're those who feel nauseous at the erratic movement of the camera you might want to take the necessary precautions.For me it's not often always to have a movie like this work on all fronts from acting to action to a tightly designed and layered narrative. If I were to recommend a movie about cops then Elite Squad would join the ranks of personal favourites like PTU and Heat. Highly recommended!";

Many other movies shows us the violence and crime of Brazil first of all the pulp masterpiece City of God. The same authors of that movie in this case explore the world of police. The movie is narrated by Capt. Do Nascimento a real officer with a fake name. He's an officer in the elite military police Corp the Bope. A black uniform with a skull as its symbol two elements that remind Fascism to fight the crime. They don't make interrogations they torture suspects to obtain informations. They don't arrest they just have to kill. This Corp is employed for extreme emergency in the most dangerous areas where the police is armless. 1997 before the visit of Pope John Paul II in Brazil Bope is deployed in favelas cleaning them from criminals. The violence of special forces is needed if you want the Pope live and able to speak about peace and fraternity to Brazilian people. In that period Do Nascimento explain us the career of two Bope's volunteers agents Neto and Matias from their beginning in the regular police to their initiation in Bope's parallel universe.SPOILERS They can't make a career in the regular police because they are too honest to accept all the corruption and the compromises inside it's hierarchy. And so they have to turn violent and enter the Bope to fight the crime seriously. This is a personal trail full of sacrifices. Neto loses his life in action. Do Nascimento destroys his family. Matias loses part of his humanity his love affair his promising career in law. Finally he loses his sense of pity. And he becomes a real war machine. Those sacrifices are inevitable in an uncompromising World in which you have only to choose between criminality and repression. Because all the other rings of the chain are corrupted. Intellectuals preaches theories against an abstract repression and they don't understand the crime. Social workers are compromised with criminals violently punished by them if they don't obey and they simply can't do the good for society. Regular police the State is itself corrupted by criminals. And then only brute force with all its horrors can fight the crime. Tropa de Elite is not only a good movie about Brazil. Its message is universal. Those who repeat that in real World white and black don't exist there is only Grey are wrong. Padilha show us how criminality oblige us to make a radical choice. A choice not easy not at all.".

It shows the corruption within the police and why a special squad called BOPE was formed for stopping the violence in slums. I was astonished to see the corruption in the police and cannot imagine a situation without the BOPE.The movie greatly portrays the activities of the BOPE which is highly strategical. I liked each and every frame of their activities especially the training of the new recruits that shows why they are so tough.Storyline is a narrative type narrated by Capito NascimentoWagner Moura who is the captain of the BOPE and a very good fighter and seeks a replacement. Wagner Moura did well in this movie.I liked the portrayal of the story which starts from the middle go to the start and move on to the end of the movie.One thing i cannot understand is that the BOPE just go and shoot or threaten to kill people and raid innocent peoples house without any law. They work independently and it is portrayed in the movie that they can do whatever they want without any permission or laws. I don't think it is possible. But still i think we can justify their activities because without such powers BOPE cannot fight against those heavily armed slums.The camera and lighting's are very good.It gives a real effect to the movie.There are a few shot from the sky showing the slums which is excellent.Anyway it is a must watch movie.You will surely enjoy this movie.If you have seen City Of God and liked it i am damn sure that you will really love this movie as i do.It is like City Of God taken from the other sidelaw enforcement side.You must really watch this movie or else you are gonna miss something great.".

Written by the same screenwriter the Oscarnominated Brulio Mantovani this movie shows the seedy side of Rio de Janeiro from the cops' point of view particularly BOPE an elite squad created to intervene when regular cops can't cut it. Basically trained soldiers acting as policemen they're methodical and ruthless but apparently also the only ones really committed to cleaning up the streets. The rest of the police force are jut happy taking bribes and helping criminals whenever they can.The movie follows Captain Nascimento's search for a replacement. He's had too much has a pregnant wife and the horrors of his work are making him crazy. Wagner Moura is a revelation here. The reach of his performance will probably be lost on nonBrazilian or nonPortuguese viewers who've never seen him on dreadful soap operas. One look at the hardened melancholy weary face of Nascimento and you'd never believe this actor plays romantic leads for a living. Nascimento is not a nice man he doesn't like the choices he has to make to do his job.So he finds a way out on two new recruits Neto and Matias two disillusioned regular cops wishing to have a more active role in fighting crime. Matias is a brilliant young man studying to become a lawyer whereas the thickheaded Neto has more guts and skills with a rifle than most people. Seeing the corruption within the department they're quickly seduced by BOPE.Although not as a graphic and technically impressive as City of God this is still a pretty amazing movie. It's more conventional more straightforward but with a vision of Brazilian society as unflinching as Meirelles' masterpiece. The director Jos Padilha tackles touchy subjects here from police corruption to police brutality to the role society has in funding drug business. It's an unpleasant movie but most good movies tend to be.".

	schema:headline " A powerful tasteful and important film...";
	schema:reviewBody "I saw this at a special screening. I have not stopped thinking about it since. A emotional and powerful film that I will remember forever. I can't fault anyone who doesn't want to see this film. But please put to rest any fears that this film was made purely to turn a profit and serves no purpose.For all those who were afraid that this film would be exploitive propaganda filled Hollywood schlock I'm sorry to say that could not be farther from the truth.Though for the most part I'm still at a loss for words I'll do my best to give you a short and sweet overview. Paul Greengrass has done the seemingly impossible by making a Hollywood film about this subject everyone is afraid to touch but made it in such a way that it's hard to find fault despite everyone's initial misgivings. No 'rah rah' patriotism. No veiled political stances. No cartoonish villains. No making the enemy sympathetic. Just a brilliantly executed look at what did happen and what 'might' have happened on that fateful day.What makes it more effective is that all throughout you don't recognize any of the actors. They may as well be real people. You're never thinking to yourself 'oh that's Nicolas Cage' conscious of the fact that it's acting. And come to find out many of the air traffic controllers and military personnel are playing themselves! This makes it all the more real and draws you in and takes you back to that day.And when the passengers decide to fight back? There's no swelling of violins or slow motion shots. They don't have a rallying cry or 'lets do it for Uncle Sam' type speech to motivate everyone. No these passengers were reacting spontaneously to the situation as it played out and were acting on their survival instinct. You can't help but think how you would react in that situation and makes it all the more compelling and powerful. I won't say this film is for everyone. It IS hard to watch at times. But I'm so glad I did see it. Very cathartic in a way. And trust me this film couldn't have been done in a more professional classy way. This feels genuine of course they are going to 'profit' off it but you get the sense that the filmmakers and everyone involved poured their hearts into this project and did this to tell a story. A more dignified and heroic story I don't think I've ever seen.".

	onyx:emotionText "I saw this at a special screening. I have not stopped thinking about it since. A emotional and powerful film that I will remember forever. I can't fault anyone who doesn't want to see this film. But please put to rest any fears that this film was made purely to turn a profit and serves no purpose.For all those who were afraid that this film would be exploitive propaganda filled Hollywood schlock I'm sorry to say that could not be farther from the truth.Though for the most part I'm still at a loss for words I'll do my best to give you a short and sweet overview. Paul Greengrass has done the seemingly impossible by making a Hollywood film about this subject everyone is afraid to touch but made it in such a way that it's hard to find fault despite everyone's initial misgivings. No 'rah rah' patriotism. No veiled political stances. No cartoonish villains. No making the enemy sympathetic. Just a brilliantly executed look at what did happen and what 'might' have happened on that fateful day.What makes it more effective is that all throughout you don't recognize any of the actors. They may as well be real people. You're never thinking to yourself 'oh that's Nicolas Cage' conscious of the fact that it's acting. And come to find out many of the air traffic controllers and military personnel are playing themselves! This makes it all the more real and draws you in and takes you back to that day.And when the passengers decide to fight back? There's no swelling of violins or slow motion shots. They don't have a rallying cry or 'lets do it for Uncle Sam' type speech to motivate everyone. No these passengers were reacting spontaneously to the situation as it played out and were acting on their survival instinct. You can't help but think how you would react in that situation and makes it all the more compelling and powerful. I won't say this film is for everyone. It IS hard to watch at times. But I'm so glad I did see it. Very cathartic in a way. And trust me this film couldn't have been done in a more professional classy way.

But my curiosity got the best of me when I read several positive quotes by numerous critics outside the US. So I picked up a ticket for the 200 show.There truly are no words to describe the power of this film. The cinematography is excellent albeit a little unsteady with the shaky lens thing going on. I found that the film very much followed the reports in the 911 Commission's book as well as numerous others. They stuck to the facts and didn't add in any glorified scenes that weren't warranted. You saw the mass confusion as the various air traffic control centers tried to make sense of what was going on. You saw the events on the plane unfold as we think they did that morning. You saw ordinary Americans scared and frightened band together and try and keep that plane from hitting another target.Do we know exactly what was said between people on the planes? No. But there are survivors who had messages from loved ones on their answering machines and people who talked to them that day. The film is a little violent for my tastes but no more so than any 'Blockbuster' fictional hit out there right now and this is reality as we know it. Any discrepancies are not for me or you to decide as those secrets are buried in Pennsylvania.When it ended I've never seen a more still theater. You could hear people breathing as they pulled themselves together. This is something that happened to our nation and while it shouldn't take a movie to make people remember maybe it does. Maybe we have forgotten or chosen to ignore what happened that day falling to politics and quick to accuse people who didn't prevent it. Maybe we are against this movie because it makes us uncomfortable as all meaningful things should. Who knows? Not I.But I do know that United 93 was done in a tasteful respectful manner and many of the families affected on 911 supported its release. Who are we to say otherwise?

The languages and prayers are spliced together through a series of short scenes that depict the emotional impact that everyone was feeling.That is what this movie is about. It does not deal with conspiracy theories. In fact to do so would be more untrue than any other lie that the filmmakers have been accused of telling. This movie is about what the people around the country were feeling as the tragedy of that day unfolded. No one was sitting there thinking 'I wonder if our government was in on this?' All the people on that plane were thinking of only one thing survival. That is what this movie portrays and it addresses several themes in doing so such as god faith unity and the will to survive. These are not 'American' themes. They are human themes. The terrorists in the film are not portrayed in a horrible demonizing light. In fact the audience is ushered to feel sympathy for them in certain scenes. This movie was not made as propaganda or as a means to make money. If one simply views the film this becomes apparent. If any 911 movie is an attempt to make money I would say it is Stone's 'World Trade Center.' This film was a prayer not propaganda and not propagating falsities. It was something that came from the heart and after viewing the intense performances and believably real reactions that also becomes apparent.".

	schema:reviewBody "There are two reasons why people go to the movies. They either go to be amused entertained or distracted from the pressures of the real world it's called escapism. The other is to learn experience educate inform and face what our world is all about. Films like Schindler's List Black Hawk Down Saving Private Ryan All the President's Men and this week another film joins that list Paul Greengrass' visceral and heartbreaking United 93. Some say it's too soon for a film about 911 to come out but I disagree. I think this film is a bold and important reminder of why we're still fighting to this very day and it puts us up close and personal with our very enemy face to face. I don't think I've had such a profound and sober movie going experience like this since I saw The Passion of the Christ and when the film was over how did the audience react? Applause.United 93 is shot entirely with handheld cameras to perfectly capture the realism of the events that happened that day. The film was written and directed by British filmmaker Paul Greengrass who's previous films include 2004's blockbuster hit The Bourne Supremacy and the critically acclaimed 2002 docudrama Bloody Sunday and every frame of his vision is unflinching intense and heart pounding from it's quiet beginning to it's nervewracking and stomach turning finale. The film is never exploitive of the events of 911 and always remains respectful to the memories of those on board that fateful plane.Everybody knows the story and everybody knows how it's going to end but that never stops the film from being suspenseful. The film is pretty much void of any character development and the film never not even for a second feels like a movie it looks like a documentary. And I'm sure the way Greengrass has captured the shock confusion chaos and panic of that morning is how it must have gone down. The cameras cover the action from all perspectives from the National Air Traffic Control Center airport towers regional air traffic stations and a military command room where soldiers try to figure out if and when they have the authority to shoot down a necessary target in order to protect Washington. One of the amazing things about United 93 is its casting. The casting of the film includes a number of real life United pilots stewardesses air traffic controllers and military personnel many of them actually playing themselves. The cast of passengers are a group of largely unknowns which lends great respectability and reality. We are seeing these people for the first time with no previous knowledge of them as actors and it only works in their favor.The film opens quietly with several hijackers going through their morning rituals reading aloud from the Koran praying to God and kneeling on the floor of their hotel room and then packing their things to head to the Newark airport. And from there we are introduced to several different air traffic controller technicians and we watch as they discover that two planes have been hijacked and eventually discover that they've hit the World Trade Center. These scenes are heartbreaking and feel somewhat surreal. But it's not until United flight 93 takes off that the towers are hit and the plane is up in the air when the terrorist's plans are set into motion.The final fifteen minutes of United 93 will leave you speechless and paralyzed as a group of passengers plan to attack and over throw the terrorists and try to take back the cockpit. It's intense violent and overwhelmingly inspiring. The film is a well done memorial dedicated to those who were killed on September 11th and I truly believe that the film was done with the utmost respect to those involved and with amazing passion and sensitivity to get it right. Director Paul Greengrass does get it right and I honestly believe that it would have been impossible for it to have been done any better than it is here. United 93 is absolutely amazing and to see a better or more important film this year seems very unlikely and I think this film should be required viewing for all Americans but when they feel that they are ready for it because this is as real as it gets. This film is responsible filmmaking of the highest level and the experience is both sobering and cathartic.".

	schema:reviewBody "A most cathartic experience came over me when I viewed the much publicized United 93. At once speculative and realistic the 111minute film will surely bring back the pall of fatalistic inevitability one feels about 911 but its more defining characteristic is revealing the untapped heroism and humanism of people caught in the most malevolent of circumstances. Masterfully written and directed by Paul Greengrass this relentlessly intense movie covers that fateful morning when United Airlines Flight 93 departed Newark for San Francisco with 33 passengers and seven crew members on board.As it turns out Greengrass's heavy background in documentaries turns out to be a blessing in this treatment as he tracks the subsequent events in real time and uses either undertheradar actors or actual aviation personnel to play the reallife characters. Instead of focusing on the higher profile passengers to provide an emotional locus which a more commercial filmmaker would have done he encompasses all the passengers within the emotional purview of the film including the four hijackers who killed the pilots and took control of the plane. The key dramatic difference is that we get to know not the people but the situation at hand. Consequently we get a more realistic sense of the scale of the events that may have occurred on that flight. That's not to say it is any less devastating. In fact the last halfhour is harrowing in the most personal sense as the inevitable becomes reality.The power of the film comes from its surprisingly apolitical perspective and the inclusion of the ground personnel trying to comprehend the scope of all the redirected planes that day in particular Ben Sliney who effectively plays himself that day the justpromoted supervisor of the National Air Traffic Control Center in Herndon Va. None of the actors stand out because the film cumulatively achieves a verisimilitude that simply knocks me out. The film also does not pretend to be the definitive version of what happened on the last few moments of the flight. In an emotional sense it is rather moot as we are talking about degrees of detail at that point. This is truly essential viewing.".

But both Spielberg's film's followed the filmmaking standards of three acts character development etc. Greengrass throws us into the events of 91101 as if it were happening right now. In fact we never even really get introduced the the people on the flight. All we know is that whatever happened on that plane was shear terror. And from that terror hero's rose and fought back.I live in Southern California and even though the events of 911 happened across the country and didn't affect me directly I still am shakken by the events. Where I live most people have forgotten. It's a time in history I will never forget and dread every single day. I can only imagine what the families of the victims live with everyday.United 93 was the most challenging film I've ever watched. It's not a popcorn flick and should not be seen for entertainment. It's a personal choice to see this film in my opinion. But whatever you do never forget September 11th 2001 it's victims and Hero's".

Where I live most people have forgotten. It's a time in history I will never forget and dread every single day. I can only imagine what the families of the victims live with everyday.United 93 was the most challenging film I've ever watched. It's not a popcorn flick and should not be seen for entertainment. It's a personal choice to see this film in my opinion. But whatever you do never forget September 11th 2001 it's victims and Hero's";

We usually only think of the World Trade Centers when we think of September 11th. I could never imagine what thoughts were racing through those passenger's heads. It truly was devastating to just think what the families were going through when they received phone calls from their loved one's and having to say good bye. We can't forget those who were so brave to help others and those who unfortunately who crashed into the World Trade Center and Pentegon nothing could be strong enough to say about them my sincere condolences to the families.I was wrong about these films they truly are important.

As we bicker over Donald Rumsfeld's job security by day and obsess over American Idol by night writerdirector Paul Greengrass offers a harrowing reminder of what's in play on Earth today.In a film of devastating emotional power Greengrass traces that morning's mounting horrors. This is no PC film crafted by moral relativists in Malibu. As soon as Universal Studios' logo fades to black a man quietly prays in Arabic. He holds a small Koran in his palms while sitting atop a motel bed. It's time one hijacker announces and their murderous journey begins.United 93 should bury for good the absurd clich that violent Muslim zealots are cowards. Rather than watch their knees knock together like castanets the four Al Qaeda agents on the doomed flight are focused and ruthless. When a cockpit screen announces Two aircraft hit World Trade Center the Al Qaeda agents celebrate. The brothers have hit the targets says pilot Ziad Jarrah. We're in control replies hijacker Saeed Al Ghamdi. Thanks be to God. Behind them ordinary Americans who had been eating omelets knitting and perusing travel guides quickly discern that their plane is a missile and they mount a plan to retake it.Though their jet slammed upside down into a field at 580 MPH United 93's 44 passengers surely spared many more lives than they sacrificed. They also likely saved the U.S. Capitol whose photo Jarrah affixes like prey to the airliner's steering column.That final image haunts me  a physical struggle for the controls of a gasolinefueled 21stCentury flying machine between a band of suicidal religious fanatics and a group of innocents drawn from amongst us all Greengrass said. It's really in a way the struggle for our world today. Greengrass uses little known actors and even some reallife airtraffic controllers and military tacticians who were on duty on 911. They make the film feel like a documentary or perhaps a reality TV show captured on celluloid. The cast appears perfectly authentic as they grapple with a growing sense of doom and an increasingly unfathomable challenge.One performance stands out among many fine ones. Ben Sliney ran the FAA's Command Center in Herndon Virginia from which it coordinated airtraffic controllers' response to the hijackings. It also quickly grounded some 4500 aircraft across America. Sliney supervised all this on 911 his first day on that job. He is portrayed rivetingly on screen by none other than Ben Sliney himself.This fine film's verisimilitude parallels recent realworld developments.Shall we pull it down? Jarrah asks another hijacker as passengers bang on the cockpit door.Yes put it in it and pull it down the other replies. Allah is the greatest. Those words are on tapes played at the deathpenalty trial of Al Qaeda agent Zacarias Moussaoui. His Arctic demeanor mirrors the icecold evil that runs through the veins of those who have declared war on America and our allies.United 93 is coming at the right time.".

Can you picture a famous figure such as Brad Pitt standing up against terrorists in such a serious drama? The problem with this type of film is that Americans for the most are not ready for this and thus the film will be the target of much criticism trashing this movie because it is too 'soon'. Didn't Apocalypse Now come out not a few years after the Vietnam war? The politics behind this movie will kill its reputation and an excellent movie will be forgotten much like last year's Jarhead.Overall an excellent movie I'm really looking forward to more of these such as the upcoming World Trade Center. 810".

	schema:reviewBody "When the screening of United 93 came to an end last week several members of the San Diego Film Critics Society commented that this would be a very difficult film to review.I concur with those sentiments but I had no problem giving this a high recommendation. It's not an easy film to watch but I believe people should see it if not as a tribute to those who died then as a remembrance that due vigilance is constantly necessary in these dark times.Some may disagree and call it propaganda but that is patently ridiculous.Based on the United Airlines Flight 93 the fourth U.S. jet hijacked on Sept. 11 2001 and the only liner not to strike its intended target this movie has the intentional feel of a documentary and is thus difficult to really criticize.Much of this reasoning is that the picture tells a straight enough story with little or no dramatic embellishments other than to speculate what exactly took place onboard the doomed craft in real time from takeoff to its ultimate crash approximately 90 minutes.What there is however is a moving powerful gutwrenching emotional work by directorwriter Paul Greengrass Bourne Supremacy Resurrected Bloody Sunday. Nevertheless he will no doubt take some heat form some uninitiated filmgoers who equate this movie with a piece of propaganda but that could not be further from the truth.Greengrass plays it fairly even down the line and cockpit voice recordings as well as last phone calls from passengers and crew seem to indicate his vision of the plane's hijacking seem pretty close to factual.Of course no one is going to know 100 percent of what happened aboard flight 93 since no one survived its ultimate crash in Shanksville Penn. at 1005 a.m. on Sept. 11 2001. However this much is true Four terrorists led by Saeed Al Ghamdi Lewis Alsamari forcibly commandeered the aircraft and most likely killed or disabled the crew Capt. Jason Dahl J.J. Johnson and First Officer LeRoy Homer Gary Commock as well as one or more passengers.One of the hijackers Ahmed Al Haznawi Omar Berdouni has brandished a fake bomb which keeps the passengers at bay long enough for Ghamdi to turn the San Franciscobound craft east towards Washington DC.Stunned by the events but believing them to be completely isolated the passengers are shocked to discover  via cell and air phone conversations  that planes have already smashed into the World Trade Center's Twin Towers and the Pentagon.They now realize this is not a hostage situation that the flight is to be used as a missile against an unknown target and they will probably not escape with their lives.It's then that the passengers mainly Todd Beamer David Alan Basche War of the Worlds Joseph DeLuca Ray Charleston Out For A Kill Jeremy Glick Peter Herman The Treatment and Mark Bingham Cheyenne Jackson Curiosity attempt to retake the plane.And while these scenes are gripping enough the real fascination for this scribbler at least comes from the segments in which the various civilian and military air traffic controllers as well as other technicians come to the cold realization that something horrible and unprecedented is taking place in the nation's skies that autumn morning.The drama that builds as controllers scramble to identify possible hijacked planes American Airline Flight 11 and United 175 and their investigation into 93's dilemma is excruciatingly tense.United 93 also exposes some serious miscommunication between civilian and military authorities with no one knowing much of anything until it is way too late.Another interesting touch is that Greengrass chose not to populate the picture with big names which would have diluted the impact in fact several roles are actually played by real ATC personnel recreating the positions they held in 2001 for this movie.This is not an easy film to watch but I could not look away. And while some make scoff at the conclusions made by Greengrass this is nevertheless a moving and thoughtprovoking piece of work.".

I'm also aware of the gravity of the events on 911. I get it. But this film was just not any good. It's a film it's entertainment  And this is NOT entertaining.It's a film that attempts to put the watcher on the same level as the people involved expect the only thing it succeeds in doing is annoying the hell out of anyone watching. I mean the first 80 of the film can be summed up with two things The first There's a hijacking? Yes there's a hijacking. Oh my god is there a hijacking? What's this about a hijacking? What can to be done to end this hijacking? There's no way there could possibly be a hijacking. etc. It's frustrating especially when you get to the part when the action actually takes place you don't see any of it. The second part goes something like this. Yeah back home I have a family... A Dog a wife 2 kids and a nice luxury sedan from every damn person on the flight. No disrespect intended to those who had family involved but they could tone down this aspect of the story because when they attempt to get it involved it comes across being bland and corny.I could continue to speak on how unrealistic is is that a 10 year old with a stanley knife doesn't get his ass kicked immediately be the what 6 or 7 big guys on the flight? But it would be redundant because it's what happened. Basically 911 could spawn a great movie. I feel for anyone whose family was lost in the senseless tragedy but this movie is terribly acted and there is little to no reason not to doze off until about the 90 minute mark.".

	schema:reviewBody "After watching this movie once I never want to watch it again. It is without a doubt the most boring and repetitive movie that I have ever seen in my life. I became so sincerely sick of the movie within the first 30 minutes that I could have gotten out of my seat made a sandwich poured myself a drink refilled my popcorn and written a 70 page essay about the properties of sand without missing anything.Not long after getting on the plane we run into one of the movie's first problems. It never stops repeating itself. The head extremist on the plane is asked by one of his cohorts when they should strike. The leader says soon and the cohort returns to his seat. Repeat this another two times and the movie finally continues. The pilots are killed and their bodies are dragged about. Some flight attendant You don't learn her name and you won't care anyways sees the bodies and runs to the back of the plane. The passengers then talk about what happened for seven minutes. The passenger's catchphrase for the rest of the movie is Oh no insert event happened.While this is occurring some people who I assume are from the FAA I didn't notice as I was on the verge of taking a nap are talking about other planes that seem to be acting strangely. We get a brief glimpse of the plane hitting the world trade center. I use the term plane very very loosely as the effect work is terrible. It looks like something a person who couldn't even turn on a computer could make. The explosion doesn't even look good and in a film about a national tragedy involving planes exploding this is inexcusable. The FAA people's catchphrase for the rest of the movie is Where are the terrorists? We found the terrorists! Where are the terrorists?And to round out the cast of people you won't enjoy watching we have the military. They basically get nothing done and out of the three these are the people who you will care for the least. They spend the greater half of the movie trying to decipher messages that are obviously cries for help. The army's catchphrase for the rest of the movie is Where is our support?You may have noticed that earlier in the review I stated how repetitive the movie was. This is especially prevalent in the passenger scenes. Whenever an event happens not a single one of them can shut up about it until it has been repeated 10 times. There is a point in the movie in which one of the terrorists stabs one of the passengers. The other passengers cower in fear repeat HE GOT STABBED! 10 times and the movie continues with its plot. The terrorists ask for the man they just stabbed to be healed by a doctor on the plane. Then once the doctor is finished the terrorists immediately stab the man again. Why? No reason. There really isn't one. I tried for 15 minutes to figure out why they stabbed him and I couldn't find it. The passengers were already cowering in fear so it wasn't to intimidate the people. The man wasn't starting an uprising because he was lying in a pool of his own blood. The only possible explanation for it was that the director got bored and decided to put a random violent image in the movie in order to stir people from their slumber. The FAA people try to prevent any further hijackings but all they wind up doing is adding to the monotony by repeatedly switching between whether or not a plane is hijacked. The Army performs pretty much the exact same function as the FAA except that they have some minor power.The final minutes of the movie are when it actually gets somewhat interesting. The FAA and Army are needless to say at this point not involved very closely in the final sequence. The passengers finally fight back against the terrorists. They storm to the front of the plane killing two of the terrorists along the way. When they reach the front of the plane the plane finally crashes. Of course before the 5 minutes preepilogue there is another possibly the most boring of them all passenger repetition scene. This is actually somewhat sad seeing as how it could have been fine if they had only done two or three. But they have five or even more once again almost asleep calls made which is just plain unnecessary considering that almost all of the calls are I love you tell my family I love them.This is a movie that is physically and emotionally painful to watch. It's awful in every respect. Only the last 5 minutes are any good and then the epilogue of course repeats what we just saw... yet again. I'm told by some of my friends that I'll grow to like it later on in life but I'm not enough of a masochist to sit through this intensely boring piece of garbage again.".

Her lover at the time MetroGoldwynMayer lawyer Greg Savitt was able to go through a brokerage to adopt a baby girl who would be Christina the first of Joan's four adoptive children. Joan believes that her own difficult upbringing has made her a stronger person and decides that while providing the comforts that a successful Hollywood actress can afford she will not coddle Christina or her other children she treating Christina more as a competitor than a daughter. Joan's treatment of Christina is often passiveaggressive fueled both by the highs and lows of her career the narcissism that goes along with being an actress and alcohol abuse especially during the low times.

	schema:reviewBody "Given the film's current cult movie status one is tempted to believe the 1981 MOMMIE DEAREST was a critical debacle and a box office fiasco. That is not really the case. It is true that critics generally considered the film a failure but many of them admired certain elements of it it is also true that box office fell below expectations but it was not a box office disaster in the same sense as the 1980 HEAVEN'S GATE or the 1981 INCHON.It is also true however that audiences howled with laughter at the film when it debuted and although leading lady Faye Dunaway received a number of critical accolades for her performance as Joan Crawford she also received an equal number of devastating reviewsand it was these that caught the spotlight. It was a humiliating experience for an actress particularly noted for her perfectionism and rumor has it that Dunaway feels the film ended her career as a major film star. Whatever the case Dunaway quickly developed a strategic silence about the film that she has maintained for some two decades.Seen today it is easy to identify the core problems of the film. The most obvious is the script which is extremely inconsistent in quality and yet perversely consistent in a style that can only be described as soap opera hothouse to the nth degree. This is particularly true of the dialogue assigned to Dunaway. Infamous lines such as No More Wire Hangers Ever Tina! Bring Me The Axe and I'm Not Mad At You I'm Mad At The Dirt have become a staple of every drag queen from Maine to California.But the ultimate disaster here is director Frank Perry. Joan Crawford was a largerthanlife personality the role is written to reflect this Dunaway plays the role as it was written. But it would seem Perry sought to heighten the effect the rest of the cast is extremely extremely restrained. This must have seemed like a good idea in theory but it proves a terrible mistake in actual fact. No matter what Dunaway does with it she can NEVER seem less than wildly overwrought in comparison to the rest of the cast and the effect is very peculiar indeed.The designs and the cinematography also clash in an incredibly bizarre way. There is absolutely no doubt that everything about the film is exactingly accurate that is indeed the look of the period right down to the very last detail. But the photography is extremely flat and you are constantly aware that the sets are indeed movie sets the costumes are movie costumes and so on. Yes it is all beautifully rendered but you can't buy into it as anything real.The Hollywood Royalty Edition DVD edition offers a good but by no means flawless print of the film and several bonuses. It is unfortunate that they are not particularly illuminating. While director John Water's commentary is enjoyable he approaches the film only as a fan. Even so Water does make several telling points many of the things that Crawford does which seem so odd bathing the face in ice for example are actually commonplace cosmetic necessities for movie stars many of the things the film treats as abuse were although carried to wild extremes in the story typical of childrearing practices of the 1940s and 1950s.There are also three short documentaries featuring a number of cast members most notably Diana Scarwid these are actually entertaining for the fact that those who appear still seem to regard the film as a good movie. The only really significant interview is with Lypsinka an artist who has driven Crawford impersonations to the level of wicked satire and high art and who offers a number of interesting personal insights into the iconography involved.Like the film itself the bonus package has two great failures. The first is that Faye Dunaway does not appear in interview or commentary it would be very interesting to have her own take on the film its failures and its afterlife. Given her sentiment it is an understandable noninvolvement less understandable however that there is not so much as a potted biography of the actressor indeed of any member of the cast for there are no written notes of any kind.The second great failure of the bonus package is that it contains no factual information on either Joan or Christina Crawford. There is no indication here that those who knew both women are sharply divided over the accuracy of the portraits both here and in the book by Christina Crawford from which the film is drawn. A number of people including actresses Betty Hutton and June Allyson supported Christina Crawford's accounts but an equal number including actress Myrna Loy and Christina's younger siblings flatly stated that Christina's accusations were largely fictitious.When all is said and done and in spite of performances and moments that are actually extremely good in isolation MOMMIE DEAREST is a film that falls under the so bad it's good category of cult films. While I am taken aback by the bizarre nature of the movie I personally find the amusement involved almost as dark as the movie's plot it is not among my cult film favorites. Even so I can understand the appeal it has for others and I give it five stars on that basis.GFT Amazon Reviewer".

How do you rate a movie like this? On the one hand it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen completely lacking in coherence shameful acting writing so bad it seems to be making fun of itself. In fact I'm still not convinced this movie isn't supposed to be a parody of Christina Crawford's book rather than a serious attempt to adapt it to the screen. On the other hand it's such a riproarin' good time of a show that I'm tempted to give it 10 stars on the strength of its sheer entertainment value alone.Faye Dunaway gives the most jawdroppingly mesmerizing freak out ever captured on screen whose bizarreness cannot even be topped by Halle Berry's Oscar acceptance speech. Dunaway must have realized early on that she was a rat in a sinking ship but instead of deserting she decides instead to devour the crew. I don't know if her performance comes anywhere close to capturing the real Joan Crawford but if Crawford was even a tenth of a percent as loony as Dunaway portrays her here I would have been hightailing it to Canada if I were either of her children. The fabulous lines many of which are quoted on this site can't really be done justice when removed from the context in which they appear and you really have to see the faces of the actors as they're delivering them to get the full effect. The wire hanger scene is of course a classic but it's really the floor scrubbing scene immediately following with Dunaway in kabuki makeup squatting on the floor like a Sumo wrestler that remains more memorable. Watching Joanie jog is a sight to behold especially when she starts talking to herself and scrunching her face up as if she's imitating Alvin or one of his chipmunks. There's the I can handle the socks moment one of the most seductive moments hee hee in film history and of course the coup de grace comes when Joanie tackles Christina across the coffee table and begins banging her head into the floor like she's in a women's prison movie.The editing in this film is atrocious. There's no sense of time events follow each other in a loosely chronological fashion but they don't make dramatic or narrative sense. Frank Perry the director must have been dozing off through much of this production either that or his film crew carried out a mutiny tied him up threw him in a shed and went ahead without him. But it seems churlish to criticize a film like this for its poor film making. It's like kicking a dead horse.All I can say is if you watch this movie with the right people in the right frame of mind i.e. with alcohol you will be howling. I watched this with a group in college and we had to periodically pause the movie in order to allow everyone to recover before continuing. Thank you Ms. Dunaway for giving us Mommie Dearest. The world will never be able to repay you for your kindness.Grade F or A depending on your perspective and level of sobriety".

Such bizarre behavior as needlessly scrubbing clean floors and clean hands helps reduce one's fears and anxieties. Overreaction to minor problems is one result. There's a tendency to expect oneself and others to be perfect. If what is being judged is not perfect then the OCD mindset perceives it to be the opposite of perfection that is ruin. There's no inbetween.Character behavior that is weird to begin with combined with poor film direction and an exaggerated overthetop performance by Faye Dunaway results in plot sequences that are campy and outlandish thus robbing the story of subtle truths that may be buried under all that bombast.Excise the rose garden sequence the wirehangersbathroom cleaning sequence and several other embarrassing parts and we might have a film that could be taken seriously. But of course then we couldn't laugh at it. And I do think the film as is is good for some laughs.Having a film protagonist who is such a blatant villain with no character arc is unusual and helps make this film so bizarre. At least Godzilla and the great white shark in Jaws could be forgiven their cruelty given their inability to be human.Apart from the bizarre main character in Mommie Dearest the film's plot does not flow well. The dialogue also is bizarre and lacks subtext. Helga I'm not mad at you I'm mad at the dirt says Joan as she spots dirt hiding under a potted plant. And as an outofcontrol angry Joan proceeds to punish a tree in her rose garden in frustration with Louis B. Mayer she yells to Christina Bring me the ax. How can the viewer not laugh?Lucille LeSueur undoubtedly was an ambitious woman a hard worker and had both genuine talent and a healthy ego. But her human relations with others especially her adopted daughter were disasters. We may never know the extent to which Mommie Dearest mirrors the real Joan Crawford or is merely a gross exaggeration by a vengeful heirless heir.Regardless Joan Crawford left us some terrific films.

If not look at Halle Berry's career choices after her win for MONSTER'S BALL. She may still rebound her career is still not at a point of no return and her acceptance speech at the Razzies may be the cold water splashing on her face that will take her back to the roles she's supposed to be doing not the ones which will garner her the first black woman to... status.But not to digress. MOMMIE DEAREST was and is a camp classic de rigeur right up there with VALLEY OF THE DOLLS. It is the CITIZEN KANE of camp. Producers must have decided that Christina Crawford's tellall book about her mother  in case you didn't already know it's Joan Crawford movie star Oscar winner glamor girl alleged child beater  would make a brilliant film and why? Well for once biopics featuring stars at their absolute worst weren't that common at the time this film was released and certainly a book as sordid as this might make for a dark look into a respected actress recently defunct. And so the casting of an actress who would embody those excesses to the hilt  and wouldn't you know the actress who stated years before she admired Crawford stepped into the task of turning herself to Joan from head to toe not only physical but in mannerisms gowns diction. Faye literally became Joan Crawford in image and style. The problem is the script was so unabashedly exploitative and poorly written her Crawford became a caricature a clich of poses that Crawford herself had created in many of her film credits. There is no real Joan Crawford here only a repetition of lines that seem to be lifted almost directly from other movies. This Joan as a matter of fact seems to also live in her own time capsule. No mention of her 1920s or 1930s career no mention of her marriage to Philip Barry no mention of her later return to MGM to film TORCH SONG or her horror movie period not even any back story of what happened behind sets in Mildred Pierce or the fact that she had to audition several times before getting that particular part which won her her only Best Actress Oscar. No mention of her rivalry of Bette Davis who? not in this film either and their one movie together WHATEVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE? This is all fantasy seen even more clearly with the inclusion of a completely fictional lover played awfully by Steve Forrest and housekeeper Carol Anne an equally bad Rutanya Alda and not to mention the horrific performance of Diana Scarwid as Christina Crawford who has some sublimely bad scenes filled with beyond terrible lines. It made me wonder was the actual Christina there as a consultant and if she was how does one explain how moronic she becomes as the movie progresses to the point that we actually side with Joan? Then again this not being an autobiography nor a book of accounts of actors who knew and worked with Crawford but an amateur attempt at writing huge inaccuracies were bound to happen. And to portray interminable disjointed scenes of Crawford gone mad brutalizing Christina for no other reason than being wigged out  well I'm not sure what the director is trying to say here.So if there's no real Crawford older and younger then this is all a mindless exercise in glossy excess. It's the TV biopic of the month that never was its existence predates future biopics of similar awfulness if not check recent tellall biopics that ABC Lifetime and other channels have been churning out lately on TV stars clawing each other's eyes out. It's also the precursor of trash TV if anyone recalls DYNASTY or MELROSE PLACE or even Jerry Springer all they have to do is rent this baby and enjoy the sublime scene when Dunaway tries to body slam and strangle Diana Scarwid Christina as an adult as a reporter watches in horror. Now that's entertainment!".

	schema:reviewBody "Mommie Dearest is a gaudy spectacle though this isn't to say some of it its 2 hour or so runtime isn't entertaining. This isn't to confuse it with good oh heavens no. This is bad. Let's make that clear up front Frank Perry's adaptation of Christina Crawford's scathing tellall about her life with her mother and who knows how true it is maybe some whatever that was what it was is a mess. As a story being told from start to finish it has no coherent structure no real arcs are given to any of the characters  including Joan or Christina  and things simply... HAPPEN! yes all in caps It's episodic which isn't necessarily a bad thing but when it lacks any direction that isn't either wildly flamingly hysterical or really too quiet and like the actress Diana Scarwid who plays adult Christina is possibly inert. There is no middle ground here. Experiencing Mommie Dearest is like taking cocaine the whole first hour is a WTF rush that is howlingly funny... but then there's the come down in the second half and it only recovers in fits and starts.In other words one may be curious about Mommie Dearest because of its notorious set pieces moreso than any curiosity to see anything remotely close to how this was in reality. It's a disastrously manic comic book version of Crawford and Faye Dunaway to her credit gives it her all. What lets her down though is the direction from Frank Perry who has made movies I've liked before seriously check out The Swimmer and see what he can really do and especially the script. I'm not kidding when I say the movie feels so scattered tonally you get whiplash from for example Crawford winning her Oscar for Mildred Pierce one moment and then the next is that 'WireHanger' scene which I'll get back to in a moment.Something that's hard to not notice is how cringeworthy the dialog is I don't mean in the sense that it's intentional. I mean that some  most  of the dialog is written not how people...actually...TALK the highlight for me is when Joan tells the Pepsi husband that he is the sodaking or something like that  as if we didn't KNOW! In that first hour we see those years in childhood for Christina how the girl doesn't seem to age or change is one of the great mysteries of life I guess not unlike Joan up until near the very end of the film. It's a fun ride in the campiest way at least for the most part  here we still see some scenes that don't work but the pacing keeps things up as far as the conflict of 'Joan's going cuckoo maybe bipolar and the daughter's along for the wild ride'. All of this seems to lead up to that wirehanger scene which I had seen part of before it's hard to avoid but in the context makes even less sense again this follows immediately after the Oscarwin scene which has its own passiveaggressive bit where Crawford says nothing to her daughter. And then Dunaway really does go to town and it's easily the most absurd and uproarious moment of the film and there are a few. But here's a question I wonder anyone thought of why were there any wire hangers even there it's her mansion and why would the little girl put one or more there if she knew it would p her off? Okay maybe getting too logical about one of the key camp scenes not to mention in a nonsexual way a dominationsubmissive thing... or maybe that's reading too much.A largerlargest problem is that Perry can't keep the momentum up whether from the issues with the script or something else. That wire hanger scene I thought was supposed to be the climax of the film  I mean where do you go from THERE?  and is halfway through the runtime. From here Christina goes to boarding school and it's here that it isn't as goodbad more boringbad if that makes sense. Oh there's a couple of highlights in this section including the terrifying scene where Joan actually chokes her daughter out it feels like the kind of moment that... uh... is no one going to call the police? Yet once that conflict fizzles as Christina gets olderish or when Perry and the writers suddenly make the motherdaughter not it's not as fun to watch. That may sound like not a good criticism but watch it if it's not grabbing at you with its sheer insanity then it's kind of boring.Had this been 90 minutes or even 100 it could be a good sharp overthetop tonic. At its length as it stands and how its so structureless and without any 'spine' to the proceedings not to mention how it doesn't know what tone to take as far as what the abuse to Christina does to the motherdaughter bond sometimes they do fight but then that goes away for... reasons off screen and it lurches until its closing which seems even for this movie completely tacky.All this said... you'll never see a woman awkwardly cut down a tiny tree in the middle of the night the same way again.".

	onyx:emotionText "Mommie Dearest is a gaudy spectacle though this isn't to say some of it its 2 hour or so runtime isn't entertaining. This isn't to confuse it with good oh heavens no. This is bad. Let's make that clear up front Frank Perry's adaptation of Christina Crawford's scathing tellall about her life with her mother and who knows how true it is maybe some whatever that was what it was is a mess. As a story being told from start to finish it has no coherent structure no real arcs are given to any of the characters  including Joan or Christina  and things simply... HAPPEN! yes all in caps It's episodic which isn't necessarily a bad thing but when it lacks any direction that isn't either wildly flamingly hysterical or really too quiet and like the actress Diana Scarwid who plays adult Christina is possibly inert. There is no middle ground here.

Okay I did think the young Christina Crawford was a little over the top but I can completely believe that any daughter of a glamorous and pampered movie star would behave in much the same way. Faye Dunaway's performance is fearless brutal complex even vulnerable and absolutely unforgettable. I found her character's behaviors incredibly disturbing to watch and incredibly cathartic because I was raised a mother who Dunaway's character reminds me of often in this film. Even though most people apparently though the wire hanger scene was ridiculous to me it rang absolutely true. I honestly had no idea the film was so poorly received when it came out I was shocked. I love this movie and it's one of those films I can watch again every few months. I would ask the critics who poke fun at the film to go back and watch Sunset Boulevard again a brilliant movie I've never heard a bad word about go and revisit Norma Desmond and all of her vanity and psychosis so haunting and unforgettable and tell me again if Faye Dunaway's performance is overacted.".

	schema:reviewBody "Oh Lord Here it comes..... This is the big one. Never before has there been and probably never will there be again a camp monstrosity as huge as this. An overthetop true story about Christina Crawford being adopted raised and tormented by the legendary film star Joan Crawford the film is an amazing exercise in excess. Virtually every line in the film is a quotable hoot and legions of people can almost recite the script! It is an overabundance of comedic riches. It's almost impossible to pick a favorite scene. First though it is likely that certain aspects of this film have a seed of truth there is no way that this is an authentic film biography.......NO WAY. So while a few incidents are loosely derived from fact most of it is guiltfree hilarity. Christina's book was striking but contained nothing as wild and vicious as this film presents. And it's entirely probable that some of Christina's memories were exaggerated by childhood perspective although there's no denying that her mother was an obsessive neurotic steamroller of a woman. Even Tina explained in her book certain aspects of the bad behavior which shed some light on Joan's actions. None of that is presented here. For example the infamous rare meat scene...the film doesn't disclose that Joan paid high black market prices for the beef during wartime rationing and was appalled that Tina turned her nose up at it and wasted it. Also the violent night raid scene is actually a compilation of two different occasions etc.... The film tries to maximize and sensationalize everything and overdo everything to the point where it turns comic. Dunaway who has herself described her mesmerizing and ferocious performance as Kabuki is beyond fascinating to watch. She imbues the role with an intense stunning magnetism which blows everyone else off the screen. It's amazing that the sets were left intact! Despite an explosive unforgettable performance Faye actually looks almost nothing like the real Joan Crawford. Her eyes are not nearly large enough and nothing is done to make them appear so her eyebrows are ridiculous her chest is not as pronounced as Joan made hers and her hair is almost never the way the real Joan wore it! And both women have HIGHLY unique voices but which are not alike at all. Still she radiates all the necessary star quality for the role. Anne Bancroft would have LOOKED the part more but who knows what the film would have been like? Better? Duller? It certainly could not have been wilder! Highlights of the Faye Dunaway circus act include the legendary cold creamfaced night raid with the iconic screech No Wire Hangers! her tirade with the scissors when she catches Tina mocking her her showdown with the boarding school principal the resultant wrestling match with Tina back home and the magnificent faceoff with the Pepsi Board of Directors. It would be impossible to list the many quotes which make this film required viewing only the surface has been scratched in the Memorable Quotes section. I fought worse monsters than you for years in Hollywood. I know how to win the hard way immediately followed by Don't FCK with me fellas!! This ain't my first time at the rodeo isn't a bad start. Too hilarious! Young Hobel really holds her own as Tina and though Scarwid is less successful as grown Tina she still gets in a few good licks. In any case the film has provided untold hours of enjoyment and allowed for some instant bonding whenever people start spouting off the hilarious lines. WHEN is someone going to adapt this into a stage show?!".

	schema:headline " Don't mess with Joan Crawford fellas. This ain't her first time at the rodeo. This movie is the mother of all good celebrity tell all stories";
	schema:reviewBody "In 1978 Christina Crawford the daughter of famous movie star Joan Crawford wrote and shocked the world with the first tellall celebrity memoir. In the book 'Mommie Dearest she shine light into the hidden life of her mother claiming Joan Crawford was a cruel abusive alcoholic. The book was Number 1 New York Times bestseller list for 42 weeks. So there was no surprise that a movie would be made from that source material. Directed by Frank Perry the movie had a number of over the top moments. Due to that reason a lot of people couldn't take this film as a serious bio. Some people think that Faye Dunaway who played Joan Crawford in the film act too hammy like an evil cartoony character. I believe Faye Dunaway acting in this movie is amazing. She really show the larger than life sadistic tones well. You cannot feel bit scare or disturb during the infamous wirehanger or the pruning the garden scenes. Honestly I don't know how some people can feel that those scenes are funny. It's clearly child abuse. While the movie isn't as brutal or dark as a lot of newer movies with similar plots. Those scenes are not at all meant to be funny to watch. You kinda feel bad for any child going through that. Many assume Dunaway's performance is campy but I will defend it because the drunk abusive people I know have acted that way in reality. Not to mention how over the top the real life Joan Crawford was in on screen and off screen. After all she did had a very public feud with another actress Bette Davis. I kinda wish the movie mention that. However what they did feature made Joan a rather pathetic sad figure who get into fights with people way too much. It is sadder still however that she chose to force her anger of that upon a helpless child who couldn't defend herself. Young Christina Mara Hobel might not be truly innocent. She does get a bit annoying and whining at times. Indeed it's hard to feel too bad for her when she's living in a pretty spoil rich life during her childhood but in no way deserve such abuse from any parent. When she grow up played as an adult by Diana Scarwid she does become a bit of a moocher and smartass due to the years of abuse. Some people question if Christina was actually abused. Defenders of Joan Crawford had argued that Joan's strictness toward her children was grossly overblown by Christina as Joan was only following the stern disciplinarian that was the standards of the era. After all most of the movie has Joan only spanking her child. While hitting your child isn't a good idea people still view spanking as an alright parental discipline. Supposedly her brother Christopher and the twins that Joan later adopted in which the film forgot to mention had a much better relationship with their mother. It's hard to believe that considering that Joan indeed strap Christopher down to his bed to prevent him from masturbating but it came with the times. Christopher does defend Christina's claims but the later twins do not. Indeed being a strict parent and wanting the best for your children does not make you an abusive parent. Was young Christina just a demanding spoil brat? Was Adult Christina just a bitter young woman trying to make money off her dead mother? Some people have forward to say they did witness some abuse by Joan but for the most part it's up to the viewer. Still you felt sympathy for Joan Crawford whom all she wants is a perfect life. It's just that Joan tend to get caught up in her will power that she feel disappointed in people who wouldn't live up to her demand perfection. Joan suffered greatly from the sudden rise from rags to riches causing her to project all of her issues with being poor into her obsessive cleaning and going postal on Christina when she used poor people clothing hangers or using her ultraexpensive makeup. Some people misinterpreted Joan's freakout over the wire hangers for her having had a wire hanger abortion in the past and not wanting to be reminded of it. She tend to alienation a lot of people ranging from companies like Pepsi  MGM Grand to her series of fail relationships like Greg Savitt Steve Forrest. In the movie Greg is a combination of the various husbands and lovers Joan Crawford had while the housekeeper is meant to represent several employees in Joan's house. In the film Joan Crawford does have some very affectionate supportive doting motherhood trying scenes. After all the movie doesn't make her look all bad. Still years after Mommie Dearest came out. Joan Crawford's reputation took a battering so ferocious that it has never fully recovered. Go see the movie it's up to you if the events being shown are fact or fiction.".

	schema:reviewBody "In Mommie Dearest we watch Faye Dunaway portray Joan Crawford as portrayed in Crawford's adopted and later disinherited daughter Christina's necessarily? onesided and tendentious memoir.  That was less a story than a payback about growing up in a Hollywood hothouse with a headstrong and possibly unhinged star as mother.  Where the precise balance lies between truth obviously some and spite owing to being read out of the will is not or no longer the point.  The point is what justice the movie does to the legendary Crawford  how accurately it reproduces her public faade and private dysfunction where it's open to skepticism and how well it evokes the way stars lived and were expected to live under the mid20thcentury studio system where it fares well.The movie opens at 4 a.m. the wakeup call for a star operating under the punishing regimen that was then the norm when shooting was underway. DunawayCrawford scrubs and steams herself then closes her pores by plunging her face into rubbing alcohol on the rocks.  Then she steps into a limo idling in the dark where she learns her lines and signs glossies for doting fans.  Noblesse oblige Southern California style.Crawford had been in movies since the last days of the silents her first roles uncredited or as Lucille LeSueur were in 1925 and had since achieved a blueandivory showplace in Brentwood two exhusbands and entre to the privileged circle of Hollywood royalty'.  All she wants to round out her life is a baby or two Steve Forrest plays an attorney and current paramour who helps her to acquire them like a pair of occasional tables.The rest of the movie depicts the ambivalent  almost bipolar  relationship between Joan and Christina the actual Crawford adopted four children whom the script cuts to two  just one really for son Christopher is seen only a few times tethered to his bed and once again at the fateful reading of the will.  So the plot's main thrust is Christina vs. Joan and the semipsychotic episodes that made the movie a cultcamp classic focus on this David and Goliath tugofwar Tina bring me the axe!' and What's wire hangers doing in this closet?'.Several episodes however weren't witnessed by the skulking passiveaggressive young Tina Mara Hobel or by the wilful and defiant teenager and woman she would become Diana Scarwid with a growling contralto that brings to mind Joan's adversary Mercedes McCambridge in Johnny Guitar.  No little pitcher with big ears was nearby when Joan in gingham apron and highheeled white work shoes scrubs the floor and bellows to the maid I'm not mad at you I'm mad at the dirt' or when in one of Dunaway's riptheenvelopeopen scenes emasculates the entire board of directors of Pepsico.Dunaway's impersonation of Crawford is in many ways unforgettably overripe and her performance been received as both extraordinary and execrable she herself is on record as regretting that she did the movie at all.  Yet despite an at times almost uncanny resemblance provided by makeup and costume we seldom forget it's Dunaway on camera.  The specific Crawford qualities that gave her unparalleled longevity in Hollywood elude Dunaway  they aren't quite there.  Under all the honeyed diction there's little of the tough broad from east Texas.  Maybe Dunaway was right in doing Crawford her own way rather than resorting to mimicry.  But she  and the script  lose too much of her prototype.The script hews to known chronology in only the most slapdash way. There's a signpost at the beginning  Ice Follies of 1939 why not the better known and just plain better The Women of the same year?  and another at the time of her AcademyAward performance in Mildred Pierce 1945.  But Crawford's subsequent vehicles many of them hits are ignored  and much of Mommie Dearest suggests she was a washedup hasbeen.   So it's never clear what juncture of her career she's reached  the late '40s and early '50s when she was still going strong the GrandGuignol '60s or near the end the '70s Trog and TV?  It's a crucial lapse of basic narrative skills.But Mommie Dearest eschews many of those skills seemingly by choice.  No longer as in the movies Crawford made famous does scene unfold into scene does motivation shape the story line.  True real life seldom observes the dramatic unities but events here come so haphazardly that they're baffling. A triumph like winning the Oscar or the humiliation of being fired from MGM by Louis B. Mayer Howard Da Silva in a memorable cameo both lead straight into fulltilt rampages.  Do they occur the same day or weeks or months later?  The timeline's too shaky to tell.  Nor do the drastic moodswings ever get explained maybe they can't be explained though Crawford's everpresent flask of vodka threads through the movie more as a colorful eccentricity than a central fact of her life.And in expressing this instability Dunaway plucks not from Crawford's roles but from Gloria Swanson in the last loony half of Sunset Blvd.  Her eyes turn inward while fleeting emotions flicker across her face hinting at something dreadful dredged up from her psyche.  Yet Crawford held on to her star power in a ruthless industry for close to four decades then snagged PepsiCola CEO Alfred Steele and proved to be a savvy businesswoman. Nothing in Mommie Dearest accounts for those facts which makes its accounting practices a little bit suspect.  It's not a very good movie but thanks to Dunaway and her subject mesmerizing nonetheless.".

	schema:reviewBody "Alright this might not be too obscure of a movie but when it came out it wasn't well received and pretty much ignored causing it to have a huge cult following. The acting by Dunaway as Joan Crawford is so exaggerated that it seems unbelievable that it's a biographical tale. More than Crawford's story as an actress this movie deals with the painful abusive and traumatic upbringing of her daughter Christina she wrote the book that prompted the making of this movie. Some say Christina made a lot of it up to destroy her mother's reputation but others say it might be quite accurate. Either way Dunaway's performance as the Screen Queen is uncanny. She embodies every quality of Crawford and watching the movie you forget that it's not really Joan but Faye in the role. Sure this movie won Razzie Awards and the producers even tried to capitalize with its failure by billing it The worst mother of them all. Dunaway even goes as far as telling interviewers beforehand that she will not talk about this movie. One can understand her seeing that she was campaigning for an Oscar nod and instead won the Razzie for worst actress but none of that matters because this movie is now seen as a great tragedy and you'll definitely get lost in the story wondering if everything is true. Oh and the scenes with Faye Dunaway and Mara Hobel who plays young Christina Crawford are amazing. It's no wonder she won the Young Artist Award. Seriously watch it. The No more wire hangers scene alone is enough to watch this great film.".

The BeeGees have always been my favorite to listen to since I came out the womb. Also I love looking at older classic films like Birds. While most of my classmates would play with their toys and take naps I would listen to Earth Wind Fire and look at 1980s films. My favorite decade has always been the eighties and it always will be thanks to mommy dearest.Joan Crawford Faye Dunaway is a driven actress and compulsively clean housekeeper who tries to control the lives of those around her as tightly as the selfcontrol she exhibits. Joan is in a relationship with Hollywood lawyer Gregg Savitt Steve Forrest but her career is in a bit of a downswing. Joan adopts a girl whom she names Christina and later a boy Christopher. Joan lavishes Christina with attention and luxuries such as an extravagant birthday party but also enforces a code of denial and discipline. As Christina rebels against her mother's demands and standards a series of confrontations ensues. Meaning all hell breaks loose! The primary message of the message of the film was that director Frank Perry wanted to show the audience how controlling Joan was and wanted to be. She was striving to stay on top of her career and her personal life as well. But as her life crumbled in certain areas she failed to keep her cool. The director also showed that with the many things that she faced head on she still remained a strong obsessive woman who would not take no for an answer.Throughout the lavish film the characters were the real standouts of the movie. Faye Dunaway not only takes the cake in this film but she gives the true meaning as a true crazy helicopter mother. Also the lighting in the film really softens each scene in movie making it very pleasant to watch.".

If you are curious who the most freakish character ever put on film is Faye Dunaway as Joan Crawford puts Hannibal Lecter to shame without even killing one person or eating human flesh you will certainly find this movie morbidly fascinating.I haven't read the book upon which this horrible movie is supposedly based but I have seen the real Christina Crawford on a documentary depicting Joan Crawfords career and I can imagine her being every bit as vindictive as this movie makes her out to be. It's not all her fault of course as it must have been a living hell to be Crawford's daughter if a tenth of what's happening in the movie is true. The problem is every character in it are unsympathetic in one way or another. So what does it have on it's mind? Does it wanna trash Crawford and make Christina out to be the hero? If so it does a poor job. See the closing scene and you will know what I'm talking about. Is it simply that movie stars are unfit parents because they are too wrapped up in themselves? It is impossible to find a culprit based on what is depicted here.There are too many awful moments to describe here but I do think that Faye Dunaway was very brave to take on this part and make it such a caricature. She must have known that there was no other way to play it since this was doomed to be a turkey.So if you are interested in seeing this do so without expecting to get any inside information about the life of these people or if you are interested in seeing behind the scenes backstabbing there is the soap opera scene it is unintentionally hilarious but the one thing that is actually close to the truth. We never really learn anything about the career of Joan Crawford as the subject matter is handled so flimsy. Most of the facts are either left out or tampered with.My vote is that this movie is awful. It is much too depressing to work as camp and much too unintelligent as to work as art.".

	schema:reviewBody "This one actually goes half and half with me so its good and bad or should I say it's so bad that it's good. I am a living witness Hallelujah! that whenever you are feeling down or depressed watch Mommie Dearest. But word to the wise don't watch it expecting good acting and wonderful relevance to the book because you surely will not get it. The thing that makes the movie float above the rest of camp classics is the fact that it is based on an informative book by Joan's daughter Christina. Therefore it is to be dramatic and realistic like say Guyana Tragedy or The Josephine Baker Story. But this movie is so unrealistic it is funny. And if you really want to roll over on the floor and have the mortician come to your house because you died laughing I would recommend that you watch the whole thing on DVD and with French language especially the wire hanger sequence. Hell it doesn't matter if you don't speak the language Mommie Dearest is like the opera the emotions and movement will tell all you need to know without understanding of the language. If I were giving an Oscar to Mommie Dearest It would be for the beautiful silver dress Faye Dunaway has on... to take Christina's rancid awful meat to the freezer just so she can make the little snot eat it the next day. But as for the acting no way! Faye goes over the top in her hammy performance as Joan the posterchild for goggle eyed takes shoulder pads anklestrapped shoes and hypochondriac cleanliness. Diana Scarwid is so bland and uninteresting as Christina. and the rest of the cast... well they are OK considering the parts they were given. But the only factors that could have made or broke Mommie Dearest were the two main characters therein Joan and Christina Crawford. Scarwid broke the movie by vice of her apathy to the role she played I would have thought in all accounts that if a child was abused they would come out of it with a newfound understanding of their own inner strength and fight like hell to survive which is what the real Christina did according to the book. But Scarwid is so unmotivated. She reminds me of my junior year Biology teacher inane and in it for the paycheck. I think this performance is what caused Scarwid's Tinseltown demise. On the other hand Dunaway hams it up and made the picture pass that thin line between drama and camp. Watch the movie. You will not think it Oscar Material but you will not be bored either.".

I am a living witness Hallelujah! that whenever you are feeling down or depressed watch Mommie Dearest. But word to the wise don't watch it expecting good acting and wonderful relevance to the book because you surely will not get it. The thing that makes the movie float above the rest of camp classics is the fact that it is based on an informative book by Joan's daughter Christina. Therefore it is to be dramatic and realistic like say Guyana Tragedy or The Josephine Baker Story. But this movie is so unrealistic it is funny.

	schema:headline " Hollywood Royalty Edition DVD Resuscitates Crawford Camp Classic Embodied by an Overcommitted Dunaway";
	schema:reviewBody "Even though she was the first runnerup for the New York Film Critics Award Faye Dunaway disavows her performance as screen icon Joan Crawford because the camp following this 1981 potboiler has developed over the years has probably been overwhelming. To put it mildly she is certainly watchable. However every line she utters seems to have an exclamation point and every gesture feels so grandiose that it's hard to figure out just what empathetic qualities Crawford had to engender her longstanding popularity. The glibly titled 2006 Hollywood Royalty Edition DVD package makes no bones that this is a movie that now caters to its huge gay following. Dunaway's snub in participating as well as director Frank Perry's death means having flamboyant director John Waters pinchhit on the commentary track and he manages to be both funny and insightful as he shares lots of apocryphal gossip and zingy oneliners to bring a whole new flavor to the execrable film.Among his many errors in judgment Perry decided to film the story of Crawford's midtolate years or more appropriately her adopted daughter Christina's version of it as if the movie was one of Crawford's own overripe films. The problem with his seriousminded approach is that it veers so unpredictably back and forth between soap opera and pure camp that the only consistency is its artifice. The story begins as the movie star's career is in free fall at MGM in 1939 when she was forced to film a true atrocity called Ice Follies of 1939. Aware of her professional dilemma Crawford decides to adopt a baby regardless of being a twicedivorced single career woman. With the help of her studio lackey lover Greg Savitt she adopts a daughter and later a son. Forever the publicity hound Crawford presents her happy family in the most pretentious manner in front of the Hollywood press yet hides a streak of cruelty that manifests itself into militarylike parenting and savagely violent episodes. Not living up to her mother's exacting standards Christina is shuttled off to boarding school and then convent school. She grows up to become a struggling young TV actress as her mother becomes a corporate wifeturned widow slipping deeper into alcoholism.Perry makes a fundamental mistake in switching the film's narrative perspective from Joan to Christina midway through the film. The consequence is that neither of their stories is fully told with any objectivity especially what could have happened in Crawford's earlier years that would have led to such excessive behavior. Instead we are given an endless parade of overthetop moments  the tree chopping the tile scrubbing the wire hangers the outofcontrol strangulation  that the movie is simply too exhausting to keep up with the episodic storyline. With her reasonable resemblance to the movie star in full makeup Dunaway carries herself confidently within the Crawford public persona and even achieves some remote moments of poignancy in between the shouting matches. Her strenuous efforts at verisimilitude however push her into an unsavory demonic level of commitment to the largerthanlife role. It's too bad that almost everyone else is quite awful by comparison  Diana Scarwid frustratingly wooden as the adult Christina Rutanya Alda irritatingly earnest in her blind devotion as Crawford's confidante Carol Ann Steve Forrest looking like aged beef as Savitt and Howard Da Silva merely smarmy as MGM studio chief Louis B. Mayer. The one exception is little Mara Hobel who brings genuine cunning to the younger Christina.The Hollywood Royalty Edition includes three dishy featurettes. The 14minute The Revival of Joan Crawford shows the genesis of the movie from Christina's redhot best seller with contributions from Scarwid Alda and producer Frank Yablans who speaks candidly about Dunaway's tempestuous perfectionism. The 14minute Life With Joan focuses on Dunaway's total absorption in the part during the stormy production and includes an extended opening sequence that was deleted before release. The 16minute Joan Lives On speaks specifically to the film's cult status with Waters and Crawford impersonator Lypsinka providing particularly comic insight to its gay following. There is also a photo gallery and the original trailer. It's truly for lovers of cinema camp.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you've never seen this 1981 adaptation of Christina Crawford's hatchet job on her late adoptive mother Hollywood legend Joan chances are you've heard about Faye Dunaway's unhinged lead performance. And yes Faye is every frightening thing you've heard about and more from the crossed eyes to the screaming fits to the unconvincing drunken wobbling. But give the dread Dunaway Jack Nicholson's affectionate term for her some credit. She's playing Joan Crawford a melodramatic actress and fiercely assertive personality. Beyond that she's asked to play Joan Crawford as the violent alcoholic monster that her vengeful daughter wants us to believe she was which demands an extra layer of mania. And surely the producers knew that Faye was never the subtlest actress  she earned that Oscar for Network with a convincing portrayal of an obvious but charming sociopath. Finally she's dealing with an atrocious script. Faye didn't write lines like I can handle the socks! and Tina bring me the ax! or dream up the ludicrous wire hanger scene on her own. The movie makers lavished a multimillion dollar budget on sets costumes makeup a twobit script and a director Frank Perrywho obviously didn't know how to rein in his stars' worst impulses. I'm not talking about Faye here I mean Diana Scarwid the expressionless stiff who portrayed Christina as an adult.Maybe Perry can be forgiven for not throwing a net over Dunaway  based on every report the lady is a giant pain Bette Davis for one hated Faye even more than she hated Joan and that's saying a lot. But why on Earth did he fail so miserably to coax anything like a recognizable human emotion out of Scarwid? After an hour or so of watching Faye chop the hair off beat and insult poor little Mara Hobel few movies are simultaneously so ridiculous and so disturbing Scarwid shows up as teenage Christina dressed like the Statue of Liberty and reciting lines from Jean Anouihl's Antigone cute guys and somehow manages to get less believable from that point onward. Maybe Scarwid  Perry decided that portraying Christina as a listless mealymouthed little simp would invite audience sympathy. Actually we wonder if Christina raided the medicine cabinet for the antipsychotic meds that might have calmed her mother down. The explosive motherdaughter confrontation scene late in the film after Joan pulls Christina out of boarding school for canoodling with an apparently nearsighted boy should be climactic  the victim is finally standing up for herself. Instead we cheer Faye on for pushing Scarwid over that end table since we might be tempted to do the same if we were trying to get a realistic reaction out of such a semianimated mannequin. Mommie Dearest destroyed careers and almost everyone deserved their fate.".

We can see how quickly those children had to grow up seeing their mommy breaking apart. We can also understand better to families in agony. This movie was made after a book Christina wrote.

If I were Faye I'd be basking in the glory of giving the most overthetop shrillest bitchiest most manical performance in screen history. This film is based on the tellall memoir by Joan's adopted daughter Christina. However if you have read the book the film version of MOMMIE DEAREST stands alone as one of the worst and most enjoyable movies that scream out What was anybody thinking??? This is basically the plot Joan feels that her movie career is in a donward spiral. She decides to adopt a baby naming her Christina. The rest of the film is just kneeslapping fun. Christina mouths off at Joan. Joan spanks her and locks her in a closet. Joan then attempts to make Christina eat raw meat Christina refuses so Joan leaves it on her plate and announces You will have dinner in your room alone and you will eat everything on that plate! More fun begins when Joan finds a wire hanger in Christina's closet. NO WIRE HANGERS...EVER! Joan screams. This scene is memorable for many reasons...especially Dunaway in a flowing black cape with her face smeared with cold cream and a bandana holding her hair back complete with VERY red lipstick. When Christina grows up Joan hates her even more grabbing her and throwing her on the floor while Christina screams MOMMIE!MOMMIE!MOMMIE! Oh and I forgot to mention the scene where Joan chops off Christina's hair with scissors wailing I'd rather you go BALD to school than looking like a TRAMP! Then there is the heartwarming scene where a drunken Joan chops down all of the flowers in her garden and when she decides to chop down an orange tree she screams Tina! Bring Me The Axe! Another famous line Don't fk with me fellas! This ain't my first time at the rodeo! I could go on and on but I must say that MOMMIE DEAREST is the best bad movie ever. Edward D.

Bulam who has tangled with Tarzan before intends to use the guns to make war on the peaceful Ashuba people led by Queen Melmendi Dorothy Dandridge.Tarzan Lex Barker is unsuccessful in stopping Bulam and his Yurongan warriors and is even thrown over a waterfall and presumably drowned. King Bulam conquers the village and after being rejected by Melmendi he withdraws and his warriors get drunk. Tarzan returns and organizes an uprising after having freed the Ashuban men.When Bulam arrives to check on the situation Tarzan gives his famous yell and the Yurongans are caught off guard. Bulam sees that Tarzan is very much alive and flees in confusion and fear.Tarzan catches up with the husky proud ambitious and greedy African war chief and a knife fight one against one ensues. While a much trimmer stunt double is sometimes visible this is still an exciting screen fight. Bulam manages to knock Tarzan's head against a tree trunk and then pulls out a rather hefty oversize knife that we have seen dangling at his waist for much of the film. The knife is almost in Tarzan's neck when Tarzan grabs Bulam's wrist and causes Bulam to fling the knife away. It lands in some ferns blade side up. Using his legs as scissors Tarzan manages to spin Bulam away and the chief rolls over several times.Here is the part I savor. Bulam rolls over onto the clump of ferns where his knife is projecting skyward. As his ample belly passes over the knife it is shoved into his body. The wicked adventurous risktaking war chief is stunned he has been stabbed with his own knife! Bulam makes several attempts to rise and continue the fight and Tarzan even draws his own knife not certain as to whether Bulam is really done for. But as his head lolls for the last time with the knife partially obscured by all the vegetation the king has rolled into it is certain that Bulam has been vanquished.The next scene shows the warriors being herded into a corral and Tarzan is begged to stay for a celebration but he must go after the gun runners who are even now having a falling out of their own and eventually endangering Jane.".

	schema:reviewBody "Tarzan's Peril 1951 out of 4 Third film in RKO's Lex BarkerTarzan series has the ape man trying to stop a bunch of gunrunners who are selling weapons to a tribe planning to use them by attacking other tribes. With the jungle at such an unrest it's up to Tarzan to try and rescue one of the main tribe's leaders Dorothy Dandridge. Quite a few reviews called this the best of the Barker Tarzan movies and while it's certainly an improvement over the last entry I'd say it still falls a little short of the first one. There's quite a bit of stuff to enjoy here but sadly we're once again treated with a familiar story that just becomes more and more clich as it goes along. I will admit that I thought the film started off with an interesting idea as Tarzan doesn't appear for the first fifteenminutes. Instead of the ape man getting all the screen time the film tries to shine the spotlight on the bad guys who are obviously more interesting the more you can hate them. For the most part I thought the villains were quite evil enough but the screenplay never really made them very fun which was a letdown. The supporting tribes are finally being played by black actors which is a plus but sadly the screenplay doesn't given them too much to do. Once Tarzan Jane Virginia Huston and Cheetah enter the picture it's pretty much all action from this point. Once again Barker is good in the role and I think it's fair to say that he finally gotten comfortable in it. Huston makes for an interesting Jane as she's certainly got the sex appeal but her chemistry with Barker isn't the greatest. George MacReady Douglas Fowley and Glenn Anders all do a nice job in their villain roles. Dandridge is the one who easily steals the film though. Her beauty charm and charisma jump right off the screen but sadly she isn't given too much to do. She certainly makes the most of the part and she makes it more memorable than any other actress would have but at the same time it's pretty sad to see her having to do a film like this. People always want to put THE BIRTH OF A NATION down but that was 1915 and here this film is 1951 and Hollywood still wasn't doing anything for one of the brightest black stars. The other highlight in the film happens when Tarzan must battle a maneating plant. The scene actually manages a few nice tense sequences. The lowlight of the film has to be a hilarious scene where Cheetah is about to be attacked by a huge snake but thankfully Tarzan comes to the rescue. What's so funny is the fake snake that they use and just wait until you get a look at its funny face!".

	schema:reviewBody "TARZAN'S PERIL RKO Radio 1951 directed by Byron Haskin the third of five installments starring Lex Barker as Edgar Rice Burrough's most celebrated jungle hero is by far the most prestigious project to date. An improvement over the previous two entries thanks to some authentic location filming in Africa where much of the Tarzan stories takes place and the casting of George Macready as the most sinister villain thus far ranking this possibly the best in the Barker series. Aside from location sequences mixed with the studio jungle sets TARZAN'S PERIL was reportedly intended to become the first in the series to be lensed in color something that never happened at least for now anyway.Rather than the traditional opening focusing on Tarzan Jane and or Cheta's daily activities which turns up 16 plus minutes into the story TARZAN'S PERIL opens with a native celebration in British East Africa as Melmendi Dorothy Dandridge is made queen of the Ashuba tribe. Commissioner Peters Alan Napier about to retire after thirty years of service witnesses the event with his soontobe replacement Connors Edward Ashley. King Bulam Frederick O'Neal a brutal chief of the Yorango tribe comes to propose marriage to Melmendi but is refused. Later the pounding of drums brings forth a message that Radijack George Macready a ruthless slaver and gunrunner has escaped prison and somewhere in the jungle. Assisted by Doctor Herbert Trask Douglas Fowley and Andrews Glenn Anders as his henchmen Radijack intends on bringing in a load of illegal rifles to the natives. As Peters and Connors approach Trask to inspect their hidden items Radijack makes his surprise attack by shooting them. During their journey climbing a cliff Radijack arranges for Andrews to meet with an accident that handicaps him with a broken leg. Being left there to die Andrews crawls through dangerous territory before grabbing gold onto a log and floating down the river. While canoing with Jane Virginia Huston Tarzan Lex Barker foresees danger and rescues Andrews from a crocodile attack. Taking the injured hunter to a doctor Tarzan having learned from Andrews of the killing of his friend Peters and Radijack's evil intentions Tarzan swings into action to stop Radijack from supplying the Yorango tribe with guns to attack the peaceful Ashuba tribe. By doing so Tarzan faces some perils of his own almost in the manner of a weekly chaptered serial.Making every attempt on bettering this long running series to a point of recalling some highly entertaining adventure made famous by Johnny Weissmuller during his days at MGM the strength to TARZAN'S PERIL rests on well developed screenplay by Samuel Newman and Francis Swann with enough action to hold one's interest. Although routinely made much of it is presented in the manner with some originality. George Macready as mentioned earlier gives a standout performance as the villain. Aside from putting other characters to permanent rest his intention on doing the same to Tarzan finds the jungle hero subdued by his native followers only to somewhat finish him off by having him thrown into water rapids to plunge down from a high waterfall. Other dangers faced by Tarzan is one where he's entrapped inside spiderlike arms of maneating plants a similar situation earlier used in Weissmuller's TARZAN'S DESERT MYSTERY 1943 plus his encounter with a giant poisonous snake that nearly takes Cheta. There's also interesting casting of Dorothy Dandridge as the African tribal queen shortly before achieving immortality for her leading roles as her Academy Award nomination in CARMEN JONES 20th CenturyFox 1954 and PORGY AND BESS Samuel Goldwyn 1959 opposite Sidney Poitier. As with her screen career Dandridge's role comes short yet essential to the plot.The weakness to TARZAN'S PERIL once again falls upon the Jane character this time enacted by the blondish but average acting Virginia Huston. Aside from her short 1950s style haircut and noticeable facial makeup in the Virginia Mayo mode her Jane character isn't dressed in traditional jungle dress tog but white animal skins resembling that of an Esther Williams bathing suit. Unlike previous efforts where Jane takes part in Tarzan's adventures this time Tarzan says Jane go home leaving Tarzan to fulfill his mission alone with Cheta his chimpanzee along for the ride. Jane being off screen for a long stretch does reappear doing housework in her tree house before being face to face with a deadly visitor.While no masterpiece TARZAN'S PERIL comes close to becoming 79 minutes of nonstop action making whatever weaknesses that take place to be overlooked or forgiven. Never distributed to video cassette TARZAN'S PERIL formerly broadcast on American Movie Classics prior to 2000 and finally Turner Classic Movies TCM premiere July 16 2011 has become available on DVD through Turner Home Entertainment. With more Tarzan adventures in the horizon and the slow faze out of Jane before the end of the decade the next installment in the series is TARZAN'S SAVAGE FURY 1952.  drums.".

On the other hand as my friend Dave Sindelar pointed out it's a lot easier to believe that Barker's Tarzan is the son of an English Lord. In any case he was a pleasure to watch in action.There were some minor missteps The chief of the bad guy tribe who wanted to buy guns to conquer the peaceful Ashuba ruled by Dorothy Dandridge looked utterly ridiculous in his headdress which circled his entire head and made it look as if he were peering out of a furlined toilet seat for the duration of the movie. The actor deserved a better costume design than this. Also there was also a completely weird and gratuitous and badly staged fight scene with what appeared to be some carnivorous jungle plants that had nothing to do with anything else in the movie. And the other miscue that stuck in my mind was the odd decision to intercut Tarzan's final fight at the end of the movie with the villainous gun runner Radijek with scenes of Cheeta swallowing a gold watch and burping. That effectively neutralized any suspense and excitement they may have been trying to generate.The big problem with Tarzan's Peril is that the movie lacked a sense of urgency or real forward momentum. Not a lot happens to be honest. But the production values are good the producers made pretty good use of the live footage shot in Africa and the two big fight scenes are well done and the actors do a pretty good job inhabiting their characters.If you have to watch a Tarzan movie for some reason this would be a pretty good one to pick.".

	schema:headline " A Little More Grit Than Usual for a Tarzan Epic";
	schema:reviewBody "Lex Barker's third outing as Tarzan in director Byron Haskin's Tarzan's Peril prepares us for the greater realism of the forthcoming Gordon Scott ape man movies. The villains here display greater evil not only to the heroes but also to our eponymous hero. Any movie that featured scarfaced George Macready as the lead villain promised to be darker and grittier and Tarzan's Peril qualifies as darker and grittier. Although there is no way that Tarzan could bite the vine the Lord of the Apes is almost killed twice. First his unconscious form is thrown over a waterfall and second he is almost stabbed to death by treacherous King Bulam in the finale. This Tarzan movie has the distinction of being the first to shoot sequences in Africa. Now some may point out that the original Johnny Weissmuller Tarzan contained scenes lensed in Africa but those African scenes were originally shot for another feature Trader Horn 1931 with Harry Carey. The Samuel Newman  Francis Swann screenplay resembles a Cavalry versus the Indians oater because the villains are running rifles to rebellious tribesmen. Aside from the casting of Macready as the villain Tarzan's Peril features AfricanAmerican beauty Dorothy Dandridge who went on to star in Carmen Jones and Porky and Bess for director Otto Preminger. Fans of the Batman television show will recognize Alan Napier who played Alfred the Butler as a British game warden. When Yorongan King Bulam and his riflebearing tribesman overrun the peaceful Ashuba tribe Tarzan swings to their rescue. Cheetah pulls an old Charlie Chaplin stunt when he swallows a musical instrument. This Tarzan opus is somehow above the level of previous Tarzan movies but the Ape man still speak in fractured English. Mind you Virginia Houston makes a comely Jane.".

Any movie that featured scarfaced George Macready as the lead villain promised to be darker and grittier and Tarzan's Peril qualifies as darker and grittier. Although there is no way that Tarzan could bite the vine the Lord of the Apes is almost killed twice. First his unconscious form is thrown over a waterfall and second he is almost stabbed to death by treacherous King Bulam in the finale. This Tarzan movie has the distinction of being the first to shoot sequences in Africa. Now some may point out that the original Johnny Weissmuller Tarzan contained scenes lensed in Africa but those African scenes were originally shot for another feature Trader Horn 1931 with Harry Carey. The Samuel Newman  Francis Swann screenplay resembles a Cavalry versus the Indians oater because the villains are running rifles to rebellious tribesmen. Aside from the casting of Macready as the villain Tarzan's Peril features AfricanAmerican beauty Dorothy Dandridge who went on to star in Carmen Jones and Porky and Bess for director Otto Preminger. Fans of the Batman television show will recognize Alan Napier who played Alfred the Butler as a British game warden. When Yorongan King Bulam and his riflebearing tribesman overrun the peaceful Ashuba tribe Tarzan swings to their rescue. Cheetah pulls an old Charlie Chaplin stunt when he swallows a musical instrument. This Tarzan opus is somehow above the level of previous Tarzan movies but the Ape man still speak in fractured English. Mind you Virginia Houston makes a comely Jane.";

Tarzan finds himself as peacemaker between warring tribes complete with racist stereotypes of African people as was common for most of the Tarzan films who've been stirred up by gunrunners. The supporting cast includes Virginia Huston George Macready Alan Napier and of most interest is the casting of singer dancer actress Dorothy Dandridge as Melmendi Queen of the Ashuba although her talents are painfully wasted on this juvenile material. Still as juvenile as the material is I did enjoy the maneating plants and other jungle nonsense. Overall it's nothing classic but decent enough if you're a fan of Tarzan films.".

She is ravishing as Good Queen Melmendi. The director wisely showcases Ms. Dandridge who ignites every scene she is in and makes it special. She is a powerhouse obviously destined for future star potential.Tarzan's Peril is a worthwhile vigorous and fastmoving adventure movie.

	schema:reviewBody "It helps to be in the right mood to enjoy this rather typical nonsense about Tarzan Lex Barker foiling a plan by a villain with a Polish name George MacReady to arm one band of African natives with rifles and Tommy guns so they can conquer another tribe and sell them into slavery or concubinage or something. The name of MacReady's character is Radijek. It SOUNDS villainous doesn't it? And in 1951 Slavic names served nicely as labels for the bad guys although to be sure Hollywood must have been experiencing some conflict over whether to give their heavies the names of Commies or Nazis. At the moment the moguls must be in turmoil what with the Arabs.I don't really think the plot is worth going on about. MacReady sneers constantly and murders his partners in the scurrilous plan one by one in order to steal their share of the loot. Jane wears necklaces by Tiffany and a wraparound sarong out of Christian Dior. Tarzan comes home from the jungle and Jane says Sit down and have some supper just like Dagwood and Blondie or Ricky and Lucy. Their tree house has several rooms one of them with a comfortable table and chairs suitable for wedding receptions and bar mitzvah celebrations. I think I spotted a framed poster of a Marc Chagall on one of the bamboo walls. The bathroom probably has a framed poster too  a yellow rose over the slogan Tomorrow Is The First Day Of The Rest Of Your Life. You can probably read it while on the throne.Of course if you're NOT in a receptive mood the movie sucks. There was some secondunit shooting in Africa. You can watch the stiltlegged water birds gobble down newly hatched baby crocodiles while a jaunty tune plays in the background. Dorothy Dandridge is in here somewhere in a minor part and we don't get to see nearly enough of her. Tarzan not real man. If Tarzan red blooded then Tarzan shed domestic tranquility fling Dandridge over shoulder and swing through tree to someplace else. Company of Cheetah optional.".

The tribe under Queen Dorothy Dandridge refuses but the tribe under King Frederick O'Neal doesn't and the latter subjugates the former until Tarzan straightens things out.MacReady even in far worse pictures than Tarzan's Peril brings his own brand of serpentine villainy for us to savor. His character and Lex Barker have some history so a chance to even things up with Tarzan is too good to pass up. MacReady though is bad news for both Fowley and Anders as well.Seeing Dorothy Dandridge is also a treat she is one regal beauty as the queen of her tribe.

France's past is personal and fears forgetting it while Hiroshima's is communal and while not wanting to forget also wants to move ahead.  For this reason Hiroshima keeps trying to convince France to stay so that they can be in love but France is too preoccupied with its own personal ghost that it cannot share which is why it is a major breakthrough for her when she tells her tragic story for the first time to anyone Hiroshima.  Hiroshima's past tragedy being communal is shared and it wants to share with the rest of the world.  France's tragedy is personal and is only beginning to be shared.  It takes the entire film before the two characters can get to a beginning of something more than their differences and likenesses of tragedy and loss in the past and this beginning is who they really are in the present two people reborn from these tragedies.".

	schema:reviewBody "The comparison between heart break and the Hiroshima bombing is beautiful. The film is about the pain of memories forgotten and remembered. Just as the pain of lost love will be forgotten so too have the horrors of Hiroshima. The scars will always be there but that feeling of pain and isolation as the world celebrates while you mourn will be lost in the past. Lui is helping to rebuild Hiroshima as an architect and Elle has fled Nevers the place of her love affair with a German soldier. The film represents Frech New Wave in it's reaction against the Hollywood style. The plot is reminiscent of Brief Encounter and Casablanca they even go to a bar called Casablanca at one point but the films style is vastly different. Action will jump in time while conversation remains the same the story jumps around chronologically and we are often unsure of where precisely in time we are. The reason it sets itself apart from other new ave films is it's use of style. Jump cuts and screwing with the chronology are not used because they can be but for a purpose. The chronology is off because the scenes are memories acting like real memories and flowing randomly. The cuts help accentuate how little time these two lovers have with each other before they will be parted. An excellent film welldeserved of it's excellent reputation.".

	schema:reviewBody "I. IntroductionThis movie has a strong reputation but I knew very little about this movie before my first viewing. I was only aware that Marguerite Duras a fine writer had produced the original screenplay for the movie and that it was considered a literary gem in its own right. The screenplay is one that you can read and enjoy on its own even if no movie had ever been made from it more on this later.Alain Resnais is the director. I draw it to your attention that this is Resnais' first feature film and apparently foreshadowed the style of much of his later career. What is clear from this film at least that he is a gifted sensitive and unyielding artist. The techniques with which he brings this screenplay to life are rigorous and unflinching. There is love behind what he has done here you can tell he loves this story and he loves these characters.II MechanicsThe movie has only two main personalities. The film follows a brief connection between these two people over the course of approximately 48 hours. It is a very short film but its a very compacted one and all its elements are densely fused together like a diamond or other gemstone. Its aspects are clear fine and bright there is no murkiness or muddle in the ideas of this film. It is not just a rambling 'romance story'. It is literally a movie in which the camera films little more than the memories of two strangersand the emotional conundrums that expand when their owners meet and combine. When each faces the growth of a new relationship. The plot is simple however the emotions are not. Its a complex psychological study and a visual poem.The setting of the film is extremely succinct only a few locations contain the entire movie. The journey is rather through an emotional terrain a journey of these characters' memories. This inner terrain unfolds as does everything else in the film through the dialogue of these two individuals to each other.The characters are a beautiful French actress doing a locationshoot in the town of Hiroshima Japan and a Japanese man she meets there. She has a striking appearance with a face that is both young and old at the same time a body that is slim but wizened. Her aspect is alluring and carefree in some shots but she wears her hair in a mature classic manneralmost severe. She is in Hiroshima for a few days only at most. It is 1959. She is about 34 and married but has allowed herself to be picked up by a sensitive intelligent Japanese man in a bar. He is an architect. They are spending the night together many of the camera's opening shots are of their closelyentwined limbs.Their conversation begins and becomesthe movie. Its initially a lovers' conversation as typically happens between a couple lying in bed after sex. They are talking lazily insouciantly chuckling with one another over this or that comment and playing with each other as they rest. Its a very long scene and takes up almost the first third of the film.What is odd is that the camera doesnt waverand this is what is intense the camerawork thrusts you right into this bed and into every expression exchanged between the couple. There is no retreat or pullingback. There is not a lot of quick cuts between one face and the other either a few extended shots capture it all. Because the faces are so close to each other the two figures are almost one it can be captured in this deft manner.Its an incredibly daring bold ruthless cinema. Very like Bergman. I emphasize it here because it is the filming of the actors' faces as close as feasibly possible that characterizes the entire movie. Their faces are the landscape of the whole film your eyes range and glide over the woman's face in particular which becomes vast and sombre as she relates fragments of her past life to the man beside her under his coaxing. The conversation eventually becomes tormented and agonizing.But you are witness to every muscle tremor every nerve twitch you absorb every expression as it flickers across her beautiful fey complexion. You watch her huge sad brown eyes that gaze into space as she talks about herself. Her smiles turn up the corners of her mouth at times but her face remains wan and stark. She has the ability to display more than one emotion at a time. Excellent casting and astounding performances particularly from this actress. The work it must have taken to get these closeup shots so precise and correctthe effects are mesmerizing.I will tell you briefly that the rest of the plot is very simple the woman rises for her day's filming but her lover who becomes increasingly absorbed and obsessed with her follows her. The last third of the movie is set in the bar they met at the night before where he attempts to convince her to stay in Hiroshima. At the end of the film this is still left ambiguous. There is a montage or two there are flashbacks deployed which help reveal the woman's past up to this trip to Hiroshima.III. MeaningWhat really goes on here? How can a film survive on a construction of only three basic scenes and two characters? Well what happens is that with a human theme of this microscopic focus the addition of anything more than a few basic sets scenes or actions is negligible. Duras rather is exploring their souls. Exteriorality simply doesnt matter. The nature of the relationship between the pair reduces everything else to ornament prelude and ephemera to their contact.What develops the tension is the crucially important dialogue the pair have with each other. Because of the complexity of the verbal revelations it is the dialogue that becomes dominant in this film. Its hard to explain. The two people are merely telling each other stories of how they grew up they talk about where they were the day that U.S. forces dropped the atomic bomb. The man was a soldier in the Japanese army at the time she was a young girl in a small town in France. She had been in love with a soldier who died. Again very simple.But note this when she speaks to this Japanese man a wonderful device is used by Duras and filmed exquisitely by Resnais. She is speaking to the Japanese man but really she is talking to her past lover. So all is not what it seems. Growth is really destruction peace is really war love is really death as seen through the prism of this woman's historythats why she's in Hiroshima. And it is this 'doublingover' and multiplicity of character with its symbol that is the heart of this film.It is a dialogue not just between two lovers but between two people and their pasts. There are surfaces under surfaces. All of the elements are in juxtaposition. All of them are mirrored. All of them are in conflict. All of them are in alignment. The movie swirls with rich intermeshed images symbols allusions and metaphors.For example when the woman speaks of the river Loire that ran by her home you see all at the same time her face the river and from the depths of the river a hand beckoning and it is the hand which is the memory she is recalling when she speaks of the river. This is but a minor example of the care that went into crafting every scene in this film. Its absolutely grand. I cant say anymore without giving it all away.Flaws the one flaw I see in this entire movie is that the dialogue is not always what you would really hear someone speak in real life. The sentences are at times very cumbersome overlyliterate and 'speechy'. It is as if Duras forgot that people dont utter really complex poetic sentences to each other in real life. The screenplay should have been altered just enough to efface this. At these moments it really would have been better to have been reading the dialogue rather than listening to it because it just sounds stilted and frail.And there are times when the poetic images and metaphors are repeated and touched upon excessivelythe density of the layers becomes a distraction in itself. Sometimes Resnais or Duras advances a motif not just two or three times but five or six times redoubling it in only a very few minutes. It would have been better to have a lighter touch in some places. But these are minor complaints.IV ConclusionOverall HMA is an enormously sensitive work of filmmaking. The story itself is moving in a way that should have impact and bearing on everyone because it is all about selfawareness and understanding how our hearts functionthese are experiences that we all share in.TS Eliot once said that April is the cruelest month because it forces new life up out of the cold earth . .  my paraphrase. This is a good quote to keep in mind when considering 'Hiroshima Mon Amour'. The Greeks also said something that bears on this film namely that change is the true nature of the universe. This movie is about selfchange. It is about the cruelty inherent in personal growth in having to shed your bonds with the dead.HMA is a story about being alive and being human. It is about the pain of loving or losing one's love and the greater torment at having to relinquish that pain we sometimes wish to nurse and hold on to. These are sometimes the effects that loving someone has on your soul and I will go out on a limb and say that its never been treated better than in this movie. Perhaps 'Last Year at MarienBad' is a close second.But the emotional signature of 'Hiroshima mon Amour' is wholly unique. The movie is a landmark in cinema.".

Even though it is over more than four decennia old it feels surprisingly new. The reason for this must be the beautiful photography starting with the very first shots of the two lovers and the deliberate moving away from conventional script writing by Marguerite Dumas.

	schema:reviewBody "Hiroshima Mon Amour is brilliantly made and brilliantly acted with a thoughtful poetic script by the great French writer Marguerite Duras. Its images are lyrical disturbing fascinating and its antiwar message is profound and still frighteningly relevant. But in terms of strict entertainment...Any film which begins with abstracted images of the entwined body parts of human lovers slowly becoming encrusted with ash and presumably atomic fallout... and then spends an obscure 15 minutes arguing about the death and disfigurement of multitudes during the atomic bomb blast in Hiroshima and the nature of memory and forgetfulness... well you realize immediately that this movie isn't set up to go anyplace fun. Unless your idea of fun is witnessing someone else's graphic misery without the cleansing catharsis that accompanies a more conventional tragedy. Hey some people enjoy that kind of thing! Not me but to each hisher own.Despite a structure which is famous for meandering through time the film's narrative is fairly cogent and nonconfusing which is a plus. But the central illicit interracial affair between a French actress and the Japanese architect whom she hooks up with during a film shoot in Hiroshima... It doesn't really make any sense. From the tiny acorn of a chance hookup grows a madpassionate love affair based almost entirely on memories dredged from the actress' past which she disgorges to the architect rather like a colorless Scheherezade as she loses all rational connection to the present conflating a youthful indiscretion with a deceased German soldier and her subsequent descent into madness with the nonhappenings surrounding her current Japanese amour. German Japanese... clearly she can't tell these Axis races apart! I understand that the point of the film was not to create strict narrative coherence but rather to delve into some kind of symbolic and psychic clash between this coldyetoverwrought union of a French woman and her obsessed Japanese lover and the horrors of War. But despite some moments which are outright absurdist in effect the overall tone of the film is grinding in its humorlessness. As I watched the characters fatalistically surrendering to their doom all I could think was man that Marguerite Duras must have been a drag to be romantically involved with. I mean the Duras script for all it's poetic symbolism and intellectual brilliance etc etc tells a story of people who are criminally passive and hopelessly clingy. Love seems to transform her characters into mere victims of love of war of life masochistically reveling in their own operatic suffering while doing virtually nothing. As the nameless SHE recalls her own suffering during her madness scraping her fingertips off on the saltpeterencrusted walls of her parent's cellarprison then receiving validation of existence by luxuriously sucking her own blood from her ravaged hands because otherwise she is utterly alone all I could think was... Oh brother! This character is so badly damaged how did she ever manage to get happily married before she embarked on this chance affair in Japan? The imagery is fabulous and intense but are these really human beings that could have plausibly embarked on a journey together? One human being actually because the Japanese architect is little more than a handsome cipher of love... love in this story apparently meaning the obsession that arises from the act of physical copulation an experience which is equated with destruction of the nuclear holocaust variety. So Marguerite Duras clearly had issues surrounding her expression and experience of sexuality. And the film betrays little in the way of empathy either the characters are infused with an undercurrent of intense selfishness as they struggle to connect. HE is constantly delving into HER unhappy past even though it can give neither of them any pleasure or joy. The more HE delves the more SHE becomes hopelessly entangled and the more obsessed HE becomes... until the cold and bitter end.At least in an opera you get to revel in an outpouring of passion! In this bitter pill everything is so cold and humorless... well it really is difficult to understand why people wax enthusiastic over this film so much. There is much here to ADMIRE... but not much to love in my opinion. Except intellectually because the film is awash with symbolism and thoughtprovoking moments. As a viewing experience for the average intellectual such as myself however I felt that once was enough. The time jumping and abstractions and other critically lauded elements of this movie have been done better and more entertainingly by others. Though this is the most emotionally powerful antinuclear statement I've ever seen for which as someone who had much of his family die in the Hiroshima nuclear blast I am profoundly grateful.".

	schema:headline " Deep beautiful devastating extremely personal cinema";
	schema:reviewBody "In my previous paper I said that  bout de souffle was an extremely complicated movie. Well if we compare it to Resnais' Hiroshima mon amour it just seems to be a skilled aesthetic exercise. I think Resnais takes a further step in modern cinema intermingling influences from surrealism modernism and the New Wave of French cinema intimate topics deep and changing characters oneirism unclear limits between reality and mind. His movie is a skilled masterpiece that really needs to be seen twice since its symbolism and action are extremely interwoven. Personally I felt somewhat frustrated the first time I saw it. Indeed I find that Resnais style in this film is too extreme in some ways. He twists action and mixes reality with memories in a way that makes the spectator lose hisher way once and again. On top of that most usually action is extremely slow quite the contrary of his colleague Godard and takes are extremely long. Truffaut did shoot this kind of scenes but his were also agile attractive. Resnais is slow exasperating boring. We must think however that Hiroshima mon amour is a literary film a long shot poem. The script is a literary work of art by Marguerite Duras. Indeed dialogs are like lines in a poem rhythmically broken slow as if they were declaimed instead of simply said. Resnais complements this poetry inserting strongly lyric scenes of the Japanese people and the city of Hiroshima and playing around with meaningful light as we will see later. In my opinion the main topic of this film is memories and how a forgotten dark past can shape our present and determine our future. Basically the film tells the story of a woman who has gone through a painful experience in his youth she loved a German soldier during the occupation of Nevers her hometown in France. This caused despise from her family and her community. This is a story that she has not told ever before. But an affair with a Japanese man while she shoots a film in Hiroshima will wake up her memories. The Japanese man recalls her of her first love let us remember for instance when she remembers the German man hand when she sees the Japanese's  both of them have a similar hair style and color. At some point in the film the Japanese will grow more interested in her life in Nevers he thinks the key to win her love is there and this will unleash harsh flashbacks in the French woman's memories. She has never told anyone as she talks out articulates her memories while they are at the bar she will experience very strong feelings. We cannot differentiate what she was feeling at the moment of the story or what she is feeling now what is a fact and what is a memory. I find very interesting the scene in which they sit together at the bar at some point she takes the Japanese man for her old love. She begins talking to him as if he was so. Her memories take her over and she talks what she feels what she remembers. Light effects are magical she is drowned in brightness while the Japanese man stays in the dark. She talks and talks and Resnais inserts the necessary flashback images. The Japanese at that moment acts as the voice of her own memory he asks her once and again. Until a point when she suffers so dramatically that the Japanese man the real one slaps her in her face to wake her up. Now we find a sharp kind of awakening. While she talked everything was silent. Now everything sound as what it is a bar with people chattering and frogs in the dark stream outside. There are four main elements in the film that spin around the life of the French girl whose name we do not know. Two cities Nevers and Hiroshima. And two men the German soldier and the Japanese man. There is a whole system of connections between these four elements in the center of which is her. Resnais uses the powerful image of Hiroshima the sadness of the place and grief of the people to identify the sadness and grief of the Frecn girl at Nevers. On the other side the Japanese man reminds her of the German soldier. There is not an exact parallelism between the two cities or the two men but connections can be made. We must remember the images of the streets in Hiroshima and the images of Nevers la Place de la Rpublique the churches flowing at the same time. The beautiful but empty Loire the dead fields of Hiroshima. Although we can see some parallelism between the two cities Resnais ends up the film with a scene in which this relationship seems to be much stronger. 'Toi ton nom est Hiroshima.  Et toi ton nom est Nevers en France'. However I cannot figure out what is the exact relationship between the two cities maybe a comparison between grief in the memory and actual grief in the present day. Whatever way it might be Resnais leaves for us a cryptic dark ending that we would have to figure out the best we can depending on the elements he has given us in the film.".

	onyx:emotionText "In my previous paper I said that  bout de souffle was an extremely complicated movie. Well if we compare it to Resnais' Hiroshima mon amour it just seems to be a skilled aesthetic exercise. I think Resnais takes a further step in modern cinema intermingling influences from surrealism modernism and the New Wave of French cinema intimate topics deep and changing characters oneirism unclear limits between reality and mind. His movie is a skilled masterpiece that really needs to be seen twice since its symbolism and action are extremely interwoven. Personally I felt somewhat frustrated the first time I saw it. Indeed I find that Resnais style in this film is too extreme in some ways. He twists action and mixes reality with memories in a way that makes the spectator lose hisher way once and again. On top of that most usually action is extremely slow quite the contrary of his colleague Godard and takes are extremely long. Truffaut did shoot this kind of scenes but his were also agile attractive. Resnais is slow exasperating boring. We must think however that Hiroshima mon amour is a literary film a long shot poem. The script is a literary work of art by Marguerite Duras. Indeed dialogs are like lines in a poem rhythmically broken slow as if they were declaimed instead of simply said. Resnais complements this poetry inserting strongly lyric scenes of the Japanese people and the city of Hiroshima and playing around with meaningful light as we will see later. In my opinion the main topic of this film is memories and how a forgotten dark past can shape our present and determine our future. Basically the film tells the story of a woman who has gone through a painful experience in his youth she loved a German soldier during the occupation of Nevers her hometown in France. This caused despise from her family and her community. This is a story that she has not told ever before. But an affair with a Japanese man while she shoots a film in Hiroshima will wake up her memories. The Japanese man recalls her of her first love let us remember for instance when she remembers the German man hand when she sees the Japanese's  both of them have a similar hair style and color. At some point in the film the Japanese will grow more interested in her life in Nevers he thinks the key to win her love is there and this will unleash harsh flashbacks in the French woman's memories. She has never told anyone as she talks out articulates her memories while they are at the bar she will experience very strong feelings. We cannot differentiate what she was feeling at the moment of the story or what she is feeling now what is a fact and what is a memory. I find very interesting the scene in which they sit together at the bar at some point she takes the Japanese man for her old love. She begins talking to him as if he was so. Her memories take her over and she talks what she feels what she remembers. Light effects are magical she is drowned in brightness while the Japanese man stays in the dark. She talks and talks and Resnais inserts the necessary flashback images. The Japanese at that moment acts as the voice of her own memory he asks her once and again. Until a point when she suffers so dramatically that the Japanese man the real one slaps her in her face to wake her up. Now we find a sharp kind of awakening. While she talked everything was silent. Now everything sound as what it is a bar with people chattering and frogs in the dark stream outside. There are four main elements in the film that spin around the life of the French girl whose name we do not know. Two cities Nevers and Hiroshima. And two men the German soldier and the Japanese man. There is a whole system of connections between these four elements in the center of which is her. Resnais uses the powerful image of Hiroshima the sadness of the place and grief of the people to identify the sadness and grief of the Frecn girl at Nevers. On the other side the Japanese man reminds her of the German soldier. There is not an exact parallelism between the two cities or the two men but connections can be made. We must remember the images of the streets in Hiroshima and the images of Nevers la Place de la Rpublique the churches flowing at the same time. The beautiful but empty Loire the dead fields of Hiroshima.

I don't know if that really means that people didn't like it but it's not a good sign.As for me well..... I've been trying to come up with my reasons and I'm not sure if I can be any more eloquent than it was boring. I try never to use that excuse as the main reason to dislike a film but it was unfortunately true of this film. I was never enthralled or involved with the story or the characters at all the tale that the girl tells in the middle of the film that takes up a big chunk of it made me feel absolutely nothing at all. I simply didn't care for the characters. I also felt like the Japanese guy was never able to tell his story I suppose the opening scene showing the tragedy of Hiroshima is kinda his story but he's definitely not given enough time to express himself. It seems to be to be merely the girl whining for much of the film.I also had a real problem with the abstractness. I have no real problem with abstractness but I like there to be something physical for it to build off of. There was none of that here. It was just abstract for the sake of being abstract. I don't know if I didn't get it but I really didn't care to. I did like the opening scene as I felt it really got its point across well but the rest of the film just didn't follow from it.This is coming across as a really negative review and I really didn't mean it that way. It wasn't terrible just pretty disappointing. The use of flashbacks is pretty innovative and I liked the way it played with image and sound. But the story was weak bordering on nonexistent the characters totally unlikeable and the themes utterly impassable. I don't think I'll check out Resnais' other work as if it's anything like this I don't think I'll like it.".

	schema:reviewBody "The first 15 minutes of this movie were very exciting for me visually thematically aesthetically philosophically and just on a purely cinematic level it sent shivers down my spine. As the movie unfolds it becomes more challenging and less accessible also more difficult to take in on a purely aesthetic and emotional level though it finally has the power to truly engage you intellectually as a complex character study in a novel would. It is an emotional movie despite being so very unemotionally executed  a Resnais trademark from what I can see.It's a funny coincidence that in the last six months or so I've seen quite a few movies featuring women having their heads shaved just after WWII as punishment for having had affairs with German soldiers. This was the most challenging of the batch bringing home the full sense of the horror of oblivion as the Lui character comments on Elle's condition at one point. Hiroshima Mon Amour also reminded me of Antonioni a little rather than the other Resnais movie that I'd seen which was also about memory Muriel ou Le temps d'un retour. Hiroshima evokes Antonioni in a paradoxical way since it was thematically the opposite of the Italians' movies. In Hiroshima a man and a woman were doing the opposite of being alienated from one another though also in a desolate emotional landcityscape that could be superficially called Antonionian.Regarding people calling it Nouvelle Vague in my view this is a one of a kind movie and no more New Wave than Notti di Cabiria is Neorealist. It is also quite obviously a literary movie  halfway between cinema and literature in nature and very unique for it. By the way did Emmanuelle Riva Elle remind anyone even vaguely of Irne Jacob as Veronique in Kieslowski's movie?".

View on the filmOpening with an extraordinary shot featuring the bodies of two people entwined having sex Alain Resnais and cinematographers Michio Takahashi  Sacha Vierny take any shade of lust or sensuality out of the sceneas Resnais and the cinematographers focus on the side angles of the characters bodies dehumanises themand gives the lovers the appearance of being part of the decaying nuclear wasteland that Hiroshima is left in.Originally planning to make the movie be a documentary about the Hiroshima bombing Resnais and editors Jasmine Chasney Henri Colpi  Anne Sarraute give the title a horrifying atmosphere by precisely crossing the French NewWave cool with a documentary grittiness.With clever use archive newsreel footage Resnais looks into the eyes of the victimssurvivors of the nuclear attack.Joining the couple at what might be the final stage of their relationshipResnais superbly expresses the feeling of an aching love that they have for each otherby subtly featuring a gap between the lovers in each of the shots they share.Taking the first step to humanise the entwined couple by splashing a huge grin across Lui's facethe exquisite screenplay by Marguerite Duras gives the exchanges between Lui and Elle an extraordinary feeling of intimacythanks to the conversations that the couple have in bed featuring a raw naturalistic quality. Skilfully going into Elle's past with fragmented flashbacksDuras gradually builds a delicate psychological depth for Lui  Ellewith the flashbacks opening up the remembrance to the pains of love and death that Lui and Elle have each been unable to approach from their pasts.Despite not knowing any French before filming. he learnt it during production! Eiji Okada gives an extraordinary performance as Luiwith Okada perfectly revealing Lui's uncomfortable feelings on Elle's memories of the Hiroshima attack.Along with opening Lui's woundsOkada displays Lui's longing for Elle in a poetic mannerwith Okada detailed body language making the gap between Elle  Lui feel like one of not of inchesbut miles.Slowly facing her memories of the pastan elegant Emmanuelle Riva gives an excellent performance as Ellewhose first love's loss is buried deep within her eyes by Riva. Introduced in the title laying in bed with LuiRiva gives Elle a richwarm chemistry with Luias Riva makes each look that Elle shares with Lui make her question the memories of the past and the relationship that she finds herself inas Lui expresses his amour to Elle.";

	schema:reviewBody "I have avoided seeing this for several decades mainly because I had been afraid to see it. The very word Hiroshima calls to my mind the horrific events of August 6 1945. Having once seen scenes of the aftermath of the bombing on the civilian population one is not anxious to revisit those. My reaction resonates perfectly with the two main themes of this movie the inability to forget and how important life events can easily slip into the fog of memory. Two phrases from the movie underline this duality memory I banish you and the horror of forgetting. It is a horror to forget what happened to Hiroshima at the end of WWII. One would think that that memory would prevent anyone but the most insane politician from even contemplating the use of a nuclear weapon but it's astonishing that the standoff between Kruschev and Kennedy brought us to the edge of nuclear war in 1962. Only seventeen years after Hiroshima the memory had faded to where it was not unthinkable to unleash a more potent hell.The city of Hiroshima provides the central backdrop. At the time this was filmed we see that the city has risen from the ashes in the fourteen years since its destruction. There are some stomach turning images shown from exhibits in the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum and seen during a peace parade but this movie is not a documentary about the bombing but rather a story overlaid on that background. The two main characters are a man and a woman who remain nameless throughout the movie. The woman Emmanuelle Riva is a French film star who has come to Hiroshima to make a peace movie. While there she meets a Japanese man Eiji Okada and they engage in a brief passionate affair. Obviously the man has been wounded by the war but the war has left the woman with painful memories as wellmemories of pleasure that cause pain.The presentation is abstract and symbolic rather than realistic. For example there is a scene that has the man and woman walking along the street at a slow pace where the man gradually falls behind and ultimately fades into the background. This scene is effective due to its deliberate pacing and emotional restraint rather than its realism. However the arty production does not prevent the story from being accessible. The black and white filming is appropriate for the subject matter and is also a good choice since there are so many closeups. I never know who should get credit for impressive cinematography but acknowledgment should be given for that here.Both the leads turn in noteworthy performances. Riva is good at expressing her painful remembrances and Okada is more reserved but no less passionate.I am glad to have finally seen this. I can now scratch it off of my should see list.".

As forgetting means the threat to eradicate everything that once constituted individual or collective meaning of life to let a dream that transcended sorrows the hope elation and joy sink back into oblivion to make the past and thus existence built on it irrelevant. Director Alain Resnais and writer Marguerite Duras set out on a remarkable poetic journey to express these mentioned thoughts and hauntingly succeeded. The viewer becomes witness of the portrayal of intimate insights in the soul of a French actress who has a brief affair with a Japanese but the sincere love combined with the horror of the historic place the couple finds itself in is reason enough to awaken an own personal story of innocence that once resulted in tragedy. The Japanese city of Hiroshima and the French Nevers become symbols of lives where history casts a long shadow and drowns the light. Unless one finds a way to penetrate the darkness and in this rare case two people do.Hiroshima mon Amour is a true piece of art with an emphasis on Duras' literary approach on the subject matter enhanced by Resnais Nouvelle Vague inspired cinematography and editing techniques. The film conveys a deeply melancholic tone through images camera movements restrained music and monotone talk. Resnais adds quick cuts and cross cuts to capture how thoughts and emotions travel from one city to another from present to past from trauma to what preceded it circling again and again around the protagonist's hidden secret in order to unearth it share it finally give it back its importance. In the end it is all about Hiroshima who helps to remember Nevers and Nevers to remember Hiroshima. Hiroshima mon Amour is probably not a film to instantly grab you but it is a lasting one.

The drivers must be very guilty people because they all assume they have in fact hit the Boy in spite of the impossible logistics they are presented with.The Boy is the main character of the film and he's as disturbed as you would expect a ten year old boy who works dangerous con jobs to be. Since his family moves around all the time he doesn't have any sort of perspective of place he hears the names of cities they are in and ones they are going to but they are never more than names to him. The Boy also lacks the usual naivety and faith in others that are usually found in children that age he sees the worst side of the strange adults he deals with and his parents are trashy criminals in addition to being the mastermind of their scam the Father is also abusive and manipulative. The Mother is actually not the Boy's real mother but he still prefers her to his father she may treat him poorly and give in all too easily to his father but she at least occasionally feels bad and tries to make him feel better. The Boy is in the unusual position of being the most intelligent and mature person in most of the encounters he has with others.Although the Boy is disenchanted with humanity he is not disenchanted with all lifeforms he repeatedly tells his baby brother and the Mother about the aliens from outer space.

Unsurprisingly he sees himself as a part of this mysterious but ubiquitous race presumably one that has been placed in Japan by mistake.In addition to the fascinating characterization of the protagonist Boy is also interesting for its experimental style. Oshima experiments with still images and distortions as in the scene in which the Boy wears someone else's glasses and everything is slanted and especially with color filters give scenes tone they wouldn't have otherwise often suggesting the emotions of the Boy quite effectively.Oshima shows Japan as a country striving to find a sense of itself much as the boy does particularly in the scene where Japan's traditional colors of red and white are displayed prominently in the background not on the familiar flag but on a giant Coca Cola billboard. It's also no coincidence that the family exploits automobile traffic and not something more traditionally Japanese.With Boy Oshima managed to make a film that was simultaneously universal in its treatment of human nature culturally relevant in its treatment of postwar Japan's national identity and modernistically rich in its treatment of cinematic techniques.".

Always on the run the family lives in hotels or inns.

There are two constants in his lifehis fantasies about salvation by aliens from the Andromeda galaxy and the company of his little stepbrother whom he regales with talk about the aliens.There's no sentimentality in this movie. With the powerful exception of the very last scene the boy looks out for himself and appears quite tough. At one point he runs away taking a train to some place by the sea. But we get only a glimpse of this place. In the next scene he is back with his parentsbecause one has to assume there really isn't any place for him to go. More than once in this film the family is on the verge of breaking up but instead they continue with their nomadic existence and their scams.So much for traditional Japanese values. The characters in this movie live in a floating world where the old verities don't apply. There are allusions to nationalism and military valor but these are like vestiges from the dim past.One of the side benefits of this movie is that we get to see many views of the Japan of the time. One of the irritants of the movieat least the version that I sawis the subtitles whose white letters are barely legible in the scenes set in snowy Hokkaido.This movie gave me another reason to be grateful for Turner Classic Movies.".

	onyx:emotionText "Boy is a really interesting movie for a number of reasons but chiefly for the astonishing resilience of its main character a boy of ten forced to live a nomadic existence with a scoundrel of a father and a negligent selfabsorbed stepmother.The parents regularly endanger the boy letting him throw himself into the sides of passing cars so they can extort money from the guilty drivers. Always on the run the family lives in hotels or inns. When there's money the father indulges himself in easy living when money's short or things don't go his way he slugs his commonlaw wife or slaps the boy around.

These films were Death by Hanging Diary of a Shinjuku Thief Boy The Man Who Left His Will on Film and Ceremony. Of these five films Boy is considered to be the most straightforward while the others especially The Man Who Left His Will on Film which is considered to be Oshima's most difficult film were entrenched in the traditions of modern Japanese theater and the theatrical craft of Bertolt Brecht. Whereas the other four films have a very limited plot and the cohesion of their various stories seems weak Boy is very cohesive and for Oshima Nagisa at least almost formulaic. However being that this is an Oshima film the film might not be quite as formulaic as it first appears.Like many of his films Boy is grounded in fact. In the year 1966 a couple was arrested for faking traffic accidents they would pretend to be hit by cars while crossing the street and extorting money from the drivers. However what truly struck the Japanese populace as outrageous was that they used their tenyearold son as a tool in this scheme. Newspaper headlines read AccidentFaking Couple Uses Child The Criminal Journey of the Demonic AccidentFaking Couple and Five Months of Strange Devotion in the ParentChild AccidentFaker Scheme. The story faded from the headlines in a couple of weeks but the story rooted itself in Oshima's brain and he was determined to create a filmic version of the odd series of crimes even going as far to scrounge orphanages to find the perfect Boy in the figure of Abe Tetsuo.Starring the always impressive Watanabe Fumio as the father and Oshima's wife Koyama Akiko as the step mother the story unfolds from the perspective of the Boy as his family travels around Japan ripping off unsuspecting victims. Actually it is only the mother and the boy who do the actual ripping off because the father has old war wounds and is unable to work. However this definitely does not prevent him from indulging in the money that his son and wife worked for. Normally living in squalid rented homes after the boy or his mother earns a fair amount of money the father is quite quick to spend it on fine hotels food and alcohol. Being well aware that the boy is unhappy ripping off unsuspecting people and moving from place to place the father tries to instill in his son that his grandmother and friends have already forgotten him and that they were glad that he left. Despite these words the boy does run away a few times but he can never get too far from the oppression of his father.While seemingly not as artistic or complex as some of Oshima's other films Boy does examine such topics as the powers of imagination and guilt driven obedience in good detail. Definitely a film not to be missed by fans of Japanese New Wave Cinema.".

It offers a tensionfilled psychological study of depraved sociopathic parents exploiting each other and their 10yearold son for easy money. The acting is remarkably good particularly on the part of the boy who takes up the family trade with a mixture of gusto and reluctance.The cinematography is wonderful  many shots are taken at a distance from the subjects often through halfopen doors semiclosed blinds and other obstructions. The camera work reinforces the message subliminally that these are dangerous people living on the margins of society and it is best to watch their antics at a safe distance. The film editing is excellent particularly in the scenes where traffic mishaps are being plotted and executed by the family.My only quibble is that the film does at times have a mannered contrived quality. For example it abruptly switches from color to black and white and back again to color. At times as when the black and white footage is quite overexposed the effect is constructive and adds to the strained atmosphere at other times though you feel a little whipsawed to little purpose.This film is as worthwhile as it is off the beaten track. Anyone with an interest in Japanese cinema or aberrant families would do well to see it.".

	schema:reviewBody "An almost full theater for 1920 EVIL RETURNS in a multiplex on the first day itself also a holiday clearly proved that there are still enough fans of horror genre desperately waiting for a good Hindi horror film from long. But unfortunately once again they all are served the same mediocre stuff from the house of Vikram Bhatt which has got nothing exceptional as associated with the brand of 1920. May be the result is such since this time the unrelated sequel is not directed by Vikram but by the debutant Bhushan Patel who mainly falters in the opportunity given due to a poor and unconvincing writing.So even when the film gives you some well executed scenes depicting the possessing spirit it overall fails to impress because of an all predictable soulless storyline penned by Vikram Bhatt himself along with Amin Hajee. As a result 1920 Evil Returns just remains a quick sequel purely made to encash the brand value of both Vikram Bhatt's Horror Cinema and 1920 in this festive season and nothing else. It begins on a confusing note and then continues its uninteresting run till the interval without moving any further as far as the plot is concerned. And then in the second half too it rarely manages to scare you off in its prolonged climax shot well. At times the scary sequences even turn out to be funny instead of frightening when the ghost starts singing songs and keeps laughing weirdly.With the actual twist in the script unfolding only in its last 40 minutes the film relies mostly on repetition and unwanted songs which ideally should be strictly avoided in this particular genre. But as per the routine the director keeps throwing one love song after another at regular intervals into the film and ruins an otherwise decent soundtrack by Chirantan Bhatt including few fine tracks such as Uska Hi Banana Apna Mujhe Tu Laga  more. Apart from the soundtrack the film also has a fine Cinematography which again gets overshadowed by a loud and annoying background score which sounds the same as Vikram's earlier movies.Moreover 1920 EVIL RETURNS remains a hushedup project in its performance department too as no particular actor is able to contribute in the film through his acting skill other than Tia playing the lead role of a possessed girl. Both Aftab and Sharad Kelkar fail to impress mainly due to the lackluster roles given to them and Vidya Malvade simply stands wasted. Further the viewer is not able to find any emotional connect with the sufferers on the screen because of a feeble screenplay which neither establishes Love or Fear in its 2 hours of duration.To put it together after watching 1920 EVIL RETURNS you can easily add the name of Vikram Bhatt in the list of those famous filmmakers who have now found a new style of making films on a fixed Template or Pattern. In clear words after Madhur Bhandarkarand Parkash Jha here is Vikram Bhatt with his new horror film made on a preset template to win over the audience. Now whether you want to be fooled again or not the choice is all yours.".

The story is fantastic even acting by the girl Tia is very good and comparable to 1920 girl Adaah. Music is definitely better with quite a few hummable songs. I think the direction is a bit loose and there are not much scary moments. Aftab is good. I think his role was of a silent and introvert person and he performed it well. Overall a great movie. Do not go by negative reviews and low ratings. The movie is definitely worth a watch. 810 from me.".

Though Vikram Bhatt is not the director of this movie still it has all the characteristics of the bhatt campPlease try new things in horror rather just serving old wine The Exorcist  in a new bottle  1920  1920 returns  each time.";

	schema:headline " The biggest disappointment of this year";
	schema:reviewBody "Heroine... the movie by Madhur Bhandarkar of so many good movies the last one being Fashion. It has been in the news since the day they were hunting for their cast. The whole Aishwarya Rai Bachchan episode Her opting out of the movie the media hyping up the whole issue because of her pregnancy. Ironically this movie shows exactly what kind of 'waves' need to be made in order for a movie to work. It makes me think whether all that buzz prior to shooting this movie was fabricated.Any how I was looking forward to this. As a regular cinegoer I refrained myself from watching the promos because I always want to be completely surprised by a movie I look forward to. When I was at the screening and the first half was about to end I cursed myself for not looking at the promos it was so hard to sit through it. I am a very patient person especially when it comes to cinema I am in the field myself. It felt like someone was torturing me like I was captured in a cell I wanted to leave because of the unbearable screenplay and Kareena Kapoor who can act when given the right movie but this... this NO... this was only Kareena Kapoor crying from start to end in a very not natural and annoying way.The story  Absolutely sorry to say that there was nothing spectacular special or new in this movie. It is Fashion but only this time it is about the movie world. Very simple a successful actress blinded and stubborn natured goes through tough situations and screws up more and more in stead of progressing.Characters  All the characters have been written so badly. I am going to start off with our 'Heroine' Kareena Kapoor. A character can be very interesting if it is described as stubborn hotheaded and impulsive. In this case it was definitely not interesting it was annoying to look at such a character the whole 25 hrs. There is no progression in the character she learns but doesn't use her experience in future problematic situations. The viewer may wonder why am I watching this... oh well there might be a lesson to this at the end of the movie. Yes there is be sane when you get famous. I feel it all could have been told differently and that the character could have been written in such a way that makes us feel pity for Mahi Arora Kareena.Aryan Khanna Arjun Rampal This character was written a little better and also cast well. Arjun Rampal suits the role of a very successful superstar he plays the part with conviction and confidence. In his character there is progression which is nice to see. He understands his mistakes and genuinely tries to change. This pleases the viewers.Angad Paul Randeep Hooda  Angad was a fine character to get to know. He was someone who was trying to help Mahi but lost his patience because of her stupidity Randeep did an excellent job and is surely making it to the list of top actors slowly.The rest  What was the need for all the gay characters in the movie? Not every costume designer is homosexual this is such a stereotype setting. All the celebrities in the movie portrayed to be bitchy selfish and political in order to gain personal success. Really? What was the need it is not exactly like that. Humility exists also in the world of films.Divya Dutta as Pallavi portrayed a stereo type media person who 'supposedly' knows how to get things done. Such an annoying character.Shahana Goswami as Promita was awesome....until the lesbian part of the movie. Seriously what did it add to the story? Nothing it all. I face palmed during the scene Kareena and Shahana were feeling sexy for each other.Ranveer Shorey as Tapanda was great he portrayed the Bengali passionate filmmaker so well that I was looking forward to his scenes constantly kudos! Sanjay Suri as Abbas Khas  He tried to portray SRK in my opinion well no it did not work. Sanjay Suri knows how to ooze charm where was it in this film? SRK has charm? DoP  some scenes were shot well but overall I thought it was a mess the way some scenes were captured.Music  Heroine could have used a chart buster Halkat Jawani being the most hummed song from the album didn't really work for me in the movie. Poorly shot and disappointing choreography by Remo D'Souza.Screenplay  was there one at all? On the whole stay away from this movie it is going to ruin 2.5 hrs of your life and you are going to regret it. The 3 stars I am giving are only for Randeep Hooda Arjun Rampal and Ranveer Shorey. Madhur Bhandarkar has turned me into someone who will now not look forward to his films anymore. I am angry for the way he portrayed the film industry it is not a shitty place! Disappointed ".

This is one of the biggest disappointment of the year after such a hype for this movie. There was no story at all and I was confused what was going on in the movie. There was nothing in it and Kareena was crying all from starting to end. Arjun Rampal was not at all matching to kareena and Randeep Hooda was totally wasted in this movie. The director plotted many emotional scenes in the movie which according to him was supposed to make the audience also emotional but I was more emotional of wasting my money and time for this movie. My rating is 110.".

	schema:reviewBody "Oh my god That was my reaction when I came out of theater watching latest Madhur Bhandarkar film Heroine. I kept wondering Is this the same director who has given movies like Satta Chandani Bar Page 3 Corporate and Fashion?. So at the outset let me say this Please don't watch this movie. And now the reasons.Story There is no story at all. The film is like a pendulum which swings from one direction to other But at least pendulum helps to move the arms of watch. This story does not do any good to the movie. So I must say very badly written. And if the story itself is bad then it is just 23 hrs of cloths foreign shoots and glamorous parties nothing else.Screenplay I am no expert but I can definitely tell the difference between good and bad. And it was bad.Music At one point I actually closed my ears. I found it too loud. It has just added to the sorrows of film.Cast One of the main reasons behind successful Madhur Bhandarkar films is the cast. And not just the central characters but the ensemble of characters gave the required impact to all of his previous films. This is not the case with Heroine. Apart from Kareena Divya Dutta Randeep Hooda and Ranveer Shauri no one leaves any impression. Kareena has done a great job in her portrayal of impulsive moody yet emotional Mahi Arora who passes through turmoils of personal and professional hurdles. But how? By drinking shrieking smoking and crying in entire film nothing else. Additionally the character itself is so confused that at one point you wonder Is there no such thing as self respect or learning from one's mistakes? I mean how can someone be so naive?. Somehow one cannot imagine Arjun Rampal and Sanjay Suri as Superstars. Arjun Rampal in particular has same expression in entire film. Helenji does reasonably good job apart from 12 pronunciations like Heroin for Heroine which I might have heard incorrectly as I was half asleep. Ranveer Shauri dazzles and makes his presence felt probably best portrayal in the movie.To summarize A Classic Example of All Hype No Substance. Don't waste your money for this terrible experience except if you want to sleep in AC for 2.5 hrs.".

	schema:reviewBody "What a stupid movie my wife exploded as we left the theatre in the first half we were at least watching her dresses her jewellery her looks. Second half didn't even have that she fumed.Allow me to elaborate further. This is one badass regressive depressive narcissistic over indulgent formulaic and overall pathetic film. There are at least three occasions when you feel its ended your spirits soar only to have them cruelly dashed as it finds another useless story thread to explore. You feel absolutely nothing for any character least of all the central character who is shown to be rude illmannered insecure manipulative vacillating constantly between career and love needy dependent unprofessional and about emotionally as stable as a suicide bomber at a security checkpost. Am not quite sure what the film was about. Kareena obviously plays the title role constantly seeks what she doesn't have and disregards what she does. Her central motive or motives remain unknown through the film as she runs through commercial films edgier topics and off beat films as part of her career. She runs through different men Arjun Rampal and Randeep Hooda being the primary. She changes staff and endorsement deals with rapid regularity. Her known temperamentalness obviously causes producers and even her heroes to shy away from her. Her endgoal right till the end remains as mysterious as her rise to stardom. If we are supposed to feel sad at all this any sympathy for her then the loud music constant shrieking rivers of tears and some extremely hammy acting by some of the character actors especially the gay designer journalist help nip that in the bud admirably.Normally the central character performance is what usually redeems such a film but despite being a huge fan of Kareena's acting abilities and looks she is saddled with such a hopeless flawed character that nothing can be salvaged from it. The only saving grace if at all is her constantly careening cleavage which provided a few moments of solace. There are so many beautiful things in the industry to explore. I've known artistes to work amazing hours to be ready on time for shots work round the clock on triple shifts to be patient firm never lose their cool. Like Kareena in real life they explore different roles experiment with different looks. But unfortunately in the eyes of the writerdirector this wouldn't have made an interesting enough film and so he gives us a caricature of a human being instead who is deeply troubled psychologically and inflicts mental agony upon the hapless audience as well.

Everything was just right on place with high hopes and confidence that i will witness something fashion like cinema i bought the ticket for Heroine ! ! 15 minutes into the movie i felt cheated.The beginning of the movie itself was confusing i am sure Madhur wanted to try something new this time. Rather than repeating his same old formula of showing his character's life right from the beginning. When you are telling a story there has to be a beginning and there has to be an End and what an end it was. He just rushed through the ending in fact he just rushed through the entire movie. He kept his mandatory elements in the movie ... Smoking  Booze  Gays  Lesbians  Bisexuals and this time Spoiler Alert even cursing which did not help the movie in any way. I was unable to understand what madhur tried to portray in this movie ? that Movie stars are desperate and can go to any level for fame ? or they are way too emotional and lonely among thousands of people ? or they are horny all the time ? Sad thing is  he showed all the actors in the movie who played Actors just the same. Does that mean that there are no inspiring actors in this movie Industry ?? Like Amir Khan  Salman Khan .. The whole kareena kapoor's character was confusing in the movie. I understood Priyanka chopra's character in fashion but i was unable to relate with Kareena's character as to what is that she is. I only felt sad for kareena as to why she did this movie ? I went to this movie hoping i will be witnessing kareena playing a legendary actress role just a modernistic version. All hopes shattered film had no strength a very UN catchy music and the Hoard of his usual caste. The 2 stars for the movie goes to ' Ranveer Shorey ' for his spot on screen presence. Apart from that movie is a mess.I never crib this so much after a movie but next time i will do my research and buy a movie ticket.".

	schema:reviewBody "As the title indicates this is the story of a Bollywood heroine in fact a collection of some episodes from her life and career. People keep on coming in and going out of her life and she finally ends up running away from the arclights and the sounds like Light Camera Action Cut etc. i.e. instead of being a crowdpuller feels better being a part of the crowd. She is indecisive or confused as to what she actually wants from her life  a successful career or a lovefilled life with the man of her choice. And as a Hindi maxim tells  Duvidha Mein Dono Gaye Maaya Milee Na Raam in the condition of being in a fix the person may get neither God nor wealth she finally gets none of them.The way every coin has two sides the same way every world or field has two altogether different sides  one bright one and one dark one. And the socalled realistic filmmaker  Madhur Bhandarkar has typed himself as a filmmaker concentrating on the dark side only of the field he is dealing with in his movie. The problem is that he always takes his audience for granted and wants it to believe whatever he shows as true.Madhur Bhandarkar has not shown any strugglers or acting lessons or a sincerity towards the profession. Instead he has chosen to show only the successful heroes and heroines and their activities involving mudslinging legpulling scoressettling and dirty politics. And just like Fashion he has shown smoking drinking drugconsumption unsocial behaviour in the parties and casual sex both heterosexual and homosexual. Is this all the film industry contains ? Is this the only scenario of a heroine's life ? After spending more than a decade in the film industry do Madhur Bhandarkar and Kareena Kapoor want to tell the world that this is what they experience in this line ? Madhur Bhandarkar has shown that hype is everything and bad publicity is also considered as commercially beneficial. Well this applies to this overhyped film itself.In the beginning sequence of Subhash Ghai's Pardes 1997 Amrish Puri says to a Westerner 'In your country love means LenDen i.e. give and take whereas in India love means Dena Dena Dena i.e. give give give. However Madhur Bhandarkar has shown that in this industry which he himself is a part of there is only give and take. Every talk every gesture every emotion every relationship is artificial and motivated by selfinterest. Well he and Kareena Kapoor know better.Chums and dressdesigners hovering around heroines are shown as speaking and behaving quite theatrically. Every female smokes. Every heroine is addressed by the talking person as 'babes' or 'baby'. Partisan media persons believe in settling their scores with the stars. Awards are negotiated. Heroes' possessive wives decide the heroines of their movies. Heroes do editing themselves cutting the roles of those who do not come to their terms. Heroines devote more time to backbiting or bitching their contemporaries. Well at least this is one fact which is confirmed through Kareena Kapoor's own life because she used to do it with her rival heroines till a few years back. For the rest I am not sure to be fully true. All the same how can I challenge the perception of Madhur and Kareena of their own line of work ? The hardhitting dialogs serve Madhur's purpose best. In one dialog the ruthless PRO Divya Dutta of the heroine says that in the filmline if you utter a lie with confidence people consider it as truth. And in another scene one partywoman says to her talking companion that who is not a fraud in this film industry. Well Madhur do you say the same about yourself too ? The movie leaves such an impression only.Technically the movie is good. Music is in line with the mood of the movie. Though engrossing the movie appears to be too long and the director seems to have attempted to cover as many facets of the cineworld as possible which has after a point made the movie as burdensome. It has got reduced to a collection of some good and some bad sentences instead of being developed into a wellwritten impressive article.Performances are all good. Even those who have been forced by the director to go over the top have not disappointed. Kareena Kapoor has taken her heart out to invest in this movie and this movie seems to be a take on the real life and career of this aging actress completed 32 years. All others have done well. Special praise is deserved by Divya Dutta as the PRO and Helen as the heroine of the yesteryears. In addition to the entertainment value it's the performances and the track of Helen which can be considered as the pluses of this movie. Madhur Bhandarkar's realism seems to be a different name for tried and tested entertainment only.The biggest thing that the movie subtly conveys is the dictum which I learnt quite late in my life  'When you chase things they run away'. When the 'heroine' in the movie chases love love runs away from her and when she chases success in career success runs away from her and all of her efforts prove to be counterproductive only in the end. Hence the great lesson rendered by default is never to run after anything. Let it go after a point.Finally I conclude my review with a dialog of the PRO to the heroine in a scene  'Either you manipulate others to your benefit or get ready to be manipulated yourself'. Madhur Bhandarkar seems to have grasped the essence of this dialog and this time he has manipulated.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ans Be Madhur Bhandarkar and show people your Heroine! I went in with GREAT expectations. Frankly I was prepared for both Masala and sleaze which justifies itself in the context and boy was I in for a MAJOR disappointment.I am a big fan of the emotions which are so freely expressed in Bollywood movies but more than anything Im vowed by actors who encompass poise and calm even when they are super charged and hyper. Perfect example Sridevi in Chaalbaaz.Sadly thoughpoise and grace were the last thoughts on the mind of our leading lady in Heroine who looked desperate to fulfill herself with Mahi Arora rather than the other way around. It was plain pathetic. 10 minutes in the movie and I was impatient restless and ready to jump out.Only the money spent on VIP tickets kept me seated! Overall the movie was a huge let down since Ms.Kapoor couldn't portray what was required. Now please crying is not acting.Chain smoking is NOT acting. Doing Halkat Jawani is not acting.And going all natural without any makeup on is definitely not acting. Rather it is called lowering the bar to suit your skills which couldn't be lifted in about 12 years of working as a sleaze bomb very effectively. Heroine was a crime! for Madhur Bhandarkar resume and definitely ripped other very capable actors of any true chance to show their genuine skills. Ranvir Shorey was outstanding the real treat in the movie. I thought he was my reward for buying the tickets  but his role was mercilessly cut short. Helen was the grace and poise Madhur and Kareena could learn from! Randeep Hooda has a very strong presence on screen and he doesn't falter.Again we were deprived of any entertainment he promised to bring. As for Arjun Rampal  he is one of the finest actors today. That poise  grace and devilish good looks combined with smooth emotional ranges that he can portray were wasted as he like all of us in theater had to cope with the shrieks from Ms.Kapoor. Her presence in the movie ensured other far far superior actors were misused throughout the movie.So what was lost in those earpiercing shrieks? Let me try and explain from the perspective of a viewer looking for pure entertainment WITH intelligence believe me I don't take easy if a movie makes fun of IQ and reasoning powers of it's viewers and Heroine manages to do both INTENTIONALLY. First who were the characters and just who was Mahi Arora? How did she reach such heights of popularity being an outsider in the industry which is what we are told through a brief voice over at the beginning. Second our protagonist tapes her intimate moments to bring the extra kinky out right and this is the same woman who refuses to sleep with the producer of her movie during the most desperate of times and hence deals final blows to her declining career ONLY to leak sex tapes later to boost publicity of a much smaller film.But the sex tapes have no sex in them or did I miss out the best part of our Heroine's acting skills?. Third she cannot portray a prostitute in a Bangali film but wait isn't she a Superstar or are we being told that Bollywood actresses can become Superstars without being able to act? Didn't that hurt Kareena? Fourth she is Bipolar and this is where Kareena has convinced and deceived people she gets away with the shallowest of performances and gathers praises as well BECAUSE she is bipolar and this is a state of mind she has portrayed in ALL her movies so far save for Refugee and Jab we met. Fifth why couldn't the movie focus on some other characters AT ALL? or are we being told that success mantra is different in movie business and that AList stars which we are told our Protagonist is don't have any emotional support systems like people who support their professional lives? The whole idea contradicts itself. In fact by taking focus away from ALL characters and meekly putting it on the protagonist  the director takes a leap of faith and commits artistic suicide! Only the Bgrade industry wannabes resort to tactics that our director shows a superstar applying to her life and career. Sixth when the water goes way above her wise head Mahi decides to run to Europe and live an anonymous life. So how does she ditch her bipolar self? or was she using it to shriek good senses out of her man? what again? Sorry.Seventh Okay she is a headstrong and stupid person which is finally something believable headstrong okay but none of the reallife leading ladies are stupid. Kareena herself has tactically topped all rankings with very flat acting skills or did everyone forget that the movie was supposed to be about a washed out Onehitwonder? Eighth and I'll end with this Kareena reportedly would get a cut from movie profits. Now did she influence the production to showcase herself ONLY because let's face it movie business is way too suave mature and professional or how can you explain the multimillion dollar worth of business it garners every year? than what this movie tells us and Mr.Bhandarkar is a smart man with however many clichs  his previous movies have still been way better!. He wouldn't kill his film by giving Kareena 2.4 out of 2.5 hours of screen time now or would he? I also noticed some bizarre behaviors while Heroine was being heavily promoted on all TV Channels which definitely made me watch the movie case of sheer irony or Madhur Bhandarkar tried to pull a smart one on us?badtasteinmouthwhenIthinkofit kind of awful. I do swear that I'd stick to my earlier vows and would never ever watch a Kareena starrer again".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Heroine";
	schema:reviewBody "Kareena Kapoor has always been involved in the largest blockbusters in Bollywood and starring with the 3 Khans in films like 3 Idiots with Aamir RA.One with Shah Rukh and Bodyguard with Salman has made her one of the few who have collaborated with all of them in their respective hit films OK so RA.One kinda disappointed. Heroines have never had it easy in Bollywood when compared to the heroes and Kareena is currently at the top of her game but can she like Vidya Balan and Priyanka Chopra marquee her own movie? The answer is probably yes but if the self referential Heroine is anything like the title goes she's going to need a better story and tighter script in order to make an impact.The first look at the trailer and various promotional clips may have one thinking this is somewhat like Chopra's Fashion also written and directed by Madhur Bhandarkar in terms of charting the come and go ups and downs and longevity of the career of a fickle fame driven industry replacing the world of fashion with that of the movies and also taken a leaf out of Balan's The Dirty Picture in centering the story around an actress who is willing to risk all for a shot at fame and sustaining her position at the top of the cut throat food chain of an industry but Bhandarkar's film now could have benefited from attempting to craft a more psychologically complex film or taken a deeper more provocative look at the industry itself. It missed on a lot of marks set and the film huffed and puffed throughout before finally collapsing on its own weight near the finishing line.It's not that Kareena Kapoor didn't try to save the film. Her star power is going to be the box office draw here and she did her best for a role that had her dig deep into emotions especially plenty of negative ones as her character of Mahi an actress on the cusp of decline gets embroiled pretty much on her lack of solid relationships with the opposite sex her insecurities both personal and professional and her conduct with the various spectrum of her industry from peers to rivals and the handling of the media. Not a chance goes by where Mahi passes on being catty to those she dislikes and in the ways of the world what you do unto others others will do unto you. Kapoor showcases her acting chops and while convincing she's clearly let down by the plot of the movie.Beginning quite inexplicably with Mahi being thrown out of a car then barging into a police station wanting to lodge a report it goes into flashback mode to chart how we got to this stage showing the world Mahi inhibits with the glitz and the glamour and the movie premieres and after parties where stars will cajole with directors and producers to chart their next project. Transitions seemed to be in a hurry and scenes were haphazardly strung together probably in eagerness to show how confused and broken the state of mind and emotion is for Mahi in the fame game despite showing nonchalance to the competition from amongst peers.Heroine also got bogged down by the none too perfect relationships making Bollywood seem like a cesspool for broken relationships infidelity and adultery where actors prey on actresses in their hotel rooms and trailers and sports personalities become adamant in wanting an equally famous actoractress hang by their arms. Its look into the behind the scenes in the industry just scratched the superficial surface of casting for a film where a string of hits will continue to bring on big budgeted projects and plenty of money spinning endorsements while duds or not being in the limelight for whatever reasons good or bad will slowly see one's career starting to fade. These again are something known through the grapevine and need not be repeated ad nausem in the film just to chalk up screen time.Subplots were also haphazardly added into the film making it more bewildering and sprawling a lot more than necessary. An arthouse film and its eccentric director and acting muse almost threatened to run away with the film from the mid point providing what would make up to be the better bits in the movie because it was getting tiring witnessing Mahi perpetually drunk or high or just plain down most of which were self inflicted. The self destruct button was clearly set by Mahi in her burning of bridges and destruction of any semblance of friendship and relationships formed and the story was stuck in this rut of self torture before trying its very best to turn things around in what could have been a wake up call to the transience of life haphazardly assembled for the last few scenes as Mahi sold her soul for one more hurrah.In what would be reel life imitating real life there's an unfortunate tragedy in the production of the film that would likely bring the curious to watch Heroine just like how a scandal boosted Mahi's hopes of a comeback. Heroine could have been a fascinating look at the industry and a great showcase for Kareena Kapoor which unfortunately didn't turn out to be as well as expected and kind of a disappointment.".

	onyx:emotionText "Kareena Kapoor has always been involved in the largest blockbusters in Bollywood and starring with the 3 Khans in films like 3 Idiots with Aamir RA.One with Shah Rukh and Bodyguard with Salman has made her one of the few who have collaborated with all of them in their respective hit films OK so RA.One kinda disappointed. Heroines have never had it easy in Bollywood when compared to the heroes and Kareena is currently at the top of her game but can she like Vidya Balan and Priyanka Chopra marquee her own movie? The answer is probably yes but if the self referential Heroine is anything like the title goes she's going to need a better story and tighter script in order to make an impact.The first look at the trailer and various promotional clips may have one thinking this is somewhat like Chopra's Fashion also written and directed by Madhur Bhandarkar in terms of charting the come and go ups and downs and longevity of the career of a fickle fame driven industry replacing the world of fashion with that of the movies and also taken a leaf out of Balan's The Dirty Picture in centering the story around an actress who is willing to risk all for a shot at fame and sustaining her position at the top of the cut throat food chain of an industry but Bhandarkar's film now could have benefited from attempting to craft a more psychologically complex film or taken a deeper more provocative look at the industry itself. It missed on a lot of marks set and the film huffed and puffed throughout before finally collapsing on its own weight near the finishing line.It's not that Kareena Kapoor didn't try to save the film. Her star power is going to be the box office draw here and she did her best for a role that had her dig deep into emotions especially plenty of negative ones as her character of Mahi an actress on the cusp of decline gets embroiled pretty much on her lack of solid relationships with the opposite sex her insecurities both personal and professional and her conduct with the various spectrum of her industry from peers to rivals and the handling of the media.

However 'Heroine' is one huge mess. Think of it as a disastrous fusion of his aforementioned films with Bollywood as the backdrop. Poorly written caricatures lacking in focus the film doesn't seem to be able to make up its mind.Kareena Kapoor in the title role hardly impresses at all. It doesn't help that the character is halfbaked and onedimensional. Perhaps Bhandarkar was aware of Kapoor's limitations and had the voiceover of a pointless reporter character one of the most annoying features of 'Heroine' dictate how the viewer is supposed to feel. Talk about spoonfeeding. Even fine actors like Divya Dutta and Lilette Dubey aren't given much scope mostly due to horrendous writing. The only acting that stands out is that of Shahana Goswami. Her track would have been a nice addition if it weren't for the pointless lesbian fling conclusion. Exactly what was Bhandarkar trying to say here? Apart from Goswami Govind Namdeo is likable too.The songs are just as dreadful. The execution is mediocre. Sound design is awful. The sex scenes are laughably bad. Were Bhandarkar and Kapoor shooting themselves up with heroin to make 'Heroine'?".

But what catches your eyes is the presentation of the film and a really good performance from the lead actor Kareena Kapoor. Bebo gives her best shot as Mahi Arora and is utterly convincing as a manic depressive heroine who is on a downward spiral. The scenes involving her as smoking drinking and popping antidepressant pills leave you breathless. It's safe to say that Bebo has given a role of a lifetime in Heroine. Otherwise Bhandarkar paves the same nails as he did in Fashion with Heroine. He throws in a lot of clichs and caricaturish characters in Heroine too. These clichs are so longdrawn and get too tiring at some point. The movie drags in the second half just like Fashion and the impact of a hardhitting cinema is largely missing at that point. Salim Sulaiman did a great job of composing some hearttouching music like 'Saiyaan' along with a raunchy number 'Halkat Jawani' in which Bebo oozes with sexiness. Watch Heroine only for Bebo! You won't be disappointed at least with her performance. I give it 310.".

Even though i am not a Kareena Kapoor fan I'd admit that after 'Jab We Met' this is going to be among one of her most noticed performances as there are few scenes which she has carried out with utter perfection. The constant use of 'babes' and the word 'shits' gets irritating after sometime. A one time watch is what I'd call it. And in my opinion Priyanka in Fashion  Kareena in Heroine ".

Even though i am not a Kareena Kapoor fan I'd admit that after 'Jab We Met' this is going to be among one of her most noticed performances as there are few scenes which she has carried out with utter perfection. The constant use of 'babes' and the word 'shits' gets irritating after sometime. A one time watch is what I'd call it. And in my opinion Priyanka in Fashion  Kareena in Heroine ";

	schema:headline " Heroine  Are Critics Mad?";
	schema:reviewBody "P.S. Let me clarify a few things first! I am not a Kareena Kapoor's aka Bay Bow's fan or even an admirer of her Zero Image! i.e. Size Zero Figure. The last movie of hers which I liked was Mujhe Kuch Kehna Hai. After hearing it from different friends and colleagues and reading from some of my gurus and friends from Blogging fraternity I was convinced that apart from Kareena Karoor there is nothing much in the movie to watch! And this might be the reason why I planned to watch it to see how good has she evolved as an actress and has she really stopped her hamming style and oh so sexy pouting looks. Anyways I was surprised! Not by the movie but by the people whom I used to consider sensible and critically sound when it comes to movie making and Hindi Cinema. This is amongst the very well made movie of the current times. I agree to the fact that the movie has nothing much to offer subject wise or story wise but when it comes to direction dialogues and acting. It is really an impressive attempt by Madhur Bhandarkar who does not need any introduction. There is not much to tell about the story of the movie. It's simple yet predictable. People initially also related Heroine with Angelina Jolie starrer GIA  1998 but that's not the reality at all. Let me quickly get back to the reason why I am attempting to write this kind of review for Heroine. First  To all those people critics and cinegoers who think that this movie has nothing but Kareena Kapoor please get yourself seriously treated. There is a huge list of amazing performers who stole the show and performed astoundingly. Arjun Rampal is a volcano of talent if utilized properly. Right from the days of Moksh he has the ability to perform complicated roles. And this time he is over the top his outburst after the party where Kareena insults his wife is natural. The other scene stealer is Randeep Hoda. This guy is a surprise factory  watch him interacting with Kareena in the party where he makes the move and then watch him breaking up with Kareena. Spell bounded. Sanjay Suri is always adequate with his eyes and expressions when it comes to any role! The guy must be offered more roles! He will surprise you in post interval with his tone looks and authoritative style. The best part of the film is when Kareena goes to Ranbir Shorey. That scene is amazingly shot. Ranbir Shorey as Tappan Da is flawless. He comfortably reminds of those self made Bengali directors who ruled the Hindi cinema back in late 70's and early 80's crisp blunt and appreciative. Shahana Goswami is great in small but strong appearance. The aftermath of her and Kareena's encounter is amazingly shot and acted! Divya Dutta is getting typeactress! But here she performs really well. Govind Namdev as Rashid Bhai doesn't have much dialogues but you can feel his presence with his expressions. Helen's scenes will show simplicity and experience of a veteran. The other scene which is the highlight of the movie is when Shahana takes Kareena to a brothel with her. The communication which takes place there simply tell the real world of those red light alleys. Smartly penned Last but not the least Kareena has really performed well. She looked psycho hot manipulating simple and broke. After all whole film rested upon her shoulders so she had to perform apart from flashing her skin which she did quite well. Niranjan's dialogues are clap worthy. Screenplay is strong. In a way Heroine is a combination of different scripts of Madhur Bhandarkar's earlier releases like Chandni Bar Page Three and Fashion. But all in all a nice entertaining fare!".

	schema:headline " With an abrupt ending it keeps hanging between a comedy drama and satire.";
	schema:reviewBody "There have been few good movies made on the subject of a common man being caught in the ugly vicious circle of the corrupt system prevailing in our country. Shyam Benegal gave us Well Done Abba on the same theme in 2010 and last year we had Chala Musaddi Office Office based on the famous TV series revolving around the same common man who always becomes the victim in this corrupt bureaucratic system.GALI GALI CHOR HAI is also another project made on the similar lines which revolves around a middle class family of Bhopal with only 4 members. There is a retired father Satish Kaushik a son who works in a bank Akshay Khanna his wife who is teacher Shreya Saran and a young modern girl Mughda Godse who is a paying guest living with them like a family. Their difficult time starts from the moment they refuse to give one room of their house for the Election Campaign Office of a reputed contestant. But the matter even gets worst when the elderly father after his refusal to the leader gives the same room to the opposition's contestant instead. In frustration the first party starts creating complex situations for the family with the help of local police which further leads to a much serious allegation towards the climax.Interestingly there was no ANNA MOVEMENT when the two movies mentioned above released in the past years. But now after ANNA being known to every single person of the nation the subject certainly has its own reach and relevance in the present context. So in that way director Rumy Jafry chose the right plot and starcast too to impress the common man watching the film. However once again it is the execution which somehow is not able to make the desired impact on the audience. And for this I would like to blame its childish second half and a very strange or unintelligent conclusion which takes the film to simply nowhere in the end with an abrupt finish.GGCH starts off pleasantly with many light sequences and some well written one liners too. But as the common man gets into trouble it prolongs the things without any solid base and then later goes on to add many silly sequences in its second half diluting the good impact made by its first hour. Particularly the scenes related with the bag and two funny terrorists following Akshay should have been treated in a better way with at least a little logic. Still the film didn't seem to be that bad until the climax when it suddenly finishes off just with a few slaps without giving any entertaining or interesting solution for the situation. In other words it all ends in only a few seconds as if the director was told on one fine day that we have to finish the shooting today itself and they did it as instructed on the spot.Making a simple film is a difficult job and Rumy Jafry tries to do the same successfully only in bits and parts in GGCH. The initial sequences of how Police can easily be used to tease a common man are well enacted and directed. But in its later reels the film loses the grip and keeps hanging between a comedy drama and a satire. Many subplots remain deliberate and underused like the tension between AkshayShreya scenes at the Ramlila stage and the plot in which the hero acts as Hanuman in the local Ramlila after his job hours. Particularly the Hanuman angle which was also promoted in the promos remains completely ineffective and useless. Nevertheless in the soundtrack it does have one well written title song sung by Kailash Kher who is also there in the song and a catchy item number Channo featuring Veena Malik of Big Boss fame.In the performance section Akshay delivers a fine act but I still couldn't find anything new in his common man. Both Shreya Saran and Mughda Godse are simply there as the representatives of the opposite sex with nothing great to do in the entire film. Satish Kaushik is entertaining along with Annu Kapoor who comes up with the best performance in the film as the corrupt police officer. Amit Mistry impresses once again and Vijay Raaz remains the same in a brief role.In the end I would like to say that Yes we all hate corruption and want to get rid of it as soon as possible. But what's the use of making such unimpressive and directionless films which try to encash the burning topic in the name of comedy. Frankly I could only enjoy a few sequences in its first hour and some dialogues in the entire film and the rest was just like another lifeless movie made around the common man which you might enjoy watching only on DVD after its home video release.".

Shyam Benegal gave us Well Done Abba on the same theme in 2010 and last year we had Chala Musaddi Office Office based on the famous TV series revolving around the same common man who always becomes the victim in this corrupt bureaucratic system.GALI GALI CHOR HAI is also another project made on the similar lines which revolves around a middle class family of Bhopal with only 4 members. There is a retired father Satish Kaushik a son who works in a bank Akshay Khanna his wife who is teacher Shreya Saran and a young modern girl Mughda Godse who is a paying guest living with them like a family. Their difficult time starts from the moment they refuse to give one room of their house for the Election Campaign Office of a reputed contestant. But the matter even gets worst when the elderly father after his refusal to the leader gives the same room to the opposition's contestant instead. In frustration the first party starts creating complex situations for the family with the help of local police which further leads to a much serious allegation towards the climax.Interestingly there was no ANNA MOVEMENT when the two movies mentioned above released in the past years. But now after ANNA being known to every single person of the nation the subject certainly has its own reach and relevance in the present context. So in that way director Rumy Jafry chose the right plot and starcast too to impress the common man watching the film. However once again it is the execution which somehow is not able to make the desired impact on the audience. And for this I would like to blame its childish second half and a very strange or unintelligent conclusion which takes the film to simply nowhere in the end with an abrupt finish.GGCH starts off pleasantly with many light sequences and some well written one liners too. But as the common man gets into trouble it prolongs the things without any solid base and then later goes on to add many silly sequences in its second half diluting the good impact made by its first hour. Particularly the scenes related with the bag and two funny terrorists following Akshay should have been treated in a better way with at least a little logic. Still the film didn't seem to be that bad until the climax when it suddenly finishes off just with a few slaps without giving any entertaining or interesting solution for the situation. In other words it all ends in only a few seconds as if the director was told on one fine day that we have to finish the shooting today itself and they did it as instructed on the spot.Making a simple film is a difficult job and Rumy Jafry tries to do the same successfully only in bits and parts in GGCH. The initial sequences of how Police can easily be used to tease a common man are well enacted and directed. But in its later reels the film loses the grip and keeps hanging between a comedy drama and a satire. Many subplots remain deliberate and underused like the tension between AkshayShreya scenes at the Ramlila stage and the plot in which the hero acts as Hanuman in the local Ramlila after his job hours. Particularly the Hanuman angle which was also promoted in the promos remains completely ineffective and useless. Nevertheless in the soundtrack it does have one well written title song sung by Kailash Kher who is also there in the song and a catchy item number Channo featuring Veena Malik of Big Boss fame.In the performance section Akshay delivers a fine act but I still couldn't find anything new in his common man. Both Shreya Saran and Mughda Godse are simply there as the representatives of the opposite sex with nothing great to do in the entire film. Satish Kaushik is entertaining along with Annu Kapoor who comes up with the best performance in the film as the corrupt police officer. Amit Mistry impresses once again and Vijay Raaz remains the same in a brief role.In the end I would like to say that Yes we all hate corruption and want to get rid of it as soon as possible. But what's the use of making such unimpressive and directionless films which try to encash the burning topic in the name of comedy. Frankly I could only enjoy a few sequences in its first hour and some dialogues in the entire film and the rest was just like another lifeless movie made around the common man which you might enjoy watching only on DVD after its home video release.";

	schema:reviewBody "The Urban Legend franchise returned with this straighttoDVD installment but this time a supernatural spin was added to the series. While it's a decent idea unfortunately it didn't work. The main problem was that you never really got the sense that anything supernatural was going on to begin with. In the Final Destination films all the deaths were made to look like freak accidents yet you always knew that they weren't just accidents but that something supernatural was at work. It was the complete opposite in this movie. Despite constant reminders that the ghoulish Mary might be lurking about most of the deaths still seemed like they really were just freak accidents. As if they weren't the result of something eerie but instead the result of extreme stupidity on the characters' part. It didn't help that the majority of the victims were thin stereotypes dumb jocks and their airheaded girlfriends. Basically I never felt like Mary was much of a threat.Storywise the film left a lot to be desired. For one there's no relation between this film and the previous two UL films which was disappointing. Even Final Cut which had a new story and a new set of characters was still somehow connected to the original Urban Legend. Also the script for Bloody Mary felt disjointed at times. It's like they were more concerned with getting from Point A to Point B without much consideration to story. For example a subplot early in the film where the jocks suspect a character of seeking revenge because of a prank just went nowhere and was forgotten after a few minutes. And then there are a bunch of seemingly important characters introduced during the first half of the film only to be forgotten during the second half as if they never existed. On the acting side the cast was barely okay. In the grand tradition of Bfilms the heroine Kate Mara was the only one who showed any signs of promise with the rest of the cast displaying community theater performances. Especially Ed Marinaro who apparently never learned to act after his buff body and good looks faded away.This movie was an obvious attempt at trying to revive the UL films by adding elements from such thrillers as The Ring and The Grudge. But taking ideas from other films shouldn't come as a surprise for this series since the first two Urban Legends were ripoffs of Scream and Scream 2 what's next? An Urban Legend set in a hostel?. That wasn't entirely a bad thing since out of the dozens of Scream ripoffs the UL films were the only good ones. They were fun and they added their own unique spin. Sadly the same can't be said for Bloody Mary which does nothing fun or unique with the premise. And it certainly never comes close to being eerie or creepy like The Ring or The Grudge for the reasons mentioned above the supernatural element wasn't established well enough and Mary is nowhere near as scary or even interesting as Samara or Kayako. She comes across more like a angry Goth girl with bad makeup. The film could have worked if they had a director who could have made Mary's scenes more chilling and atmospheric but instead they're just dull uneventful and predictable. One of the film's biggest offenses is that it completely betrays the title. The film has nothing to do with the actual legend of Bloody Mary or what she supposedly does when summoned. Rather than base the film on true Bloody Mary legends they come up with a lame story of their own involving a prom from 1969.I didn't hate the movie like I thought I would but I also didn't enjoy it as much as I should have. I will say that Bloody Mary is at least worth checking out for the spider scene alone. That was the film's one true highlight.".

Sadly the same can't be said for Bloody Mary which does nothing fun or unique with the premise. And it certainly never comes close to being eerie or creepy like The Ring or The Grudge for the reasons mentioned above the supernatural element wasn't established well enough and Mary is nowhere near as scary or even interesting as Samara or Kayako. She comes across more like a angry Goth girl with bad makeup. The film could have worked if they had a director who could have made Mary's scenes more chilling and atmospheric but instead they're just dull uneventful and predictable. One of the film's biggest offenses is that it completely betrays the title. The film has nothing to do with the actual legend of Bloody Mary or what she supposedly does when summoned. Rather than base the film on true Bloody Mary legends they come up with a lame story of their own involving a prom from 1969.I didn't hate the movie like I thought I would but I also didn't enjoy it as much as I should have. I will say that Bloody Mary is at least worth checking out for the spider scene alone. That was the film's one true highlight.";

Another gripe I have is that there are certain parts of the movie that go on for too long without an appearance by Bloody Mary. As a fan of the horror genre I found this movie decent but not great. I thought the first two Urban Legend movies were better because they kept you guessing. However this installment did a better job at basing the deaths on urban legends than Urban Legends Final Cut. I would recommend Urban Legends Bloody Mary to fans of the genre but not to people who only like Oscar quality films.".

The acting is terrible and the situations that some of the characters are put into are completely stupid and you'll find yourself screaming at the TV screen. But as the movie progresses some of the deaths become quite interesting and one in particular makes your skin crawl. When you look back at some of the stupid situations and deaths you actually quite enjoy laughing at them and wonder if they were put there for that purpose but they probably weren't. The main character Samantha is very annoying sometimes as is her brother but towards the end they become somewhat likable and you don't really want them to die as much as you did in the beginning.The direction in the movie is sometimes really good but other times quite terrible. Some of the camera angles used are... interesting but also very distracting and the atmosphere in areas such as the graveyard and the school basement is all wrong. The soundtrack is too quiet and doesn't provide any scares at all so it doesn't really feel like a horror movie.Apart from all the negatives the movie was enjoyable and good to watch with some friends. I'm sure it will inspire other filmmakers to use the bloody Mary legend in their projects and maybe breath new life into the story. 810".

A prankgonewrong takes place in the attic of a high school involving a girl named Mary. The guys responsible for the prank assume her dead and lock her body in a trunk. Cut to present day. A group of teenage girls are spending the night having a slumber party telling urban legends to pass the time all leading up to the infamous Bloody Mary legend. On their third and final bloody Mary chant the girls end up getting kidnapped by some jocks who are performing a revenge prank mainly on a girl named Samantha. They all return safely a little shaken and confused after the bizarre event. But our main character Samantha begins having visions after the prank mainly of Bloody Mary  and people start to die off. Is it all a joke or is Bloody Mary back to take revenge? It's up to Samantha to uncover Mary's origins and stop the vengeful spirit.When I heard about this sequel I was thinking Okay okay  this might be decent. And for the most part it was. I saw the DVD at a local retail store and decided to buy it because I was curious. This film has nothing to do with the other two films at all this one is much more supernatural rather than a slasher mystery. The acting was decent not perfect but it passed. I enjoyed Lambert's Pet Sematary and I unlike most people enjoyed the sequel as well. The script for this film is predictable the audience pretty much knows what actions the characters will take before they actually do it. The cameraworkcinematography was alright for a straighttovideo release and the special effects were just okay they unfortunately come off as a little bit corny in some of the sequences especially the sequence that took place between Mary and the teenage boy at the motel. But hey I wasn't expecting this movie to be perfect. The spider scene was actually pretty creepy looking if not a little cheesy too. The deaths were quite creative and original I'll give it that.To sum things up Urban Legends Bloody Mary is a mediocre but semifun horror sequel. It's not great it's really not bad. It's just somewhere right in the middle. I suppose it could've been worse. If you enjoy supernatural revenge movies along the lines of Pet Sematary or if you like Lambert's previous work you may want to check this out. It's flawed and predictable but overall entertaining. There's no need to see the other two films though because this one has nothing to do with them. 510.".

Considering how deceiving sequels usually are I must say that director Mary Lambert who's also responsible for the excellent Pet Sematary and Pet Sematary 2 did a great job again. This second addition to the franchise is quite refreshing since it introduces a supernatural threat. Hello Mary Lou Prom Night II did pretty much the same thing with the slasher Prom Night. This kind of twist may discourage some but I think innovation is better than stagnation. Once dared by friends at a younger age I myself have tested the Bloody Mary myth. Therefore when came the time for the movie to build tension as Bloody Mary gets pronounced for the third time in a row I felt nothing. There wasn't even a mirror involved even though every version of the story I've heard does. xecutionwise I guess you cannot beat Candyman. Indeed the flick focuses more on its loyalty towards the first two movies. As it was the case with Urban Legend and Urban Legends this movie is about kids becoming urban legends themselves through death. This time around though it seems Mary's ghost is after them. Therefore most of the murders are being committed by an invisible entity Final Destination style. All of them must have looked really good on paper. Unfortunately the execution lacks subtlety. Budget restraints are this movie's biggest issue and it shows through most visual effects. The no name actors featured here give the movie an authentic feel. Kate Mara and Robert Vito play two teen aged heroes and they are actually not two times older than their respective characters a rarity in horror movies. Rebecca Gayheart doesn't make an appearance this time and the same applies to Loretta Devine. Somehow the need was felt to replace her with a similar character. Tina Lifford plays a purposely stereotyped and omniscient pothead. She's handled her scenes nicely and made me laugh. OverallUrban Legends Bloody Mary might just be the best outcome possible in a franchise that got repetitive right at part two. It combines two sub genres slasher and ghost story while holding strong links with the original.".

	schema:headline " Bloody Mary? more like Revenge of Mary";
	schema:reviewBody "After seeing this movie I came to ask myself why this movie was called Bloody Mary. Besides them showing how she died and her getting revenge on the people that hurt her by killing their kids nothing else has to do with the story of Bloody Mary. The majority of the movie is people being killed one right after the other. They needed to go into more depth about Mary. Also instead of them saying Bloody Mary in a well lighted room they should have done it in the bathroom with the lights turned off and facing the mirror the way it's suppose to go. I have heard many versions of the story but I'm pretty sure she was suppose to be pregnant....OK so at the end we find out that Billy was the kids stepfather wow big surprise who killed Mary by accident. So he goes and tries to kill the brother and sister. We see the brother die but at the end the sister doesn't even look sad. I have heard that they cut out the part when they run into each other at the hospital. Why would they do that? It kind of makes the ending look stupid.Anyways it's kind of cool the way that the people die but nothing's a mystery. You know what's going to happen before it happens. If you're extremely bored and there's nothing else to watch I suggest this to waste some time before a show comes on.".

I was disappointed that there was only one scene with a mirror. I was disappointed that the girls chanted her name thrice IN THEIR ROOM with it completely lit up. Mary wasn't supposed to be drugged and locked in a box she was supposed to be killed in front of a mirror.

	schema:headline " Better than the second a decent addition to the UL family but lacking in the execution of the BM legend.";
	schema:reviewBody "Spoilers are present in this review.Being a supernatural buff and having a deeper understanding of the Bloody Mary legend than the average person I have to say that I was pretty excited to see this movie come out. I've sifted through volumes of material on her alleged origins and couldn't wait to see what Mary Lambert of Pet Sematary fame had in store here.The movie places Mary's death in the 1960's at a high school in Utah. It doesn't explain why she appears in mirrors or address the larger issue that the legend itself existed long before the 1960's. It seemed less an attempt at being creative with the legend and more an excuse to make another UL movie. Granted this won't bother the average moviegoer who probably isn't even aware of the Bloody Maryesquire legends that date back to colonial America and some loose tieins even before that. Still it did detract a little from my enjoyment of the film.That said the film definitely sells the legend as it's portrayed... and unlike the first 2 UL movies the big shock twist ending this time is that there really IS a ghost... and a human killer as well. Overall the plot while fairly predictable was enough to keep me interested throughout. There was of course the gratuitous reference to the other UL films but short of that no other tieins. The characters are all teenage stereotypes with no depth and there's plenty of gratuitous eye candy like the 3 girl pillow fight at the beginning.The direction of the film exceeds the capabilities of the script. The dialogue is wooden and contrived as one would expect from a directtovideo sequel. It's obvious that Mary Lambert had big plans for this one but the script and the acting just couldn't come through for her. It's also clear the style is heavily influenced by recent supernatural thrillers such as The Grudge and The Ring... there are plenty of sharp cuts and audio tricks used throughout and even Mary herself seems to borrow a little from Samara and a little from the creepy dead woman in The Grudge. The scene where Mary crawls out from under a hotel bed in particular reminds me of the woman descending the staircase. There's even a slight touch of demon possessed Regan from the Exorcist in Mary's ghostly visage.I enjoyed the film was slightly grossed out at parts but not really scared or even anxious after watching it. It's tough to do that to me though. I think it's at least a semifaithful portrayal of one of the modern variations of the legend and it's rather satisfying to finally see Mary in some form. And if I may say she's quite a little hottie before her unfortunate... incident. I think it's a better UL film than Final Cut was and I was quite satisfied that Mary herself was a part of the film and not revealed to be a psycho student dressing up in a silly costume a la Scream and the prior two UL movies. The pacing is a little slow sometimes but then the first half hour of Pet Sematary is quite slow as well and I love that film and the dialogue is a little wooden... but overall this is a decent film. If you're a big horror film fan it's definitely worth buying. If you're curious about Mary or enjoy a casual spook flick rent it or buy it used. So long as you aren't expecting the definitive movie about Bloody Mary you probably won't be disappointed with it. If you are... well you'll have to keep waiting.Or you could turn off the lights stand in front of the mirror and give her a call to ask about it yourself...".

	schema:reviewBody "Now this is interesting. This is interesting indeed. Perhaps the theories on cinema desensitizing the masses are true. Case in point I would have physically assaulted and crippled most of the characters in this film myself. Were I a main character watching everyone else die it wouldn't phase me. Hell I'd call out Bloody Mary a few times and ask her if she wanted help. Note  that sounds like sarcasm. It's not.Mary was a high school student accidentally killed by the football team players who dropped some pills in her drink. Fast forward 30 years later a new set of girls one of which is the film's heroine get pills dropped in their drinks and disappear by this generations jocks who are also selfabsorbed delusional morons who thrive on the microcosm of high school popularity.But now Mary's back and she's taking revenge. So in other words the evil killer ghost is doing mankind a favor and also poses no threat to the heroine in fact you could say she's taking revenge for herself and the heroine. So I'm sitting here watching a horror movie where I can honestly and without sarcasm ask Why do they want to stop Mary? Mary's victims  I hated them. Every one of them. I hated them to the point that I was verbally criticizing the film that the deaths weren't gruesome painful and horrible enough to give a satisfying finale to these pricks. Needless to say this makes suspense impossible. To go back to Hitchcock's bombunderthe table analogy I was throwing rocks at the thing hoping to make it go off early. Screw suspense just kill 'em.Now be careful because the criticism isn't so much that I hated the characters. It's the fact the movie continues on as a normal horror movie and treats the suspense as if I cared about them. If I actually liked the characters sure I would have flown with it as the films stands. More so I think it would have been very interesting if the film acknowledged that the victims were complete unsympathetic losers and found an alternate means of getting suspense by introducing an additional layer of conflict  one that actually threatens Samantha and no the surprise ending that doesn't surprise us doesn't count. Actually let me address the ending of the movie a little bit further because it is quite hilarious it's supposed to be a surprise ending and yet it's part of a typical cinematic formula. If you haven't figured out the ending by the film's midpoint you haven't seen enough movies. Here's a hint Luke I am your father. Then again if the movie had the brains to go into more provocative concepts it wouldn't have a lot of the lame dialogue it has especially in the beginning of the film. Since we're in the postScream era of horror enter the false layer of sophistication by having the characters mention the Clive Barker film Candyman. So the film has convinced me the kids have seen one movie? Zipadeedoodahday! I was hoping it could convince me they had a life too.Complaints aside Mary Lambert can be a great director and this is apparent in fleeting glimpses in Urban Legend Bloody Mary.

	onyx:emotionText "Now this is interesting. This is interesting indeed. Perhaps the theories on cinema desensitizing the masses are true. Case in point I would have physically assaulted and crippled most of the characters in this film myself. Were I a main character watching everyone else die it wouldn't phase me. Hell I'd call out Bloody Mary a few times and ask her if she wanted help. Note  that sounds like sarcasm. It's not.Mary was a high school student accidentally killed by the football team players who dropped some pills in her drink. Fast forward 30 years later a new set of girls one of which is the film's heroine get pills dropped in their drinks and disappear by this generations jocks who are also selfabsorbed delusional morons who thrive on the microcosm of high school popularity.But now Mary's back and she's taking revenge. So in other words the evil killer ghost is doing mankind a favor and also poses no threat to the heroine in fact you could say she's taking revenge for herself and the heroine. So I'm sitting here watching a horror movie where I can honestly and without sarcasm ask Why do they want to stop Mary? Mary's victims  I hated them. Every one of them. I hated them to the point that I was verbally criticizing the film that the deaths weren't gruesome painful and horrible enough to give a satisfying finale to these pricks. Needless to say this makes suspense impossible. To go back to Hitchcock's bombunderthe table analogy I was throwing rocks at the thing hoping to make it go off early. Screw suspense just kill 'em.Now be careful because the criticism isn't so much that I hated the characters. It's the fact the movie continues on as a normal horror movie and treats the suspense as if I cared about them. If I actually liked the characters sure I would have flown with it as the films stands. More so I think it would have been very interesting if the film acknowledged that the victims were complete unsympathetic losers and found an alternate means of getting suspense by introducing an additional layer of conflict  one that actually threatens Samantha and no the surprise ending that doesn't surprise us doesn't count. Actually let me address the ending of the movie a little bit further because it is quite hilarious it's supposed to be a surprise ending and yet it's part of a typical cinematic formula. If you haven't figured out the ending by the film's midpoint you haven't seen enough movies. Here's a hint Luke I am your father. Then again if the movie had the brains to go into more provocative concepts it wouldn't have a lot of the lame dialogue it has especially in the beginning of the film. Since we're in the postScream era of horror enter the false layer of sophistication by having the characters mention the Clive Barker film Candyman. So the film has convinced me the kids have seen one movie? Zipadeedoodahday! I was hoping it could convince me they had a life too.Complaints aside Mary Lambert can be a great director and this is apparent in fleeting glimpses in Urban Legend Bloody Mary. The visual style is always interesting and I adored some of the roaming camera moves through the empty corridors of the school  very stylish very atmospheric if only the script had the same level of sophistication as this simple really simple yet effective technique. At her best Mary Lambert can deliver some truly haunting and disturbing imagery as seen in Pet Semetary particularly the final confrontation of the film stands out in my mind.

Here we have the third instalment of the Urban Legend franchise this time changing it up yeah such a smart idea. Instead of the UL usual stalk and slash story's this time they're brining a supernatural aspect. To be more specific Bloody Mary. Thrilled? I think not. When the movie ended I was kind of lost for words. I was a big fan of the original. With it's smart script great setting talented cast and more than enough scares it was an instant classic. The second addition Urban Legend Final Cut was nowhere near up to the standards of the first but it was entertaining enough and a decent sequel. This however is catastrophic. This was only made for the sake of having a trilogy.The movie has so many flaws and plot holes it's just too hard to name them all. I would also suffer a severe head pain actually trying to go through the movie again  it sounds terrifying just thinking about it  but for all the wrong reasons. If I had to pick one thing that stood out the worst it would have to be the story. Bloody Mary? come on give me a break. Seriously. The third Urban Legend should have been a slasher fright fest. Going back to the true original style of the first. Though I know it would have never measured up to it's first I would have probably respected it a lot more. The story is just lazy. It lacks any real spark. It's like they read one of the most boring takes on the several Bloody Mary stories and turned it into a film.The second flaw would have to be yep you guessed it the terrific acting. Man was it bad. Every single actor was bad. When I say everyone  I mean everyone! Not one of these Z listers has a decent shred of good acting abilities in them. This made the film appear cheap and unprofessional. All I wanna know is who did the horrific casting job? They should be fired! All in all this film was more than below average. More so in fact that it doesn't even deserve 1 star. It's a terrible piece of film and should be avoided at all costs!".

This felt like a lowerbudget Final Destination with attempts at originallooking kills. The originality comes from the deaths looking like they're urban legends actually happening. I will admit that the scene involving the mirror and spiders was very creepy and effective even gruesome. The other urban legends weren't so memorable and a few were actually amusing not necessarily a bad thing. Bloody Mary herself was not really scary to me even sometimes looking ludicrous. If the rest of the horror had been to the level of the mirror scene it would have been a much stronger movie. I was surprised at how good the lead actors playing brother and sister were. They looked their age and were believable. Not so much for everyone especially the big blonde jock with the kid haircut. I saw the surprise coming a while away and the whole last act was kind of boring and felt too long.Rating 4.5 out of 10 Average".

I saw the surprise coming a while away and the whole last act was kind of boring and felt too long.Rating 4.5 out of 10 Average";

The loss of the PENSACOLA is prescient in a way because her successors the very real AKRON and MACON which had yet to enter service when the movie was made were subsequently both lost at sea in storms bringing an end to rigid airships in the U.S. Navy.

The movie shows excellent closeup film of the ship mooring at Lakehurst N.J. as well as her experimental trapeze which allowed an aircraft to moor to the ship while in flight. This feature was incorporated in AKRON and MACON along with a hanger to stow the planes aboard. These two the biggest in USN service at 800 feet could each carry 34 planes. The planes could be captured on the trapeze brought inside and then launched from their trapeze. An amazing sight to see!".

	schema:reviewBody "While Dirigible 1931 is notable as Frank Capra's best early film the real credit for making something that was both a huge hit during the early years of talking pictures and an old film that will interest even today's jaded action movie fans should go to Editor Maurice Wright. Wright had to assemble this early blockbuster from what Capra shot and what the U.S. Navy provided in the form of stock and promotional footage. He did a great job and you rarely are aware that you watching a movie let alone a fictional drama. The story is a historical concoction mixing elements of Robert Falcon Scott's sledding disaster at the South Pole and Nobile's illfated North Pole expedition in the airship Italia. It is likely the producers of The Red Tent 1970 borrowed heavily from Capra's technique when they dramatized the crash of Nobile's dirigible for their film. The destruction of the fictional dirigible The Los Angeles is the most interesting sequence in the film but the Navy's promotional footage is also quite interesting particularly to viewers 75 years later. There is extensive coverage of operations on the first USS Lexington which would be sunk during WWII The Battle of the Coral Sea. The rest of the simulated action stuff leaves something to be desired but was no doubt quite credible to viewers at the time of the film's release. I wouldn't pay much attention to complaints that the backstory is lame and boring. It features a preKong Fay Wray. She is younger and has her natural darker hair color. As such I think you will find her about as beautiful as any actress in film history especially in profile. Apparently Capra quickly figured out what he had with Wray as he makes extensive use of closeups during her scenes a technique that would not really come into fashion until the 1970's. And Wray exhibits considerable acting talent in these scenes earnestly sincere as the wife of a gloryseeking Navy pilot. And since you can't take your eyes off her any complaints about scripting and content are pretty much irrelevant.Then again what do I know? I'm only a child.".

All of these things cost much money. The U.S. Navy's use of airships was so brief that this film also marks one of the few stories about this chapter in our military history.This film proves that Capra was also adept at high intensity action directing for 1931 as well his usual characterdriven morality plays that he became so wellknown for.The one thing that is the most striking to me about some early talking pictures of which this is one is that they have hardly any music score. This is true here and only adds to the isolated feeling in the scenes of the doomed expedition struggling to escape from the frozen tundra. Plenty of sound effects in the scenes of the doomed Pensacola going down but no music. In fact the film even uses a few silent film style narration cards.Anyway in spite of this film dating from 1931 it has aged really well and doesn't seem too dated at all. A nice actionadventure film. The print they showed on TCM on television was in very good shape even the sound was strong in most places. Yes the love story seemed tacked on but there are thousands of films in the history of Hollywood that could have survived artistically with their romantic subplots probably inserted at the insistence of cigarchewing studio bosses to get the female market jettisoned. In any case this movie is quite entertaining and Worth checking out.".

In the 1930s the Navy purchased some of these airships from the Germans and also made some their ownall of which eventually crashed! Some of this was due to pilot error and some of this was due to the weaknesses of the American designs. So since the use of these enormous gasbags was limited to a very short period of time there just isn't all that much information about them.

One of the airships in the film the Pensacola did not exist while the Los Angeles was an actual airship.So back to the film. The aerial sequences are generally quite good and a lot of actual footage was rather seamlessly integrated into the filmin particular the amazing Aviation Day sequence where two dirigibles and many nonrigid airships fill the screen. Also while a bit ponderous the Antarctic scenes were well made and interesting. BUT the gratuitous romance just got in the way of the film and made no sense.

Holt attempts to do it via dirigible and Graves tries the conventional way by ship and sea plane. In between them there's a girl of course Fay Wray.

Lots of aerial footage of Holt commanding the dirigible and Graves as a pilot move the creaky plot forward. The film was actually based on a real life incident and adapted by Jo Swerling and Dorothy Howell based on Frank Wead's story. As in many films from this period an obligatory romantic subplot is tacked on which kind of detracts from the film. Fay Wray is Helen Pierce Graves' wife. The script fails Wray as she acts discombobulated throughout the film. She lives Graves but can't stand the danger he readily embraces. Meanwhile good guy Holt who plays second fiddle offers a shoulder to cry on and rescues the big lug Graves on top of it but he doesn't get the girl. OK as entertainment but a notch below most of Capra's efforts. 12 of 4 stars.".

	schema:reviewBody "Here's the sequence that led to this in my life I read about the Scott disaster an amazing story. Then last night I saw the 1958 film of it an extraordinary story and an interesting film. For those who don't know the story it is of a British expedition to be the first to the south pole. They were beaten by a month by a Norweigian explorer and on the return lost their lives. They made extraordinary errors but they were loved by the Brits because well because they were so heroically aristocratic and gentlemanly in their bearing. This story was huge just huge.It was huge enough to serve as the basis for this film which I saw following the 58 UK film. That film showed the sleds as pulled by humans as cooking with certain pots as the sleds with odometer wheels as certain surely genuine clothing. It shows a man dying of wounds after being pulled in exhaustion another knowing his fate was sealed and going off into the cold to die in sacrifice. We have all that here.This is three films in one two of them palatable. I usually get annoyed at Capra but this is before he developed his sugary world for us.One film is of a crew wrecked at the south pole and having to recreate the doomed Scott voyage in evocation of that great adventure. Keep in mind that this was only 20 years before and its over 75 years since this film!Another is an equally amazing adventure sequence. The story here is that the top dirigible pilot and top plane pilot Frisky are buddies. They plan a joint trip to the pole. The sequences that have these two flying are still darned impressive today three quarters of a century later. The flying cameras are great. The flying balloons are shown with convincing reality. If all we had were the shots of the real facility and its devices and sailors this would be worth it. The third story grows to take over the thing. Its the story of Frisky's wife played by Fay Wray a couple years before King Kong. She's upset that Frisky is away so much doing his stunts. The dirigible pilot is his best friend and in love with her. While Frisky is on his way to the pole she plans to divorce Frisky and marry his buddy. Naturally Frisky is saved by his buddy making a dangerous flight over Antartica and he generously arranges to hide the affair knowing that Fay has discovered her love for her husband. All this is rather horrible in every dimension.But see it for the other two components. Darn worthwhile.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have about 3 feet of shelf space in my library devoted to books about airships and I don't think any of them use the term dirigible except derisively in referring to lighterthanair flying machines. Dirigible comes from the French dirigible ballon meaning steerable balloon. For English speakers the proper term and the one used by the U.S.Navy is airship but apparently the director and writers for DIRIGIBLE didn't know that. Airship is not used once throughout this interesting if seriously flawed film. There's a lot about airships the director and writers didn't know. For example in one part of the story USS Los Angeles in her proper persona is shown flying over the South Pole to rescue some downed aviators from a Ford Trimotor crash. Since the pole lies in excess of 10000 feet above sea level and since none of the Navy's four rigid airships were designed to fly higher than 3000 feet high such a project would have been totally impossible. The Germans in WWI had some ships designed for as high as 20000 feet but our Navy never did.Well despite all the wrongheadedness of the story USS Los Angeles manages to be the star of this movie and upstages all of the human cast. In the course of the film USS Los Angeles plays a dual role. First as the fictional USS Pensacola which was destroyed in a hurricane while flying on a harebrained project to the South Pole. This was no doubt inspired by the real fate of USS Shenandoah which was destroyed over the U.S. middlewest while on an equally harebrained project. Later in the story as herself USS Los Angeles is sent to the South Pole on the already mentioned impossible rescue mission. Some of the events involving the downed aviators seems to have been suggested by the real troubles of the ill fated Scott expedition to the South Pole of 1912. There one of the explorers who was being almost literally carried by the others went out of the tent and died to spare his comrades. Incidentally Ford Trimotors were used by the early U.S. polar expeditions but there were no crashes involving them. There was one air crash but it occurred near the shore and was not a Ford Trimotor.There were a number of great scenes possible and impossible in the film but inevitably we come back to poor Fay Wray in the thankless role of the wife who can't abide her husband's adventurous career as a Navy pilot. While her romantic entanglements are boring us silly we are also given the impression that the U.S.Navy had a whole fleet of rigid airships. In a scene near the beginning we see what looks like a number of airships flying in formation. If this didn't involve camera trickery those other airships were blimps not the big rigids. In a brief scene it might be hard to tell the difference. At no time during the roughly ten year period beginning about 1924 did the U.S.Navy have more than one rigid airship in commission. The Congress kept such tight purse strings on the Navy that they could only afford enough helium to keep but one flying!".

	schema:reviewBody "For those interested in the history of aviation the artful integration of old Navy footage of the Los Angeles airship a Germanbuilt Zeppelin which was the 4th aircraft to cross the Atlantic including footage of the experimental underside mooring mast used for docking an airplane in flight and the Lakehurst field and hangar all offer a wonderful slice of history. This footage and the parts of the film which show the interior of this airship and its mockups and use are wonderful and many other elements provide a wonderful view of what the world looks like through a 1931 lens. It is interesting to see how some things parts of the Navy ships do not look all that dated while other elements are radically different. This alone makes this film a very worthwhile and trumps all the issues and complaints below. For many this alone makes it worthy of a 9 out of 10 although for those without this interest it is more like a 6.At the story level there are a lot of holes. There is an inconsistent and totally unbelievable romance kludged on with a Fay Wray performance that doesn't work and will leave you scratching your head. This part is a 1 or 2 out of 10. Like other scripts which take a little bit of current technology and try to extrapolate to spin out a story without really understanding the technology some parts seems pretty silly today but this was the view from 1931. The writing seems to be oblivious to the service ceiling of the craft and the limitations imposed by the large surface area and low speed of the craft when exposed to winds especially as channeled by terrain. However in the era shortly before the end of serious airship use they were losing them at an alarming rate and the Los Angeles was one of the few that survived to be decommissioned and disassembled. SPOILERS BELOW  The plot has issues. Bravado and personal agendas trump planning on important expeditions and military Navy ops a failing shared with Capra's 1929 Flight also starring Holt and Graves which stretched bravado and credulity even further. Here we are to believe that Frisky upon successfully reaching the South Pole but having dropped most critical supplies to lighten the load decides to chance a landing on an unknown surface in an area where no rescue would be possible per their orders. We are then given scenes at the South Pole which do not represent conditions at the pole. My uncle was at Byrd Station and it gets pretty cold there with average summer temps close to 30C and it appears that the north and south hemispheres are both in summer so we are also left to wonder if they understood they are reversed south of the equator. When a rescue does come instead of sending people down the rescue lines they parachute in from a very low altitude for dramatic effect but then get pulled back in by the lines. Okay you get to see cool parachuting footage from 1931 so I guess its okay. Overall a great slice of history with contemporary use of now archival footage but the plot and romance drag the ratings down.".

	schema:headline " Almost a remake of Lost Zepplin from 2 years earlier this is a spectacular film hurt by the soap opera of home life";
	schema:reviewBody "Very similar to a film called the Lost Zeppelin to the point its almost a remake that was released two years earlier this is a story of an attempt to reach the South Pole via dirigible. The story begins when the US Navy tries to get into the good graces of a polar explorer who is planning yet another trip to the pole. The navy enlists Jack Holt a dirigible pilot to impress the explorer in the hopes of his considering using one of their ships to make the trip. Holt seals the deal when he agrees to bring along a plane which can hook and unhook from the airship. The trip goes badly and ends in disaster. However it sets the stage for a later expedition and a shot at redemption.Spectacular large scale production this is a grand adventure if some what slow moving tale of pushing the envelope in the name of adventure and science. Filmed with the cooperation of the navy this film has some absolutely stunning images of planes and airships in flight. The sets are truly amazing and it's not really clear as to what's real and what's not. The look of the film will blow your mind.What is less thrilling is the soap opera between the airplane pilot and his wife played by Fay Wray. Wray is very good as the wife who loves her husband but can't stand all of his macho antics. The scenes between the husband and the wife and even Holt and Wray Holt is the husbands best friend are pure soap opera well acted but still soap opera. I'm sure the reason the romantic scenes were inserted for the women in the audience but the scenes kind of stop the film and diminish the rest making the film seem much longer than its 100 minute running time.Still the film really is worth seeing. It's a grand spectacle and adventure that they don't make any more. It will knock your socks off.As to similarities with the Lost Zeppelin you have the same goal the clash of friends the wife of one of the men being unhappy in her marriage a crash needing rescue and a few similar points. I wouldn't go so far as to say that Dirigible steals from Lost Zeppelin so much as remakes it with a few significant changes.".

The story begins when the US Navy tries to get into the good graces of a polar explorer who is planning yet another trip to the pole. The navy enlists Jack Holt a dirigible pilot to impress the explorer in the hopes of his considering using one of their ships to make the trip. Holt seals the deal when he agrees to bring along a plane which can hook and unhook from the airship. The trip goes badly and ends in disaster. However it sets the stage for a later expedition and a shot at redemption.Spectacular large scale production this is a grand adventure if some what slow moving tale of pushing the envelope in the name of adventure and science. Filmed with the cooperation of the navy this film has some absolutely stunning images of planes and airships in flight. The sets are truly amazing and it's not really clear as to what's real and what's not. The look of the film will blow your mind.What is less thrilling is the soap opera between the airplane pilot and his wife played by Fay Wray. Wray is very good as the wife who loves her husband but can't stand all of his macho antics. The scenes between the husband and the wife and even Holt and Wray Holt is the husbands best friend are pure soap opera well acted but still soap opera. I'm sure the reason the romantic scenes were inserted for the women in the audience but the scenes kind of stop the film and diminish the rest making the film seem much longer than its 100 minute running time.Still the film really is worth seeing. It's a grand spectacle and adventure that they don't make any more. It will knock your socks off.As to similarities with the Lost Zeppelin you have the same goal the clash of friends the wife of one of the men being unhappy in her marriage a crash needing rescue and a few similar points. I wouldn't go so far as to say that Dirigible steals from Lost Zeppelin so much as remakes it with a few significant changes.";

When this film was released in 1931 it was the golden age of zeppelin travel and the crash of the Hindenburg which doomed this type of transportation was still five years in the future. There were numerous scenes shot at Lakehurst Naval Air station where ironically the Hindenburg crashed that was the center of dirigible activity at the time for the U.S. Navy. As someone who is interested in this subject I found this part of the movie fascinating as well as the part of the story that took you behind the scenes of airship travel and how much danger could be involved. The riveting scene dealing with the crash of a dirigible in a violent storm brought to mind the U.S. Navy zeppelin Akron launched the same year as this film which was destroyed in a similar storm only two years later. It was also interesting to see actress Fay Wray two years before she would gain fame with her role in King Kong. I had the opportunity to catch this film recently during an airing on the TCM cable channel and would recommend it for anyone with a similar interest.".

The title says it all  this film is about a grandstanding naval pilot in the early 30's at the time the U.S.Navy was experimenting with dirigibles. Because this experiment didn't last that many years this film is a great opportunity to see the technology up close.Jack Holt plays Jack Bradan a stalwart friend and loyal navy man. Ralph Graves plays Frisky Pierce also in the navy but more out for himself and his own reputation as aerial stuntman than anything. Frisky loves collecting trophies a category in which he puts his lonely and frightened wife Helen Fay Wray. She's frightened because she once saw Frisky crash and she's lonely because if Frisky isn't out breaking records he's out with the boys bragging about it.A break between the two friends occurs when Jack first invites Frisky to come along on his dirigible expedition to the South Pole and then disinvites him according to the pleas of Frisky's wife. Jack has sworn not to tell Frisky about her wishes so Frisky vainly assumes that Jack can't take Frisky hogging the spotlight. Jack's expedition fails almost immediately due to a hurricane that crosses paths with the dirigible. Frisky then gets a chance to head up a second expedition for all the wrong reasons  another trophy and also a chance to get back at Jack.Some reckless and headstrong decisions by Frisky added to some bad breaks have him realizing what it means to have other men's lives in his hands and even what his own life means to him. What you end up with is It's A Wonderful Life in reverse. In Wonderful Life George Bailey always let his own wants take a backseat to everyone else's welfare and is shown the world would have been a much worse place without him  he really did make a difference. In this film Frisky has always done what he wanted and when faced with his own mortality realizes that his own life and actions haven't amounted to much in the grand scheme of things. This one has higher production values than many of the early Columbias. This is partly due to the artful direction of Frank Capra and partly due to the cooperation of the U.S. Navy in making this film.".

It was written by Spig Wead the protagonist of John Ford's The Wings of Eagles and directed by Frank Capra before he became warm and populist. Fay Wray is a cute and unwittingly sexy as she was in the same year's King Kong even if she does keep her dress on this time around.Ralph Graves is a hotshot aviator in the 1932 US Navy. You ought to see him do outside loops and laughing at orders not to do it. Jack Holt is his superior officer who is committed to the giant dirigibles that fly out of the Naval Air Station in Lakehurst New Jersey. Graves is married to Fay Wray whom Holt loves from afar in a gentlemanly kind of way. Graves doesn't take Wray seriously when she complains that he's more interested in headlines and aviation trophies than he is in her. He placates her with lines like Say honey you must know nothing means more to me than you. He thinks he's smart but he's pretty dumb.Graves is chosen to pilot a flight over the South Pole and dropping a flag on it. He decides to land the airplane and plant the flag in person the happygolucky lug. Well  maybe not so lucky. He cracks the plane up. Two of the fourman crew wind up dead. And Graves carries the third guy until he collapses from exhaustion hunger and cold abjectly accepting death. But before they can snuff it the two men are rescued by a dirigible flown by Holt.The first part is a little goofy. The actors speak as if they're on a stage and have to shout to reach the balconies. But the last two thirds of the film are packed with action scenes and fairly convincing considering the year. The suffering undergone by the crash survivors isn't stiffupperlip stuff either. Roscoe Karns is a wisecracking radioman on the crew. Usually these characters survive and sometimes they're given the final witticism as the film closes on the lovers kissing. But when his foot is injured and he's being hauled along on a sled he breaks down and shouts with pain squealing I don't want to cry! I don't want to cry! It's a little horrifying. It's done with such artlessness that it's believable and the cure turns out to be worse than the disease.It's a commercial enterprise not a masterpiece. Capra uses some stunning shots from high up in the rafters of the dirigible hangars but aside from that it's a straightforward and somewhat familiar adventure story. It will likely sweep you along by sheer momentum after you're through the initial exposition. Interesting to note that even in 1932 radio operators used speed keys.".

Graves doesn't take Wray seriously when she complains that he's more interested in headlines and aviation trophies than he is in her. He placates her with lines like Say honey you must know nothing means more to me than you. He thinks he's smart but he's pretty dumb.Graves is chosen to pilot a flight over the South Pole and dropping a flag on it. He decides to land the airplane and plant the flag in person the happygolucky lug. Well  maybe not so lucky. He cracks the plane up. Two of the fourman crew wind up dead. And Graves carries the third guy until he collapses from exhaustion hunger and cold abjectly accepting death. But before they can snuff it the two men are rescued by a dirigible flown by Holt.The first part is a little goofy. The actors speak as if they're on a stage and have to shout to reach the balconies. But the last two thirds of the film are packed with action scenes and fairly convincing considering the year. The suffering undergone by the crash survivors isn't stiffupperlip stuff either. Roscoe Karns is a wisecracking radioman on the crew. Usually these characters survive and sometimes they're given the final witticism as the film closes on the lovers kissing. But when his foot is injured and he's being hauled along on a sled he breaks down and shouts with pain squealing I don't want to cry! I don't want to cry! It's a little horrifying. It's done with such artlessness that it's believable and the cure turns out to be worse than the disease.It's a commercial enterprise not a masterpiece. Capra uses some stunning shots from high up in the rafters of the dirigible hangars but aside from that it's a straightforward and somewhat familiar adventure story. It will likely sweep you along by sheer momentum after you're through the initial exposition. Interesting to note that even in 1932 radio operators used speed keys.";

Aside from the obvious use of a handcranked camera in some of the location scenes it is beautifully made by director Frank Capra no less from a firstclass shooting script by Jo Swerling. Admittedly Fay Wray is not as attractivey made up or costumed as she was in her later encounter with King Kong but nevertheless some of her closeups are very appealing. It's also good to see Jack Holt as the number one star. Under Capra's direction he is far less wooden here than in many of his later 1930's vehicles. He's not the hero of course. That role is ably undertaken by the now unjustly forgotten but highly personable Ralph Graves. True this is not a typical Capra outing but I found it just as interesting and absorbing as his betterknown movies.".

The idea of honor seems to be a totally obsolete concept these days hardly surprising in view of the role models people have ie. politicians.The footage of vintage planes and the detailed shots of the airship are fascinating and the Antarctic scenes are gruesomely realistic though of course simulated. It certainly shows the harsh reality of exploration. And certainly the scene of the breakup of the airship is very realistic looking and dramatic.

The existence of this concert filmperformance art piece is a testament to the unique presence Laurie created out of herself in the 80's and her appeal to a truly appreciative audience of the time.Assembled loosely into small bytes the performances in Laurie's concert range from simple statements of fact to speculation to obtuse poetry to accessible pop music to challenging political statements to beyondsurreal vignettes about nothing whatsoever. The overall tone comes off as stream of consciousness the language filled with dream imagery and nonsequiturs. Hypnotic backprojection accompanies most of the onstage action including an eerie OZlike moment where Laurie's giant disembodied head floats above the proceedings glancing around noncommittally.At times the whole thing seems to unravel only to come back around to a unified center againthat center always being Ms. Anderson the ringmaster who is by turns sexy cute scary androgynous and almost always remote...but with a warm twinkle in her eye and dry sense of humor never far away. That what looks like chaos must indeed be very well choreographed is astounding and could only have been wrangled with the help of the brilliant musicians Ms. Anderson assembled for this concert. It's also wellif conservativelyfilmed.Of course this was made with college kids in mind and I imagine it was popular with the stoner crowd. However it works as its own sort of drug by turns seductive beguiling offputting obnoxious bewildering and immensely entertaining. It reminds me somewhat of David Lynch's Industrial Symphony no. 1 but is far lighter in tone and moves a bit quicker. I doubt it's possible to get this anymore and will eventually be forgotten I'm glad I have it and pull it out now and then when I'm in the mood to sit back and be transported to Laurie's odd 80's world for 90 minutes.".

	schema:headline " The best Hindi comedy ever made!";
	schema:reviewBody "There have been very few great comedy films in the history of Hindi Cinema. Andaz Apna Apna happens to be one of them. The film is based on a very simple story of two poor young men Aamir and Salman who dream of becoming rich by marrying a millionaire's daughter Raveena. Aamir and Salman Khan try their best to outwit each other and woo Raveena. The plot thickens when Paresh Rawal  Co. plan to take over all the wealth. The movie is well paced and very funny. Rarely does one come across a Hindi comedy which is both funny and intelligent. This is one of the few films with Aamir and Salman together probably the only film!. Unfortunately it did not succeed at the boxoffice and we might never see a film of this calibre again. Aamir Khan is brilliant in the film and has proved his versatility as an actor in this film. Salman Khan gives a very good performance as a dimwit. Raveena plays a convincing role as a confused rich girl and Karishma who is Raveena's assistantfriend is also funny. Paresh Rawal Junior Ajith Shakti Kapoor Deven Verma Jagdeep and Tiku Talsania just add to the flavour of the film! All in all the best Hindi comedy ever made and I wish they make more quality films like this one. You will want to watch this film time and again.P.S  For those of you who have watched this film I also suggest Gol Maal Chupke Chupke Chhoti Si Baat Naram Garam Hera Pheri old and new etc.".

The movie is about two guys who dream of riches and try to accomplish that by wooing a millionaire's daughter. A humorous drama unfolds while a lot of complexities surface in the story. The complexities add to the sheer comedy of the entire plot. Aamir Khan plays the a streetsmart guy while Salman Khan gives an unexpectedly good performance as the dumb guy. The villian played by Paresh Rawaland his henchmen Junior Ajit and Kaliaa make you laugh in your sleep. Although the movie borrows from a lot of other movies despite shoddy camerawork and despite being loud at times it remains one of the scarce funny movies Bombay has come up with after movies like Padosan Golmal and other Amol Plaekar movies. It is sad that it didn't do well at the boxoffice for that means producers turn back to formulas and creativity is abandoned.".

Story is  nothing groundbreaking but the complications that are added to it make  it awesome. Aamir Khan is a total cartoon. Just watch his expressions  in the song Yeh Raat aur yeh doori. He is amazingly good at comedy I  never knew. Salman Khan was also good as the somewhat dimmer of the two  characters. The noises he makes are almost as funny as Aamir's faces.  Raveena and karisma serve their purpose but are nothing amazing. The  real pick of the lot is Paresh Rawal as usual.  The plot is rather simple Amar Aamir and Prem Salman are useless  sons of poor fathers. They don't believe in hard work and just want to  get rich the easy way. So both their brains come across an idea to woo  a rich man's Paresh Rawal daughter Raveena Tandon who comes to  India to look for a husband. So Amar and Prem meet on the trip and join  hands to drive off the hundreds of other men trying to marry this girl.  When they succeed they now have to get rid of each other. Somehow both  of them get into Raveena's house Amar as an injured guy and Prem as  his doctor. From here on they try to oust each other. But things are  complicated as Raveena's friend Karisma Kapoor falls for Prem and  pursues him. And rich man's evil twin brother Rawal also tries to get  rid of the heiress and her father so he will inherit the money and  sends in his two most trusted but bumbling fools to do the dirty work.  This is a movie you do not want to miss. Watch it! It will be worth it.  I even own the DVD its that good. And if you like this movie I'd also  recommend Gol Maal if you haven't already watched it. Other good  comedies are Namak Halal and Hera Pheri new.".

Karisma Kapoor's outfits tell a story of their own  makes you wonder if the stylist deliberately made her wear some of the clothes just to make the movie funnier at one point she looks like she's wearing a nappy. Andaz Apna Apna is the only comedy genre movie to make me laugh from the beginning till the very end. There is not one dull moment every scene is hilarious even the songs and dance moves will have you in stitches of laughter. I especially loved the scene in which Amar Amir Khan 'regains his memory'. I've seen this movie so many times I've lost count. And I'm so glad to say that this time Bollywood can take all the credit for this fantastic movie as far as I know A.A.A it is not a replicate of a Hollywood movie THANK GOD. Overall I recommend this movie to anyone who understands Hindi Urdu and loves good comedy.Watch it you'll love it!!!!!".

Not possible! Simply because every scene is a scene you got to watch out for! Aamir  Salman share great chemistry and are perfect in their shoes but I'll put the characters in order of favoritism Rank  1. Crime Master Gogo Shakti Kapoor's best performance till date and yes this happened before the casting couch Gogo is an innocent character who belongs to well reputed family of Mogambo Mr. India fame. Crime Master Gogo is actually Mogambo's nephew but for Mogambo he's more than a responsible handsome charismatic charming son. Gogo makes the biggest mistake of life by lending 36000 rupees to Teja who is as Balla had once said A Fraud and a Cheat!. Now Gogo's only goal is to get back what's his and in his journey of recovering his lost money Gogo realizes that there is more than 36000 that he needs to achieve and thus begins... Gogo's struggle against the sinnerworld.Rank  2. Teja Teja Main Hoon Mark Idhar Hai! Teja is an evil character who is Ram Gopal Bajaj's twin. Originally named Shyam Gopal Bajaj Teja chooses to change his name to suit his personality. Teja as a child had always envied his brother and then one day things took a turn for the worse when his father gave his entire wealth to Ram Bajaj. Teja decided to kill his father but in the night's darkness instead killed Munshi Harish Chandra Raveena's Dad though Teja doesn't regret his actions. Teja's sole mission now is to get back his property somehow and start his own Poultry  Bakery Farm. Teja also needs to return back the loan to Gogo but has no intentions whatsoever to do so. In order to achieve his evil goals Teja employs two people Robert Vijay Khote who is very good at aiming and Balla Shahzad Khan Ajit's clone and son... who is a very very smart boy! Rank  3. Amar Aamir Khan Wants to marry the rich heiress Raveena so he sells his father's cheap saloon and heads off for Mumbai. Amar has no problem taking care of the big business that Raveena's father will hand him over after their wedding and is willing to sacrifice his happiness and shift to London if needed.Rank  4. Prem Salman Khan After Gogo Prem is the second most innocent character to appear in the movie and the way Amar tries to take advantage of him in the mask of a friend is tragic.I won't reveal any more characters because Jesus Christ! I just wouldn't stop typing! The movie is outright stunning! Go and get the DVD now and beware of those cheap VCDs as they have omitted many good scenes out of the movie.The background music is stud and the action is better than the Matrix especially the final encountered between Prem and Crime Master Gogo watch out for it it appears in the climax. Andaz Apna Apna is also a drama with many negative and positive characters and teach us a lot about life and values and ethics. It teaches us about bravery why else would Amar ask Prem to stay back when they go to meet the kidnapper even though Prem was complaining that he had to go to the toilet???. Andaz Apna Apna is also a tragedy especially the scenes where Salman is targeted by Aamir and is given overdose of stomachupsetting pills the part where Teja reveals his sad feelings regarding why he couldn't go to London and the part where Gogo is arrested in the ending without even getting back his 36000. Andaz Apna Apna is overall a complete package.... sit back and enjoy the ride! Bet there'll be a second ride after that... and then a third!The movie was considered a flop back then and I bet no one liked it but buckle up guys! This movie is a big hit! Even if it didn't have enough people coming to theatres the movie is one of the highest selling Home DVDs and one of the most frequently movie on most of the channels so the producers have laughed their way to the banks long time back!".

This movie is simply marvelous and according to me is the funniest movie I've ever seen! And yes I do put it over Hera Pheri... reason? Hera Pheri has scenes you'll watch out but Andaz Apna Apna? Not possible! Simply because every scene is a scene you got to watch out for! Aamir  Salman share great chemistry and are perfect in their shoes but I'll put the characters in order of favoritism Rank  1.

When the movie released i was a 8 year old and I heard it was a flop but I never understood till now why was it a flop...but let me tell you one thing...this movie would have more money by selling home Cassettes and DVDs and by showing in TV movie channels than any hit movie in theaters. This movie has been shown countless times in Movie channels and I think even now the public love and the TV producers keep repeating the movie again and again. I personally have watched the entire movie more than 80 100 times and I still love it.....The performance by both Aamir khan as Amar and Salman khan as Prem is mind blowing but i especially liked the performance of Aamir khan as a street smart guy....his dialogs in the movie are Hilarious... the story is simple and heres how it goes.....Amar and Prem are poor  lazy chaps and come from a poor family of tailors and Amars father is a barber. Then they both get a news that a Millionaire 's daughter from London is coming to India to look for a suitable match ...both Amar and Prem think that this is a brilliant opportunity to become super rich.....therefore they both head out to woo Raveena Tandon..the millionaires daughter......in their journey they both hate each other and each one of them try to fool the other in order to marry Raveena.....the comedy scenes in between are so hilarious that you would need a glass of water to stop the pain in your stomach by laughing.......and then there is Raveenas Uncle Millionaire's look alike brother Teja who wants to take revenge from Raveenas father.....since he is broke and Raveenas dad is a millionaire......his plans include kidnapping Raveena to blackmail Raveenas dad for which he hires 2 butlers.....but later on we get to know that there is a twist in the movie watch the movie to know.......then there is Shakti Kapoor as crime master Gogo who is also incredibly funny......The thing which stood out for me were the dialogs in the movie which has become a legend of sorts.....Aamir khan uses his aaila  brilliantly and Salman goes like OOima ........and for Gogo there is  Jab Raat Ko Bacha Soota Nahi Hain to Ma Bolti Hain Ki Sooja Nahi to Gogo Aa Jaega ......each and every scene is so funny......I especially liked the one in which Aamir khan and Salman goto get Raveena from Teja and they both go in a Luna having chillar money in a bag....that scene is so funny..I recommend anyone who understands Hindi or Urdu to watch this movie ......this is one movie that I would recommend having a DVD and you will never regret.......".

	schema:reviewBody "Andaz Apna Apna is the most recent instance of a growing trend of Bollywood movies to briefly surface on IMDb's Top 250. Personally I have found these films hit or miss and Andaz joins the clear misses. Films with almost a perfect rating need to justify themselves. Certainly a victim of high expectations Andaz failed to update or improve comic shticks that were unoriginal fifty years ago. Energetic and upbeat this film had its heart in the right place but could rarely elevate jokes above the smirk level. Every character was initially amusing but their simplicity and lack of evolution aggravated the already substantial run time. The music was not even memorable. This is not to say I hate the movie or was even particularly bored. Hijinks were certainly abound. I was never surprised by any outcome but was at least amused watching each bit of chicanery unfold. Humor is arguably the most subject aspect of film and I will surely not claim that I was able to pick up every subtlety across the language barrier. I am happy for the many who enjoyed this film more than I. Andaz Apna Apna was simply not inspiring. An average film.".

	onyx:emotionText "Andaz Apna Apna is the most recent instance of a growing trend of Bollywood movies to briefly surface on IMDb's Top 250. Personally I have found these films hit or miss and Andaz joins the clear misses. Films with almost a perfect rating need to justify themselves. Certainly a victim of high expectations Andaz failed to update or improve comic shticks that were unoriginal fifty years ago. Energetic and upbeat this film had its heart in the right place but could rarely elevate jokes above the smirk level.

	schema:reviewBody "Over the last year or so I've been attempting to watch my way through the IMDb top 250 and as a result have watched several Indian movies due to a recent influx of films to the list. While some films have been good Lagaan Drishyam Gangs of Wasseypur as examples there are those such as Andaz Apna that are woefully lacking in merit to be rated as highly as they are. The story line filming style and sense of humour are akin to the British Carry on movies only with more musical interludes and an extra hour in length. The story line sees our two main characters competing for the love and affection of a wealthy heiress who has recently returned from London. What follows is a series of attempts to get close to her all the while inadvertently avoiding and preventing the deathcapture of the girl by an evil criminal! Sounds ridiculous? that's because it is! It's certainly not all bad and there are some moments of humour and slapstick that do raise a smile and there are little parts of the story that are inventive. However overall this film lacks enough genuine laugh out loud moments and there is little to hold the attention throughout especially when there are some clear directions the story is going in but it leaves you waiting and waiting before they materialise on screen.Don't base this film on a sole judgement of Indian movies I know a number of people are unhappy at the inclusion of several 'overrated' movies in the IMDb Top 250 however it isn't the whole story other Indian movies do warrant their inclusion unfortunately Andaz Apna isn't one of them.".

The songs like 'Kadhal Anukkal.' 'Robo Dance' 'Boom Boom' or 'Kilimanjaro' all evoke thunderous applause. Rahman's mastery in blending orchestration harmony and rhythm add pep to all the numbers. The lyrics too compliment the songs and the theme of the movie. The legend in Vairamuthu his novice son Kargy and Pa Vijay deserve applause.Come to master of the ship  Shankar.

The man is an absolute genius. His creativity reaches great heights with this movie and elevates the Indian movie standard to an all time high. With every movie of his the scale of moviemaking grows tremendously. He got the best technology money can buy. Looks like the majority of the budget is spent on Animatronics and this movie has got plenty of that. Rajinikanth is magnificent in this movie. In fact he is the movie. He adds life to every single frame created by Shankar. Aishwarya does what she does best look GORGEOUS.She has some pretty slick dance moves in the songs.The Animatronics are the best you could find in any movie so far and not just an Indian movie. The songs are spectacular. Shankar shows the audience some of the best places in the world all for a few bucks. The locations are mindblowing and totally unique to this movie. Shankar handpicked the locations for the songs and they are shot on a grand scale. The music is haunting and highly entertaining. This movie will surely become one of the biggest movies ever made in India and without a doubt bring in a lot of moolah to the producers distributors and the exhibitors all around the world. Rajinikanth redefines super stardom. Truly a legend of a man.".

	schema:headline " Endhiran...The Greatest Blockbuster of Indian Cinema!";
	schema:reviewBody "Endhiran The Robot is definitely going to be a Biggest Blockbuster of Indian Cinema. 1. Budget is 35m most expensive movie in Asia.2. 2250 prints 3000 screens largest worldwide screening after 'Spiderman'.1400 screens in Tamil Nadu alone including 48 out of 52 screens in Chennai.3.In three language versions TamilTelugu  Hindi.4. The special effects are as good as Hollywood movies like Terminator Matrix Godzilla which is composed of 1500 graphical shots.5. Double Academy Award Winner AR Rahman has scored the music.This is a story of android based humanoid named Chitti.The first part in Endhiran movie has lot of surprises and rest half has actions and rides. In Endhiran Rajni plays double role. One is a scientist and another is a Robot. Scientist Rajni creates a Robot with artificial intelligence like that of sixth sense in humans to help human beings and to the development of the country.But its silicon heart falls in love with Aishwarya Rai. Writes romantic poems and the Robot behave just like a human being. Knowing about the extra ordinary intelligence of the Robot the villains try to get control of the Robot. The last 30 minutes of the film are literally the grandmaster of all makebelieve and end up creating a whole new genre of cinema the 'curry eastern' which stands up as a wholesome alternative to the curry western. For Rajnikanth fans the climax is definitely a surefire way to lose your sanity.For nonRajnikanth fans it's a surefire way to understand the mystique and magical allure of Rajni sir a hero who enjoys a demigod status in several parts of India. Why? Because there are almost a hundred Rajnikanths eating up helicopters smashing cars battering planet earth and creating havoc like never before. If you thought Terminator Matrix Godzilla was fun then we guarantee you'll fall off your chair with glee as our desi T2meetsBlade Runnermeets NeomeetsGodzilla sets the screen on fire in a crazy vengeance bid. Spoofy yes. But super fun too.Robot is primarily designed as an unadulterated tribute to the charisma of Indian cinema's ageless superstar Rajnikanth. And it's completely wholeheartedly joyously desi. Where else would you find a hero who literally shoots with his fingers! What's more important is the fact that you actually don't mind when the bullet whizzes out of his forefinger and hits the man in front in the head. Instant death! Ha Ha!The high point of Robot are the super quality special effects. All the Spiderman Batman and Superhero antics of Rajnikanth have been done with exquisite elan by the Stan Winston Studio which reportedly provided the animatrics for films like Jurassic Park and Avatar. And all the stunts have been choreographed by Yuen Woo Ping the Hong Kong based action director who created the highadrenalin stunts of classics like Kill Bill and Matrix. Almost 40 per cent of the film's colossal budget Rs 160 crores has been spent on special effects which at the end of the day seems all worthwhile. For watching Rajnikanth running horizontal on a speeding train clambering across burning buildings like Spiderman or mutating into gargantuan monsters does manage to shock and awe the viewer who's out there to have big time fun.But Robot isn't effect alone. It has a plot too which if you really pay attention has a meaning and a message. The film carries forward the manmachine war through interesting twists and turns and creates a lively love triangle between scientist Rajnikanth medico student Aishwarya Rai and robot Rajnikanth. Interestingly the duo make an interesting pair what with Rajni sir's sundry wigs and sideburns and Aishwarya's tribal 'KilimanjaroMohenjodaro' attire. You might just overdose on the pungent masala fare. Have a blast.For Tamil audience this movie is a definite 10 out of 10!".

The last 45 minutes are simply cracking for his enactment of the anti hero as only he can and does. My only regret in the film was that they seemed to have required not 200 but 400 crores to really deliver in the stunt sequences in the 2nd half! But even still magnificent achievement with an absorbing story line which keeps you engaged and rollicking in your seats till the last frame. Aishwarya seems to get more attractive with each passing year! This is the only event Rajni apart from cricket in India where absolute strangers on the road in the theatre ask each other questions on how the movie was and talk like long lost friends on any subject under the sun.".

You won't really find one word to describe the true charisma and the onscreen persona of Rajnikanth the undisputed Superstar of Tamil oops Indian cinema!The Gist of the StoryRajnikanth is a scientist Vaseegaran who develops his brainchild a robot. Names it 'Chitty' and teaches every single thing that this universe can hold. 'Chitty' is programmed to learn and know everything except for human emotions and when that is taught how would you expect a machine to react? Watch 'Endhiran' to know how! DialoguesThe Superstar's fan following ranges from the villages to international cities and this being a movie talking about technology one would expect totally technical jargon in place. But that's only a myth because the dialogues in 'Endhiran' are simple and convey the message quite crisply making sure all the sections of the audience understand every aspect of technology and science. Now did that sound serious? The movie is neatly infused with comedy dialogues that will make you giggle and when rendered by Rajni himself you'll just scream laughing! Visual Effects and EditingThe teasers and trailers stimulated the curiosity thanks to the splendid visual effects by international technicians. Examples of the dynamic effects are a plenty to talk about in the movie but sample this  a robot with unimaginable powers confronts goons with his electromagnetic property and attracts their weapons and voila you get to see a spectacular scene that probably idolizes Goddess Kali! You'll have to watch it to understand and realise it is verbally impossible to describe that scene and many other visual effects! Editing by Antony is crisp. Had the length been a little longer the party would have been a little annoying! StuntsNot just for visual effects Shankar has also used the services of international expertise for the stunts in his movie. Yuen Woo Ping who worked on 'The Matrix' etc has designed stunt scenes that will make your jaws drop! Our very own Peter Heines has also done his part. A sample to tease your curiosity  an intense car chasing scene with our Superstar making a 'donut' in his Mercedes Convertible! Exhilarating! MusicAR Rahman the Mozart of Madras we've seen the response for the music right after the launch! But on screen 'Kadhal Annukal' and 'Kilimanjaro' not to forget 'Arima' they take you by storm. The background score's decent and tries to receive your attention effectively! The rerecording in the movie is near perfect and sound capture by Oscar winner Resul Pookutty is A1. The CastYour eyes are predominantly set on the Superstar but pave way for the other leads. We'll come to the beautiful Aishwarya in a little while but before that it is going to be the gracious Danny Denzongpa the wily villain of the movie. He is old but he is got grace and is a refreshing change from the usual villains. He adds a lot of freshness to the script a brilliant choice of casting. The next comedians Karunaas and Santhanam though they don't quite have lengthy screen presence they still manage to receive appreciation for their comic timing. Santhanam will be a proud man to have shared screen with the superstar. Aishwarya Rai  The Miss World is amazing and truly an epitome of beauty! She forms an important part of the script and hence you'll spot her throughout the movie perhaps for the first time a heroine is receiving considerable importance in a superstar's movie! The marvellous costumes add to her allure and she's just majestic in few scenes! Rajnikanth aka SuperstarSaving the best or the ultimate for the last Rajnikanth is one man who will not cease to amaze you! If your 6 or 60 doesn't really matter because you will be in awe of the man! you will be in awe of the man! In a movie which shows signs of visual effects riding in the driver's seat the Superstar dominates every bit to walk away with appreciation! No favouritism here you just can't stop talking about him once you come out! As the scientist Vaseegaran he plays his part uncharacteristically Rajni without Punch dialogues or fights but as 'Chitty  the Robot' you are bound to follow or even turn an addict! Sample this  as a gentle Robot he is precise in acting and when it comes to the evil side the incredible Rajni has made sure he doesn't waste his opportunity! His evil laugh his characteristic slick walk that body language and the dialogue delivery in 'Endhiran' remind you of the golden Rajni time! Look out for the amazing dance moves by the superstar given his age a few moves are stunning credits to the choreographers!My VerdictThe festival of lights 'Deepavali' is round the corner and with the release of 'Endhiran' the fireworks have already started! Quoting the Superstar himself 'Endhiran' for the Indian audience all around the world is an 'experience'! Don't miss it!".

	schema:reviewBody "Endhiran roughly translates to The Robot and what you get in this Bollywood adventure is a big smashing together of nearly every trope ever associated to robotic androids in movies.The story follows an Indian scientist who has created a robotic replication of himself. The robot named Chitti is designed to be a super soldier for the Indian government but when Chitti starts to feel human emotion and courts the scientist's girlfriend things begin to go awry.The movie is part action part drama part comedy part romance part musical etc. It is a lot of things and like many Bollywood movies it doesn't seem to work that well in the transitions. Really the movie does try to deal with the heavy concept of human emotions and the dangers of them but these odd transitions between different styles do not aid in accentuating this theme. For example whenever the characters feel a rush of emotion they burst into songanddance to techno glory but these scenes much like the action scenes and the infamous mosquito scene which was ridiculous and just plain weird where Chitti converses with a pack of mosquitos they all drag on for far too long as if the filmmakers could not distill down the scenes to a reasonable length. And speaking of the bizarre the change in the middle of the movie where Chitti goes from being the good guy to being the bad guy just makes little to no sense and it feels as if there are two movies here rather than one. Focus on finishing one story before gearing up another.Endhiran may appeal to fans of Bollywood but to us others it leaves us scratching our heads after this visually stimulating but unfulfilling ride of human emotion.I give Endhiran a 2 out of 10!".

	schema:headline " A Study of Propaganda";
	schema:reviewBody "The day was finally set. I was going to watch Endhiran the most expensive Indian movie ever made. The Avatar of India the posters claimed. I will admit upfront I am not a huge fan of either Shankar or Rajinikanth but there was a glimmer of hope as it was a screenplay by the late Sujatha a true technocrat whose books and prose I have cherished over the years would he have coined the term Robo Sapiens?. As Sujatha had passed away during the preproduction of the movie I was well aware that the screenplay would have been completed by Shankar Madhan Karky is also credited as a coscript writer. The initial reviews had lauded the movie claiming it to be a benchmark in Indian cinema and how Indian cinema has improved by leaps and bounds and how the movie will stand up to any Hollywood production of recent years.The movie proved be a huge disappointment except a few scenes and it also proved the fact that without a cohesive screenplay any movie even the most expensive one would turn out to be a fiasco and dishearten the nonemotionallyinvested viewers. Let's face it the movie would have never worked with that screenplay without a hugename star to portray the protagonist the innocent robot Chitti Speed 1 THz Memory 1 Zettabyte and the antagonist Chitti v.2.0. Rajini a forcestar he may be but it is the actor that I miss whom I last saw in Thalapathy 1991. I was subject to overthetop performances and overthetop everything that I have come to witness in Shankar movies. Aishwarya Rai as Sana is beautiful as always but has little else to do as others who just appear in the scenes without leaving a mark. It is understandable that Shankar wanted Rajini to carry the movie but I was used to the Rajini that I saw onscreen he did not bring anything new to this movie. I was comforted in the fact that there were no buildups to the Dr. Vaseegaran character and no opening songs claiming the protagonist to be the all conquering singing dancing hero of the silver screen.The songs good as they were only managed to drag the flow if there was any of the already stumbling screenplay and the second half seemed to drag. I believe it is now time for Thamizh movies or any movies except musicals to not have song sequences which just test our patience as I did not gain anything from a song set in Machu Picchu as Dr. Vaseegaran was contemplating the future of Chitti. Plot holes galore in this movie which took two years to complete we are shown that as Sana is kidnapped by Chitti v.2.0 the police randomly firing at the car were they not worried that Sana might be killed in the crossfire or were they all crackshots? And did we need to see Chitti conversing with mosquitoes? I felt angry for spending the money and wasting my time watching this utter garbage which some of my friends have claimed to be the best Thamizh film ever! Shankar has taken elements from Bicentennial Man and I Robot and served up a diarrhea inducing meal on a silver platter. It was really hard to believe that Santhanam and Karunas to be scientists but even that seemed tolerable compared to the romantic scene between Aishwarya and Rajini Sana wants to end their relationship where Vaseegaran asks Sana to return the kisses he had given during the course of their relationship. The scene takes us to a very artificial looking desert as Rajini plays the guitar if you can believe his strumming  looked more like he was moving his hands up and down the guitar and a beautiful song wasted in Kadhal Anukkal.The one scene that I found really impressive was the Chitti v.2.0 metamorphosing fight sequence in the climax supported by the background score with the metallic edge as provided by Academy Award winner A. R. Rahman. I expected more from Chitti v.2.0 Rajini should have explored more with what makes Chitti v.2.0 tick but as he said in the Endhiran audio launch he had followed Shankar's directions to a T which in my opinion has backfired as Chitti v.2.0 exaggerates its' speech and gestures as the muchdetested Shankarism comes into play in the third act. I did not empathize with Chitti as it dismantled itself I found it neither moving nor the fitting end to the most expensive movie of Indian cinema. My absolute anger lies in the fact that this socalledexcuse for a movie was marketed as a challenge to Hollywood productions and the announcement of Thamizh cinema on to the world stage. If the rest of the world considers Endhiran as a token Thamizh movie I will be among the first to completely switch off Thamizh movies and deny that I ever watched them. Dot.".

	onyx:emotionText "The day was finally set. I was going to watch Endhiran the most expensive Indian movie ever made. The Avatar of India the posters claimed. I will admit upfront I am not a huge fan of either Shankar or Rajinikanth but there was a glimmer of hope as it was a screenplay by the late Sujatha a true technocrat whose books and prose I have cherished over the years would he have coined the term Robo Sapiens?. As Sujatha had passed away during the preproduction of the movie I was well aware that the screenplay would have been completed by Shankar Madhan Karky is also credited as a coscript writer. The initial reviews had lauded the movie claiming it to be a benchmark in Indian cinema and how Indian cinema has improved by leaps and bounds and how the movie will stand up to any Hollywood production of recent years.The movie proved be a huge disappointment except a few scenes and it also proved the fact that without a cohesive screenplay any movie even the most expensive one would turn out to be a fiasco and dishearten the nonemotionallyinvested viewers. Let's face it the movie would have never worked with that screenplay without a hugename star to portray the protagonist the innocent robot Chitti Speed 1 THz Memory 1 Zettabyte and the antagonist Chitti v.2.0. Rajini a forcestar he may be but it is the actor that I miss whom I last saw in Thalapathy 1991. I was subject to overthetop performances and overthetop everything that I have come to witness in Shankar movies. Aishwarya Rai as Sana is beautiful as always but has little else to do as others who just appear in the scenes without leaving a mark. It is understandable that Shankar wanted Rajini to carry the movie but I was used to the Rajini that I saw onscreen he did not bring anything new to this movie. I was comforted in the fact that there were no buildups to the Dr. Vaseegaran character and no opening songs claiming the protagonist to be the all conquering singing dancing hero of the silver screen.The songs good as they were only managed to drag the flow if there was any of the already stumbling screenplay and the second half seemed to drag.

	schema:reviewBody "Endhiran The Robot is the muchtouted Indian scifi extravaganza that debuted last year. If you've seen the trailer you'll have a pretty good idea what you're getting into. A roboticist builds a lifelike robot and begins teaching him how to become human. The scenes practically write themselves but they're overpowered by frequent song and dance numbers that interrupt the flow of the movie. These are mildly entertaining at first for their sheer novelty but by the fourth number I started looking at my watch.If not for these distractions Endhiran would fit right in with Hollywood's blockbusters. It certainly regurgitates enough gags from them with a particular fondness for The Matrix and Terminator films WooPing Yuen was hired to choreograph the stunts so it's not too surprising. Naming the origins of its lowrent scenes ahead of your friends might make for an interesting drinking game but the lack of imagination is disappointing. It does try to put its own spin on familiar ideas but is most successful when it pits man vs machine for the love of a woman. But it takes far too long to build up to that and the fun action sequences are fleeting.At nearly three hours long some cuts here and there would be appreciated. There's a disproportionate number of scenes with questionable value ones with talking mosquitoes and another where a woman gives birth come to mind and they're not always entertaining for the right reasons. I wouldn't say that Endhiran is so bad that it's only worth watching just for laughs but it comes pretty darn close.In the end this is a tough one to recommend due to its taxing length and general stupidity never mind the largely unwelcome Bollywoodstyle numbers Endhiran isn't considered a true Bollywood film because it was filmed in Chennai in Tamil. But the action scenes with their cartoon physics and utter disregard for realism are pretty hilarious. The grand finale in which hundreds of humanoid robots band together like modular parts to form gigantic snakes drills and other stuff might be enough to sway this one into the must see category if you're in the mood for something totally crazy. Just be prepared to wade through a whole lot of cheese to get there.".

The problem is these kind of movies appeals to the masses who have no taste or their threshold of entertainment has been irrevocably lowered by by the imbecile and cheap nonIndian actors like Aamir Khan and Salman Khan. Any six year old can come with this concept of a robot which can do math quiz I would have been more impressed if the Robot could have made Sana Ash Rai act. She remains just an eye candy and an actingdancing robot after 120'odd films. I am yet to see an hint of acting.I think this movie's popularity is another example of the despair and decadence of the Hindi Films to the point of no return. Crores spent on special effectson foreign talent is a collossal waste of money with no benefit to the locals who are starving for food and enployment.".

The problem is these kind of movies appeals to the masses who have no taste or their threshold of entertainment has been irrevocably lowered by by the imbecile and cheap nonIndian actors like Aamir Khan and Salman Khan. Any six year old can come with this concept of a robot which can do math quiz I would have been more impressed if the Robot could have made Sana Ash Rai act. She remains just an eye candy and an actingdancing robot after 120'odd films. I am yet to see an hint of acting.I think this movie's popularity is another example of the despair and decadence of the Hindi Films to the point of no return. Crores spent on special effectson foreign talent is a collossal waste of money with no benefit to the locals who are starving for food and enployment.";

	schema:headline " an intriguing sensitive suspense drama that is not meant for all";
	schema:reviewBody "When was the last time Indian audience have witness an intriguing noirish suspense drama without any cheap thrills? Probably not in recent times for starters Kahaani is a suspense thriller. Talaash is one such celluloid experience that will captivate you to the last reel. The film is a darkcomplex psychological yet there are layers of emotions which makes it more compelling..Add to this there is an Occult angle to the mystery..The film starts with a darkish depiction of Maximum city with eerie background music followed by a car coming at high speed which suddenly takes a turn and gets drowned in a river. It is later known that famous cinestar Arman Kapoor died in that car accident or murder or something?? Inspector Shekhawat gets the charge of the case. At a personal front Mr shekhawat and his wife are trying to come to terms with untimely loss of their son. The two incidences get connected at a point which changes the life of the protagonist. Without revealing the story I can say clearly the detailing is commendable and you can see the dots getting connected.Reema Kagti in her second directorial venture proved her understanding of this medium and fluidness in handling of complex themes. Talaash is one of the most complex films of recent times with layers to the narrative and characters. At the same time it's a thriller and an emotional drama of a father coming to terms with his child's loss. The emotions and vulnerability of Inspector Shekhawat is genuinely expressed which one can identify with. Everyone of us have lost a near or dear one at some point of time we will recently I lost my mother and after that the mere existence becomes difficult. At those moments mind and brains starts behaving weirdly and one starts accepting irrationality which gives one inner peace. Talaash explores one of those phases of life when everything seems at lost yet one has to move on with life. Without giving away any suspense I would say Kagti's  Zoya akhtar script webbed in a beguiling suspense drama around that complex phenomenon. Kudos to K.U Mohanan's camerawork who was recently being part of award winning pulp noir Miss Lovely brilliantly captured the bylanes of Mumbai. Mumbai becomes a darker character in this mystery. The fear of danger lurking around the corner can be sensed and it seems no one should be believed. Subaya's editing and Ram Sampat's flawless music add on to the proceeding and help in building the circuitous narrative. Sampat's music is brilliant with Akhtar's lyrics especially Lakh duniya kahe tum nehi ho is mark of a genius and someone who have lost a dear one will surely relate to the lyrics. It brings tear to one's eyes as one look back at life. Jiya lagena songs has a good video which gels with the fusion music. There are moments which had excellence written all over it like one in which Shekhawat is trying to recall his child's accident and ponders how his way of handling the situation in a different fashion would have saved him from drowning. The eerie background score and blurred camera work in few of the sequences justifies the end when the truth comes out.The end is heartening which leaves a lump in your throat yet the urge to watch it again remains. May be in the second viewing one will find another aspect of the story.Aamir Khan again proved that he is the only superstar who wants to associate with quality cinema. This film doesn't have the regular masala appeal wala entertainment. While all other stars are playing it safe Aamir ensures that his film has some meat which will be remembered down the line. His performance as Inspector Shekhawat deserves awards and accolades. He flawlessly portrays amenability of a depressed soul who has been caught in a web of mystery. His sequences with Rosy showed his versatility as an actor. Kareena Kapoor is effective as escort Rosy. The role is sensitive and something not on the lines of a typical mainstream heroine but Kareena effortlessly fits in it. Rani Mukherjee is just about perfect as Shekhawat's lonely wife. Another actor who steals the show is Nawazuddind Siddiqui as Taimur who has proved his mettle this year with GOW  Kahaani and now this one Those few privileged soul who got the chance to see Miss Lovely would have already labeled Siddiqui as finest actor of recent times. He is one of the central characters of this mystery and delivered his best. One will remember this character long after the movie is over. Shernaz Patel  Raj Kumar yadav are ever reliable actors and suits the bill. Subrata Sen as Shahsi leaves his mark in a small role. All the other actors did a decent job.On a whole Talaash is a rare suspense drama which would be loved by connoisseurs of good cinema. This film will open new window to this genre and hopefully more complicated psychological themes will be explored in the near future. One thing is for sure Talaash will be remembered in the long run as a fine cinematic experience that remained true to the style and content till the very end without falling into traps of commercial arena.Coming to the end of the film there has been criticism from some sectors claiming it to be unrealistic but then who told them the film depicts hardcore reality. The film just tells a story of coming to terms with loss and that also a gripping one with usage of after life concept to build the narrative. The end is sensitive.With untimely loss of your near and dear one you would feel or crave for some answers as to why You and the answer lies within...And in this film Mr  Mrs Shekhawat at least got some explanations in their questTalaash..".

	schema:headline " In quest of the unknown with Mr. Perfectionist";
	schema:reviewBody "Talash search  quest is apparently a murder mystery which does not turn out to be a traditional murder mystery in the end and a supernatural element also appears in the narrative which the spectator could not have thought of even in the wildest of his guesses about the solution of the mystery. That's what makes Talaash different from regular suspensethrillers. The hero i.e. our Mr. Perfectionist  Aamir Khan is an honest efficient and dedicated cop  Surjan Singh Shekhawat who is internally aggrieved because of the accidental demise of his son for which he considers himself as responsible and suffers from guiltcomplex. Neither he is able to console himself nor his equally aggrieved wife Raani Mukherjee. He becomes workaholic and remains on duty for almost 24 hours. He gets the case of the apparently accidental death of a Bollywood hero and the story of the movie mainly covers his quest Talaash of the truth only while intermittently dealing with his personal life and agony. A sexworker Kareena Kapoor helps him and when finally the truth comes out he and also the audience is taken aback like anything.The basic grains are not at all original. I don't know whether the director  Reema Kagti the script writers and Mr. Perfectionist himself have watched an old Bollywood movie  Ek Paheli 1971 starring Feroze Khan and Tanuja in lead roles or not but the inspiration from that story is clearly there which I could see because I have seen Ek Paheli. Anybody who has seen that old movie can easily contrast the resolution of the mystery in that with that in Talaash. All the same it is to be admitted that Talaash is an engrossing movie and though certain dialogs of Kareena Kapoor appear to be illogical and superfluous everything falls in place in the end. When the mystery is resolved and the scene involving Aamir Khan and his superior officer takes place there are certain shots which remind of John AbrahamBipasha Basu starrer flop movie  Madhoshi 2004. Personally I don't believe in supernatural and hence I am not completely satisfied after watching Talaash. A solution sans the supernatural element would have been acceptable to me. All the same I admit with open heart that the supernatural element is directly linked to the sentimental aspect of the story also and hence the way the script has been written it's inevitable for the narrative.The director  Reema Kagti has done her job very well and she has been successful in keeping the audience glued to the screen till the ending reels. Except the final 10 minutes or so you cannot afford to lose even a single minute of the movie. The narrative keeps you spellbound and whether you believe in the resolution of the mystery presented or not you feel like watching a good movie when leaving the theatre.Though the mystery is unraveled in the climax only the director has scattered clues and hints throughout the duration of the movie prior to revelation and given the viewers enough food for thinking and guessing on the basis of them. Everything shown or told including seemingly trivial things ultimately gets linked up to the main story and thus the director has shown her capability to handle suspensebased plots. This style of narrating is highly admirable and reminds me of some novels of renowned Hindi novelist  Ved Prakash Sharma.The emotional quotient is quite strong and the movie moves the spectator deep within at many place including the ending scenes. Not just the main track of the heroheroine is emotionstudded there is also a sentimentally impressive side story of the love affair of the limping petty criminal  Taimur Nawazuddin Siddiqui with an aging sexworker I don't know the name of the actress who helps him in getting blackmailing money but finally lands up with that money falling into her pocket only when Taimur is shot dead by the men hired by the blackmailed person.Technically the movie is good and utterly realistic. All the action and chase sequences have been handled pretty well and they are impressive by all standards. Instead of showing grandeur luxuries pump and show the director has kept all the scenes in realistic settings. And that's why nowhere the narrative seems to be out of place or playing with the intelligence of the audience except for the supernatural element embedded in the narrative. Cinematography is as brilliant as the art direction is. The movie is not unduly long and there is no superfluous footage at all. Small drops of humour provide a bit of relief in this otherwise intense suspensefilled drama.Aamir Khan truly deserves to be called Mr. Perfectionist. The getup the physic the gestures the mannerisms from every angle does he appear to be a nononsense dutiful cop who means business. It's very difficult to visualize anybody else in the role of Inspector Surjan Singh Shekhawat. Raani Mukherjee and Kareena Kapoor have done pretty well. The complete supporting cast has done justice to the assigned roles.Music of Talaash is praiseworthy. Jaaved Akhtar has written touching and meaningful lyrics and Ram Sampat has prepared earsoothing tunes for them. I consider Jiya Laage Na as the best song of the album but the other ones are also quite good to listen. Background score is also perfect.Summing up this much awaited movie of Mr. Perfectionist may not be a great movie but it is definitely worth a watch. It satisfies the entertainment appetite of the mysterylovers on one hand and suits the taste of the audience of emotional family dramas on the other.".

	onyx:emotionText "Talash search  quest is apparently a murder mystery which does not turn out to be a traditional murder mystery in the end and a supernatural element also appears in the narrative which the spectator could not have thought of even in the wildest of his guesses about the solution of the mystery. That's what makes Talaash different from regular suspensethrillers. The hero i.e. our Mr. Perfectionist  Aamir Khan is an honest efficient and dedicated cop  Surjan Singh Shekhawat who is internally aggrieved because of the accidental demise of his son for which he considers himself as responsible and suffers from guiltcomplex. Neither he is able to console himself nor his equally aggrieved wife Raani Mukherjee. He becomes workaholic and remains on duty for almost 24 hours. He gets the case of the apparently accidental death of a Bollywood hero and the story of the movie mainly covers his quest Talaash of the truth only while intermittently dealing with his personal life and agony. A sexworker Kareena Kapoor helps him and when finally the truth comes out he and also the audience is taken aback like anything.The basic grains are not at all original. I don't know whether the director  Reema Kagti the script writers and Mr. Perfectionist himself have watched an old Bollywood movie  Ek Paheli 1971 starring Feroze Khan and Tanuja in lead roles or not but the inspiration from that story is clearly there which I could see because I have seen Ek Paheli. Anybody who has seen that old movie can easily contrast the resolution of the mystery in that with that in Talaash. All the same it is to be admitted that Talaash is an engrossing movie and though certain dialogs of Kareena Kapoor appear to be illogical and superfluous everything falls in place in the end. When the mystery is resolved and the scene involving Aamir Khan and his superior officer takes place there are certain shots which remind of John AbrahamBipasha Basu starrer flop movie  Madhoshi 2004. Personally I don't believe in supernatural and hence I am not completely satisfied after watching Talaash. A solution sans the supernatural element would have been acceptable to me. All the same I admit with open heart that the supernatural element is directly linked to the sentimental aspect of the story also and hence the way the script has been written it's inevitable for the narrative.The director  Reema Kagti has done her job very well and she has been successful in keeping the audience glued to the screen till the ending reels. Except the final 10 minutes or so you cannot afford to lose even a single minute of the movie. The narrative keeps you spellbound and whether you believe in the resolution of the mystery presented or not you feel like watching a good movie when leaving the theatre.Though the mystery is unraveled in the climax only the director has scattered clues and hints throughout the duration of the movie prior to revelation and given the viewers enough food for thinking and guessing on the basis of them. Everything shown or told including seemingly trivial things ultimately gets linked up to the main story and thus the director has shown her capability to handle suspensebased plots. This style of narrating is highly admirable and reminds me of some novels of renowned Hindi novelist  Ved Prakash Sharma.The emotional quotient is quite strong and the movie moves the spectator deep within at many place including the ending scenes. Not just the main track of the heroheroine is emotionstudded there is also a sentimentally impressive side story of the love affair of the limping petty criminal  Taimur Nawazuddin Siddiqui with an aging sexworker I don't know the name of the actress who helps him in getting blackmailing money but finally lands up with that money falling into her pocket only when Taimur is shot dead by the men hired by the blackmailed person.Technically the movie is good and utterly realistic. All the action and chase sequences have been handled pretty well and they are impressive by all standards. Instead of showing grandeur luxuries pump and show the director has kept all the scenes in realistic settings. And that's why nowhere the narrative seems to be out of place or playing with the intelligence of the audience except for the supernatural element embedded in the narrative. Cinematography is as brilliant as the art direction is. The movie is not unduly long and there is no superfluous footage at all. Small drops of humour provide a bit of relief in this otherwise intense suspensefilled drama.Aamir Khan truly deserves to be called Mr. Perfectionist. The getup the physic the gestures the mannerisms from every angle does he appear to be a nononsense dutiful cop who means business. It's very difficult to visualize anybody else in the role of Inspector Surjan Singh Shekhawat. Raani Mukherjee and Kareena Kapoor have done pretty well.

	schema:reviewBody "Talaash!!!General OK where do I begin. To start off the movie is very intriguing thrilling and keeps you glued to your seats screen right till the end. The movie doesn't lose it's pace for even the shortest time and will keep you guessing as to what is going to happen. The movie starts off with the story right away and cuts to the chase without wandering too much on what isn't significant to the main plot. The main aim of the movie is to keep the thrill throughout the movie and manages to do exactly that.You may be able to predict the story to some extent but then that won't ruin the experience. Personally I felt the ending could have been better and was a bit of a let down as far as my expectations are concerned. All in all a wonderful thriller  suspense movie experience with some minor plot holes.Acting Now coming to the acting part Aamir Khan does a very good job exactly what is expected from him. Kareena was as usual good but not exceptional maybe that was exactly what the role required. Standout actor for me has to be Rani Mukerji who plays a grief stricken mother very well. All the other supporting actors also do their part very well not overacting and playing the characters exactly as required. Special praise for Nawazuddin Siddiqui Temur who is proving to be quite the actor after powerful roles in Kahaani Gangs of Wasseypur and now Talaash.Story line Well its better to know nothing about the story and go to the theater and have a whole new experience. Story  suspense wise it does have similarities with other thriller movies but then again it's better not to name them.Music Music blends very well with the story and is exactly what the situations require. The songs Muskaanein jhooti hain and Jee le zara are sure to stay on your mind for a long time even after the movie. The songs are perfectly timed during the movie and don't feel like a squeezein.All in all its a worth watch movie you may or may not like it but the movie won't bore you that's for sure... Enjoy !Rating 810".

Reema Kagti failed to extract the best from Aamir Khan and Rani Mukherjee. Well what can I say about Rani? She was definitely not in her best form however she makes her housewifecumgrieving mom role believable. The only bright spot of Talaash was Kareena Kapoor. Kareena proves that she has sheer talent as she tackles the role of a shady prostitute with aplomb. Her role was much more challenging than Aamir and Rani's. The music blends well with the movie without interrupting in the proceedings of the story. ShankarEhsanLoy have definitely given the best music as they do in most of the films. The direction was pretty much laid out and Reema Kagti and Zoya Akhtar have come up with a superficial albeit refreshing story to their credit. The movie shouldn't face a steep competition from SRK's Jab Tak Hai Jaan since the latter couldn't create strong ripples at the box office unlike most of SRK's movies.

Everything else from setting to cinematography is fine!But inspite of all these the movie definitely does not live upto the expectations and hype created ! It shows that still we have miles to go!As the Aamir requested not to reveal the suspense and it's very essential for any mystery movie Remember the end of the movie DHUND which states This is the end but please do not tell anybody!. So I will not talk about it however I would quote a statement of KAREENA given in an interview that TALAASH MINUS KAREENA IS NOTHING .....!!!Finally I would like to say that Talaash does pass the litmus test but Not With Distinction It is definitely Good but not awesome!!!

But somehow I feel disappointed when the movie moves on to the climax. It was not the kind of a movie Aamir usually do. Mostly all of his previous movies where really good and add something new to the Indian cinema. But this one despite being a very good movie failed to become a masterpiece. See this is what we always expect from Aamir Khan a masterpiece! Cinematography was good acting superb but somewhere it was lacking the Xfactor. Rani Mukherji with no makeup added the depth to the role on the other hand Kareena was looking as glamorous as always. Aamir Khan as usual did the best. Nawazuddin Siddiqui did what he is best in....acting!! The script keeps you holding throughout. All in all it is a good movie to watch but I feel that the climax could have been made better and more sensible.Definitely a one time watch and worth watching at least once.".

The creators of the movie missed that trick here don't know whether it was done intentionally.An accident which took place in some beach hangout spot in the very early hours of morning killing a favorite actor of the Indian film industry. Inspector Shekhawat Aamir takes up the investigation who is also suffering from insomnia due to the loss of his son in an accident. The accident scene in which the actor was done makes the movie rolling after the titles. Awesomely picturized by Mohanan the DOP of the movie who also had the headache of creating almost seventy percent of the movie in the dark which he did rather magnificently. Along side the Talaash of the killer Shekhawat also want to keep a good relation with his wife Rani who is suffering mentally for the same loss. Then comes Kareena Kapoor who tries to help Shekhawat in his talaash of the killer has done a good job does appear in the whole movie as Aamir Khan's aide.Nawazuddin Siddiqui an aide to one of the suspect Shashi plays wells though his journey ends rather quickly. A part from Aamir and Kareena many have been sidelined into small shells. Aamir khan tried to bring his authority of the main lead as cracking some potential jokes during the interrogation and on one rude scene which he saves shashi's girl in love.Story and screen play by the director Reema and Zoya Aktar made the film in a way that no missing links comes from here and there which they successfully succeeded still misses that feeling that needed to suck the audience into the movie. Farhan Aktar who wrote the dialogues with some assistance from Anurag Kashyup well and truly fabulously.Ram Sampath's music was not that applauding have done neatly...Movie will not create a fuss as compared to the recent flicks of Aamir.

Movie is simply amazing.Plot is the back bone of the movie. Director Reema Kagti has successfully tried to keep the mystery going through out the movie.Suspense is highly underused genre in Bollywood. I can count decent Bollywood suspense movies on my fingers. My tillthedate favorite being 36 China Town which is now replaced by Talaash. I hope this movie's successwhich is going to be tremendous but not even close to 3 Idiots motivates other top actors and directors to exploit this genre.Aamir Khan was very convincing as a cop. His characterSurjan Singh Sekhawat was flawed and that's what I liked about it. Its a trend in Bollywood to make the protagonist perfect having no flaws at all. Ironically Mr. Perfectionist's character in this movie was most flawed.Even though he has been better Aamir's acting in this movie was by no means bad. He was good. But he's been better.Out of Kareena and Rani in my opinion Rani was better. She was just perfect at what she was doing. She was living it.Kareena I think yet again like Heroine was trying too hard. She is one of the best actresses if not the best in Bollywood. So no one can say she was bad. Its just out of three she takes the third spot.Biggest drawback of the movie was its music. Some scene lacked thrill because of poor background score.. Some songs were a bit dull as well.Overall movie was good. A MUST watch. Go for it.

	schema:reviewBody "An actor dies. A cop movie is born. That is the most I'll tell you about the plot of this film but I will definitely take the opportunity to praise the actor who is responsible for some of the best films made in India. There is trend of films with big stars playing cops and giving us some of that good old masala Right from Wanted to Singham to Dabangg to Rowdy Rathore. Every superstar is cashing in on this formula while it lasts. Aamir Khan could have also followed this trend but he chooses to kill that actor and gives birth to a real cop movie into the mainstream. Aamir returns to the big screen after a hiatus of 3 years when he captivated the entire nation with 3 Idiots 2009. Yes he did Dhobi Ghat but you know what I mean. Year after year he refuses to sellout and holds true to his promise of giving us good movies. Sure he does a film like Ghajini 2008 as well but then even while he does it he makes a mark. We all know it was the first film that crossed 100 crores way before the industry myth of the 100 crore club was coined. He created the trend which he refuses to follow.Then again it would be highly unfair to sing praises of the actor and not give credit to the makers. Films like 3 Idiots and Lagaan were excellent films due to the talents of Rajkumar Hirani and Ashutosh Gowariker. Talaash works more so because of the meticulous execution of Reema Kagti. The atmosphere and the tone of the film are always precise never losing focus. The agenda throughout is telling the story and telling it right. The music by Ram Sampath is old fashioned and superbly delicious. Laakh Duniya Kahe my favorite song from the film is attached to a subtle roll over credits. I could notice the presence of the background score in almost every scene which creates a mood of dread and gloom. Mohanan's camera flirts with luscious colors and classy lighting. The screenplay by Zoya Akhtar and Reema Kagti is well constructed. It conceals every bit of information which would elevate the mystery. Yet it gives us information while the characters in the film are robbed of it and makes us engaged participants. Remember those yesteryear murder mysteries like Bees Saal Baad 1962? It gives you taste of such sumptuous dishes that nobody likes to offer anymore. Recently we saw Kahaani which was also a good thriller but this one did what Kahaani couldn't do for me I cared for the characters. Obviously an impeccable actor like Aamir Khan contributes to this which is not saying Vidya Balan isn't one. I remember a time in the late 90s when films like Gupt 1997 and Kaun 1999 were being talked about everywhere because of the big reveal at the end. I felt I was catapulted to those days where I don't want to tell people what the twist was and see their reactions later. Please don't be a sourpuss and spoil it for people it's way more fun that wayYes there is a twist. Your judgment of the film will depend on whether you like this twist or not. My first reaction was naaah.. then after few minutes or so I realized that the end couldn't have been better. I even guessed the twist including its details and you may guess it too but instead of being proud of the fact that our minds do work I strongly recommend you to indulge in the rewards of the film which extend further than a fanciful surprise. And how I love the surprise!. Thanks to the last 10 minutes of the movie which I believe is what makes this film more than just a thriller is tastefully handled... and YES it does have a message builtin. It may remind you of a movie which I will not name because that would be again be a massive spoiler. Talaash is a firstrate murder mystery with solid performances. The winners for me here are Kareena Kapoor of course apart from Aamir Khan and Reema Kagti who stand tall and churn out a film that is consciously quixotic and endlessly fascinating. Now can someone get this trend going? I'd like some more of those good old mysteries please....".

The movie had every ingredient to make it a good thriller as it had a mystery shrouded plot. All was going well till the movie started to end. The under water scene of Aamir and Kareena was disgusting  ridiculous. I had got up to walk.The last 10 minutes of the movie were unwatchable.Don't go to the movie expecting a thriller as the entire plot is hollow.

So he joins a masonic lodge thinking that those people after all want progress as much as he does but do so adhering to some bizarre protocol. Once enlisted he discovers all the 'inner circle' is about is covering up one another's dirty deeds and he's flooded with requests for petty favors. When war rumors spread he confronts his associates who depict the upcoming war as a picnic...as a result he's assaulted and stabbed by henchmen of the fraternity while newspapers proceed to assassinate his character claiming the assault arose out of matters of sexual misconduct or drug abuse and label him a psychopath. The short 40mins amateurish movie is no hatred artwork at all...or perhaps some think there are no 'inner circles' and backstage deals of that amplitude in politics... Sure there are flashes of newsstands details financial scandals hinting that the 'inner circle' is covering up for his members...hardly surprising especially after thousands of billions 'mysteriously' gone to waste these last months.

	schema:reviewBody "If Forces occultes really represents Vichy France's most determined effort at nazi propaganda as one reviewer claimed then one cannot really say they put much effort into their propaganda. A mere 45 minutes short the film is very heavyhanded and alltooobvious in making its point. Today the movie's inyourface symbolism a huge hairy spider with the masonic symbol on its back comes off as rather campy or silly. How anyone can still regard this as dangerous is beyond me.It is simply too dated and too badly done to still be effective.The hero Pierre Avenel is too clearcut and cardboardstraight to be a real character and that also makes it hardly believable why he is joining the Free Masons in the first place or staying with them for so long at least five years the movie tells us if they are not doing any good and being just slimy pushy characters from the beginning on. How these people could possibly rule the world is explained later when it is revealed that these are merely the peasants in a far bigger game.However the film is interesting for historical reasons. Avenel can be seen as a fascist idealist in the vein of Jacques Doriot. In the beginning he fiercely attacks the corruption in the parliament of both the Left and the Right. The parliamentary system is shown as ineffective and oldfashioned  at one satirically exaggerated point the parliamentarians merely utter a cockadoodledoo or the mowing of sheep. While parliamentarians debate all day the real powers that be act behind the facade. Left or Right are merely pawns in a game for power which reflects the fascist claim for being beyond both Left and Right and for overcoming the crisis of parliamentarianism see Zeev Sternhell's books for that. And there is lot of cleaning up to do FORCES OCCULTES paints the picture of a vast global conspiracy. A map in the beginning shows that only three fascist countries in the world are liberated from JewishMasonic influence Germany Italy and Spain.Another crucial ideological point is the claim that the Free Masons among them many Jews dragged France into the war against Germany while at the same time undermining the state. This was a way to blame the prewar elites for the disaster of 1940 and to show the necessity to replace them with fascism which was not identical with the actual Vichy government.The most convincing scene is the detailed depiction of a scurrilous Masonic initiation ritual. Director Jean Mamy executed in 1949 for collaboration himself was a member of the Grand Orient de France from 193139 so this may be quite authentic.".

It was odd to me that upon exiting the theater the thing that I wondered about most of all is what the hell is he going to do next! The Master is not an easy movie to sit through and at times you don't even know what the movie wants. But then you realize that the movie doesn't want anything. All it asks is for you to observe. More so than his earlier films The Master and There Will Be Blood really venture into the realm of the film as being a purely cinematic presentation of a life. Anderson doesn't pass judgment or any point of view he merely stretches the canvas which allows his characters to speak for themselves. Yes there is a beginning middle and an end but is there? Do we really have a sense of catharsis at the end of There Will Be Blood? or do we simply understand man a little better?Anderson insisted as I'm sure he would say the same for this film that There Will Be Blood wasn't a metaphor for anything. It was what it was. No hidden meaning no sophisticated and often formulaic subtext. It's simply man. As Hoffman's character says in the trailer for The Master  But above all I am a man.The movie deals with an interesting idea of the leader vs. the soldier master vs. slave. It breaks down the anatomy of a relationship so you may interpret it in any way you'd like.It's beautifully shot on 6570mm film which is the way I saw it and the way I recommend for you to see it if you get a chance to. Feels almost as if Anderson is giving the finger to the digital revolution by shooting his film on a resolution so high that digital can only dream of getting there in about ten years or so.The acting and the dialog is superb as you'd expect. Phoenix and Hoffman are on a different level here especially Phoenix in a role of a life time. There are definitely times in this film that he completely disappears into that role. There is also some great supporting work from Laura Dern and others.It would be difficult to place this film in his body of work. More than anything it feels like the natural continuation of what he started with There Will Be Blood. Not to say that he will continue on this path but just that this is definitely a more narrowly focused film than some of his earlier ensemble work. I found it to be less engaging than some of his other work and yet there was never a dull moment. You're always on your toes trying to understand what's going on and where the movie is leading you. It really is simply just like man a fascinating piece of work.".

He's secured a gig as a portrait photographer at a lavish department store imagined like a temple of indulgent commercialism. But Freddie doesn't last long there. In the darkroom he screws models and chugs rotgut he makes with photo chemicals. Ultimately he loses it on a customer not just hitting him but harassing and lambasting him working out some indecipherable irrepressible rage.Phoenix's performance as Freddie reduces all he's done before to a preparation exercise. He longs for something but even he can't tell you what and that sorrow has clotted into self destructive ritual. We see his snarly face from angles we haven't seen before.

He's a captivating animal.Then he meets stout articulate Lancaster Dodd always circled by people who treat him like a prodigy hanging on his every word laughing at all his mugging. Lancaster fancies himself a renaissance man. He's married to Peggy who's much more vigilant than we first think. His son trails the proceedings with a dormant pose of derision. His daughter marries a man who like everyone else in their clique views him as a wizard.The film belongs to Phoenix but Hoffman more than does his thing his affectations ringing with conceit and fraudulence. Freddiefather dead mother institutionalizedis naturally drawn to Dodd who promises answers mental freedom happiness even claims to cure leukemia. He's written a book his bootlickers treat as a sort of bible. He loves to charm and perform.It's wellknown that Lancaster's cult is inspired by L. Ron Hubbard's Scientology. It's not direct but the manner in which Lancaster draws Freddie into the fold among other things is unmistakably influenced by the contentious institution and Hubbard's life. Paul Thomas Anderson doesn't bind to that inspiration for his movie...but he doesn't bind to anything really. You walk out muddled wearied wondering where to start in connecting the dots in this elegant arresting movie. The story is as confounding as its technique is magnificent.Anderson the true wunderkind of the Tarantino generation sets everything up so beautifully you wait for the turning point to prevail so the intrigue can come to boil. Instead nothing progresses. The dramatic developments seem to dwindle and become less consistent as the movie drifts along and Anderson throws in pauses like a lingering desert scene or an outstretched montage in which Freddie is made to pace in a room that slow the movie to a drudge. Freddie's sex preoccupation which was stressed in the film's early stretch grows dissonant. It's less about narrative arc and more the emotional condition of two men a twist of trust and mistrust id and superego. PTA's vision is grand in scope but his result is not so much ambiguous as opaque and detached.For the first time in his immaculate career the greatest filmmaker of his generation seems to languish. His newfound frigidness makes the film easy to admire but difficult to love. Anderson is so stunningly impressive in fact that it's taken me two viewings of The Master to admit all this to myself. Understandably some critics have patronized it as deliberately evasive and occult but isn't that just doubletalk? A glorification of an artist's failure to proportionately bear his ideas? Something particularly intriguing is how the movie poses questions not so much about the importance of faith but how far the human limit for change can extend and to confront emotional devastation so heavy it can never recover. But the film is too ambivalent or cautious to probe them in depth. By the end it's become an opaque challenge between two phenomenal actors whose commitment to their roles is aweinspiring but it's manacled to a work so in awe of itself the audience gets blockaded.".

	schema:reviewBody "Paul Thomas Anderson has grown as perhaps the greatest American auteur of his generation. At 42 this is his 6th film following 1996's Hard Eight 1997's Boogie Nights 1999's Magnolia  my alltime favorite  2002's PunchDrunk Love and 2007's There Will Be Blood. Like the late master Kubrick and the aging master Terrence Malick who coincidentally just debuted his 6th film To the Wonder at the latest Venice Film Festival where PTA won the Silver Lion for Best Director he isn't the most prolific of filmmakers but his perfectionist creations cerebral yet strikingly cinematic and emotional always leave an indelible mark polarizing audiences but usually earning critical acclaim. The Master is no exception. Shot on 70mm film it is not so much of an outside epic as you'd imagine  although every single image is stunning and perfectly composed courtesy of cinematographer Mihai Malaimare Jr. who replaced Robert Elswit Anderson's usual collaborator. It closely resembles There Will Be Blood in tone and content but it stands on its own Jonny Greenwood is once again responsible for the score.Freddie Quell Joaquin Phoenix is a troubled and troubling drifter who becomes the righthand man of Lancaster Dodd actor extraordinaire Philip Seymour Hoffman the master of a cult named The Cause in postWWII America. Their strange ambiguous relationship is the center of the film. The Master is a thoughtprovoking indictment of cult fanaticism and lies sold as religion which has caused controversy and concern among Scientologists even before its release.

	onyx:emotionText "Paul Thomas Anderson has grown as perhaps the greatest American auteur of his generation. At 42 this is his 6th film following 1996's Hard Eight 1997's Boogie Nights 1999's Magnolia  my alltime favorite  2002's PunchDrunk Love and 2007's There Will Be Blood. Like the late master Kubrick and the aging master Terrence Malick who coincidentally just debuted his 6th film To the Wonder at the latest Venice Film Festival where PTA won the Silver Lion for Best Director he isn't the most prolific of filmmakers but his perfectionist creations cerebral yet strikingly cinematic and emotional always leave an indelible mark polarizing audiences but usually earning critical acclaim. The Master is no exception. Shot on 70mm film it is not so much of an outside epic as you'd imagine  although every single image is stunning and perfectly composed courtesy of cinematographer Mihai Malaimare Jr. who replaced Robert Elswit Anderson's usual collaborator. It closely resembles There Will Be Blood in tone and content but it stands on its own Jonny Greenwood is once again responsible for the score.Freddie Quell Joaquin Phoenix is a troubled and troubling drifter who becomes the righthand man of Lancaster Dodd actor extraordinaire Philip Seymour Hoffman the master of a cult named The Cause in postWWII America. Their strange ambiguous relationship is the center of the film. The Master is a thoughtprovoking indictment of cult fanaticism and lies sold as religion which has caused controversy and concern among Scientologists even before its release. By not mentioning real names Anderson is capable of broadening the scope of his story and making it richer  and subtler  than a straightforward Scientology flick would have been. Like his previous films there's more than meets the eye at a single viewing and his attention to detail pays off there's also a visual homage to Jonathan Demme's Melvin and Howard another favorite of Anderson's in a motorcycle racing scene. Hoffman is as good as ever and Amy Adams is highly effective slowly depriving herself of cutesy mannerisms as his wife. David Lynch's golden girl Laura Dern has a small role as well.

	schema:reviewBody "The Master is absolutely magnetic orchestrated brilliantly by writerdirector Paul Thomas Anderson and helmed by the commanding turns of Joaquin Phoenix and Philip Seymour Hoffman.Anderson has never been a director that makes a film for everyone to enjoy. In the vein of auteur directors like Terrence Malick David Lynch and Michael Haneke Anderson's films aren't necessarily the most accessible despite the seeming mainstream status. Films like Boogie Nights 1997 Magnolia 1999 and There Will Be Blood 2007 are reflective tensional studies of human behavior all things that the average filmgoer most of the time will not embrace. In The Master Anderson constructs absolutely magnificently I might add two dynamic real and tangible men that the audience can both imagine knowing loving and loathe. It's the writing masterpiece of the year.Lancaster Dodd Hoffman gets the best character blueprints of any player to interpret. Hands down the sharpest and best written character of the film is purely Lancaster. Anderson concentrates on his motivation and responses giving him an arc that the audience can both easily and willingly travel with him. Hoffman's natural talents as an actor and finding himself in a character are showcased here with intensity and composure. His often seemingly bloodfilled hotheaded dialogue encompasses some of the best moments of the film. It's evident Hoffman is not only enjoying himself but enjoying Lancaster. He's both repulsive but completely enamoring in structure word and persona. Anderson may have created the great oxymoron of cinema this century. Hoffman is damnnear perfect.The performance of the year... On the flip side Joaquin Phoenix not only inhabits a character never seen by him or any actor before but assembles a man from scratch beat by beat trait by trait. It's not just the finest acting performance of the year not only the finest acting performance this millennium it could be the finest work of the past twenty years or so. I can only recollect a handful of actors that have the gumption to stand toetotoe with Phoenix's work here. His Freddie Quell is utterly unpredictable strutting glaring and holding an explosive mentality that could detonate at any moment. Phoenix controls it even though there are many instances where you feel like he's losing it. Quell is frightening admitting his evil unbalance and instability. Phoenix externalizes this in his zealous and disturbing actions but more importantly internalizes it in body language and character beats that not many actors dedicated to the craft can achieve. Joaquin Phoenix is not just Oscarworthy he's Oscarbound. It's the performance you can't deny the performance of the year. Let's hope they don't.Where Phoenix and Hoffman are strident and vociferous Amy Adams is internal and subtle but always at the brim. Peggy Dodd is multifaceted and extremely complex. Adams understands her amazingly well making intricate features that are surprising for goodgirl Adams. She gets dirty and dominating in not only a prolific manner but in a sultry method. Adams is a revelation. Laura Dern is brief but memorable a missed actress who should be doing more accessible work.Jonny Greenwood's score once again it's absolutely brilliant well placed astonishing and among the best composers this year. Mihai Malaimare Jr. cinematographer extraordinaire is just that extraordinary. Malaimare is painting scenes on a film canvas and we are witnessing the artist work. It's as if we're watching Bob Ross teach us the art of capture. Expect Cinematography to be named among Oscar's lineup in 2013 along with Film Editing Leslie Jones Peter McNulty and Production Design David Crank and Jack Fisk. It goes without saying Picture Director and Screenplay should be there alongside them.The Scientology subject is there and there are connections that can be made but are they obvious or intended? Not necessarily. It's not evident or offensive. I only hope that Paul Thomas Anderson and the film doesn't suffer from anyone assuming that its a slight at the group or any particular one for that matter.Though the film takes time to warm up to once the film soars it's soars high. While The Master is not for everyone and there could be many detractors there are three scenes in particular that are masterpieces in filmmaking. Anderson levels and executes a difficult subject with no fear or hesitation. He also knows his characters what they are who they are and marrying the actors to them in a way not many directors can do. Anderson unites film with art again and The Master is their bond. It's good to see them together again.".

	schema:reviewBody "In a broad sense The Master tells the story of a soulless drifter Freddie Quell Joaquin Phoenix constantly drunk and with no purpose in life finding sanctuary in the company of The Cause a cultlike group lead by a charismatic intellectual Lancaster Dodd Philip Seymour Hoffman. This plot description does not do the film full justice because with this film Anderson fully releases himself from the constraints of traditional narrative storytelling. The film is told in a streamofconsciousness style loosely linking together vignettes and moments from the time these two men spend together without any sense of drive purpose or goal in the traditional screen writing sense. It is a style perfectly befitting the emotional and spiritual state of the main character Freddie adrift in life with no anchor or sense of purpose of his own. Throughout the film Anderson occasionally cuts back to a shot of the wake of a slowmoving ship placing us the audience aimlessly drifting through the narrative just as Freddie is. What results is a series of scenes snapshots of events some narratively linked and some not. The film is very subjective and puts us squarely in Freddie Quell's mind as a result no easy answers are given many questions remain mysteries and we never get a firmly grounded sense of reality many events remain ambiguous and keep us wondering as to their fidelity long after the film is over.The Master is Anderson's most cinematically humble film yet. Gone are the sweeping camera moves rapidfire editing and high style of his previous films even the slow meticulous beautifully lit tracking shots of There Will Be Blood are gone. Instead Anderson submits to a wholly utilitarian shooting style only moving the camera when necessary to capture action in the shot and using formal framing techniques and naturalistic but still very beautiful lighting to comment on the characters' internal states. That said it would be impossible to talk about the film's visual style without commenting on Anderson and cinematographer Mihai Malaimare Jr.'s decision to shoot on 65mm film. This film stock especially when projected in 70mm provides the film with an unprecedented sense of clarity and sharpness. The 65mm lenses provide a very unique and distinctly shallow depth of field that adds to the dreamlike quality of the film and helps emphasize the isolation the characters feel. It would be a crime to watch the film on any other format.All this discussion about nonnarrative elements thematic overtones and film formats is not to minimize what is possibly the film's crowning and most longlasting achievement the performances. Philip Seymour Hoffman one of the most consistent performers working today and an Anderson regular delivers another powerful charismatic performance in line with his turn in Doubt. It is for the most part an effectively subtle performance maintaining a controlled dignity peppered with the occasional outburst. Amy Adams delivers a similarly dignified performance. Her character is mostly quiet observing from the sidelines but she has her moments to shine in the aforementioned private scenes between her and Lancaster in which she completely dominates him. But the highlight of the film is without a doubt Joaquin Phoenix's tremendous performance as Freddie Quell. Over the years Phoenix has without much fanfare slowly but surely cemented himself as one of the best actors working today with powerful turns in many varied films from his deliciously villains turn as emperor Commodus in Gladiator to his quiet grave personification of Johnny Cash in Walk the Line. Now after a fouryear absence from narrative films he returns with what is undoubtedly a career best performance and one that with any luck will win him a muchdeserved Oscar. His utter and complete immersion in the character of Freddie Quell has to be seen to be believed. His back hunched swinging his arms like an ape his frame thin his face twisted and distorted mumbling and slurring his speech out of the corner of his mouth like he is just learning how to behave in society for the first time and failing. And Phoenix' physical commitment to the performance doesn't stop there either he flings himself into scenes of raw violence that look and feel completely real. It is a crowning achievement in the art of acting and the method rivaling that of Daniel DayLewis in Anderson's previous film and it further cements the biggest difference between Anderson and Stanley Kubrick as directors Where Kubrick is known for his actors' cold removed performances Anderson has become the most consistent source for highcaliber Acting with a capital A.It's hard to really explain what makes The Master work even though it lacks many traditional narrative elements that provide most other films with powerful drama closure and immediate gratification. It's a very subjective experience and I'm sure many viewers will have difficulty immersing themselves in the film without the typical sense of narrative progression and character goals. For this reason The Master is probably Anderson's least accessible film. That said I think it is a testament to Anderson's enormous intellect and directorial abilities that he managed to capture the attentions and fascination of so many viewers and critics. He certainly won me over although I had more visceral and immediately satisfying reactions to Anderson's previous films I find that The Master lingers on long after the lights went up in the theater. The film's intellectual ambitions along with its very unique eerie tone will keep me mulling over the experience for days to come. Already I feel the urge to revisit it and attempt to uncover more of the film's secrets. And that right there is a telltale sign of an instant classic film in the making.".

	schema:reviewBody "Paul Thomas Anderson's The Master is a puzzling often bewildering film. Very few films have left me shaken and stirred and still leave me wondering What was that all about? I can't say that I hated the ride. It is quite simply a remarkable film from one of America's best filmmakers today. This film is not for everyone however.The film's center plot the one about selfdescribed nuclear physicist philosopher and professor Lancaster Dodd and his organization The Cause  as seen from the point of view from a shellshocked psychotic drunk Freddie Quell. During the course of the film Lancaster and Freddie bond somewhat with Lancaster progressing his latest works.The main performances by Joaquin Phoenix and Philip Seymour Hoffman are superb and should warrant both of them Academy Award Nominations for Best Actor. Both of them. Phoenix is literally on fire here his quirky mannerisms twitching lips unforgiving unsettling eyes and ferocious anger and voice had me on the edge every time I see him on screen. Hoffman also is more subtle though we see growing anger and rage whenever he feels that his work is being threatened. He can be classy charismatic and when threatened loses all of that and becomes about as desperate as Freddie. Brilliant work by both actors. Watch the scene where Lancaster gets through to Freddie or the harrowing scene where both of them are in jail cells. Special mention to Amy Adams who while not really standing out gives off a peculiar and somewhat sinister aura whenever she's on the screen.Anderson's solid screenplay and his concentrated direction bring the goods. There seems to be a pattern about Anderson's last three films including this one. Both PunchDrunk Love and There Will Be Blood featured lead characters who are extremely lonely and prone to snap to anger. The Master is somewhat a bit of both where the lonely man can be both psychotic without reason and yet there are scenes which show he is after all a man. Some very well written lines If you can find peace without looking up to a master any master... meshed with some really great cinematography by Mihai Malaimare Jr. that brings nice color tones to the 1950 production design. Complementing all of this is Jonny Greenwood's eerie dissonant score which makes the movie all the more odd unsettling and yet compelling to watch.Eventually both men in the movie are the masters of their own fate and Anderson his own. It may move some and it may turn away others but this is a fascinating watch nonetheless. The Master is one of 2012's very best films.Overall 91".

	schema:headline " P.T. Anderson makes another under appreciated masterpiece";
	schema:reviewBody "Often in the history of film there have been remarkable gems hailed by few and ignored by the masses. Over time many of these gain the credit they deserve Citizen Kane was panned by many critics at the time and only with the passing of time has its influence and brilliance been generally acknowledged. P.T. Anderson's new film The Master may not be Citizen Kane but it is certainly in the same vein. As Orson Welles modeled Charles Foster Kane after William Randolph Hearst Anderson's new film focuses on another controversial historical figure L. Ron Hubbard. Like Welles Anderson treats his characters with the same mixture of examination and empathy that leaves you questioning pre conceptions and wondering what truly defines an individual.In postwar America Freddie Quell played by Joaquin Phoenix  a former soldier with an abnormal libido and a hobby of making near toxic alcohol is wandering through life like an actor oblivious of his stage. His course takes a slight detour when he wakes up aboard a ship with Lancaster Dodd Philip Seymour Hoffman and his followers who make up The Cause a cultish religion clouded in the guise of science philosophy and psychology. Dodd sees in Quell the opportunity to display the power of his new methods and in Dodd Quell sees a mentor and hope for answers to the questions that plague all humanity.Like many of Anderson's films the pace can often be trying and the often surreal visions expounded are certainly not for everyone's taste. Images of swirling water are only a drop in the bucket of metaphors Anderson buries his audience in. Like Anderson's last film 2007's There Will Be Blood gorgeous imagery and an eerie score help create a dreamlike sense of bewilderment that stays with you long after the lights go up and the popcorn is stale.Anderson's ability to craft film as art is only matched by his eye for talent. Philip Seymour Hoffman in his fifth collaboration with Anderson plays Dodd with wonderful simplicity that allows the complexity of the character speak for itself. With subtly and reserve Hoffman lets his character's egotism and magnetism shine through Anderson's typically biting dialogue. Joaquin Phoenix still recovering from his 2010 film debacle I'm Still Here gives a powerhouse performance reminding us all what was so intriguing to begin with.

	onyx:emotionText "Often in the history of film there have been remarkable gems hailed by few and ignored by the masses. Over time many of these gain the credit they deserve Citizen Kane was panned by many critics at the time and only with the passing of time has its influence and brilliance been generally acknowledged. P.T. Anderson's new film The Master may not be Citizen Kane but it is certainly in the same vein. As Orson Welles modeled Charles Foster Kane after William Randolph Hearst Anderson's new film focuses on another controversial historical figure L. Ron Hubbard. Like Welles Anderson treats his characters with the same mixture of examination and empathy that leaves you questioning pre conceptions and wondering what truly defines an individual.In postwar America Freddie Quell played by Joaquin Phoenix  a former soldier with an abnormal libido and a hobby of making near toxic alcohol is wandering through life like an actor oblivious of his stage. His course takes a slight detour when he wakes up aboard a ship with Lancaster Dodd Philip Seymour Hoffman and his followers who make up The Cause a cultish religion clouded in the guise of science philosophy and psychology. Dodd sees in Quell the opportunity to display the power of his new methods and in Dodd Quell sees a mentor and hope for answers to the questions that plague all humanity.Like many of Anderson's films the pace can often be trying and the often surreal visions expounded are certainly not for everyone's taste. Images of swirling water are only a drop in the bucket of metaphors Anderson buries his audience in. Like Anderson's last film 2007's There Will Be Blood gorgeous imagery and an eerie score help create a dreamlike sense of bewilderment that stays with you long after the lights go up and the popcorn is stale.Anderson's ability to craft film as art is only matched by his eye for talent. Philip Seymour Hoffman in his fifth collaboration with Anderson plays Dodd with wonderful simplicity that allows the complexity of the character speak for itself. With subtly and reserve Hoffman lets his character's egotism and magnetism shine through Anderson's typically biting dialogue. Joaquin Phoenix still recovering from his 2010 film debacle I'm Still Here gives a powerhouse performance reminding us all what was so intriguing to begin with. Somehow Phoenix makes a character who should come off as a simpleton violent alcoholic a very empathetic and human individual. In the end he is still not very likable like many people in this world but you can nevertheless sympathize with his mortal struggle. Whether or not Phoenix will get the Best Actor Oscar as many have discussed is still anyone's guess especially with the multiOscar winning Daniel Day Lewis who won his second Oscar for Anderson's There Will Be Blood in the competition.

	schema:reviewBody "Unquestionably P.T. Anderson's best film so far. I've always liked his work but early on I had no sense he would achieve heights such as this. Let me say this Anderson ALONE I think amongst relatively bigbudget American filmmakers allows his imagery to play by its own rules. EVERY other studio filmmaker from Scorsese to Tarantino to Jarmusch plays by some kind of preestablished ruleseven if they are the preestablished rules of art cinema or second cinema. Anderson like Weerasthakul or Bela Tarr speaks his own tongue. I thought There Will Be Blood was pretty great but this is Truly Great a singularly challenging work of art. Similarly I would compare Daniel DayLewis's work in Blood with Phoenix's work here. The former was impressive creative witty. The latter is brave adventuresome and merciless. More than any of the canonical method performances of cinema I think Phoenix reaches into places of himself of all of us that's very unearthing demands new philosophical questions. Here's my take for what it's worth of the meaning of the film. It's a comparison of two drastically contradictory and complementary personalities. One wants to live without any Master by becoming a Master himself. The other wants a master to give some kind of shape to his life. L. Ron Hubbard inspired guru Lancaster Dodd played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman in a performance that's beautiful but not groundbreaking is a conman but as I read him he's not exactly a charlatan. He truly wants to believe the selfserving things he's saying and he needs other people to believe them too. He's very successful at least the latter half of this. But this does not make him free. Instead it turns him into a kind of King and as we know from the example of Louis XVI any sovereign is ultimately a privileged prisoner of hisher subjects. They are exempt from the laws of the land of life exactly in so far as others believe they are. Dodd's freedom from mastery is wholly dependent on the worship of the other an other outstandingly represented by Phoenix's Freddie Quell a potentially unbreakable scoundrel who Dodd both fears and admires as such. Quell is a completely irredeemably broken individual whose only surviving qualities are sheer animal instinct screw eat and drink. He yearns to be put back together to be mastered by some other to serve some sovereign and thus be welcomed back into civilization. But he's too far gone or too savage for that to work. He can't be mastered even by any coherent sense of self. Dodd seeks the solitude of the sublime but is ultimately made completely dependent on the Other while Quell very unwillingly achieves the freedom and loneliness of God.".

	schema:headline " Spoilers The Master may not convert you but it did convince me";
	schema:reviewBody "From the first second the movie gets going it becomes clear that Paul Thomas Anderson's ''The Master'' is not a war movie it's not an action flick or comedy although there are some great laughs here and there. There will always be those who will go into a movie theater no matter what's being shown hoping for some orgasmic CGI display coupled with a plot whose sole purpose is to validate the viewer's basic moral beliefs.So to give you an idea of what the film is aboutspoilers Freddie Quell is returning home from the pacific theater in WWII traumatized and sick of the world. His attempts to fit into society moderate his drinking of dubious potions of alcohol he brews himself have a normal healthy relationship and work as a photographer all fail miserably. He ends up on a yacht after being forced on the run and meets Lancester Dodd The Master and leader of a cult organization called The Cause. Now this film is obviously partly a critique of Scientology. Hoffman's got a good resemblance to Hubbard's physique his character also claims to be a nuclear physicist and i believe the name ''The Cause'' is a subtle parody of CoS the abbreviation most commonly used for The Church of Scientology.Now although the movie is a satire of CoS and maybe religion in general i find it to be so much more. It's easy to see the film as simply the struggle and friendship between Freddie and Dodd master and slave yin and yang. The charismatic and secretive cult leader vs the demented and aggressive vagabond. If you'd ask me i'd say that the film is mostly about Freddie after all there's a very dreamy quality to a lot of the narrative and it seems PTA is taking his lessons from Kubrick and Lynch in exploring Freddie's trauma. Freddie's journey from battleship to cultcommanded yacht the captain metaphors everywherethere's even a small statue of a captain behind a steering wheel on Lancester's desk near the end of the film the dream scene and the scene near the end with Freddie lying on the beach all imply that there's something going on behind the curtains.Although a lot of the film heavily resembles ''There Will Be Blood'' this film isfittingly more mystical and open to interpretation. spoilers perhaps it's symbolic that Freddie escapes from The Cause in the desert after serving his master on the sea.

Even if this whole arthouse thing might turn you off i've got to add that this film's got some amazing performances especially from Phoenix.

	onyx:emotionText "From the first second the movie gets going it becomes clear that Paul Thomas Anderson's ''The Master'' is not a war movie it's not an action flick or comedy although there are some great laughs here and there. There will always be those who will go into a movie theater no matter what's being shown hoping for some orgasmic CGI display coupled with a plot whose sole purpose is to validate the viewer's basic moral beliefs.So to give you an idea of what the film is aboutspoilers Freddie Quell is returning home from the pacific theater in WWII traumatized and sick of the world. His attempts to fit into society moderate his drinking of dubious potions of alcohol he brews himself have a normal healthy relationship and work as a photographer all fail miserably. He ends up on a yacht after being forced on the run and meets Lancester Dodd The Master and leader of a cult organization called The Cause. Now this film is obviously partly a critique of Scientology. Hoffman's got a good resemblance to Hubbard's physique his character also claims to be a nuclear physicist and i believe the name ''The Cause'' is a subtle parody of CoS the abbreviation most commonly used for The Church of Scientology.Now although the movie is a satire of CoS and maybe religion in general i find it to be so much more. It's easy to see the film as simply the struggle and friendship between Freddie and Dodd master and slave yin and yang. The charismatic and secretive cult leader vs the demented and aggressive vagabond. If you'd ask me i'd say that the film is mostly about Freddie after all there's a very dreamy quality to a lot of the narrative and it seems PTA is taking his lessons from Kubrick and Lynch in exploring Freddie's trauma. Freddie's journey from battleship to cultcommanded yacht the captain metaphors everywherethere's even a small statue of a captain behind a steering wheel on Lancester's desk near the end of the film the dream scene and the scene near the end with Freddie lying on the beach all imply that there's something going on behind the curtains.Although a lot of the film heavily resembles ''There Will Be Blood'' this film isfittingly more mystical and open to interpretation. spoilers perhaps it's symbolic that Freddie escapes from The Cause in the desert after serving his master on the sea. There's even a scene where Lancester refers to him as 'his little soldier' and people honestly say that the film is pretentious. Really? Even if this whole arthouse thing might turn you off i've got to add that this film's got some amazing performances especially from Phoenix. Anyways if you don't mind a slow pace and a film that relies ongreat acting instead of gimmicks i'm sure The Master is something for you unless perhaps if it insults your personal beliefs in which case there's nothing this review will do to change your mind.";

It's like waking up in a fog bank you don't really know where to go.Yeah it's a story of the beginning of a cult so it's not going to make much sense. I get it. But they go beyond that to make it a really bad movie. The big problem is they put the plot focus on the mentally unstable character Freddie Quall played by Joaquin Phoenix. The problem with Quall is he's not really disturbing which could be fascinating see Hannibal Lecter but just disturbed. You can't make a movie surrounding a character like that! He's not compelling he's not interesting he's just sad. The writers made a terrible blunder by making this guy TOO disturbed so disturbed you feel like you're staring at a homeless guy trying to figure out when he's going to eat his own feces. That makes YOU the creepy one! This and other choices by the filmmakers makes The Master a sloppy unwatchable mess. Besides focusing too much on Quall's lunacy it skips  jumps around and just when you think it's going to get interesting or deep they skip along to something else. Then it starts this homoerotic undercurrent and then just ... ends.I wouldn't even call it a good allegory on Scientology or other cults. It is almost worthless in that regard there's only a few moments that show the malicious intent of groups like this but then they swoop back to Phoenix acting disturbed again. I suppose I could say Philip Seymour Hoffman does a good job playing cult leader Lancaster Dodd. I wish he was the actual focus of the movie but for whatever reason the filmmakers decided not to do that.Regardless we spent a good hour afterward complaining about how bad this movie was and that ended up being the best part of it.".

I thought it captured the feel of the time period very well.On to the bad of which there is substantially more in my view. I'll start with the plot. There is almost none and the movie has no hook. It never made me forget I was sitting in a movie theater. Its pace is maddeningly slow and it is too long. A good portion of the film is spent watching Phoenix walk back and forth between a window and a wall for reasons that remain rather opaque. Yes it's that kind of movie.I didn't care at all about Phoenix's character or Hoffman's and despite the rave reviews I think neither actor brought their Agame to this one. Their characters were one dimensional unsympathetic and unrelatable. They didn't feel like real people. They don't really change much over the course of the movie.What irked me most though was that the movie really didn't have anything to say. It had no real insights into anything. It didn't make me think or challenge my mind in any way.When a movie fails to make me think or feel as this one did I can't help but regret spending money on it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Well I really wanted to like this one. On paper it's perfect. Directorwriter Paul Thomas Anderson cast headed by Joaquin Phoenix Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Amy Adams. What could go wrong? The script. If a movie doesn't start with a good script it can't turn out well. There is no crest to this story. And there is no denouement. It lays flat for over two hours. The actors give great performances and the scenes are constructed well. Joaquin Phoenix has moments that are tragic. And then the movie just plods on. I am fine with a film that develops slowly. I'm not fine with a film that never develops. Is it about an alcoholic? No. Is it about a cult leader? No. It's random moments between an alcoholic and a cult leader strung together with no direction and no narrative. You could extract any scene from this film and on it's own it would stand up well. Pieced together however they don't add up to a story. A story has to be about something. It has to start somewhere and it has to go somewhere. This story starts and then goes nowhere. It is fine if the resolution of a story is simply it's endlessness. This film however never establishes where it's going. And therefore can't simply go on forever. It never went anywhere to begin with. The actors are left to spluge all over the audience for no discernible reason. I'm over Phillip Seymour Hoffman and have been for a while. In this role as a sort of L. Ron Hubbard figure he overacts to the point of caricature. For my money the best Seymour Hoffman is Boogie Nights Happiness or The Talented Mr. Ripley. Joaquin Phoenix is probably the most talented American actor working today but his physically contorted repetitive mentally tortured alcoholic Freddie Quell was never given the opportunity to become real or sympathetic or even vile. He just like the rest of the movie went on and on and on. This actor Joaquin Phoenix has the chops to do anything. Check him out in Reservation Road Gladiator Walk The Line and his BEST Two Lovers. In Two Lovers Phoenix draws the portrait of an emotionally crippled man whose life crumbles beyond all hope in his eyes but through an accident of fate finds a path through which to go on living. He is riveting. There isn't anything he can't do given the opportunity. But he doesn't get the opportunity here.Clearly this film was trying to comment on cultism. We know too much however Jonestown Waco Warren Jeffs about cults to accept this fraction of a story. Clearly the main character was an alcoholic. Yet the film never explored his turmoil or addiction the way even a dumb show like Celebrity Rehab would. We were almost brought close enough to his story to care during his first session with Phillip Seymour Hoffman but that was not developed and ultimately went nowhere. Just like the rest of the film.There are some shocking scenes in this film. But there is no story that justifies them. It is like watching a big screen version of Americas Most Shocking Videos  for over two hours. They are independently compelling but ultimately disconnected. And they never amount to a story about anything I could wrap my arms around. For me the ultimate failure of this film is that there was no point to it. It is not an art film. It is a pointless film. And it's not that I don't get it. There's nothing to get. Better to spend your time watching car crashes on TV shot from dash cams. At least you won't expect much going in.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Master is the latest film by American filmmaker Paul Thomas Anderson. The movie comes after a gap of five years following Anderson's highly successful outing in There Will Be Blood 2007. The Master stars Joaquin Phoenix Philip Seymour Hoffman and Amy Adams in pivotal roles. Anderson is one of the few commercial filmmakers alive today who write their own screenplays. And perhaps that's the reason why he has not been very prolific as a filmmakeryielding only once every 45 years. The Master also marks the return of Joaquin Phoenix from a selfimposed acting break. The movie presents the tale of Freddie Quell Joaquin Phoenixa WWII Naval veteran on the brink of a mental breakdown. Freddie belongs to the dying breed of war veterans which finds it hard to adjust to the sanities of a postwar civilized world. The excruciating pain and mental trauma that a soldier experiences during a war is irreversible and often enough to drive him crazy. Freddie has had a troubled past but the war has broken him completely. Freddie's pitiful perverted mental state can be best described by the two bizarre scenes presented at the beginning of the film. In the first one Freddie is shown masturbating in front of a sand sculpture of a woman which he perversely seems to use as a substitute for a love doll. In the second one Freddie is shown imbibing a certain fluid most likely gasoline directly from the fuel tank of a Navy vessel. Freddie is dipsomaniac with a morbid liking for dangerous cocktail drinks which he prepares by mixing alcohol with toxic substances like paint thinner. After being fired from a couple of jobs because of his irascible behavior Freddie stows away on the private yacht of Lancaster Dodd aka The Master Philip Seymour Hoffman. Dodd is the charismatic leader of a philosophical movement called The Cause. Freddie's life changes for ever after meeting Dodd. For the second time in his life after his stint in the US Navy Quell sees a cause worth fighting for. He begins to show a kind of jingoistic fervor for The Cause. Anyone who dares to oppose The Master and his preaching will have to first deal with him. What follows is a hypnotic journey of selfrealization which will either consume Quell or will make him the true master of his fate.The Master is a multifaceted work of cinema that can be enjoyed at so many levels. The Master has a sense of randomness attached to it that makes it a very difficult film to interpret. It may appear to have several interweaved layers to one viewer and yet appear completely hollow to anotherdepending purely on the viewer's understanding and interpretation. The Master works well on both the technical and emotional frontsanother rarity for an American film. The movie's cinematography music and editing are all topnotch and complement each other really well.The acting is aweinspiring to say the least and is quite easily one of the strongest points of the movie. Also there's enough room for character development. While the relationship that Quell and Dodd share is explicitly platonic in nature an undercurrent of homosexual impulse cannot be ruled out. Joaquin Phoenix is electrifying in the role of a lifetime. He takes great pains in conjuring up his selfloathing verminous reclusive alter ego as he himself gets lot in the role. Philip Seymour Hoffman is outstanding in the role of Lancaster Dodd and steals each and every scene he is a part of. Anderson elicits strong performances from the supporting cast especially Amy Adams who is an absolute treat to watch as Dodd's demanding wife Peggy.Overall The Master is an endlessly fascinating work of cinema that may require multiple viewings to grasp its deeper meanings. The Master is undoubtedly the best film to have come out of the Englishspeaking world in the year 2012. It's a real shame that the Academy yet again failed to identify a cinematic gem. The fact that the movie has not been nominated in the Best Picture category only substantiates the ineptness of the Academy in segregating topnotch cinema from the heaps of mediocrity. The Master like most of Anderson's movies is not meant for everyone. A casual viewer is ought to be disappointed for he may find it drab and utterly boring. But The Master will most definitely succeed in satisfying the deepest cravings of an intelligent viewer. Highly recommended! 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "I would like to say that I mean no disrespect to Paul Thomas Anderson. His contribution of Magnolia and There Will Be Blood to the world of cinema have been more than enough to forever place him permanently on the top 100 greatest filmmakers of all time list. These two masterpieces also forever forgive him for making his one great stinker Punch Drunk Love.Well he made another stinker here with The Master make no mistake about it. Here's a few thoughts on this film which I'll say is worth seeing unlike Punch Drunk Love.The acting is brilliant on all accounts. I think 90 of directing is casting so PTA hit this one out of the park. All the other departments of the production were right on but the most important department the story portrayal was just disregarded almost offensively so. The Master is a great character piece. The actors did their homework. But the film is one giant character study but with no coherent story. There's no spoilers in this review because there's nothing to spoil. So I can't even go into the details if I wanted to. This movie is about a series of subplots that meander into nothing juxtaposed with random unmotivated nudity and intense scenes where Joaquin Phoenix either beats someone's ass or you think he's going to beat someone's ass. Paul Anderson spends roughly 55 of the screen time developing the character of Lancaster Dodd P.S. Hoffman as this great writer persuasive teacher and potential cult leader much like L.Ron Hubbard and then... ffffttt. The other 45 of the film is spent very deliberately developing the character Freddie Quell J. Phoenix as a tormented raging alcoholic and disillusioned Navy vet... which also leads nowhere. Dodd tries to mentor Quell who desperately needs help and he doesn't really succeed. Phil Hoffman starts to get a cult like following gets arrested for something unclear and so does Phoenix for resisting Hoffman's arrest then poof they're both out of jail and nothing is explained. The two men separate briefly and Hoffman winds up in Europe and asks Phoenix to join him there. Phoenix joins Hoffman. Hoffman warns Phoenix never to leave again. Then Phoenix leaves and winds up on the beach caressing a naked female sand castle mirroring the first scene in the film where Phoenix is molesting a naked female sand castle. The film ends here. This is why I say it's a film half finished. Sure there was complexity and duality in the twisted past of Phoenix and the intelligence of Hoffman's character but none of it matters because there's no payoff for any journey the characters go on. At the end of the day it was just about Hoffman mentoring Phoenix off and on and the two men loving and hating each other. That's it. The great Amy Adams was poorly used in the film and doesn't deserve mentionIt's a familiar trend with Hollywood these days The characters are fantastic but the story is unexplored and unmotivated. If PTA hadn't wrote and directed this I would maybe give it a 4 or 5 as the casting was so strong. But a storyless movie can only be a maximum of 5 on my IMDb rating scale even if Stanley Kubrick himself made it and sent it to us from the great beyond. This film had many great attempts at taking you on a journey but always dropped the ball at every opportunity of beat and started new random and unconnected threads that didn't mean anything. I don't buy the it's an art film b.s... or the idea that it's s a subjective piece that should be interpreted differently for everyone. That's horse crap and the people who wrote the 9 and 10 star reviews know it. They are just under the spell of Hoffman's tremendous stage presence. Because let's face it without Hoffman this film doesn't work. We all know the ability Paul Anderson has to tell a profoundly original story while still being surreal and using music to motivate plot turns. The Lets be surreal just for the sake of being surreal method doesn't work for him. Sorry Paul you're not a Warhol Lynch or Von Trier why even try? The subjective 2001 Space Odyssey films have been made already. We're bored of people imitating that. at least I am. The Master is supposed to be based on John Huston's Let their be Light and loosely influenced by L. Ron Hubbard and the rise of Scientology much like Citizen Kane was supposed to be about William Randolph Hearst. But try as it did this was just a train wreck from the start. At no point did you get the feeling of a Scientologyesc uprising... or any kind of an uprising whatsoever. At least have the courage to show the cult rise to power or come out and say that Hubbard was a frickin nut case. At least that would be saying something. This film says nothing. It keeps you guessing and it's a huge let down when you realize the film is going to do the pretentious art thing and not explain anything. I don't know guys. I would wait for Netflix or Redbox on this one. Unless you enjoy paying a lot of money to be bored in public with a few hundred strangers all pretending to be blown away by nothingness... constantly waiting for the genius character performance of Hoffman and Phoenix to be engaged in a story. Why tease yourself?".

	schema:reviewBody "I was a bit sceptic before I decided to watch The Master. I had seen There Will Be Blood which was also directed by Paul Thomas Anderson and I did not like it. It was pretentious and the only reason people seemed to like it was because it was an unusual art house film. Unfortunately The Master turned out to be even worse.The film sort of follows a man called Freddie Quell played by Joaquin Phoenix. He comes into contact with Lancaster Dodd played by Philip Seymour Hoffman. Dodd is a cult leader and Freddy Quell falls for his charms and that's basically the whole plot. It's just Philip Seymour Hoffman spouting idiotic lines and Joaquin Phoenix acting like a mentally handicapped person. Occasionally Phoenix's character leaves the cult for no apparent reason only to return a few scenes later. The only thing the movie seems intent on conveying is that cults are weird and dangerous. Because of this the characters are shallow their motivations unclear and no one seems to behave normally. To a lot of people this is seen as an intelligent story but to me it's like something a mentally ill child would write.Normally in a film with a great cast but a weak story you can rely on good acting. Unfortunately even that can't be enjoyed. Hoffman and Phoenix are good and most of the supporting cast are reasonable. But if actors have to play characters with no purpose it's impossible to improve the quality of a film.After watching this film I asked myself what I had learned. My answer was nothing. How is this a good film? What makes the story good? To a lot of people it's probably because it's just different than most films. The great Paul Thomas Anderson doesn't need to tell a proper story he doesn't need to direct his actors so that they can give good performances. Mr Anderson can just shoot some clichd scenes while great actors just do some nonsense and he will be praised by the critics. Well I have had it with this pretentious rubbish. This is certainly one of the worst films I have ever seen and I think I will avoid Anderson's films from now on.".

When the agency's head office is attacked the Chief decides to assign Maxwell as a spy and partners him with sexy Agent 99 much to her chagrin. The duo nevertheless set off to combat their attackers by first parachuting off an airplane and landing in Russian territory  followed closely by an over seven feet tall 400 pound goon known simply as Dalip. The duo handicapped by Maxwell's antics will eventually have their identities compromised and may be chalked up as casualties while back in America their attackers have already planted a bomb that is setup to explode in a concert.";

	schema:headline " By far the BEST adaptation of a classic TV series for the big screen.";
	schema:reviewBody "I just saw an advance screening of Get Smart and it was great! It was  simply the best adaptation of a classic TV series for the big screen. I  don't know how to explain it but it successfully carried the tone that  the original series had. It was silly but not too silly and at the  same time a little serious but not too serious. Familiar characters  props music jokes and lines all brought back fond memories of a  delightful TV series. And there were plenty of new elements in this  film that made it interesting and entertaining to watch.  Steve Carrell was terrific as Agent 86 and seemed to capture the  essence of Maxwell Smart. Not only did his portrayal of him resembled  that of Don Adams' from the sound of Smart's voice to the delivery of  Smart's lines Carrell managed to inject a bit of his own personality  to create a new Smart that didn't stray too far away from the old.  Anne Hathaway was perfect as Agent 99. She did bear some resemblance to  Barbara Feldon and actually delivered her lines in a similar manner as  her at times. But more importantly she had great chemistry with  Carrell. A key ingredient to Get Smart's success was Maxwell Smart and  Agent 99's chemistry and I'm glad the writers of this film didn't  forget that. Feldon and Adams had terrific chemistry and so too did  Hathaway and Carrell.   Unlike previous film adaptations of old television series that only  superficially resembled their TV series counterpart this film can  truly be considered a big screen version of the Get Smart TV series.  Where Lost In Space Mission Impossible Charlie's Angels Starsky and  Hutch and have I missed anything? have failed this film succeeded in  maintaining the tone and style of the original series upon which it's  based. Moreover the filmmakers managed to bring Get Smart up to date  without forgetting its roots. New ideas created for this film seemed to  be natural extensions of those used for the original series. Jokes  props music characters and plot old and new all seemed to be born  from the Get Smart world.  I wish I could get into more details but I don't want to give anything  away. I thoroughly enjoyed this film and highly recommend this to  anyone especially fans of the original TV series.".

	schema:reviewBody "Yes go see this movie. I know sometimes a preview looks pretty good and then the movie stinks hello Indiana Jones IV? but this one does not disappoint.I remember enjoying the Get Smart TV series when I was a kid and like some other reviewers here I feared the remake might screw it up even though watching a couple of 5thseason episodes recently reminded me just how bad the show itself became late in the game. But this movie version strikes just the right balance of action and comedy while also balancing fresh ideas with welcome nods to the TV series.After all it wouldn't be Get Smart without Would you believe... Sorry about that Chief or Missed it by THAT much. It was also great to see such classics as the shoe phone the Cone of Silence Hymie the robot and not one but two of the cars that Don Adams would have driven. But while some remakes mining the past for material have nothing new to say and get stuck in paying homage to their predecessors the Get Smart movie has a pretty good story of its own. Now this isn't Robert Ludlum material and I doubt anyone is real surprised to see who turns out to be a bad guy but it's a lot of fun along the way with either a sight gag or surprisingly good action and often both at the same time coming down the pike every few minutes. There just aren't really any slow spots. I'm sure a lot of funny stuff got left on the cutting room floor surely they didn't put Carrell in a fat suit for a mere ten seconds of film but the pacing felt just right. We can catch all that other stuff when the DVD comes out at Christmas.Steve Carrel plays Agent 86 almost exactly the way he portrays DunderMifflin's Michael Scott. He comes off as basically wellmeaning and earnest and although a bit bumbling at times his Maxwell Smart is thankfully not Don Adam's version. Neither was this one of those Naked Gun characters who stumbles into success despite his incompetence Smart has some hilariously bad moments but is never made out to be simply a lucky fool.Carrell and Anne Hathaway have surprisingly good chemistry and Alan Arkin is perfect taking over Edward Platt's role as the Chief. Former wrestler Dwayne The Rock Johnson does a good job as Agent 23 and an even larger wrestler 7foot 2inch 387pound Dalip Singh from The Longest Yard is wellcast as a KAOS underling although most of the other main bad guys are rather forgettable. Even TVseries KAOS agent Bernie Koppel shows up for a cameo as does Patrick Warburton who will be terrific in the inevitable sequel and Bill Murray almost unidentifiable hiding in a tree. Bottom line you won't come out of this movie feeling as if you were cheated out of your money. Judging from the laughter in the theater and smiles in the lobby as we left a lot of folks agreed with me. This is going to make a ton of money and deserves it. Look for Get Smart II in a couple of years and let's just hope it is as good as this one. P.S.  It's rated PG13 but there's very little that's objectionable for even younger viewers Carrel rips the seat out of his pants. Take the kids and have a good time!".

	schema:headline " Fun light summer entertainment";
	schema:reviewBody "As I was watching Get Smart I came to the delighted realization that the filmmakers weren't trying to do a spy spoof here but rather a loving tribute to spy movies with a lot of comedy thrown in. This is the right approach as the nowtired Austin Powers franchise has pretty much run the spy spoof idea into the ground. Director Peter Segal a veteran of many past Adam Sandler comedies tries and succeeds at doing something rare. Get Smart is silly enough to work as a comedy but at the same time contains some truly impressive action sequences that would be right at home in just about any summer blockbuster that had a slightly more serious mind.I cannot claim to be an expert on the original 1960s TV series created by Mel Brooks and Buck Henry but I do have enough knowledge to know that this is a fitting and loving tribute that won't insult fans of the show or alienate newcomers with countless injokes. The casting of Steve Carell as the wellmeaning and often bungling secret agent Maxwell Smart was a great decision. Carell is able to capture the spirit of the performance of late actor Don Adams while not trying to ape Adams' distinctive voice and mannerisms. He fits comfortably into the role and does not make Smart into an incompetent goof. He plays the part as a man with some obvious intelligence but things don't often go the way he intends. It's a very likable comic performance and Carell even gives the character a lot more personality than I expected walking into the film.As is expected the plot is mainly something to hang a lot of situations for Smart to be in over his head. He starts off as an analyst for CONTROL a top secret government spy organization devoted to thwarting the terrorist designs of the evil organization KAOS. Smart dreams of being a field agent and has even taken the test eight separate times only to be turned down each time by the Chief Alan Arkin who thinks Smart belongs as an analyst. When KAOS launches a surprise attack on CONTROL headquarters killing most of the field agents the Chief has no choice but to promote Smart and send him off on the latest mission. He is teamed up with Agent 99 Anne Hathaway to travel to Russia and uncover a secret weapons factory where the evil organization is developing nuclear weapons to target America. With the aid of Agent 23 Dwayne Johnson back at the base Smart and Agent 99 will attempt to stop head KAOS agent Sigfried Terrence Stamp from carrying out his master plan of destruction.Get Smart is breezy frequently very funny and never once slows down enough to become dull. This is one of those movies where you can tell that the cast is having a great time and that joy carries through on the screen. The movie is a comedy but the action scenes and stunt work on display are truly first rate. What's perhaps most impressive is that the movie finds a perfect way to blend the silliness and the spectacle so that the two halves never seem out of place. The entire cast play the comedy as if they are smart people who can't believe what they've just done or what is happening to them. This is a comedy that laughs with the characters not at them. There's a scene where Maxwell and Agent 99 have to crash a lavish party being thrown by a suspected enemy agent and Smart winds up dancing with an obese woman. A lesser movie would have mocked the woman but here the movie finds humor in the situation in other ways. The fact that the woman winds up with the final laugh and that it's not at her expense was very welcome.Aside from the very strong lead from Carell Anne Hathaway brings a certain sexy yet vulnerable charm to her role. She's a good match for him as a costar and they create a good buddy chemistry as the film goes on. They're slightly less successful when they're asked to bring romantic chemistry into the relationship but it's not really their fault since the film does seem to be trying to start a franchise so I'm sure there's time for it to build in a sequel. Former prowrestler Dwayne Johnson drops his the Rock title for the first time meaning he's finally serious about moving beyond his past and becoming a real actor. He manages to get some laughs here and even has some charisma leading me to believe he could be the rare wrestler to move onto an actual career in films. There are even some fun cameos including James Caan as the President of the United States and Bill Murray turns up as a fellow field agent who has the unfortunate task of having to pose as a tree while undercover. There are some more to look for some for fans of the original show and some for fans of Saturday Night Live but I'll leave those for you to discover yourself.Get Smart is probably one of the stronger TVtofilm adaptations to come along in a while. It's not Earthstopping entertainment and it never pretends to be. It's merely a light and simple summer comedy that's a great way to kill an afternoon. We need those during the summer as much as we need the big blockbusters so it's fortunate that this is a very good one. And despite the film's PG13 rating I can't imagine any parent being offended by letting their kid watch it. Get Smart is harmless and entertaining and sometimes that's all a movie needs to be.".

When CONTROL headquarters is attacked by longtime nemesis group KAOS and many of the Agents' identities are compromised Smart is promoted to Agent 86 and partners with the unwilling Agent 99 Anne Hathaway to thwart the villainous group's latest plan for world domination.Whether or not Steve Carell perfectly embodies Maxwell Smart he certainly knows how to handle his comedy. Excelling at both physical and verbalstemmed laughs Carell makes the tumbles look as easy as his notable style of quick quips and clever observations and the funnyman seems to garner chortles even when the rest of the crew can't quite muster an equal energy. Anne Hathaway provides the good looks and serious attitude to counter Agent 86's incessant jokes and the pair's on screen chemistry gels nicely throughout the majority of the film. A few slips and failed retorts interrupt the flow of their characters' progressions but are quickly forgotten in the grand scheme. Alan Arkin furnishes several of the funniest moments in the movie and the Academy Awardwinning actor never misses a beat when the camera turns his way. Dwayne The Rock Johnson again confirms his status as a reliable comedic presence and laudably supports the leads. Many interesting cameos perforate the film and while they're amusingly recognizable they're also regrettably wasted. Few draw laughs with clever dialogue or comedic prowess but rather produce a quick smile for those that get the reference or enjoy the recognition.The humor throughout Get Smart always orbits around Carell and his singular style of comedy. Those that don't take a liking to his brand of wit will undoubtedly be less amused as he is clearly the driving force behind the vast majority of the entertainment value present. While Carell's lines are rarely delivered without a magnetic humor many of the conversations lose their luster midway due to faltering dialogue and a lack of focus on creating the biggest laughs. Several of the extravagant setpieces end with many a missed opportunity to supply more hilarity and lots of little laughs spread the truly uproarious moments too thin. While a healthy dose of romance drama and some truly spectacular action scenes appears commendable the devotion to these components often shortchanges the comedy.From exotic locales to storm drains and Moscow to Disney Hall the action and humor follows Maxwell Smart at breakneck speed. A few feeble gags and missed chances at grand hilarity can't ruin the fun and while they might have missed it by just that much it's not enough to detract from Carell's dynamic performance and the inspired comedy that trails closely behind.The Massie Twins".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw a preview of Get Smart last week at Warner Brothers and all my worries about what they would do with the great TV series vanished in the first few moments of the movie as Steve Carell enters Control through the famous doors and so began one of the most hilarious comedies I have seen in a long time. To my added delight I recognized Mel Brooks himself sitting in the back row and laughing along with everyone else! What a thrill for me that not only was I seeing an early screening of the movie but enjoying it with my hero the cocreator of my favorite TV show of all time. Carell and Hathaway are perfectly matched. They have somehow channeled the essence of Don Adams and Barbara Feldon. Carell is dropdead funny throughout but especially in a scene in the airplane. We all kept laughing right into the next scene but my favorite is a dance scene with Carell and 99 that will go down in movie history as a classic. Also I keep remembering the hilarious scene when a kid in a car tries to call his mom's attention to Carell flying outside across the car window and she testily dismisses him. At the end of the movie there was loud applause. This is a summer blockbuster. P.S. Real fans should stay through the end of the credits because the movie is dedicated to Don Adams and Ed Platt.P.P.S. I just read the interview with Mel Brooks and I'm delighted that he loves the movie made from the TV Series. He is certainly the best critic of it and so it thrilled me all the good things he said about it because I felt the same way!".

He does channel Don Adams when appropriate but really makes the character his own. His chemistry onscreen with Anne Hathaway who plays Agent 99 is great. There's been some complaints about the age difference but they clear that up in the film.The story line is solid and helps introduce this great spy comedy to a new generation.

	schema:reviewBody "The first 10 minutes or so of Get Smart are kind of disappointing and I thought here we go another trailer that makes the film look better than it is. But it improves greatly after that point mainly after the first encounter of Max with Agent 99. Anne Hathaway is in some ways the life of this movie she is incredibly sexy with a magnificent back and legs to die for or by and completely believable in all her action scenes. Steve Carell has good comic timing he may at times remind you of Leslie Nielsen in The Naked Gun and Spy Hard mode but beyond that he manages to make Max a genuinely likable and human character not just a cartoon. The relationship Max and 99 have formed at the end of the movie seems to be based more on friendship than anything else. The rest of the cast is generally wellchosen although I didn't get the point of Bill Murray's 1minute cameo there is a big plot twist that allows one cast member to play against type and even Dalip Singh aka The Great Khali in WWE comes off well playing a huge indestructible henchman in the tradition of Jaws of The Spy Who Loved Me and Moonraker.There are some good laughs in Get Smart but what pleasantly surprised me is how welldone the action is. From an exhilarating freefall sequence that was probably designed as a homage to the opening of Moonraker to Carell's and Hathaway's quick efficient fight scenes choreoghraphed by a veteran at this sort of thing James Lew and from the explosions at the bakery factory to the incredibly kinetic final chase sequence involving various means of transportation the action in this movie probably surpasses the recent James Bond pictures helped by the fact that a lot of it seems to have been done by the actors themselves willing to take some risks. So people who are more into action than into comedy should still get some satisfaction out of this.Nothing brilliant but a dependable crowdpleaser nonetheless. I'd give it  out of 4 stars.".

The dialog the gags and the characters are pure Get Smart. I do not believe anyone could have come into Don Adams shoe phone better than Steve Carell. He perfectly carries off the almost debonair yet not as clever as he thinks he is Agent 86. Anne Hathaway who looks breathtaking in black leather was awesome as Agent 99 completely playing the seasoned agent to Max's bumbling. Alan Arkin Dwayne Johnson and Terrance Stamp round out a great cast. I just hope though in the next movie we see more Hymie one of my all time favorite characters.

	schema:headline " A superb updating of a classic production!";
	schema:reviewBody "The new Get Smart does a masterful job of capturing the style tone and humor of the '60s series while transporting it into a modern sensibility. I had hopes for this film after seeing the two leads doing a 30second skit on the Academy Awards show and thought they were dead on. So I invested 11.50 and was proved right.First this is no cheap knockoff. The production team captured Buck Henry's creation very credibly both in tone and substance. It reminded me very much of the late '80s homage to Dragnet which was executed with love and great attention to detail right down to the product placement of Camel cigarettes and a photo of Jack Webb on the Dan Akroyd's desk. It's no small feat updating something as much a part of its era into a modern sensibility. There were even echoes of the early James Bond films especially in The Rock's ladykiller character flirting with CONTROL's Miss Moneypenny and in some of the musical cues. On the other hand the production values were all firstrate and contemporary including a CGI effect of an aerial flyaround and pushin to a 747 that was reminiscent of the key shot in the pilot of Star Trek.Steve Carrell makes a very reasonable Agent 86 where Don Adams played the character as a bumbling naif Carrell makes him into a goodhearted wannabe who despite having the kind of personality that renders him invisible in society still has intelligence and an earnestness that can make him into hero material when he works at it. He reminded me of Jim Varney's portrayal of Jed Clampett pure of heart and belief in his fellow man yet with a bit of chops in dealing with the dark side of society. He fumbles around a lot getting his sea legs after years of being an ineffectual fatso viz. impetuously slamming a fire extinguisher into the noggin of his boss at one point but in a pinch he's quickwitted and moves with decision. He also quite reasonably feels more secure in briefs than boxer shorts I don't know what Adam's take on this issue was.On the other hand Anne Hathaway nails Agent 99 with a performance absolutely capturing Barbara Feldon's creation right down to the tone of voice the raised eyebrows and at least three different deadon intonations of Oh Max! Nevertheless Hathaway moves the character beyond the prefeminist liberation era and invests 99 with a believable 21st century sexuality and sense of empowerment. She's clearly in charge during the first half of the movie only slowly yielding to an appreciation of Carrell's growing sense of command and her own feelings toward him as we move into Act 3.Alan Arkin brings an odd turn to the Chief playing him with a muchlessexasperated fatalism than did Edward Platt. In an interview Arkin says he saw the character as a very good principal of a very bad middleschool. He comes across as a somewhat old codger closing in on retirement who's comfortably in charge and doesn't try to micromanage and he has an important role in the climax piloting a Cessna over Disney Hall downtown but I missed one of the catchlines they didn't include in this revision namely the Chief getting one of his headaches. The other catchline they left out was 86's frequent That's the second biggest fill in the blank I've ever seen.Everything else was there though We see the Cone of Silence technologically updated a very clever CGI revision of the entrance passage to CONTROL HQ cameos by both Hymie the Robot and Fang and there's even a passing utilization in this cellphoneobsessed society to the shoephone appropriated from the Smithsonian institution display of the old defunct CONTROL. On the other hand the agency is now under the Homeland Security Department and answers to the Vice President when they can find him and uses lots of hightech satellite surveillance and GPS gear. Chaos is in cahoots with terrorist organizations around the world and we know they're bad because they drive around in SUVs the most satisfying and green event is seeing one of Satan's Sedans being demolished by a freight train.Oh and BTW it's also a love story.".

The script was hard to follow the story was nonsensical and scenes were random and lacked direction. Also much of the action was extremely contrived and poorly thought out. It was a good effort but as Max says they missed it by THAT MUCH! I am shocked to see how many glowing reviews there are for this stinker here on the IMDb. Obviously the movie producers are getting people to write lots of positive reviews on their movies and fill up the entries on the IMDb. If you read the positive reviews and compare them to the negative reviews it is pretty clear which ones are genuine reviews from normal users.This movie was full of problems and jokes that just didn't work. I loved Steve Carrell in Anchor Man and I like his comedy and style. But I will tell you that I never once laughed while I was watching this movie. Yes I had a couple of light moments a couple of chuckles but no real laughs. Nothing that struck me at all.Spoiler Alert! One ridiculous scene was when Max had his hands binded on the airplane and he goes to the bathroom to try to escape. He uses his special Swiss Army knife...but instead of just using THE BLADE OF THE KNIFE he tries to SHOOT the binding with his miniature crossbow. And as the crossbow missfires and shoots little arrows into him over and over again almost putting out his EYE Max doesn't give up or try the blade instead...no he just keeps shooting himself with the crossbow. What was he really expecting to do with that crossbow? It seemed to be THE WORST option on the knife to try to remove the bindings. It just made absolutely no sense.That is a good example of the typical circumstances in the scenes that made up this movie. They were ridiculous poorly thought out poorly motivated and made of pure nonsense. And that was truly distracting.As I said this movie was a big letdown and I recommend you avoid it. A note to the IMDb You should do something about these phony reviews that people are leaving. It degrades the authenticity of the site.".

However as a young generation Y'er who just recently spent two months obsessing over the five seasons of Get Smart the 60's TV show this movie pained me from the moment I entered and saw Steve Carell dumbing down the part. The backstories agent 99 getting plastic surgery and 86 as an analyst who was formerly morbidly obese shames the complexity of the original duo and paints a flat boring reevaluation of them. It seems the screenwriters unable to be truthfully funny in both dialogue and situation fell back on lame setups for Don Adams famous lines flashbacks to fat camp references to Carell's part in the office in the interview style camera angles they have and a female chauvinism that falls flat on its face.For those who have seen the original the writers of this movie thought they'd include some memories. They mention Herbie Fang now a worthless tiny furry dog that Carell covets the shoe phone the cone of silence and his classic red car and the doors and phone that intro'd the show. The classic music is back but now everything is updated generally for the worse. Cone of silence is now some weird blue telekinetic force field control headquarters are right under a museum that preserves Control's past. The movie lacks any creative random tech and replaces it with crossbows in swiss army knives. Lots of the humor in the movie is Carrel hurting himself or another character being hurt whether it be carrel spending two minutes shooting himself accidentally with the crossbow or getting punched by security guards or throwing up in airplanes. In the original Smart would insult a big foe attack him with no success and try to buddy up with him before getting pulverized. In this one he attacks without success and gets pummeled. It seems the screenwriters didn't understand the humor was established with the dialogue and not the pointless violence. It's like they took the names from the show and cut out all that made it good in the first place.The poster hides Carell's face beyond that of Hathaway's. The movie likewise shies away from anything that could make it good. They intertwine the classic music with the overdramatic action and romantic music in bigbudget films. Whereas the original fed off a campy feel this one replaces quality with massive doses of cgi explosions and pow sound effects. I was really looking forward to this as I finished the original series just two months ago and it ranked in my top five shows of all time. However this was a massive disappointment. The credits say they collaborated with Mel Brooks and Buck Henry but in all the things I've read on the internet they were largely left out of the writing process. In conclusion if you want to waste your money on a cashin with little value and no respect to its namesake go for it. But be prepared that the ride is not how you remembered it.PS I almost forgot the George Bush humor. They mention Nuculor falling asleep at fine art President's working for their vice pres and appreciating tackles over solving real problems. If you're into hearing the same jokes you heard 34 years ago in big budget movie form chuck your money here.".

Don't get me wrong I'm a huge Office fan and if this was Office the movie I'd be the first one in line but this was suppose to be Get Smart.

Apparently that is a lot more that can be said about the writers of this movie. Once again Hollywood has made a film that bears very little similarity with the source material...other than the title and the names of the characters. So at the outset those who DO want to see a remake of the TV show are going to be rather disappointed. The problem I see is much like the problems with the MissionImpossible films. The old shows were very plot driven but with both these movie remakes the movies are mostly driven by amazing special effects. The problem is that these special effects have nothing to do with the show and the entire spirit of the source material is missing.As for Maxwell Smart he is also quite different from the TV version. Don Adams' version was a guy who was essentially a lucky moron. Steve Carell's version is clumsy but he's also a genius at interpreting data and forecasting enemy action. A smart Maxwell Smart?!?! What gives?! In addition Chaos and Siegfried are smart and very dangerous Agent 99 is a macho killing machine and all the humor and gentleness of the show is gone.So to enjoy the film it really is best that you are young...very young. Otherwise you will be confused and irritated by the whole thing. I teach high school and several of the kids liked the film as it was clearly aimed only at them and people about their age. For anyone else don't bother.".

	schema:reviewBody "Yet another TV show becomes a movie. Steve The Office Carell plays dimwitted agent Maxwell Smart in a movie that's so bad it makes the worst movie you ever saw become the second worst movie you ever saw. The seventh rate story if you can call it that has a megalomaniac trying to take over the world. It is so unfunny it is absolutely pathetic. About the only thing Anne Hathaway does as agent 99 is look goodshe seems incapable of doing anything else. Bill Murray has the fine sense to limit his screen time to about 90 seconds and a few faces from the TV series turn up in very small roles. Movie is supposed to be part thriller and part action film. It is neither. Even though I really was not a fan of the TV series at least it was light years ahead of this piece of hit. All this does is drag it through the dirt and cheapen whatever good memories we had of it. Thank God Don Adams is not here to see it. Keep it up Hollywood! Keep making crappy movies like this and keep sendin 'em to the multiplexes on a weekly basis. No wonder the film industry is going down the tubes. This movie is so rotten it's NOT even good for laughs. If this movie were a newspaper it could be used to line the bottom of a bird cage. There is absolutely no reason to see this movie. A root canal is more enjoyable than this.! Rating zero minus five stars. Unless you are a Masochist STAY AWAY. Better still do what the title says Get Smart and save your nine bucks. You will be able to buy about 2 gallons of gas with it. Put it in your car and be thankful you did not waste it going to a multiplex to see this bomb!".

	schema:headline " Very disappointing";
	schema:reviewBody "Having been a great fan of the Get Smart series I had high expectations for the movie. I could not have been more disappointed. The director and writers completely missed the point. They could have made a movie about a new and naive secret agent and it might have been amusing. But if they wanted do make a movie specifically based on the Get Smart series they needed to build on the premise that it was a farce about an idiotic agent who somehow always prevails against equally idiotic villains.That's not the Get Smart movie. The movie is about a factdriven analyst who finally gets his chance to be a field agent. Agent Smart is naive and inexperienced but not played as a fool. He is not the silly idiotic agent that Don Adams wonderfully portrayed. Steve Carell's Smart is not a fool just new inexperienced clumsy and naive.Don Adams was hilarious as Smart who was anything but smart. He'd say Would you believe this building is surrounded by 100 Control agents? When told his foe found that hard to believe Adams' Smart systematically reduced the threat to something like Would you believe 3 boys scouts and a guard dog? And he would say it with such earnestness that it made clear just how foolish he was actually thinking he could change his story and still hope to be believed. When Carell's Smart pulls the same gag it feels totally out of character. His Smart is no fool and would never say such an idiotic thing. So it makes no sense other than the writers wanting to get in a gag from the series while changing the lead character so that the gag no longer makes sense.The movie includes the cone of silence but frankly it was done much funnier in the series. There are brief scenes showing Hymie the robot the red car and the phone booth. But that's just to remind us that this is the Get Smart movie.The series was laughoutloud funny about a goofy stupid agent against stupid enemies. It was a wonderful farce spoofing the secret agent genre. The movie is a mildly amusing story about an inexperienced agent. It missed the mark by a million miles. If you want to laugh out loud watch the old series and forget the movie.".

	schema:headline " An Insult to a Great Classic";
	schema:reviewBody "Mystery films come and go a precious few stand the test of time. Charade' for my money the greatest whodunit ever made is a masterpiece of tone miraculously blending the disparate elements of suspense humor and romance more successfully than any film I've ever seen. Enhanced by the dashing beauty and charisma of its two stars Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant the sophisticated wit of its ingenious script the shimmering beauty of its onlocation photography and of course the classic strains of its Henry Mancini score Charade is a movie that one can enjoy no matter how many times one has seen it.I wonder how many people will be saying the same thing about The Truth About Charlie'  Jonathan Demme's utterly pointless remake of this great film  four decades from now the original title Charade' is actually more appropriate because the story deals with lies deception and falsehoods in general and not just in relation to that particular character.  I have absolutely no idea how anyone unfamiliar with the original work will respond to this film.  I can just say that for diehard devotees of the 1963 Stanley Donen classic The Truth About Charlie' is a travesty on every level imaginable.  And alas that great Henry Mancini score is nowhere to be found on this version's soundtrack the first of many strikes against this modern rehash.Although this new version shares the basic plot premise of the original it has completely eliminated most of the elements that made Charade' such a worldclass timeless charmer.  First of all in what universe could Mark Wahlberg and Thandia Newton possibly be considered replacements for Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn two of the greatest screen legends of all time? Yes Ms. Newton has a certain attractiveness and appeal at times but her onenote expression of pouting bemusement does grow tiresome after awhile. The real trouble however comes with Wahlberg a fine actor who has turned in some impressive film performances in the past but who is just plain disastrous in this part.  His character is supposed to be a suave debonair gentleman who attempts to win Reggie's confidence after her husband has been murdered for stealing 6 million and she becomes the hapless target of a band of hooligans who want their share and who believe she knows where it is.  Wahlberg has never looked more uncomfortable or out of place than he does here trying to appear sincere' and concerned ' but coming across as merely epicene and amateurish.  This is in fact the worst case of miscasting I have seen in a film in a long long time.   How can one have a remake of Charade'  of all films!  with two stars who lack charisma and generate zero romantic chemistry when they're together on screen?  Even more detrimental perhaps is the fact that virtually all the wonderful humor from the original script has been excised a strange turn of events indeed considering the fact that the original writer Peter Stone also had a hand in this venture here he has assumed the pseudonym of Peter Joshua' one of the names ascribed to the Grant character in the earlier film although the name for no apparent reason has been inverted for Wahlberg. The very few comic lines that have been retained are delivered so poorly by the actors that we wince every time we hear them. So now we have a remake of Charade' utterly devoid of humor and romance. What else could go wrong?  Well in the original the secondary characters all stood out as finely drawn figures in their own right.  The three men chasing Reggie for the money  James Coburn Ned Glass and Arthur Kennedy  had each a retinue of fascinating personality quirks that helped distinguish one character from the other.  In Charlie' the three villains' not only comprise a blandly homogenous group but they do not even remain consistent as characters.  The most egregious example is Lola Lisa Gay Hamilton who spends the entire film bullying and threatening Regina then inexplicably and in a matter of minutes becomes some sort of heroine whom Regina comes to love and admire.   It makes no sense at all.  The concluding scene in which the characters all meet up together to reveal their true identities and unravel the mystery is so hamhanded in its execution that one wonders if the filmmakers ever even saw the flawlessly executed Donen original.  It is the low point in a film made up of little else but low points.  Demme has also injected an idiotic plot strand involving Reggie's husband's insane mother but the less said about that the better.  In fact one suspects that the sole reason for this storyline is to allow the director to feature famed French director Agnes Varda in a cameo role.  Indeed Charlie' is filled with all sorts of pointless homages to French culture in general and the French New Wave in particular including a clip from Truffaut's Shoot the Piano Player' and a truly bizarre cabaret scene with famed Jean Luc Godard actress Anna Karina belting out a song while the characters perform a surreal tango that throws us out of the film's world completely.   In fact Demme has tried to recreate much of the style of 60's cinema by employing a camera that rarely ever sits still and a razzledazzle editing technique that attempts to substitute style for substance.   The effort is too selfconsciously cutesy to be even slightly effective.This does however bring us to the one undeniable element of value in The Truth About Charlie'  Tak Fujimoto's eyepopping cinematography which does a superlative job bringing out the colorful richness of the Paris setting.A word of praise to anything or anyone else involved in this production would however be excessive.   Demme has taken a film that just about defines the word style' and turned it into a hollow soulless exercise utterly devoid of wit suspense romance and star charisma  all the elements in fact that made Charade' such a golden timeless treasure. Avoid the theaters and head to the nearest video store to pick up a copy of Charade'  and see what a great film is really all about.".

And it certainly wasn't Mancini's wonderful score.But the biggest Truth about Charlie is that Demme's rewrite is simply awful.In the original Charlie is a nobody and so he doesn't get in the way of all the other characters. Here he has a face and is apparently the big villain so we have to be treated to a slew of foggy flashbacks that halt the flow of the story.Newton and Wahlberg liplock so early there's absolutely none of the playful sexual tension of the original. And instead of Grant's cocky endofthefilm surprise we get a bathetic Wahlberg begging Newton to forgive him. Bleacch.The reworking of the story that sets everything in motion is so muddled I'm still not sure just exactly what was happening and why.And the final big thing missing is the element of wonderful surprise Donen crafted so well. In the original Grant's multiple characters are peeled back with delicious surprise at each new revelation ending with the final perfect surprise at the end of the film. And the moment when the original film reveals the big secret is still thrilling even after watching it a dozen times. In Charlie the big secret becomes a tiny flicker of something in Newton's eyes and when it is finally revealed it's a moment that the word anticlimax was designed for.It's such a shame that Demme made such a muddle of something that originally was so clean and clearly presented. As so many others have done I strongly recommend you skip this one and just go back to the original.".

Well they bothered for the same reason virtually all Hollywood films are made to make MONEY lots of MONEY! No one in their right mind would attempt to duplicate two so magic stars as Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn from the original Charade but some studio type thought they could cost in on the deserved reputation of the original for excellence and make a bundle before the critics and the public got to see what a stinker this wouldbe remake is. Mark Wahlberg may have a certain presence but a Cary Grant his is NOT and never will be and that woman taking Hepburn's part was simply pathetic what with her little moues of pseudoBritish mouthings. Audrey who was the quintessence of delicate dignity and charm would spin in her grave if she could. And with the change of dating to reflect not the Second World War but postVietnam the entire tenor of the original was changed from a charming 'escapadeaveclarceny' to a mad chase with the modern dictum of 'diversity' with a cast more suited to a tract on multiculturalism than anything having to do with telling a coherent story! The 'stamps' were well explained in the original but here they are a throwaway plot device that more confuses than illuminates. And 'la belle Paris' mon Dieu how it is ignored and abused in this tawdry effort what was charming even in the face of murder and crime in the original is merely seedy here. There is no magic between the stars as in Charade just some groping. And where was the duplicate of the crafty Walter Matthau character? Tim Robbins is a good actor but here he is no replacement for the Mr. Dyle. And that dismal woman who is the police inspector is merely awful in this tiresome flick. If you have never seen Charade you must not let this failure make you think the original is as bad for you would be denying yourself one of the finest delights of the modern screen and the sight of two of its greatest luminaries Grant and Hepburn in very good form!".

It doesn't know what it wants to be. Is it a comedy? Is it a romance? Is it a thriller? For a time it tries to be all of the above  and fails at each one.Demme speaking to an audience in Philadelphia following an advance screening said the movie could have gone in vastly different directions in the editing room. For example another version could have been much funnier. I don't doubt it. There are some good elements in place.Mark Wahlberg stepping into the Cary Grant role is surprisingly debonair. This role officially puts him lightyears away from his early '90s whiterapper persona. Don't get me wrong he's still no Cary Grant  but watching him in this film you can easily see him as an American James Bond.Following in Audrey Hepburn's heels is the todiefor Thandie Newton. Combining beauty sophistication elegance and vulnerability Newton more than succeeds in bringing a Hepburnlike quality to her character. She also gets boatloads more screen time than Wahlberg which isn't a bad thing considering she's the best thing in the movie.If only the story didn't fall apart in the second act as all tension and suspense evaporates. Things come back together in the third act but it's too late.The movie also exceeds its quota of cliches. For instance how many times have you seen foreigners in movies begin conversations in another language  only to switch into perfect English after a couple of sentences? Well in this movie get ready to see it again... and again.Then there's the car accident scene  we hear squealing brakes and crunching metal offscreen then Demme actually gives us a shot of a hub cap rolling across the street!  The movie gives us no indication these bits are meant to be tongueincheek.There is one terrific foot chase that Demme admits is inspired by Run Lola Run. The scene has energy suspense humor and fun  all things the rest of the movie tries but fails to achieve.".

Apparently very few screenwriters can come up with original ideas so we wind up with a new version of an old favorite month after month.  I hope that Mr. Demme is out of rehab by now because he must've been on some kind of delusional trip when he got the idea to remake a classic. I've read all the reviews posted here at IMDB and for the life of me I cannot see the rants and raves for Thandie Newton. Poor child why didn't her mother tell her NOT to attempt to recreate an Audrey Hepburn role? She has about as much cinematic charisma as a pile of sawdust. Early in the movie when she's standing between the French Commandant and the Lieutenant Ms. Newton completely disappears. I was watching the Lt. more than the star of the picture. Seeing the extras on the DVD Mr. Demme proclaimed he was looking for the right vehicle for Ms. Newton's talent or did he have more prurient interests in her off camera?. The worst scene was the gunpoint standoff which I found myself looking at my watch wondering how long could this go on? I've always been a huge fan of Tim Robbins but what in heaven's name was the accent he was trying to use? I can't blame Mark Wahlberg he chomped at the bit to play a romantic lead. Damn! Had he never seen the original film and realized whom he would be compared to? This was truly sad. There's no reason to continue tearing this piece of schlock frame by frame but the closing credits??? Mr. Demme chose to dedicate this to his late brother...who's surely rolling over in his grave from this. Ms. Portman's music even had to use the Mancini theme to compensate for her lack of originality.  Then I wouldn't have believed this if I hadn't seen it...someone at Universal Pictures had the gall to put the original Charade on the flip side of the Charlie DVD. Stupidity? Insanity? Audacity? There is NO word for it! God! What a mess!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "Cinema is art therefore is not to be copied. Nobody copies a Picasso  or a successful romance for example. No matter how similar it could  be it would be a copy of an artistic piece without any value.  Therefore remakes of great movies are totally unnecessary. The  original 'Charade' was not a masterpiece but a great movie with a  charming central pair Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant and funny  situations and dialogues. But this 'The Truth About Charlie' is really  ridiculous. Beginning with the choice of the lead actress and actor.  Thandie Newton and Mark Wahlberg performing the roles of  Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant respectively is outrageous. The  modifications in the original plot made the delight of 'Charade' be  lost. Do not waste your time with this film rent or buy the original  one. By the way I have a friend who knows by heart many dialogues of  the original 'Charade'. Jonathan Demme has not probably paid attention  on the wonderful original text otherwise he would try at least to  reproduce some of them. My vote is four.".

No matter how similar it could  be it would be a copy of an artistic piece without any value.  Therefore remakes of great movies are totally unnecessary. The  original 'Charade' was not a masterpiece but a great movie with a  charming central pair Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant and funny  situations and dialogues. But this 'The Truth About Charlie' is really  ridiculous. Beginning with the choice of the lead actress and actor.  Thandie Newton and Mark Wahlberg performing the roles of  Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant respectively is outrageous. The  modifications in the original plot made the delight of 'Charade' be  lost. Do not waste your time with this film rent or buy the original  one. By the way I have a friend who knows by heart many dialogues of  the original 'Charade'. Jonathan Demme has not probably paid attention  on the wonderful original text otherwise he would try at least to  reproduce some of them. My vote is four.";

What is amazing to me is that Roger Ebert's review states that while the original Charade has been voted the 168th best film ever he thinks this catastrophic abomination is justified because Thandie Newton photographs well. The attempts to bring bits of French films into the remake are an insult as all the original film fit the pattern of a standard American thriller the only connection to France being the location. Nearly all of the humor of Cary Grant like his line about leaving a bad guy hanging around American Express almost a precursor to some of Clint Eastwood's Dirty Harry or Swartaneggar's wise cracks were completely omitted. This film should not only have gotten a thumbs down but should have been Hanniblized.".

	schema:headline " A terrible remake of a great classic";
	schema:reviewBody "'The Truth About Charlie' is not worthy to be a remake of the great 'Charade'. To be honest I don't even get why they had to remake that film since it still works today both as a Hitchcockian thriller and as comedy. But they did remake it and where the original film stars Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn two of the greatest stars in the movies this film gives us Mark Wahlberg and Thandie Newton. Personally I like Wahlberg especially in 'Boogie Nights' 'Three Kings' and later film 'The Departed' but apparently this role was for Grant only Wahlberg does not pull it off. For me personally Newton ruined the film. I never understood whether this film contained the comedic elements as they were in 'Charade' or not but whatever it was it felt weird and out of place. Mainly Newton's performance was the cause of this.The second distraction comes from Paris as the setting. Director Jonathan Demme who has lost most of his 'The Silence of the Lambs'touch is too much in love with it. By now the world has seen the Eiffel Tower and for that matter has heard Charles Aznavour who appears from time to time and the film does not realize this. If the story is only a backdrop for a place and an atmosphere at least show us elements of both things we are not acquainted with. The story by the way deals with Newton as Regina Lambert who finds out Charlie her husband for three months now dead used to lead more than one life. Apparently he had six million dollars in diamonds and now the French police a couple of former soldiers who fought with Charlie and a character played by Tim Robbins are after it. Mark Wahlberg's character named Joshua Peters pops up everywhere Newton seems to need him meaning his role will stay vague as long as the film wants it to be.When the closing scenes finally arrived I did not care anymore. Who was who and why and for what reason it didn't matter to me I was just glad the film was over. The final scenes were supposed to have some suspense in it but even that was spoiled by annoying closeups and many cuts. I have seen quite some bad films over the years but this time I was really amazed with such good material wasted in such a complete way.".

	schema:reviewBody "Charade is an inconsequential but lovable classic. The Truth About Charlie is just weird.I don't fault Demme for trying to rework Charade into something more contemporary. It could have been a fun interesting exercise. But the product is neither fun nor interesting except in spurts.Charade was a romanticcomedythriller with an emphasis on the romantic comedy. It wasn't serious in any way  for example while the bad guys were not nice they provided more comic relief than menace. It was light mildly suspenseful and anything but realistic. What's wrong with that? As Regina would say Absolutely nothing.The Truth About Charlie can't decide what it's supposed to be. How can a movie make so many homages to its predecessor and films from completely disparate '60s genres like French New Wave and still try to be a Mission Impossiblelike actionadventure for the 21st Century? And why after following the plot of Charade almost scenebyscene for half the movie does it diverge from original in ways that make it less cohesive AND less suspenseful?And the showdown at the end? Mild spoiler here if you care...On the DVD commentary Demme said he wanted to avoid having the characters use guns to solve problems  that's why the hero gets to play hostage negotiator and talk down the situation  but why then did Demme film it like a John Woo 21gun standoff scene? The reveal was horrible. The supposed motivation for Dyal was ridiculous. The whole last third stunk.Not that the rest was that great. Thandie Newton has star quality and was a good pick to update an Audrey Hepburn role which makes casting an antiCary like Mark Wahlberg even more absurd. Wahlberg can be appealing in earnest and earthy roles but why on earth would Regina Lampert find him attractive? Tim Robbins in the Walter Matthau role complete with a trace Matthau accent is rather funny until the showdown scene which ruins him. The three pursuers are more diverse in a PC way than the originals but their personalities are much less distinct. And why bother with giving the French police roles more play when they don't end up being more than mildly useful to the plot? Argh!Now for the good part Interesting camera work and newParis soundtrack. I imagine many other fans of Charade would hate those changes from the original but they worked for me and would have been great assets if the story had been better told and cast.".

	schema:reviewBody "possible spoilersfirst time I'm writing a review on here and only because the movie was that bad. I have yet to see the original Charade but will soon and I highly doubt it is a waste of film like the remake.Why was this movie so bad? For one the acting. Tim Robbins surprising was horrible. He read his lines like he was being forced to make the movie at gunpoint. There was very little character development Thandie Newton and Mark Wahlberg somehow fell in love with each other in 5 minutes. Despite the fact that Mark Wahlberg constantly lies to her and she has reason to believe he has bad intentions she still flirts with him the entire movie.Another major flaw with the movie was that it was full of actions that made no sense. Imagine an action movie where the unarmed hero passes up every oppurtunity to pick up a gun 500 times. The protagonist meets people out to get her deceased husband's money any way possible and is friendly to them halfway through the movie for no reason. Though she supposedly trusts no one her actions show her taking everything at face value. She is approached by a man claiming to be from a US agency only she never checks to see if this is true even with the french police.It's also worth mentioning that Robbins was not the only one who gave a poor performance. Wahlberg was extremely bland and the 3 other people after Regina's money gave lackluster performances adding very little to the movie.That all said what really bugged me about this movie was how pretentious it was. It pretended to be an artsy French movie only it wasn't. Especially in poor taste were the scenes where performer singing the song in the background would then appear in the movie. Even worse were the actors acknowledging his presence.In summary if the plot on the box intrigues you save yourself the frustration and watch the original it's on the other side of the DVD.".

	onyx:emotionText "possible spoilersfirst time I'm writing a review on here and only because the movie was that bad. I have yet to see the original Charade but will soon and I highly doubt it is a waste of film like the remake.Why was this movie so bad? For one the acting. Tim Robbins surprising was horrible. He read his lines like he was being forced to make the movie at gunpoint. There was very little character development Thandie Newton and Mark Wahlberg somehow fell in love with each other in 5 minutes. Despite the fact that Mark Wahlberg constantly lies to her and she has reason to believe he has bad intentions she still flirts with him the entire movie.Another major flaw with the movie was that it was full of actions that made no sense. Imagine an action movie where the unarmed hero passes up every oppurtunity to pick up a gun 500 times. The protagonist meets people out to get her deceased husband's money any way possible and is friendly to them halfway through the movie for no reason. Though she supposedly trusts no one her actions show her taking everything at face value. She is approached by a man claiming to be from a US agency only she never checks to see if this is true even with the french police.It's also worth mentioning that Robbins was not the only one who gave a poor performance.

Mark Wahlberg was his atypical self detached outside yet deeply involved and it fit his character well.The locations and extra casting are excellent instead of portraying France as the place of ultimate beauty as is often seen or a city plagued with an overabundance of harlots it is seen here as a place that is crowded and populated with very bizarre characters.The movie suffers from a sort of mordant wit the end sequence being in and of itself worth watching the entire movie for.

So one has every right to compare The Truth About Charlie to Charade. And when it comes down to it The Truth About Charlie just falls flat.I did have the pleasure and handicap of watching Charade before the remake. Both were watched in my Literature in the Media class and we were required to write a comparison with no bias from the teacher at all. And guess what? The entire class wrote how better composed the original was and how the new movie was corny in and of its own. And even all of the students who missed the viewing of Charade still thought it stunk.Watching the remake was hilarious throughout the beginning because of how it was just so corny. And then after all of the bad acting hilarity we were met with a very convoluted climax. But it was short lived and after Dyle's death wail and fancy gun skills were released the movie got right back to being funny with the random singing and teleporting guy singing at the end. Would be a great comedy if that was what they were aiming for. Which by the way they were not.Some things that bothered me the most wereThe character of Reggie In the remake they completely changed the persona of Reggie. In Charade Reggie was clueless but intelligent naughty but not horny. Only similarity the new Reggie had was that she was also clueless. Though Thandie Newton is OK looking and an OK actor I wouldn't be able to tell through this movie.The unruliness of Marky Mark In the old movie Peter Joshua or was it Joshua Peters? was cool. He was mysterious and you couldn't tell whether he was good or bad up until the end of the movie. In The Truth right from the get go you know that Cary Grant is good you just don't know what he's up to. It made the movie predictable and kind of flat.Political Correctness Wow what the heck? Crazy how that in France an group of exsoldiers that are Asian AfricanAmerican and crazy Caucasian work with an AfricanBritish lady who is helping out a creepy Caucasian secret agent and her wanna be cool Caucasian friendlover find out about Charlie a Swiss and his money. And don't forget about the help of the French police. Wow am I watching Barney? Realism say by by.Boob lady in the beginning I am a dude and I enjoy the occasional flash it's true. But it seems that the writers knew that this movie was going to be less than great so they just threw in a nice uh pair in the beginning of the movie just to keep those type of viewers hoping for more and this random nudity made me more critical of the movie. I can truthfully tell you a few people in my class were complaining about the lack of nudity they expected because of the beginning flashage. And I hope to God that the lady in the beginning is not the same lady who helps the Asian guy at the end because if it was I don't know what I'll do.Music Arabian Gangster Rap? Is that even a Genre?The addition of the crazy lady mother It seemed like the writers for the remake needed some deus ex machina character to solve random loop holes so they threw her in and by her I mean Charlie's mother who is crazy enough to be just some random lady who thinks she's his mother. Can anyone say random? She is not introduced or explained very well and pops up randomly. The kicker is she kills a lady and yet is allowed to serve and somehow poison food at the unisex prison she was apparently sent toworks at. And talking about her and the poison what the heck was that ending? What kind of poison makes you violently wail before dying? And why the heck after the whole happy song ending did they add the lady poisoning Dyle who mind you wasn't really that bad of a guy? If you liked this movie it's probably because you didn't watch it past the credits because that part killed the entire movie. I mean they freeze frame on her freakin' smiling face. C'mon!Favorite part of movie Reggie throws 6 million dollar stamps into firePJ or JP Speaking like a little girl Reggie! I can't believe you did that!Dyle I can! laughsme in disgust OhmyLord...PS If you liked the movie you liked it because it was funny right?".

Jewish doctor Henryk Goldszmit known also as Janusz Korczak is a man of high principles. He is unafraid of shouting at German officers and frequently has to be persuaded to save his own life. His orphanage set up in a cramped school in the Warsaw ghetto provides shelter to 200 homeless kids. Putting his experimental educational methods into practice he installs a kind of children's selfgovernment whose justice is in a big contrast to what is happening in the outside world. Right in front of the school dozens of kids are dying or being killed everyday and their naked bodies lie on the street unattended. Ghetto's mayor assures Korczak that the orphanages will be saved. Korczak raises food and money for the orphanage from the rich Jews. In the final roundup he refuses to accept a Swiss passport and boards the train to Treblinka ...";

	schema:reviewBody "In Warsaw Doctor Henryk Goldszmit a.k.a. Janusz Korczak Wojciech Pszoniak runs an orphanage with a great dedication and love for the orphans. After the invasion of Poland by the German army his orphanage moves to the Warsaw ghetto with two hundred children. Dr. Korczak asks for food and money from the wealthy Jews and tells that his dignity is the two hundred children he needs to feed. When the ghetto is displaced to Treblinka by train Dr. Korczak refuses a Swiss passport and embarks in the train with his beloved children. Korczak is a touching and heartbreaking film about a man that dedicated his life to raise a group of Jewish orphans in the invaded Poland. The biography of this man is impressive and his selfsacrifice to stay with the children in their final journey is amazing. Andrzej Wajda uses black and white to disclose this dark moment of mankind history and his style seems to have inspired Steven Spielberg in his Schindler's List' three years later. The sad fate of Dr. Korczak and his 200 children is symbolic and very beautiful. This film was released on VHS in Brazil by FJ Lucas Distributor.

	onyx:emotionText "In Warsaw Doctor Henryk Goldszmit a.k.a. Janusz Korczak Wojciech Pszoniak runs an orphanage with a great dedication and love for the orphans. After the invasion of Poland by the German army his orphanage moves to the Warsaw ghetto with two hundred children. Dr. Korczak asks for food and money from the wealthy Jews and tells that his dignity is the two hundred children he needs to feed. When the ghetto is displaced to Treblinka by train Dr. Korczak refuses a Swiss passport and embarks in the train with his beloved children. Korczak is a touching and heartbreaking film about a man that dedicated his life to raise a group of Jewish orphans in the invaded Poland. The biography of this man is impressive and his selfsacrifice to stay with the children in their final journey is amazing. Andrzej Wajda uses black and white to disclose this dark moment of mankind history and his style seems to have inspired Steven Spielberg in his Schindler's List' three years later. The sad fate of Dr. Korczak and his 200 children is symbolic and very beautiful. This film was released on VHS in Brazil by FJ Lucas Distributor.

	schema:reviewBody "This was Wajda's first movie after the election defeat of the Communists in Poland and deals with many aspects of human relationships in repressive times kissing up to authority to make things better for others resistance versus principled nonviolence blackmarketeering trying to pass a member of an elite group benefiting from others' bad luck sacrificing friends for selfinterest. The film is almost too burdened by looking at so much.In spite of this it really remains focused on how Korczak can provide precious childhood to his orphans in the Jewish Ghetto. He is fiercely protective and uncompromisingly humane in giving his children space to grow and find comfort. Unlike Life is Beautiful he acknowledges his children will have to face death at least of those close to them and prepares them with the emotional tools to deal with it. He demands a children's hospice ward so that no Ghetto child would die without dignity alone on the street. Any handholding in bright light can only be metaphor for the spiritual leadership. Indeed the bedtime tucking rituals and the occasional giving up his bed to his most troubled charges is the strongest symbol of the childhood comforts he tries to give them.Wojciech Pszoniak Korczak reminds me of Robin Williams as Oliver Sacks in Awakenings. He is so serious about those in his care while at the same time able to provide them with good humor as needed. He is also a bit of a social misfit.Like Szpilman Korczak is so well loved and respected by all Poles and even some Germans he seems to have been chosen by them to survive. Korczak's fate mirrors the Pianist in the sense that Szpilman is aloof and his existence becomes more and more isolated as people help him survive. But because Korczak is so engaged and so devoted to his children his fate becomes more and more wedded to theirs.Polanski is definitely more cinematic but I think Wajda is more humanistic especially from a script by Holland. In any event the Poles cinematic treatment Holocaust is for me the most relevant honest and moving.".

	schema:headline " Another Great Wajda Film";
	schema:reviewBody "Once again Wajda returns to the war. Here the Naziera ghetto is shown as a place of greater variety of experience than typically depicted. As Nazis film the street scenes we've grown accustomed to seeing the hero of this film is able to run an orphanage with some semblance of normality others are poor but not starving and some Jews even live high on the hog trading with the guards. In fact the studiorecreated scenes of ghetto death and poverty in the streets seemed cleaner more airbrushed than the ordinary town streets in Wajda's 35year earlier A GENERATION which was on the same bill when I saw this. But this is not a major criticism. Scriptwriter Agnieszka Holland's purpose isn't merely to retell Nazi horrors her subject is how a moral force meets and responds to the holocaust. In his ghetto orphanage the director walls his children in to shield them. While he does business with the devil outside to keep them fed inside the children care for each other keep discipline with their own court of justice tempered with mercy and put on classic plays one dealing with death so the children will understand and not fear it. Wealthy wellmeaning gentiles outside the ghetto try to save the doctor but he won't consider it. Finally inevitably the children are put in a railway car to the ovens. The whole point and power of the film is that this man's will has kept his children's humanity intact. When the end comes we feel their death in a personal way that few films on the subject have. Pszoniak plays Korczak who is based on a real person with great strength. Korczak's insistence on not accepting the Nazi status quo sometimes works often doesn't even achieve short term ends but is the only moral stand to be taken. The end a fantasy shot of the children and the doctor running from the cattle car into a field of light is somewhat controversial. It would in another film seem a poetic copout. Here it works because even as the image plays out on the screen your mind sees their real end that the rest of the film has prepared you for.One can't help but feel that Spielberg was influenced by this film when he made SCHINDLER'S LIST a film that's perhaps visually more flashy than KORCZAK but which doesn't have KORCZAK's clear moral purpose at its core. Wajda is given special thanks in the screen credits of the Spielberg film.".

	schema:reviewBody "A great tragically truthful and sincere film. It is the work of art that leaves you with a heavy heart and with very sad low mood. Mr. Wajda did a marvelous job depicting the tragedy of Dr. Janusz Korczak a famous Polish Jew who was a writer a doctor and who loved children with all his big heart. This black and white movie is very slow tragic and merciless. The war is shown as it was  bloody ruthless coldblooded and unbearable. The scene when the Nazi film crew makes a film in the ghetto is simply unutterably dark especially when real documentaries creep in and you can see dying and dead people skinny kids sad faces and horrible ruins of Warsaw houses. The central story is excellent as Dr. Korczak does his best in the horror of the ghetto trying to allow his 200 kids to live well as if there is no war outside. The final scene when the train carries them all to the death camp Treblinka makes your heart stop and when Wajda adds a symbolic final when all the children and their Doctor leave the train and go to the foggy morning happy and kidding made me cry. I was not able to stop my tears my heart still aches now when I recollect the scene of the happy children walking with the Jewish flag held high and when you know that in fact they all suffocated in a gas chamber while Korczak was telling them fairy tales just to make their deaths a bit sweeter if that was ever possible...

	schema:reviewBody "Before Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List 1993 was Andrzej Wajda's Korczak 1990. Shot in melancholic blacks and whites the film stars Wojciech Pszoniak as Doctor Korczak a PolishJewish paediatrician who oversees an orphanage in wartorn Warsaw. As WW2 rages and the Holocaust blossoms Korczak does his best to shelter his band of two hundred or so Jewish children.Spielberg would consult and hire some of Wajda's crew whilst making List and would later include a thank you message to Wajda at the end of his film's final credit sequence. Unfortunately like most holocaust cinema Korczak is a trite sentimental film which reveals little about the historical and psychosocial forces at work behind the events depicted. We watch as Nazis brutalise Jews as the saintly Korczak steps in and of course the inevitable final act march toward gas chambers. It's Schindler's List without the murderporn.Still the overall thrust of Wajda's film is touching. Wajda's Korczak isn't a conventional saviour but a man who resolves to join Jews on their journey toward certain death. He refuses to abandon them refuses to make a dire situation worse a seemingly useless act which nevertheless epitomises the height of courage humanity and decency.Korczak has been compared to Louis Malle's Holocaust themed Goodbye children but Wajda's climax is much more grim. Here we watch as Korczak's orphans are shipped to Treblinka one of three Operation Reinhard camps named after Reinhard Heydrich chairman of the 1942 Wannsee Conference. Wajda's final title card then informs us that Korczak and his kids were gassed at Treblinka but it's equally likely that the kids and adults were processed and separated here and then shipped further eastward for either gassing internment or slave labour.You do not know how evil this film is Claude Lanzmann would say to the wife of the French Prime Minister when Wajda's film was screened for a special audience in 1990. Some argued that the film absolved Poles of their role in the Holocaust of their complicity a fact which Wajda actually does touch upon we see Korczak being betrayed by a number of prominent Polish figureheads throughout the film.Another complaint is that Wajda's final fantasy sequence in which Korczak and his kids appear to be set free is insulting. A simplistic coda maybe but insulting? Throughout the film Wajda contrasts the idyllic innocence of the kids  an innocence which Korczak desires to preserve  with encroaching barbarism. The film's fantastical final sequence is in keeping with this theme.A pessimistic ending would have said to me that all these endeavours of Dr. Korczak were in vain Wajda would say of his climax that pedagogy in the face of force has no sense that no efforts of man can reverse the fact that he is dying so accidentally. This would be an awful existentialist point of view. There would have been nothing easier than showing the death of the children in a gas chamber. It would have been a very moving scene. Everyone would have been crying. But do we have the right does art have the right to show this? Is art for this? Art has to stop short of certain facts has to look for other possibilities. In short Wajda does not believe that the futility of Korczak's actions negate the righteousness of his deeds. It's the old saying better to die for a good idea than live for nothing and no good deed can ever be tainted by its ultimate ineffectuality. It's a sentiment common in Holocaust films.710  For more interesting Holocaust films see Costa Gavras' Amen Wertmuller's Seven Beauties Vittorio de Sica's The Garden of the FinziContinis Pontecorvo's Burn Marcel Ophuls' Hotel Terminus 1972's Winter Soldier Visconti's The Damned and Menno Mejes' Max.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Doctor strikes one as a solid man  man of courage unbreakable. Yet to the entreaty of the resistance movement he says I have no dignity. I have 200 children. What are we to think of his ultimate actions in walking his children into the death trains? Wajda seems to give these final actions an air of honor and a dreamlike finale scene but we must reflect what these children would suffer upon their peaceful entrance to those cars.What is needful above all else is to remain living. But living as human beings not slaves victims of sexual and sadistic perverts cattle. Where do we see the dignity of the human spirit in this film? We see it in the doctor and in the resistance fighters perhaps in some of the kids. All others are broken spirits hollow remnants of humans. Anything is worthwhile if it will maintain man's humanity in such times. They should have sang danced created or fought killed destroyed. In the resistance fighters that rush upon the scene so briefly we see the sparkling eyes of men not bound by fear free men. Korczak also remains free spiritually refusing the armband but we see that in his personal resistance he can only expect to be broken or killed by one of the many Germans that he'll encounter. He can expect to see his children hideously killed and himself comforting them to no avail. Anything is good if it maintains the spirit. Perhaps training the children to fight would have been appropriate. Certainly no nonviolent means of resistance are affective against the Nazi's. As Gandhi says nonviolent resistance does not work on machines and beasts. The Nazi's were machines.It is tempting to condemn Korczak for his ultimate actions  thought it shows a pathetic tendency in him which runs throughout the film. He wants to give people a dignified death to save children without sending the nonJewishlooking one's to hide with Poles.

	onyx:emotionText "The Doctor strikes one as a solid man  man of courage unbreakable. Yet to the entreaty of the resistance movement he says I have no dignity. I have 200 children. What are we to think of his ultimate actions in walking his children into the death trains? Wajda seems to give these final actions an air of honor and a dreamlike finale scene but we must reflect what these children would suffer upon their peaceful entrance to those cars.What is needful above all else is to remain living. But living as human beings not slaves victims of sexual and sadistic perverts cattle. Where do we see the dignity of the human spirit in this film? We see it in the doctor and in the resistance fighters perhaps in some of the kids. All others are broken spirits hollow remnants of humans. Anything is worthwhile if it will maintain man's humanity in such times. They should have sang danced created or fought killed destroyed. In the resistance fighters that rush upon the scene so briefly we see the sparkling eyes of men not bound by fear free men. Korczak also remains free spiritually refusing the armband but we see that in his personal resistance he can only expect to be broken or killed by one of the many Germans that he'll encounter. He can expect to see his children hideously killed and himself comforting them to no avail. Anything is good if it maintains the spirit. Perhaps training the children to fight would have been appropriate. Certainly no nonviolent means of resistance are affective against the Nazi's. As Gandhi says nonviolent resistance does not work on machines and beasts. The Nazi's were machines.It is tempting to condemn Korczak for his ultimate actions  thought it shows a pathetic tendency in him which runs throughout the film. He wants to give people a dignified death to save children without sending the nonJewishlooking one's to hide with Poles. Has he not shut himself to the truth  that truth which the escaped man yelled out on the streets before his death? They are sending you to your death! Korczak the lover of children leads them proudly to their cart.

Are they just going to keep making films and TV shows and documentaries about the Holocaust until the story of every single Jewish person who died in the Holocaust is recounted? OK!! I Get It!!! A lot of HORRIBLE things happened to the Jewish people at the hands of the Nazi's!!! Can We Just Get On To Other Things Now??? And every single one of these Jewish Holocaust stories is just another variation of the same tear jerking depressing despairing sob story. I Just Can't Take It Anymore!!! 2 This retelling of the story of Korczak in this film is just unreal. Even given that this film accurately covers all the historical facts NO ONE could be as good and saintly and kind and generous and self sacrificing and uplifting 247 like this film makes out this guy to be. I mean the Catholic Church should have beatified this guy and made him the first Jewish saint in Catholic Church history if you believe this film. This film tried to make a saint out of a regular human being and it just didn't fly for me. Had this film made Korczak look more like a real human being with some flaws and defects it would've been much more closer to the historical person of Korczak and I probably would've viewed the film to its conclusion.".

	schema:reviewBody "I had been searching for this gem for nearly 15 years until I found it. When I did it was as good as I imagined! The film follows the adolescent obsession of a 15 year old John Moulder Brown seedy Newford Bath House attendent. He falls under the romantic spell of a red haired tease brilliantly played by Jane Asher that toys with his emotions to the brink of taking him over the mental deep end. Director Jerzy Skolimowski's film is so unique that it deals with the mind set of a sexually inexperienced youth in a way that is comedic sensitive and yet totally insane. Parts of the character reminded me of a darker Max Fletcher the child character in Rushmore and a less calculating Tom Ripley see The Talented Mr. Ripley but totally immerssed in a Mod London invironment that is saturated in sex and seediness. What strikes me as interesting is that you can never tell if London was meant to be represented in such a sexual red light or if this is all just how the protaganist views London with sexually curious eyes of puberty? My one criticism towards John Moulder Brown is his English accent tends to sound more proper rather than lower class Cockney which would have suited the story's angle. Jane Asher's performance however is truly amazing! Her use of the dialog is completely naturalistic in approach. I always feel as an eavesdropper to someone's private conversation. Check out the scene in which her and John Moulder Brown are trying to retrieve a diamond from a pile of snow and sprinkled in the dialog are comments of her being hungry it would seem strange to see those lines written in the script which leaves me to think it may be improvised?. And when she tells off the Gym Teacher one of her lovers and then continues to work on finding her diamond. Totally improvised and naturalistic!!! As a person like myself who studies acting I was quite impressed by her acting and am saddened that she has not appeared in more films she seems to be mostly known for being the exgirlfriend of Paul McCartney. The music soundtrack to the film is of great interest as well. It contains the song But I Might Die Tonight by Cat Stevens as the title track and different variations of that theme supplied by either Cat Stevens or Kraut rock group Can. It also contains one of Can's most amazing tracks Mother's Sky in a great scene where the boy stalks his obsession to a London Club then to a seedy Nude Girl joint which contains a cardboard cut out of her then to an outofcommision prostitute and then finally to the London Underground where he confronts Jane Asher. All done with the surreal mind of what only a 15 year old could conjure up. The film contains many surreal moments in which the boy sinks to the bottom of a pool and eyes a naked woman swimming underneath him. Or when the boy jumps off a diving board and lands on top of the cardboard cut out in a pool. He again sinks to the bottom holding the cut out as if it was her. This film captures the complete frustration of that age and the yearning to be a part of the sexually grown up world that is just out of reach but keeps getting dipped towards your hands by a taller more mature ? tease. Unfortunately teasing an imature boy can also have very horrible consequences. Highly recommended!!! One of my all time favourite films!!! I give it a 10!!".

	schema:reviewBody "I first saw Deep End shortly after its release it played at the base theater during my Air Force days. Films on base ran for only one day three shows and this was one of a handful that drew capacity crowds to the later shows due to word of mouth praise by those who attended the first screening. I finally got the opportunity to view it again last week and was not disappointed. About all I recalled from my long ago first viewing was the Jane Asher fullsize cardboard standup and the color red. Meaning that director Jerzy Skolimowski managed to create some powerful imagery that stayed in my mind over all those years which is more than I can say for a lot of films. My association of the color red now makes perfect sense as that was obviously the imagery that Skolimowski meant to drill into each viewer's mind. From Asher's red hair in the film itself and in the promotional poster where it trails off into blood to the new color being painted on the walls of the bathhouse to the blood that punctuates certain climatic moments in the story.Skolimowski was Polanski's screenwriter for Knife In the Water and stylistically Deep End has a Polanski flavor it certainly has its Repulsion moments. I was also reminded of a Judy Geeson film from about the same time Goodbye Gemini 1970 a London setting and a doomed pair of mismatched lovers. If you are looking for a more useful comparison think of a bizarre marriage of The Summer of 42 1971 and Play Misty For Me 1971. But Deep End is too grounded to be overwrought its romantic obsession  coming of age story rings surprisingly true. Probably because the gritty is evenly blended with the abstract in a storyline that nicely cuts between accidental and destined. Just out of school 15 yearold Mike John MoulderBrown goes to work as the towel boy at a seedy London bath house. Asher plays Sue an older coworker who reveals that some of the clientle are good for extra money in exchange for titillation in the private rooms. In an extraordinary scene an aging Diana Dors explores Mike's interest in football soccer. Sue is a megatease she is stringing along a rich fiance having regular private sessions with one of Mike's former teachers servicing assorted clients at the baths and getting her perverse kicks turning on Mike. Sue is not atypical in her level of irresponsibility and Mike is not atypical in his level of naivet. Stuff like this plays out everyday. But Mike's obsession begins to get a bit twisted when he first realizes that Sue and his former teacher have a relationship. And Skolimowski goes from broken mirror to ripped poster to broken glass to blood substituting visual images for overwrought melodrama. Glass mirror fire alarm diamond light bulb substitutes for Mike's fragile psyche and distorted perception pictures the PSA poster on the bulletin board and the cutout girl Mike steals substitute for a normal boygirl relationship and paint and hair substitute for blood. Deep End is a film in motion it never slows down and its scene transitions run from excellent to lame. I don't remember the theatrical showing well enough to say whether the version I just watched was intact. But I suspect that it has been hacked up and trimmed which would explain the more inexplicable scene transitions. There is some support for this notion in that it has been converted into a 43 aspect ratio and has lost all the end credits except a few bars of the same Cat Stevens song that ran over the opening titles. If it ever gets a DVD release I hope they can find a better example to digitize. The best way to understand it is to be open to the interplay of Skolimowski's images these provide the texture of his film. The story may appear to be being told from Mike's point of view but it is the texture that allows the viewer to go beneath the surface of the deep end and to see the dance between love and death. Then again what do I know? I'm only a child.".

	schema:reviewBody "Okay here's a cinechallenge. There are some films that take you back to a particular time in your life at absolute warp speed. Frequently these films are reasonably universal but their associations might be obfuscated personal and subjective never understood even by your friends unless explained. One such film which chronicled absolute obsessive teenage love and its destructiveness was a wakeup call to a frequent formerly obsessive type myself in my misspent youth. This and the film's innate mastery instantly timetravel me back to days that were simultaneously more innocent and more complicated than today late night smoky college discussions in a candlelit apartments.And that film would be Deep End directed by Jerzy Skowlimowski pal of Roman Polanski with the same great mix of bizarre sensibilities and takes on life done in professional Hollywoodcaliber production even if on an indie budget.It's from 1970 featuring music by Cat Stevens Yusef Islam now to the noninfidel and two unbelievably strong leads a 15yearold John Moulder Brown and 25yearold Jane Asher Paul McCartney's 1960's trophy girlfriend.

Frequently these films are reasonably universal but their associations might be obfuscated personal and subjective never understood even by your friends unless explained. One such film which chronicled absolute obsessive teenage love and its destructiveness was a wakeup call to a frequent formerly obsessive type myself in my misspent youth. This and the film's innate mastery instantly timetravel me back to days that were simultaneously more innocent and more complicated than today late night smoky college discussions in a candlelit apartments.And that film would be Deep End directed by Jerzy Skowlimowski pal of Roman Polanski with the same great mix of bizarre sensibilities and takes on life done in professional Hollywoodcaliber production even if on an indie budget.It's from 1970 featuring music by Cat Stevens Yusef Islam now to the noninfidel and two unbelievably strong leads a 15yearold John Moulder Brown and 25yearold Jane Asher Paul McCartney's 1960's trophy girlfriend.

	schema:reviewBody "This is an interesting little film which to my knowledge has never been released on video or DVD in the US. It's about a 15yearold workingclass boy who goes to work in a London bathhouse catering to some truly unattractive customers. He falls in love with a slightly older female coworker with ultimately tragic results. This film is a neorealist look at workingclass Britons in a seedy setting one would hardly recognize as Swinging London made years before anyone had ever heard of Mike Leigh. It's also one of the few films about the sexual initiation of a young male that is neither a saccharine Hollywood coming of age story nor stupid sexploitation comedy. It is pretty funny in parts such as when then lead steals a lifesize cardboard cutout from a sex shop because he is convinced it is his coworker but it also shows the painful and even destructive side of male puberty. John MoulderBrown from La Residencia is very convincing as the youth who looks much older but if anything is even less emotionally mature than the usual boy his age. Jane Asher is also pretty good but her character is less believable. For one thing Asher a modelactress who was a onetime girlfriend of Paul McCartney is a little too attractive and glamorous to convincingly play this role. But the character herself is a little illdefined. She's obviously a social climber with an uppermiddle class boyfriend who takes her to swinging clubs and buys her an expensive diamond ring but she cheats on him with a lecherous middleaged and married swimming coach and a fifteen year old. This WAS Swinging London but she doesn't seem really seem like the free love type. And she's such a malicious tease she even devours ice cream in front of a fat woman. The ending would have been even more powerful if we cared about her as well the boy although there is a revelation about her and the swimming coach near the end that softens the picture of her a little.The Polish director was a friend and protg of Roman Polanski. He does a remarkable job here particularly with the visually impressive final scene with the two naked actors in an empty swimming pool slowly filling with water. I guess this was once a minor cult movieI first heard about it in Danny Peary's Cult Movies book. It's unfortunately pretty forgotten today but definitely worth finding.".

	schema:reviewBody "Deep End is a practically unheard of film these days  but it's a surprisingly good one that urgently needs a bigger audience. The film is basically a coming of age story involving young love and teenage angst. Despite the fact that everything in this film has been seen before in other films it all comes together well and doesn't feel like it's just rethreading old ground which is very much to it's credit. Writerdirector Jerzy Skolimowski does a really good job of telling his story too which means that deep End is an easy film to get along with. The title refers to the film's central location  a swimming pool. We focus on Mike a young lad fresh out of school who has just got his first job as a pool attendant at the local bath house. On his first day he meets the beautiful Susan and falls head over heels in love with her. Trouble is Susan already has a fianc and while she kind of likes Mike she doesn't take him seriously...leading Mike to become frustrated and willing to do anything in order to have Susan all for himself.The two central performers are really good and responsible for a lot of the film's success. Jane Asher is absolutely beautiful and it's easy to see why she'd have a young lad lusting after her. Horror fans will likely recognise John MoulderBrown from classic horror The House That Screamed as well as Hammer Horror Vampire Circus. He's good here too and expertly captures the immaturely and lust of youth. The film itself is always interesting and the director keeps the central relationship at the forefront of the film which helps to keep things interesting. The film is set in 1970's London and the director does a good job of capturing the gritty feel of the city. A lot of the film takes place inside a swimming baths but sequences that take place in sleazy corners of the city are among the best of the film. The director does have an eye for sleaze too  some of the bath house punters are rather shady characters and we've also got scenes set inside a prostitute's room and an adult movie theatre. The ending is iconic and memorable and manages to tie up all the film's central themes. Overall this really is a very good film that more people need to see!".

	schema:reviewBody "For many years a somewhat obscure and unseen semiavant garde melodramaDEEP END has had a recent revival in digitally restored fashion in cinemaDVD and televisionand has an undercurrent of strangeness running through it's entire oeuvre.Set in postswinging 60's Londonbut an AmericanWest German coproduction directed by Polishborn Jerzy Skolimowski mostly filmed in Germanywith an eclectic cast and musical scorea dubious story and related characters.This overall oddness does not necessarily equate to greatnessbut DEEP END still nevertheless manages to hold the attention throughout.A decidedly gaucheawkward 15 year old youthMike John MoulderBrown starts his first job at a grimydilapidated London municipal bathhouseand falls in love with a beautiful but uninhibited female coworkerSusan Jane Ashera few years older than him.Susan is apparently engaged but uses and exploits other males for her own pleasureincluding the hapless Mike himself.The attraction gradually seems to become more mutualif dangerous.Coming at the end of the optimistichappygolucky 60's and populated with rather unlikable charactersDEEP END is packed with so much symbolism as to be in peril from drowning in it.The setting of the seedycrumbling bathhouse is an obvious metaphor for being literally thrown into the deep rather than shallow end of lifewith the related problemsfrustrations and behaviour on show signifying this.For a whileDEEP END comes across as a familiar but wispily charming essay on the pains of growing upwith an amusing cameo from Diana Dors who became a better actress as she got into early middleageholding Mike to her bosom while mumbling platitudes about footballthough it's not long before it all becomes progressively darkerwith dubious behaviour from a male swimming instructor who Susan has a dalliance with towards young female studentsand an increasingly unhealthy relationship between Mikeso wet behind the ears as to be soakingand the voluptuous Susan.MoulderBrown is fine as the hopelessly naive adolescentthough as with many teens his character's behaviour and traits often becomes very irritatingwhile Ms Asher is convincing as his and other males object of desireoutrageously sexy and knowing itteasing and cajoling as many males as she can mustermostly for her own entertainment and amusement in the skimpiest clothing imaginable.With all this symbolism such as Mike stealing a cardboard life size poster of Susan from London's underground and semiFreudian obsessionDEEP END has little in the way of plotand much of the cast are not British but mainland European mainly German.This sometimes gets in the way of authenticity for the more pessimistic mood of late 60'searly 70's London not surprising as much of the film was apparently filmed in Munichand Skolimowski often seems not to have an ear for the English languagewith some scenes allowed to ramble with somewhat stilted dubbed and nondubbed dialogue.There is much use of handheld camera and other scenes which have an improvised feelwhich is not necessarily a bad thing as said moments have a more spontaneoushumorous and natural feel to them.Such locations as the bathhouse and Soho which features a funny cameo from Burt Kwouk add to a sense of decline and seediness while observing the dubious behaviour of the main and secondary characters involvedwhich inevitably leads to the climax in the swimming poolwith the symbolism at it's height as it being empty and drained of waterbut there is a twist in store.....With it's drearyseedy setting and unsympathetic charactersDEEP END could have been utterly disposableyet it's very style deem it oddly compulsive and curiously watchablewith it's best moments reserved for it's finale with haunting and extraordinary imagery that linger in the mind long afterwardsconfirming it's reputation of being a bizarrerediscovered cult classic.RATING7 out of 10.".

	onyx:emotionText "For many years a somewhat obscure and unseen semiavant garde melodramaDEEP END has had a recent revival in digitally restored fashion in cinemaDVD and televisionand has an undercurrent of strangeness running through it's entire oeuvre.Set in postswinging 60's Londonbut an AmericanWest German coproduction directed by Polishborn Jerzy Skolimowski mostly filmed in Germanywith an eclectic cast and musical scorea dubious story and related characters.This overall oddness does not necessarily equate to greatnessbut DEEP END still nevertheless manages to hold the attention throughout.A decidedly gaucheawkward 15 year old youthMike John MoulderBrown starts his first job at a grimydilapidated London municipal bathhouseand falls in love with a beautiful but uninhibited female coworkerSusan Jane Ashera few years older than him.Susan is apparently engaged but uses and exploits other males for her own pleasureincluding the hapless Mike himself.The attraction gradually seems to become more mutualif dangerous.Coming at the end of the optimistichappygolucky 60's and populated with rather unlikable charactersDEEP END is packed with so much symbolism as to be in peril from drowning in it.The setting of the seedycrumbling bathhouse is an obvious metaphor for being literally thrown into the deep rather than shallow end of lifewith the related problemsfrustrations and behaviour on show signifying this.For a whileDEEP END comes across as a familiar but wispily charming essay on the pains of growing upwith an amusing cameo from Diana Dors who became a better actress as she got into early middleageholding Mike to her bosom while mumbling platitudes about footballthough it's not long before it all becomes progressively darkerwith dubious behaviour from a male swimming instructor who Susan has a dalliance with towards young female studentsand an increasingly unhealthy relationship between Mikeso wet behind the ears as to be soakingand the voluptuous Susan.MoulderBrown is fine as the hopelessly naive adolescentthough as with many teens his character's behaviour and traits often becomes very irritatingwhile Ms Asher is convincing as his and other males object of desireoutrageously sexy and knowing itteasing and cajoling as many males as she can mustermostly for her own entertainment and amusement in the skimpiest clothing imaginable.With all this symbolism such as Mike stealing a cardboard life size poster of Susan from London's underground and semiFreudian obsessionDEEP END has little in the way of plotand much of the cast are not British but mainland European mainly German.This sometimes gets in the way of authenticity for the more pessimistic mood of late 60'searly 70's London not surprising as much of the film was apparently filmed in Munichand Skolimowski often seems not to have an ear for the English languagewith some scenes allowed to ramble with somewhat stilted dubbed and nondubbed dialogue.There is much use of handheld camera and other scenes which have an improvised feelwhich is not necessarily a bad thing as said moments have a more spontaneoushumorous and natural feel to them.Such locations as the bathhouse and Soho which features a funny cameo from Burt Kwouk add to a sense of decline and seediness while observing the dubious behaviour of the main and secondary characters involvedwhich inevitably leads to the climax in the swimming poolwith the symbolism at it's height as it being empty and drained of waterbut there is a twist in store.....With it's drearyseedy setting and unsympathetic charactersDEEP END could have been utterly disposableyet it's very style deem it oddly compulsive and curiously watchablewith it's best moments reserved for it's finale with haunting and extraordinary imagery that linger in the mind long afterwardsconfirming it's reputation of being a bizarrerediscovered cult classic.RATING7 out of 10.";

	schema:reviewBody "I may be getting out of line here but there's a point in most male adolescent development for the search for sex takes on an overly aggressive practically sadistic aspect that is for the most part entirely contrary and disturbing so that it's hardly often mentioned except as one of those confused thoughts that teen men get. This time of life is usually quickly passed barely anybody acts on those impulses because its too seedy and antisocial most boys outgrow it and the majority of them end up having other more positive formative experiences that allows them to leave that part of themselves behind. Nevertheless the obsessive quality of male sexual development is not all that often given its own movie as the results are as disturbing as this one. Jerzy Skolimowski writes and directs a movie about a 15 year old boy who having been thrust into the work place and a world of underlying sex and violence he doesn't comprehend loses all sense of social normative awareness and quite literally goes off the deep end.Mike John MoulderBrown is out of school and gets his first job. He's immediately smitten by the tenyearolder Susan Jane Asher who unfortunately for Mike is a confused agedbeyondheryears tease and manuser who has no real way of interpreting the world around her except by sleeping and flirting with other men for her gain her fianc because he's rich even if he is a tool and ridiculously clueless her exswim coach because he's older and has given her a job and now Mike because of his persistence and insistence in getting her attention and approval.With no other life to distract him no money to support him nothing but his lowclass existence and his desire for Susan Mike quickly goes from a crush to confused love to stalking to outright obsession with absolutely no awareness of the negative effect of his actions. This all keep in mind is set in 70s England where law enforcement is ridiculously incompetent sexual taboos have gone past being broken to being downright dysfunctional and social confusion and decay has set permanently into the mold of the city. Everything is seedy dirty and disturbingly sexualized. Movie theatres offer ridiculous porn clubs that couples go to are adult clubs and the lower classes essentially wander the streets looking for things to blow their load on monetarily and otherwise. British cinema is typically soaked in class consciousness and Jerzy shows his affinity for that awareness even if he's not British himself.This movie is a masterpiece. The cinematography is beautiful with some of the most profound changes in the story saturated in red a lot of shifting light values and camera movements that get the viewer stuck into the head of little Mike especially in one superb setup in the veranda of an adult club a moment as profound unbalanced and nauseating as the movie eventually becomes as a whole. The acting is beyond superb and led by a script that manages to make some of the most dreadful people into relatable tearinducing tragic characters. Mike is driven to symbolically and maybe even literally works too submerge himself into Asher's body not that a blame him and the psychosexual tumble into morbid insanity that's where I do blame him for his actions is even more compelling than even films like Vertigo. Music by Cat Stevens and The Can gives a suspenseful backdrop and the miseenscene is laced with the pessimism felt subconsciously in the 70s.Deep End is one of those movies of which I can understand completely why it's hard to come by it strikes a little too closely to the most unmentioned unacknowledged aspect of male fantasy and it doesn't relieve any of it with comedy or a happy ending preferring instead to close on a strikingly symbolic final shot with absolutely no credits to follow read no time to sit and collect one's self after viewingin keeping with the Hitchcock comparison think The Birds only more realistic and damning. That said it's honestly one of the best movies I've ever seen and should be much more wellknown and appreciated in my opinion. The screening I attended was introduced by the owner of the theatre who claimed that we were watching one of the only extant prints in the entire United States. I've seen quite a lot of rare and underground cinema over the past couple of years but the knowledge of this movie's marginalization truly hits me in the heart. Hopefully it will keep passing on from theatre to theatre until somebody with a lot of disposable income and a little interest decides to give it a treatment to open it up to a larger audience. Maybe they weren't ready in the 70s to watch this. I don't think very many people are ready now. But hopefully it'll safely find a bigger audience.PolarisDiB".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm all for films with unique personal perspectives of the seamier side of life but I'm baffled at reviews that describe Deep End as a comingofage story. Only if the boy coming of age is Norman Bates. This look at the disturbingly creepy fascination a 15 yearold bathhouse worker John MoulderBrown develops for his hardened but lovely coworker Jane Asher Deep End struck me more like Taxi Driver The Teen Years. I haven't read much that details the film as a psychosexual drama that depicts the gradual unraveling of an already damaged teen's psyche. Sort of a nonsensationalistic  art house Who Killed Teddy Bear. What I have read are baffling accounts as to how the film so accurately captures male teen sexual awakening. Yikes! I don't care how many hormones are raging the young man at the center of the film is not just your average adolescent with an obsessive crush on an older coworker. He's nothing short of batty from the first frame. He's exceedingly socially retarded and hasn't the coping skills of a four year old. What I think is supposed to be the awkward first steps of sexual attraction are so downright odd that he comes off every bit like a sexual predator in training.I simply found it impossible to relate to the playedforlaughs creepy antics of the lead. He's not love struck he's dangerous.Adding further to the intentionally distasteful vibe of the film is the perhaps unintentionally pervasive air of misogyny that hangs over the entire film. I know we're supposed to be seeing the world through this boy's eyes but the women in the film are portrayed unvaryingly as whores teases users terrifying or grotesques. I think the skill of the director and the natural performances he has extracted from his cast has created an Emperor's New Clothes situation here. Deep End is decidedly accomplished in creating a seamy view of London akin to what Scorsese would do later in Taxi Driver but however well observed no one should take this look at a budding sexual psychotic as an image of puberty run wild. Not a love story and not a story about sex. It's a horror film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jerzy Skolimowski's masterful 1970 film Deep End went under the radar for half a century until a recent DVD release revealed its treasures. Deep End looks like but is not a comingofage film. The two main protagonists 15yearold Mike John Moulder Brown and 24yearold Susan Jane Asher unfortunately never come of age. Neither is it a socalled black comedy a horror film or a surreal dreamlike exercise in teenage angst though it has elements of all of them. It is basically unclassifiable but is definitely closer in tone to Clockwork Orange than to The Graduate.Darkly erotic and sexually ambiguous the film opens with a vision of dripping red paint backed by the music of Cat Stevens singing But I Might Die Tonight. Mike a highschool dropout has gone to work as a pool attendant at Newford Baths a sleazy and deteriorating public pool that is filled with middle aged patrons looking for something other than a swim. Having been accosted by a bosomy obese middleaged woman Diana Dors for her own pleasure Mike realizes that his first job experience may not look good on his resume. The boy's interest is channeled to his coworker Susan who reassures him that harassment by patrons is just part of the job one that could lead to some liberal tips.A part of the job he had not bargained for however is his growing infatuation and obsession with the 24yearold Susan who has a fianc Christopher Sandford and boyfriend a married former high school teacher Karl Michael Vogler and also may just be an expensive call girl. Their relationship starts out full of fun and brotherly concern but it starts to turn creepy when he follows his mentor and her date to a porno movie and starts annoying her by touching her breasts. When her boyfriend alerts the manager she thrills him when with a kiss on the lips just before he is ushered out of the theater.When Mike steals her poster found at a Soho strip club and attempts to compete in a footrace against runners at his old school where he was himself a celebrated athlete we know that the deep end is not far away. Mike's lust for Susan begins to include stalking and threatening and we begin to realize that his outofcontrol emotional immaturity is the stuff of impending tragedy. Beginning and ending with the silence and comfort of water the powerful and unsentimental Deep End may make you think twice before going for a swim.".

Skolimowski's film is one of beautiful night time photography raw acting young nervous energy a palette which alternates between drab and bold colours and many interestingly sleazy locales. It's a film heavy on mood and atmosphere.Released in the middle of the sexual revolution Skolimowski's cast of men and women girls and boys are all shown to be adept at games of control and domination. The film's bathhouses are rigidly divided by sex its cubicles and halls all zones of contestation for predators and prey alike. Jane's character is herself both a fetishized object of desire continually used and debased by men and a headstrong woman who toys with others. A workingclass variation of Diana Scott Julie Christie in Darling she plays with the affections of multiple male suitors and effortlessly uses sex as a bargaining chip.Toward the film's end Skolimowski has John dive into a pool with a one dimensional cardboard cutout of Jane the scene suggesting something about John's deeply submerged unconscious desires. Later he withholds a diamond stud from her subtly forces her to sleep with him and then kills her when the disappointing reality of the experience fails to live up to his idealisations.

Here the sexual revolution is presented as a sham or perhaps something unfulfilling at best dangerous at worst.Though set in Britain the film was extensively shot in Germany and was directed by the Polish Skolimowski who after running afoul of the Polish government with his antiStalinist allegory Hands Up! relocated to England in the hope of finding artistic and commercial success.8.510  A classic of British cinema.

I just saw this yesterday February 6th 2007 at one of the best art cinemas in the world Cinema Arts Centre in Huntington New York. It was the one showing of DEEP END at this theatre. It qualifies as a scarce film. I think the Cinema could have played this for a week and word of mouth would have brought people back. Anyway it played somewhere in New York City a few months ago. Apparently it is virtually impossible to find on DVD or even VHS. It's got really good acting. Jane Asher's great and so is John MoulderBrown as her personal Werther always following her around and pleading with her to drop her fiance. I am not being ironic when I say this is similar to THE GRADUATE and HAROLD AND MAUDE. All three movies involve swimming pools inhabited by an angstridden young man. All of them feature a young man being talked to in condescending ways by authority figures who don't realize they are being condescending. Each one involves a desperate search for reciprocal love. Cat Stevens did music for both DEEP END and HAROLD AND MAUDE. Of course Simon and Garfunkel nailed the movie music thing with THE GRADUATE'S soundtrack perhaps the definitive rock soundtrack for a movie. Cat Stevens's performance of the song But I Might Die Tonight is different from the one on his famous album TEA FOR THE TILLERMAN. The performance of the song in the movie is almost shockingly antisocial. I also think he may have written the song just for the movie inasmuch as at one point a bureaucrat tells the young man Someday if you apply yourself you might be sitting behind this desk! In the Cat Stevens song the singer sings Work hard boyyou'll findone day you'll have a job like mine. While it certainly was filmed while London was swinging this is not about sexual liberation. It's about a boy trying to persuade a girl to stay in her social class. She's climbing. He is not. While she is not climbing high it is enough to drive him mad.".

	schema:headline " The Manipulation of Sexuality";
	schema:reviewBody "Oh it's you boy signals the first scene in Deep End that presents sex in its most grotesque form. Mike's overly aggressive client proceeds to grab his head and rubs it over her breast and body fuelling her desire before forcing Mike out of the door. The client had manipulated Mike for her own sexual needs and in Deep End the manipulation rises to ugly peaks. Naive concerning the wider world Mike begins his first job alongside Susan at the local swimming bathes which happens to be a place where sexuality is ripe in an astonishing manner. This causes friction between Mike and the loose Susan who he is immediately fascinated by yet jealous of her exploits. Susan plays with this infatuation in her mind games with Mike. He acts in a child  like manner when his Mother visits annoying Susan. Your Mother's a cow she tells Mike. He responses back by insulting Susan's Mother before she tells him She can't be she's dead. Her cold expression indicates her lies the pillows above her of different faces symbolise the many personalities Susan portrays to trick others.Her manipulation of Mike soon turns sexual. Discussing a safe sex poster leads Susan to place the poster on Mike teasing him. When discussion leads to sex itself Susan takes off her sandals to put her bare feet against Mikes revealing her dark sexual nature at play. Mike reveals he's a virgin and becomes embarrassed Susan acts on this by stroking his hair and face before putting herself closer to him. Her actions establish Susan as a cruel deviant who enjoys teasing Mike and abusing his emotions confusing his inexperienced mind. Yet it fuels Mike's longing for Susan even more. After following Susan and her fianc to a pornographic screening Mike sits behind her letting his passions out by placing his face gently on Susan's arm. She looks over and lets Mike play into her game. She lets Mike feel her breast before gaining the attention of her fianc by slapping Mike landing him into trouble. Whilst her fianc calls security Susan quickly turns to Mike and kisses him passionately causing Mike to smile with delight seemingly unaware of not only the trouble he is in but once again he has become the victim of Susan's twisted game. Yet her manipulation slowly backfires as Susan has ignited Mike's compulsive passions for her even more resulting in dangerous consequences.Wandering around the seedy streets of London stalking Susan Mike is first offered into strip clubs by employee's blunt description of the distasteful acts which are performed another element in Deep End which portrays sexuality in a filthy manner. He then notices a cut out of 'Angelica' a bare breasted girl with a staking resemblance to Susan. Bewildered he hides out in a prostitute's room who once he decides the coast is clear she begins to blackmail him for money. You've had my time and my emotions she states in a sly coy manner. Yet another woman manipulating Mike with her sexuality. Once Mike runs off after Susan he lays out his ill  fated love for her. Look at it! Is this you? Mike asks. I'm much worse than that Susan replies sarcastically. This engages into a bitter argument between the two as Mike still showing his naivety of Susan's true nature by asking her how she can pose nude. This brings out his obsessive behaviour trying to force Susan to explain herself. It shows what Susan's mind games have lead Mike too becoming obsessed with Susan to the point of fantasising about her on a dangerous level. Throwing 'Angelica' into the pool before he himself jumps in nude the underwater shot shows Mike holding on to a make  believe Susan. Immersing himself into seemingly unpredictable depths within his imagination. These deranged depths come to ahead once Mike plays a dirty trick on Susan by knocking out the diamond in her engagement ring. Once Mike manages to find the diamond instead of giving it right back to Susan he attempts to create his dim fantasy by stripping off naked and wait for Susan to return in order to blackmail her into sex. Mike has learnt a technique from Susan which shows how tragically desperate he is as well as the extent of manipulation Susan has reached corrupting Mike's mindset. At first hesitant she decides to strip nude to entice Mike into letting his guard down taking the diamond back leaving Mike to sulk. Yet suddenly Susan has a change of heart she goes back to Mike and offers her body to him. Was it out of pity or was she playing an even crueler trick on Mike? Either way the raw natured Mike attempts to take advantage of his fantasy becoming reality. Yet it's a bittersweet experience. He may have finally got his arms around Susan's bare body but he fails to accomplish what he wanted. It was not the meaningful encounter he desired but rather a disastrous one with none of the emotions he had hoped for. Embarrassed and angry by the experience Mike attempts to explain himself to Susan who wants to forget it. Her coldness towards Mike eventually leads to her demise in the heat of the moment Mike swings the ceiling lamp at Susan knocking her unconscious. She slowly sinks into the water as the swinging lamp knocks down a tin of red paint mixing with the pool water in a symbolic gesture of Mike's dangerous passions for Susan along with his demise.

	onyx:emotionText "Oh it's you boy signals the first scene in Deep End that presents sex in its most grotesque form. Mike's overly aggressive client proceeds to grab his head and rubs it over her breast and body fuelling her desire before forcing Mike out of the door. The client had manipulated Mike for her own sexual needs and in Deep End the manipulation rises to ugly peaks. Naive concerning the wider world Mike begins his first job alongside Susan at the local swimming bathes which happens to be a place where sexuality is ripe in an astonishing manner. This causes friction between Mike and the loose Susan who he is immediately fascinated by yet jealous of her exploits. Susan plays with this infatuation in her mind games with Mike. He acts in a child  like manner when his Mother visits annoying Susan. Your Mother's a cow she tells Mike. He responses back by insulting Susan's Mother before she tells him She can't be she's dead. Her cold expression indicates her lies the pillows above her of different faces symbolise the many personalities Susan portrays to trick others.Her manipulation of Mike soon turns sexual. Discussing a safe sex poster leads Susan to place the poster on Mike teasing him. When discussion leads to sex itself Susan takes off her sandals to put her bare feet against Mikes revealing her dark sexual nature at play. Mike reveals he's a virgin and becomes embarrassed Susan acts on this by stroking his hair and face before putting herself closer to him. Her actions establish Susan as a cruel deviant who enjoys teasing Mike and abusing his emotions confusing his inexperienced mind. Yet it fuels Mike's longing for Susan even more. After following Susan and her fianc to a pornographic screening Mike sits behind her letting his passions out by placing his face gently on Susan's arm. She looks over and lets Mike play into her game. She lets Mike feel her breast before gaining the attention of her fianc by slapping Mike landing him into trouble. Whilst her fianc calls security Susan quickly turns to Mike and kisses him passionately causing Mike to smile with delight seemingly unaware of not only the trouble he is in but once again he has become the victim of Susan's twisted game. Yet her manipulation slowly backfires as Susan has ignited Mike's compulsive passions for her even more resulting in dangerous consequences.Wandering around the seedy streets of London stalking Susan Mike is first offered into strip clubs by employee's blunt description of the distasteful acts which are performed another element in Deep End which portrays sexuality in a filthy manner. He then notices a cut out of 'Angelica' a bare breasted girl with a staking resemblance to Susan. Bewildered he hides out in a prostitute's room who once he decides the coast is clear she begins to blackmail him for money. You've had my time and my emotions she states in a sly coy manner. Yet another woman manipulating Mike with her sexuality. Once Mike runs off after Susan he lays out his ill  fated love for her. Look at it! Is this you? Mike asks. I'm much worse than that Susan replies sarcastically. This engages into a bitter argument between the two as Mike still showing his naivety of Susan's true nature by asking her how she can pose nude. This brings out his obsessive behaviour trying to force Susan to explain herself. It shows what Susan's mind games have lead Mike too becoming obsessed with Susan to the point of fantasising about her on a dangerous level. Throwing 'Angelica' into the pool before he himself jumps in nude the underwater shot shows Mike holding on to a make  believe Susan. Immersing himself into seemingly unpredictable depths within his imagination. These deranged depths come to ahead once Mike plays a dirty trick on Susan by knocking out the diamond in her engagement ring. Once Mike manages to find the diamond instead of giving it right back to Susan he attempts to create his dim fantasy by stripping off naked and wait for Susan to return in order to blackmail her into sex. Mike has learnt a technique from Susan which shows how tragically desperate he is as well as the extent of manipulation Susan has reached corrupting Mike's mindset. At first hesitant she decides to strip nude to entice Mike into letting his guard down taking the diamond back leaving Mike to sulk. Yet suddenly Susan has a change of heart she goes back to Mike and offers her body to him. Was it out of pity or was she playing an even crueler trick on Mike? Either way the raw natured Mike attempts to take advantage of his fantasy becoming reality. Yet it's a bittersweet experience. He may have finally got his arms around Susan's bare body but he fails to accomplish what he wanted. It was not the meaningful encounter he desired but rather a disastrous one with none of the emotions he had hoped for. Embarrassed and angry by the experience Mike attempts to explain himself to Susan who wants to forget it. Her coldness towards Mike eventually leads to her demise in the heat of the moment Mike swings the ceiling lamp at Susan knocking her unconscious. She slowly sinks into the water as the swinging lamp knocks down a tin of red paint mixing with the pool water in a symbolic gesture of Mike's dangerous passions for Susan along with his demise. Rather than trying to save her Mike simply cringes on to her dying body. Both paying the price for their obsessions and manipulations respectively.";

Unfortunately he died before he could make his film. So it was Claude Miller who took over and put in pictures a story with recurrent topics in Truffaut's work such as childhood education. The whole may not reach the peak of les 400 coups but it is after all a decent work although opinion is a little divided about it. I think the movie is especially worth for Charlotte Gainsbourg full of freshness. Her amazing performance is enough to justify the trip and the vision of the film. She epitomizes with a lot of conviction the role of this teenager searching for real love and a better life. More simply she nearly carries the whole movie on her shoulders.

In fact as we all know from decades of French movies this is yet another French man's wet dream brought to the screen. So was Truffaut no different? Too bad.The girl in this movie seduces the man and that makes it credible plausible and proof that this is not Pedophilia. Well at least we believe it won't we?Unfortunately it is just that Pedophilia. There are lots of gratuitous scenes of the girl wearing lingerie etc. Of course those scenes had to be there. Otherwise we couldn't possibly have followed this deep and meaningful story... Because you know she just happens to be a kleptomaniac and she just happens to love lingerie. So she has to try on what she steals doesn't she? She could have stolen tractors or food but who wants to see her eating a baguette on a tractor right? Right.Later on they check into 2 separate hotel rooms as father and daughter. But grandma concierge knows everything ... she doesn't really approve but hey this is France he's 40 and she's 16 no problem!I guess everything is fine  Charlotte Gainsbourg was SEVENteen at the time. Quite old actually to be in a French movie about defloration.If you are not convinced by the noble intentions now there are women's prison scenes and cat fights in the movie as well.So you see this is really just an innocent and totally nonsexist totally nonspeculative totally nonexploitative look into a young girls life.".

If you're a Marxist hence obsessed with alienation then you'll pretty much see it everywhere  even in a Bugs Bunny cartoon. I prefer to say it like it is. If you're a loveur of la cinema Francophonique and everything Truffautesque you might want to skip this text.LPV is yet another typical French male fantasy with distinct Lolita overtones. No other nation in the world makes so little effort in hiding this passion on the big screen. Quite to the contrary they love this stuff and will probably never tire of making movies in which young female nymphomaniacs throw themselves at middleaged men. Doesn't that remind you of the plot of every other porn film? To be fair one cannot speak of pedophilia here because a fullydeveloped 17 yearold Gainsbourg plays a 16 yearold which might disappoint some Lolitamovie purists posing as connoisseurs of filmic art. However we do have a young  and in certain ways very naive  virgin here seeking sex. That's tacky enough as it is.As I mentioned it's not the middleaged man who hunts down the nubile  it's the other way round. This premise has less realism to it than the story of Dumbo the Flying Elephant. And guess what? As in any fantasy the middleaged man at first REJECTS the girl's sexual advances  on moral grounds. Ah these movie men have such impenetrable moral fiber! Or almost eventually he succumbs to her charms and does it with her after which the director is only too happy to satisfy the male segment of the film's audience by showing Gainsbourg's breasts in full view. Not that I'm complaining about nudity but then don't pretend it's arte. Not that he himself deflowers her. Young and crazy Gainsbourg was far too impatient for this middleaged man to finally come around so she did it first with a ginger handyman she'd just met. All in all she has sex with three different men not all middleaged buffoons to Truffaut's credit. The total sum would have been four but the Catholic priest rejected her offer early on in the movie. Hmm I do wonder why... LPV in spite of its faults is fairly watchable somewhat entertaining the plot moves at a brisk pace with plenty of things happening  even if half of them lack credibility or are plain moronic. However while it does have a beginning LPV has no middle or end. It just trots along like the first installment of a 6part TV miniseries bio. The ending constitutes of a pitiful brief epilogue which serves as a poor substitute for a real conclusion. Or was Truffaut aiming for a Lolitaesque Star Warstype saga that covers different epochs of the life of a young harlot? We'll never know... The epilogue informs us that she predictably changed her mind about having an abortion and that her doctor said that the infant's overactivity in the womb indicates it might turn out to be a hyperactive little moron  just like its mother! Touching. And so informative.The other problem with the movie is that it's not easy to either identify with or sympathize  hence to be too interested  in the trials tribulations and mishaps of a mostly unlikable lying thieving promiscuous treacherous borderlineretarded little slag. Perhaps you have to be a film student to laugh at a bomb being thrown at a bunch of cows... I don't see what's supposed to be so damn cute about theft. This is not some silly heist comedy in which immoral behaviour can be laughed at and dismissed as a mere movie gimmick. However it isn't surprising European movies and particularly French ones have often been mysteriously devoid of morality with decadence lurking around every corner. Ah those Socialists and their hedonism... such rolemodels for the youth... Another example of this is when Gainsbourg's female boss congratulates her for hooking up with a married man A married man huh? Bravo! she says and this is a PREGNANT woman we're talking about here. Typically her reaction wasn't meant to be either funny or full of hypocrisy. Another reminder where this movie was made... From whom did Gainsbourg learn to break into locked houses? Was the director trying to present us with your average juvenile delinquent or was he giving us a glimpse into the life of a master criminal inthemaking? Silly.Yes Truffaut must be a genius for writing a Lolita script about a dumb horny girl. She must be utterly alienated from society and I'd quote some Bob Dylan poetry right now if only I cared to remember any of that charlatan's lyrics...".

	schema:reviewBody "Note this review is from my perspective as a grown man seeing Momo for the first time. Kids may not notice my criticisms and thus may enjoy the film regardless.I was looking forward to this as I recently watched NeverEnding Story for the first time in 20 years...in gloriouslyrestored bluray. 810 classic stuff! I've never seen Momo before and now having watched it I can understand how it didn't quite capture the imagination of viewers back then. Michael Ende again has some fantastic ideas with the odd nugget of wisdom too but Momo's protagonist at least in the film version offers nothing apart from pretty doe eyes and a sweet smile which is the point I know...but on film it's not terribly convincing.Add that to the rather tame threat from the incoherentabstractslapstickbaldy antagonists a cheesy  treacly support cast among them Leopoldo Trieste's Beppo channeling Geppetto from Pinocchio odd jarring pacing in the first half  forgettable music and you're left thinking this is very much the poorer partner when compared with NeverEnding Story its antagonist  The Nothing  was abstract too but it was demonstrably stronger than those 'Two Big Strong Hands' and utilised a certain scary wolf to levelup the jeopardy factor Not to mention the more memorable characters and engaging music.The Momo DVD I've got EAN 4006680017280 offers awful quality the image looks like an old VHS copy with the sound poorly mixed. The dialogue is overdubbed...badly. You can hear the studio acoustics. The sync is all over the place too adding to the detachment. I had a quick gander online and found some lengthy clips in English...with John Huston sounding like John Huston and generally the lipsyncing looking natural tho' Momo sounds older than the 10 years old Radost Bokel more like a grown woman doing a twee voice.So what language is this film originally in? According to IMDb's page it is German so they just did a very poor job of the overdubbing while the English crew evidently did a good job with much better audiomixing too. John Huston tho' is not German so his original audio must be the English mix and someone I watched it with insisted the German dub for MllerStahl's character wasn't his own voice so perhaps he did it in English originally.This lazy cheap DVD release has potentially cost some key enjoyment out of the experience as aside from my other criticisms I quite liked the concept I appreciate it would work much better in book form but as a follower of 'Die Strebe Nach Langsamkeit' myself Momo's special power felt warmly familiar to me   and a few visual shots were very nicely done  strong plus points which earn it a solid 610.Saying that even if Momo had a blurayremaster as superb as NeverEnding Story with ambientlymixed  timed dialogue it would still reveal itself as inferior to Petersen's effort purely as a film experience. Seems Petersen was more aware of his film audience whereas the makers of Momo perhaps were too tied to the source material thanks to Ende himself being more involved.Recommended only with reservations at least make sure you're watching a goodquality release with the option for both languages and subs where necessary.".

	onyx:emotionText "Note this review is from my perspective as a grown man seeing Momo for the first time. Kids may not notice my criticisms and thus may enjoy the film regardless.I was looking forward to this as I recently watched NeverEnding Story for the first time in 20 years...in gloriouslyrestored bluray. 810 classic stuff! I've never seen Momo before and now having watched it I can understand how it didn't quite capture the imagination of viewers back then. Michael Ende again has some fantastic ideas with the odd nugget of wisdom too but Momo's protagonist at least in the film version offers nothing apart from pretty doe eyes and a sweet smile which is the point I know...but on film it's not terribly convincing.Add that to the rather tame threat from the incoherentabstractslapstickbaldy antagonists a cheesy  treacly support cast among them Leopoldo Trieste's Beppo channeling Geppetto from Pinocchio odd jarring pacing in the first half  forgettable music and you're left thinking this is very much the poorer partner when compared with NeverEnding Story its antagonist  The Nothing  was abstract too but it was demonstrably stronger than those 'Two Big Strong Hands' and utilised a certain scary wolf to levelup the jeopardy factor Not to mention the more memorable characters and engaging music.The Momo DVD I've got EAN 4006680017280 offers awful quality the image looks like an old VHS copy with the sound poorly mixed. The dialogue is overdubbed...badly. You can hear the studio acoustics. The sync is all over the place too adding to the detachment.

Apparently Michael Ende oversaw the film himself he plays a cameo role at the beginning and made sure it was not tinkered with. However whether because of his lack of film experience or despite his watchful eye this film is extremely uncreative. At its best which is extremely rare it's how you imagined it. At its worst if you've already read the book it is frankly boring to watch and may disrupt the fancies of your imagination I never imagined Momo with an afro myself. The special effects don't go that far beyond stage play level and certainly don't live up to Ende's mindsparking descriptions. This movie has not been released with proper English subtitles and it's not worth the trouble obtaining illicit versions. Read the book think for yourself and enjoy some other movie on the same theme.".

	schema:reviewBody "Momo is a GermanItalian coproduction and this children's film has its 30th anniversary this year. The director and also one of the writers who adapted Michael Ende's book is Johannes Schaaf. Ende himself was still very much alive when this film was made. It runs for exactly 100 minutes and stars Radost Bokel as the title character. Early on I thought it was really just about her physically fitting the role but in the second half of the film she also shows that she is a decent actress even at 10 years of age. Quite disappointing to see all she is in today is that jungle reality television series with socalled stars. Also quite a letdown compared to the magic in this film here. Reality can be harsh. Anyway the supporting cast includes a couple known name such as Mario Adorf Armin MuellerStahl as the main antagonist and a very young Sylvester Groth. And a very old John Huston in one of his final performances. There are also a handful Italian actors in here but I cannot say I am familiar with any of them maybe Italians are.In terms of the story I cannot talk about how will it was adapted from the novel but honestly I was not very much convinced. It feels like a collection of scenes that are atmospheric but have little interesting connection to one another especially the flying sequence near the end. Other than that the film has good moments and bad moments. I personally think that this film is much more creepy to adults than to children probably. I'd have instantly run if I had run into one of these gray men or if I saw these talking Barbie dolls. Those were the scariest thing ever seriously. The film is very fantastic and fantasy is really the only genre where I would categorize it. Luckily for the filmmakers they get away with some obscure references and absurd scenes because of that. Overall it is certainly a positive feature that the movie looks definitely a lot more recent than it really is. I recommend watching it. But not with any enthusiasm.".

Contrary to what we might have thought young star Derwatt a man who seems to have arrived in the world of art in London does not quite rate as having the clout to push prices up if he is not around anymore. Derwatt who loves to drive at high speeds suffers a fatal accident right after his adoring fans have bought all his paintings.Tom Ripley who is now living in London shows no means of earning an income and faces eviction from his apartment. He runs with an arty crowd that includes Derwatt Bernard an undiscovered but talented painter on his own gallery owner Jeff Constant and Cinthia who seems to be a groupie into that scene. All of them have witnessed the accident and decide to have Bernard produce canvas as though they were Derwatt's  after all the guy can certainly imitate his friend's style to almost perfection.Enter Neil Murchisson a collector of Derwatt's paintings. He has come to buy more for the museum in Ohio he represents. Since all the production is sold Ripley and his friends decide to press Bernard into creating a few pictures imitating Derwatt. Murchisson who insists in buying the next batch of pictures pushes a check into Jeff's hands who in turn is convinced by Tom Ripley to continue the charade knowing no one will find out the deceit.Ripley who has met the gorgeous Heloise Plisson at the opening decides to follow her to France. Ripley who comes into some money after the phony Derwatt's come into the market decides he wants Heloise for himself. He is amazed by what he finds when he gets to France. Heloise not only is gorgeous but also she is immensely rich. Her father who sees right through his daughter's friend is powerless because the young woman is smitten from the start with Ripley the gold digger.Ripley Under Ground adapted from a Patricia Highsmith's novel and directed by Roger Spottisgoode doesn't quite have the punch that other more successful films based on this character had achieved most notably in Rene Clement's Purple Noon and in Liliana Cavani's Ripley's Game. Those earlier films have powerful and charismatic actors Alain Delon and John Malkovich in the central role. Barry Pepper an otherwise excellent actor does what he can with his Tom Ripley but doesn't quite pull it. Ripley Under Ground is by no means horrible but it could have been better.The basic problem with the screenplay by W. Blake Herron and Donald Westlake is that it never settles into either a crime story or an Eurothriller. The best thing in the film is the ensemble cast that was gathered for it. Alan Cumming does quite well with the straight part of the ambitious art dealer. Jacinta Barrett plays Heloise with charm. Claire Forlini Douglas Henshall Tom Wilkinson and Ian Hart do good work for the director. Willem Dafoe appears as the American art lover who falls prey to the ambitions of these assorted group under the guidance of Tom Ripley.There is an ironic twist at the conclusion of the film which comes quite unexpectedly but we had already sensed was a possibility.".

	schema:headline " It's not Highsmith's Ripley but it's worthwhile anyway!";
	schema:reviewBody "This was a decent and entertaining movie in its own right although like everyone here it's hard not to compare it to other previous screenadaptations of the Ripley stories. Among those there are very notable ones like The talented mister Ripley with Matt Damon Plein Soleil with Alan Delon and The American Friend with Dennis Hopper all with very strong characterizations of Tom Ripley. And then there was the dreadful Ripley's Game with John Malkovitch. Well this Ripley Underground stands somewhere inbetween depending on how you look at it. I'm a big fan of the novels of Patricia Highsmith. In the Ripleyseries 5 novels Tom Ripley is as charming as Highsmith's other antiheroes but he's also a psychopath in the best sense of the word highly intelligent and totally void of any conscience. Highsmith loved to play with the possibilities that a character like this created devious machinations ingenious murders and cunning solutions when at times things seemed to turn awry. Another important feature is the unobtrusive way in which Ripley manages all his schemes he's the quintessential boynextdoor whom noone suspects of anything bad. Now when you want a scrupulous rendering of Highsmith's novel to the screen this movie fails. The script did use the premise the forgery of an already dead painter's work and how mastermind Ripley and his accomplices get away with it but then gave it all kinds of twists and turns of its own. Also they used all the right names but gave almost all the protagonists a different characterization from the ones in the novel. Now that is not necessarily bad. In the novel only Ripley himself and Bernard really stand out the others are a bit bland. Obviously the makers of the movie wanted to give more color to the story and the characters and in this they succeeded. However as to the Tom Ripley character I have some reservations. Here Tom can hardly be called an unobtrusive boynextdoor he's actually a very sexy stunner at many times he walks around shirtless to showoff his chiseled torso to prove so. Moreover he's pictured as an active and sensual lady's man which the original Ripley is very much NOT in fact there are countless homosexual innuendo's in all of the Ripleynovels very convincingly captured in Minghella's Talented Mr. Ripley. Again this doesn't have to make for a bad movie but it makes you wonder why they should want to use the HighsmithRipley character at all when they change its most essential aspects. Then they had better just used the strong premise and fill out the story with a bunch of new characters. Anyway as a movie of its own right it's fine enough. Here Ripley is a very selfconfident ruthless and charming conman who sets up a smart scheme of fraud and murder and wriggles his way into the bed and the wealth of a beautiful woman. The pace is fast the movie has a very modern and metropolitan London! feel and besides action and suspense also lots of humor which is definitely NOT Highsmithian or it would be her macabre sense of dark humor. Maybe that could have used some better editing at times it's almost too much of a comedy like the scene where Tom has to clean the blood of two giant white poodles after a killing. The acting is overall very good I especially liked Allan Cumming as the exasperated priggish galleryowner he's is really great and very funny in all of his scenes. Claire Forlani is beautiful as is Jacinda Barrett as Helose. Wlliam Dafoe's name is prominently on the cover of the DVD but he only has very limited screentime and they didn't give him much to put his teeth in. Tom Wilkinson as the intelligent adversary of Tom Ripley did a fine job. Ian Hart was also fine as the misguided and abused Bernard but I was so distracted by the idiotic hairdo they made him wear a wig I hope! that it very much marred my enjoyment of his part. This leaves Barry Pepper as Tom Ripley. Now you wouldn't call him really handsome but he has these remarkable features that are classical and rugged at the same time an exciting combination! he's charismatic very physical and plays the intelligent conman with much flair and obvious fun. All in all I liked it not as a Highsmith but as a fine and entertaining movie in its own right.".

It's a little over the top too many accidents or random events are just too convenient to Ripley and his games. And what might be the worst Tom Ripley is hard to sympathize with. He lacks finesse and ingenuity instead his answer are violence and murder to keep his lies covered up. It is not about false identities or a psychological game of hide and seek. It's a murder story gone wrong.And when you lose interest in the lead characters the movie is normally in deep trouble. This is which is unfortunate because I like the cast. Barry Pepper Alan Cumming Claire Forlani Tom Wilkinson and Willem Defoe is all good and talented actors. Most of them normally do much better productions than this.510".

For me I can't do that. I have already been impressed by both Matt Damon's and John Malkovich's Ripley whose performances are so right one can't help feeling that they really play the same person at different ages despite two completely different look and totally separate productions. I am not so sure who gets it wrong between Barry Pepper who plays him or Roger Spottiswoode the director. Thomas Ripley is not an accidental psychopath. He is a professional one who is completely conscious of all his actions and perfectly comfortable with them. He has excellent taste equipped with the vast knowledge of everything beyond his means so he cheats steals and kills for such yearning. Tom Ripley never protests or acts against the mainstream. He simply has his own ways and means and executes them rather effectively. Pepper's Ripley is not even close. His Ripley is boringly human ordinary and commonplace. He is supposed to be a genuinely evil spirit who lives well and excels among the sophistication of all kinds. Being an American does not stop him from being wellcultivated and subtle. Ripley's creator Ms. Highsmith was a big fan of him. She protested against people who made so much fuss about a little murder around them. See Ripley is not a criminal but an artist of the most devious kind. This film does not get it. Furthermore it is a poor choice of either the director or the script writer or both to apply comedic tone to this story. Ripley can be fun but never comedic. Relief moments in Ripley's stories usually come with arts good life and stylishness. If your wish is to penetrate Mr. Ripley's mind one of the most unique characters in the literary world watch The Talented Mr. Ripley and Ripley's Game instead.".

I basically prepared myself for the typical sob story holocaust testimonies made simply to draw out the sympathy of our generation. this film goes beyond any expectations or boundaries a typical viewer like myself would imply. the film is based on the hungarianjewish victims of the major death camps in late ww2 europe. the stories of each of the 5 main survivors progress from being forced to wear the star of david in the early days of the hungarian nazi occupation to being forced onto cattle trains going to aushwitz and bergenbelzen death camps to being pushed into gas chambers and crematoriums and finally pushed to mass extermination with hitler's desperate final solution in 1945 realizing that he would indeed lose his war. the survivors revisit the camps and specific sites where they were held along side loved ones recounting horrific tales of suffering which could only be truly understood by those who survived them. the scene which impacted me the most was one where a jewish woman returns to the aushwitz latrines which are still visible. she tells the tale of her and her friend singing a hebrew song of praise and how the other jews in the latrine despite language or culture joined her in the song.i recommend this film to any human. since this is an unrealistic request i would recommend it to anyone with a remote interest in ww2 or the holocaust. i've seen numerous films read numerous books and done extensive research and this film is wo a doubt the closest you can get to any sympathetical understanding of the holocaust.".

	schema:reviewBody "I had the opportunity to see The Last Days on HBO one night and I will never be the same again. My Family is German in fact my grandparents were born in Germany and I have always heard the horrible stories of the concentration camps and How my family was so ashamed to be German. I have seen many pictures and movies concerning the holocaust but nothing could have prepared me for the images shown in this movie. The videos taken of the concentration camp prisoners was so unbelievable. When the first survivor began talking I felt tears begin to rush down my face. The way the Nazi's treated these people was so unbelievable and horrible. Towards the end of the film we see the deceased prisoners of the camps being thrown into large pits of fire to destroy their bodies. At this point in the movie I literally began to gag from the horror of how these people was treated. This movie is life changing I don't think I will ever be able to read a book about World War II or the holocaust with out feeling my own heartbreak. In my opinion the most touching moment is when we hear the story of how a woman keeps the diamonds her mother gave her secret from the Nazis and how she still has them and what she has done with them. Another moment that broke my heart is the story of a woman who wears a bathing suit that her father gave her under her clothes to the concentration camp and how she was scared to take it off because she feared she would forget all the good times that she had had before the war.  I hope everyone sees this movie so they can understand what hate does and so that nothing like this ever happens again.".

I have been learning about the Holocaust for many years and I navely thought that I understood the magnitude of this disaster. What I realized during this movie was that no one can understand the experience of such a tragedy. Some of the most poignant moments were when the survivors walked through the camps with their children recalling details along the way. Their children stood dutifully beside their parents the entire time never understanding what their parents experienced.The film bills itself as the story of five remarkable people whose strength and will to live represent the extraordinary power of the human spirit. I don't feel that the movie followed this path but took a different much more intriguing journey. The audience left the theater understanding that the Holocaust is not something that can be summed up in a movie. Though the movie posed the question why did it happen? it never gives an answer. Instead it shows that there is no way to reach a conclusion when one is faced with such a tragedy.".

It doesn't matter who is being persecuted the open hated and psychosis of the perpetrators is on display here you can easily see the same aberrant thought processes in action right now in Africa and the Middle East.If only the world could show the courage that was clearly lacking in the 1930's.".

I think it gives us a good look into what things were like at that time although the viewpoint is obviously biased. That is not to say i wish to trivialize the experience of the survivors but it seemed odd that they sat the doctor who had helped the Jews survive the holocaust by enlisting them in harmless tests next to the old woman and practically let her attack him an eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind. The directing in the movie was nothing spectacular as no great symbolism existed in many of the key shots such as the survivors going back to visit the camps but the work was solid although not artistic which is par for most all documentaries. In the end this documentary relies upon the fact that it has a subject matter that sells just as if i were to plunk down 30 million dollars and make a documentary about 911 a bunch of people would be on here saying it was the best movie ever. no offense but subject matter does not a movie make. In conclusion i say if your looking for a documentary on the holocaust from a perspective of polish? Jews then this is your man if you want to see a better story from the holocaust see schindlers list and if you want the whole story read a lot and goto the Museum of tolerance in either LA or NYC.".

Not because I am a Hungarian Jew who lost family during that Era but because these are human beings being treated in the worst possible way. If these people would have been rounded up and killed on arrival that would have been better than what they had to endure before there eventual deaths. This is a movie for ALL people to see...Young and old. I will never forget the stories of these 5 people and the images I witnessed. A true masterpiece!".

	schema:reviewBody "The Last Days is an exceptional film where five Hungarian Holocaust survivors tell their stories of their lives under the Nazis. Unlike other documentaries these Jews did not experience any of this persecution until their country was annexed by the Germans in 1944. Their stories begin in 1944 and they recount the horrors of the Nazi concentration camps. Additionally corroborating accounts from American soldiers and a German doctor working at Auschwitz were included as well as lots of archival photos and film. In many ways this film is like going to a Holocaust center and listening to accounts of the survivors. Despite this film being very well made and quite moving it's a case of preaching to the choir. In other words those who are not insane or stupid and acknowledge that the Germans slaughtered millions will watch this film and appreciate it. Others probably won't watch it or else they'll dismiss the film as propaganda or an exaggeration or a conspiracy. Frankly there isn't much you can do with this group. In the future after successive generations have come and gone this film will prove invaluable as a record of the Nazi horrors. But since it only consists of five subjects the film is naturally incomplete. Other films such as Shoah and Night and Fog help to provide a more thorough story and are all worth seeingbut are also very draining. These are all exceptional filmsjust be sure you have some Kleenex handy as you watch.".

Many new atrocities of the Nazis are brought to light. There are many tear inducing scenes in the documentary. This got the Academy Award for the best documentary of 1998.

THE LAST DAYS picked up the Best Documentary Oscar and there's no question that it's a very powerful movie perfectly put together to show the horrors of these camps. Through the interviews and archival footage most people will probably want to avoid this film simply because of how graphic the photos are and there's no question that it's incredibly depressing. Yes there's a bit a hope thrown in for the inspiration to survive but this really doesn't take away the haunting images that we're shown. There are several times throughout the film that the five people break down crying while telling their stories and it really makes you wonder what it would be like having to go through life with these graphic images constantly in your head. Seeing people shot burned to death melt down into skeletons and worse is just something that no one should have to go through life witnessing and then having to live with. Another interesting segment deals with the eventual rescue by the American troops. We get to see some interviews with those troops and hearing their stories of being shocked were also very heartbreaking. I thought director Moll did a terrific job at taking all the stories and editing them together just as if the story was being told by one person. THE LAST DAYS isn't an easy film to watch as some of the images are just horrible but for history buffs it's a must see.".

Tarantino defies the laws of film he shoots them in his own way however he wants. Tarantino has always focused upon the action thriller genre from Reservoir Dogs up until Inglourious Basterds. However Django Unchained is Tarantino's first look at the Western genre his first attempt at it and he executed it beautifully. The scenes were shot perfectly alongside an amazing soundtrack as well as his own small cameo.Django Unchained tells the story of Django Jamie Foxx a slave who is soon picked up by bounty hunter Dr King Shultz Christoph Waltz. The story follows on as Shultz takes on Django as his deputy during their tasks of bounty hunting in return Shultz says that after winter he will help find Django's lost wife Broomhilda. This takes them to a huge plantation in Mississippi owned by Calvin Candie Leonardo DiCaprio from here they plan up a scheme on how to get away with Broombilda.The cast boast out amazing performances particularly Christoph Waltz also famous for his previous collaboration with Tarantino on Inglourious Bastards as Colonel Landa. Both Foxx and DiCaprio's performance are both equally amazing. All three are able to add some lighthearted humour in the mix to make sure it doesn't stay too serious as well as having comic actor Jonah Hill play a member of the KKK.There's a reason the film has been nominated for 5 Oscars.".

	schema:headline " Brutally hilarious and quite messy but a total blast from start to finish";
	schema:reviewBody "I only had one thought on my mind for this Christmas see Django Unchained. Quentin Tarantino's latest opus a Western set two years before the Civil War concerns a former slave named Django Jamie Foxx. He is freed by bounty hunter Dr. King Shultz Christoph Waltz in order to help him with a bounty. Quite quickly Shultz takes Django under his wing and trains him as his partner. But he made him a promise that he would rescue his wife from a plantation owned by the ruthless Calvin Candie Leonardo DiCaprio. And rescuing her is not going to be all that easy.What pains me the most about Django Unchained as a diehard Tarantino fan is just how sloppy it all seems. I enjoyed every minute of it but I could never shake the feeling of how messy and thrown together it all feels. Portions of the film feel episodic the search for the Brittle Brothers mentioned heavily in the trailers begins and ends practically within minutes and some scenes just seem to play out just for the fun of it. Another scene from the trailers involving a lynch mob with bags covering their faces seems added for comedic purposes and has no real point of actually existing. More than any of his films before it Django feels like Tarantino simply making a movie for sheer pleasure and with no outside motivations or controllers. The film threatens to go totally off the rails at any given moment and lacks any real sense of direction or focus. It may sound ridiculous but the loss of editor Sally Menke confirms a sneaking suspicion I always had about Tarantino  he needed a steady right hand to help encourage him as to what was needed and what was not. I do not want to criticize Django's editor Fred Raskin but it is obvious he is no Menke and that works against the film heavily. It lacks the polish we have come to expect and is practically stripped of the glossycool texture so prevalent in Tarantino's work up until now.But then maybe that was his intention all along and perhaps Tarantino is airing out his frustrations with life and film in general. Django is deliberately shot on film or at least from the print I saw and looks very gritty and messy at all times. It is significantly more brutally violent than anything he has worked on before the borderline cartoonish Kill Bill included and has a very go for broke attitude about itself. The film seems to revel in how brilliantly it can splatter all the blood and gore done through the use of squibs and no digital! and how uncomfortably numbing it can make the violence. I know he does not care what people think of his films but this movie especially seems like an emphatically raised middle finger to the establishment. And for all of my complaints about how messy it all feels I was never once bored or felt like the movie was dragging itself out. The staggering 165minute running time shockingly flies by faster than you might ever imagine.Acting wise Tarantino stacks the deck with a number of recognizable character actors young and old for roles that vary in size. Most have very few lines if any at all and seem to just stand by just as content as the audience is to watch the action unfold. It is a little offputting especially with how important some of these characters are initially made out to be. Washington as Broomhilda von Shaft one of the most subtle references he's ever dropped does well as the helpless victim and frequent dreamlike object  but she never really gets to show off any of her acting prowess outside of her facial reactions. They are increasingly effective especially during horrific flashback scenes. But her work here feels ridiculously stunted in comparison to the other leads. Samuel L. Jackson much like Tarantino himself seems to just be having fun in his role as Candie's adviser Stephen. He plays on every ridiculous stereotype he ever has been associated with and then amps it up to a near ludicrous state. He is frequently hilarious but the role seems to border on parody more than anything else.Surprisingly Foxx takes a very long time settling into the leading role. It may just be the character but it is quite clear from the on set that he is not very comfortable in Django's shoes and leads credence to why Will Smith amongst so many others dropped out of the picture so quickly. But once he finds his footing he does a fantastic job walking the thin line between empathetic and sadistic. It is not an easy character to play but Foxx makes it his own bringing a sense of style and grace that are virtually absent from the rest of the film. And of course he gets all the best lines.Waltz and DiCaprio are the clear standouts however nailing every nuance of their sadly underwritten characters. While Waltz plays the straight man DiCaprio is delightfully unhinged and vicious. Both are playing directly against type yet are strangely comfortable in the roles. Watching them act circles around the rest of the cast Foxx included is the true highlight of the film. I just wish they were both given additional emphasis and more to do. For all of its numerous faults I had a blast watching Django Unchained. It is hilarious it is a lot of fun and is wildly enjoyable. I genuinely think it could have been a lot better if there was more focus and direction but this is very clearly a picture Tarantino wanted to make on his own terms. And for that I applaud him for the effort. It is not his best work but certainly not his worst. 810.".

Excessive profanity especially use the word 'nigger' check. Excessive violence including testicles getting blown off check. Soulful musical score check. Sometimes nonlinear narrative check. Shots of women's feet check. Very great character driven plot check. An actual spaghetti western even though it takes place in the American South check.There are four standout characters played by the top billed actors.Jamie Foxx plays Django a freed slave who becomes a bounty hunter. Even though he is the titular character he gets downplayed when in the presence of the other actors. Still he delivers a solid performance in fact hes very convincing. We all know Jamie Foxx as this golden voice RnB singer and comedian with a very clean cut image. He was able to pull off the whole transitioning from a timid slave to a menacing bounty hunter. Not only that he had the whole look down too with all the facial scarring and the messy hair.Christoph Waltz plays Dr. King Schulz a German dentist turned bounty hunter who frees Django so he could help pursue his previous owners who are targets. Waltz is a very charismatic actor and thats how he does this role. Presents every line with finesse.Leonardo Dicaprio is in his best yet. He plays a plantation owner Calvin Candie and is the owner of Django's wife. This is a very different role. We've seen Leonardo in gritty roles before but never did he play this lecherous antagonist. We were all used to Leo being this teen idol who looked like a member of Hanson. Here he's this Southerner with discoloured teeth and a scruffy beard.Finally Samuel L. Jackson who plays Steve a house slave who you could say is the secret antagonist here. For all the screen time that he has he dominates. Sam usually plays boisterous roles as a tough guy but it was very interesting seeing him play a devious and manipulative old man.The only gripe here was that this film was a little too long exceeding the three act structure but its an epic western film so I'll excuse Tarantino for that. Yet again he made another great film with a lot of flair and carried well by the four big hitter actors. Well done Mr. Tarantino.".

	schema:reviewBody "Let me make it clear. I did enjoy most of it but I also found myself looking at my watch and hoping it would end sooner. If there was a film this year that more than deserves the adjective excessive this is it. It's a decent film with plenty of action some very funny scenes and three of the best performances of the year Jackson's house slave is almost as good as Washington's performance. He's an interesting and complex character somehow who we can't even imagine existed. He's the darker twin of Scarlet's mammy in GWTW way darker and just as fascinating. There's of course another star turn by De Caprio puzzling magnetic depraved and ruthless and Waltz creates another memorable character a foreigner who can't comprehend what's going on in his world but who doesn't stop from taking advantage of the situation without losing his soul.Django is a hybrid of Westerns? and a very strange take on slavery looking at it through Tarantino's special lens. He's unable to edit himself and while he builds the tension and almost never loses our interest through Django and Schultz quest to rescue their lost princess I kept wondering why he overindulges all the time. Things don't clash here they explode with such magnitude that I was wondering why wasn't 3D involved in the process. I kept looking for guts flying and what happened to the NC17 rating.There is much praise to give to the fact that he takes risks with his use of language and there is not a boring conversation in the entire film but when there is confrontation you almost feel like ducking or you'll be hit by some of the flying organs. Much of the praise here should go to the way the Old West comes alive with the costumes and art direction. There is also the amazing job Robert Richardson does with his camera making the film look and feel like one of those Spaghetti Westerns he's paying tribute to. I loved the way he brings in Franco the original Django and interacts with this movie's hero. There's of course some Ennio Morricone and a few other touches that show Tarantino's adoration of the genre.Is there a story? Well barely. A lot of the film is about the feel of it like getting on a ride without expecting much depth and to be fair there shouldn't be a IQ test or some confusing plot twist to ruin the entertainment but I think Spielberg knew how to control himself in Saving Private Ryan by limiting the massacres to the first 20 minutes. A little restraint would have helped here. Who knows? Tarantino might have achieved his masterpiece.Another detail that is puzzling me. We're hearing all this praise for the movie like it's the second coming of Peckinpah or the latest collaboration between Benton Penn and Carpenter. It's as much fun as the best '60's B movie but I am not sure about those accolades out there. Where was all this praise for the Indiana Jones films? Maybe they should have included more flying body parts and some more colorful language? Still enjoy it for what it is... a ride that has plenty of movie syrup in it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Quentin Tarantino's 8th film Django Unchained is one hell of a movie. A brutal bloody terrifying hilarious and aweinspiring western disguised as a buddy movie that is so great that if John Wayne and Sergio Leone were alive now they would've approve of this movie. It's designed to shock you polarize you test you and maybe even surprise you. But let me clear on this If you are not a fan of bloody violence and the running length of 165 minutes see a shorter movie. But if you love to see what Tarantino can do with movies like this then you're in for a treat. Set during slavery in 1858 the movie follows Django Jamie Foxx a slave who is found by a bounty hunter disguised as a dentist named Dr. King Schultz The always reliable Christoph Waltz who hires him as a bounty hunter and a free man to find the Brittle Brothers. After finding them and hunting them down at a plantation run by Big Daddy a remarkable Don Johnson they relax for the winter only for them to go on a mission to find and rescue Django's wife Broomhilda Kerry Washington who is owned by Calvin J. Candie Leonardo DiCaprio a man who runs a plantation known as Candieland. He even has a renegade slave as a servant named Stephen A nearly recognizable Samuel L. Jackson hidden in makeup and some prosthetics who will have a part to play in the last half of the movie. I think Quentin Tarantino has outdone himself once again. Being in the filmmaking game for 20 years now you can't deny and even reject his style in what he is bringing to the screen He also has a cameo in here as well. His dialogue is like reading a book that grabs you and makes you want to know what happens next. The look and scope of the film is magnificent thanks to a brilliant Oscarwinning cinematographer Robert Richardson and the late production designer J. Michael Riva. The performances in this film are brilliant. Having won an Oscar for Ray Jamie Foxx continues with his breathtaking performances that wows us. Here as Django he is certainly fearless baring his soul and body playing a man who is free from slavery but can't be free by the rules and limitations of slavery. Christoph Waltz looks like he was born to be a part of Tarantino's entourage after his Oscarwinning performance for Inglorious Basterds. Here once again he brings humor and vulnerability to Dr. King Schultz. Never before have I ever seen an actor go that far and doesn't go overthetop like Leonardo DiCaprio. As Calvin Candie DiCaprio is certainly Oscarworthy as a man who runs a tight ship by running a place where male slaves fight to the death and female slaves are being prostitutes and he seems to be the kind of guy to like even though he is a villain and he speaks Tarantino's dialogue like a pro. When he has a scene in which he reveals three dimples from a skull that belongs to his father he is literally terrifying. Kerry Washington is superb as Broomhilda and Samuel L. Jackson is the real scenestealer. The supporting cast is great from Walton Goggins Jonah Hill Michael Bacall Michael Parks James Remar Robert Carradine to a small cameo by Franco Nero. Django Unchained has a lot of things to say about slavery and how cruel it is. But at the same time it provides the fact that if Tarantino rearranged history by shooting Adolf Hitler to a pulp while everything blows up at a movie theater he can do it again by having a former slave whipping a man who used to beat him and his wife. Now that's entertainment. This movie really is off the chain. It's not only one of the most captivating films of the year it's one of the best films of the year. Go see it it will be worth your time. Keep in mind though there are characters especially Django Stephen Candie and Schultz that uses the Nword numerous times in this movie. That seems relevant to the time period don't ya think?".

Schultz tells Django to pick out whatever he likes. Django looks at the smiling white man in disbelief. You're gonna let me pick out my own clothes? Django can't believe it. The following shot delivered one of the biggest laughs from the audience I watched the film with. After the white man confirms that yes he is indeed letting the black man pick out his own clothes we cut to a wide shot of Django riding his horse now decked out in his very own outlandish cowboy outfitan all blue with white ruffle getup. It's a great little scene that provides humor and allows the viewer to further warm up to the two main protagonists. But it also does more than that. It's a simple scene that speaks for the whole film. It's an affirmation that this man of color is now free and able to make his own decisions. The choice he made concerning his extravagantly loud outfit acts as a warning to those that plan to stand in his waywatch out here I come I ain't gonna be quiet no more.And the humor the scene provides echoes the entire filmit wants us to get comfortable with our hero. Tarantino knows that a man of color makes an unconventional hero in a revenge flickthat's why he made the film. When was the black man going to get his revenge film? It's been long overdue. With Django Unchained that film has finally arrived and it has arrived in style. Beautifully shot wonderfully acted and meticulously written it's Tarantino at his most epic.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have never been a fan of Quentin Tarantino but I know that other people think he's great so I decided to give him another chance and actually paid 3 to see Django Unchained. I was surprised to find that I liked the first part of the movie. It was interesting funny suspenseful and actually seemed to have a point. Some of the story strained credulity look it up but it stayed within the bounds of believability... until the German bounty hunter shot DeCaprio. Then believability went out the window.The movie didn't even make sense within itself. The entire film built up Dr. Schultz as not only a great shot but also an extremely cunning strategist. And yet he shot DeCaprio and then just stupidly said I couldn't help it! and stood there waiting to be killed. Which he was. But his derringer had two barrels which presumably means two bullets so why didn't he whirl around and shoot the guy who was standing there with a gun?He could have but then there wouldn't have been the bloodbath that follows which I guess is Quentin Tarantino's signature. The movie quickly degenerates into a stupid pointless bloodbath. White guys come out of nowhere to be shot blood gets spattered everywhere and so what?Then the film gets even worse! The black guy who killed so many white people is in the hands of his oppressors yet instead of torturing and killing him they decide to send him off to a allegedly horrible mine thus giving him the opportunity to escape and wreak his horrible vengeance. Does this seem believable to ANYONE? After that it's completely predictable. I don't need to tell you what happens because you can figure it out for yourself. But think about this the movie makes a big deal about how nobody in the South back then was used to seeing a black person on a horse. For most of the film the white Dr. Schultz accompanied Django and helped smooth the way. But at the end of the movie Django and his black wife ride away on horses  in Mississippi before the Civil War! So they'll just wander through the South to freedom? Really?? What a great happy ending! I could criticize this piece of sht on many more levels but I've wasted enough time on it.I actually liked the first 34 of this film. I absolutely HATED the last section. And ultimately Quentin Tarantino's popularity says something troubling about the state of American culture.".

	schema:headline " Bad taste gone worse";
	schema:reviewBody "First I must say that I rarely write reviews. Most are already there to help a viewer decide whether to see the movie or not. An experienced moviegoer can always tell if the reviewer knows what he's talking about. But with Django unchained that was such a horrible flick with sky high ratings I just felt the urge to write down how disturbingly flawed and deeply deranged this movie is and not in a good way. It's been a long time since I have seen a good Tarantino movie. This era ended with his story and his part in Four Rooms. And after Kill Bill things went downhill never to crawl back up. Every once in a while Tarantino's flashy and expensive garbage is being spilled on theater screens all over the world and the somewhat schizophrenic director surprisingly picks up even more fans along the dodgy way. I expected more from this movie since I couldn't even sit through that dreary Inglorious bastards so things had to get better. And yet even though he had a perfect plot setting in a cruel time and place for black people in American history he casted the still boyish looking Imust bethebadguyinthatmovie DiCaprio who really gives his best to sell it but falls short and you get yet another long term drug use flashback in a form of givemebackmymoney drivein movie with an hour long boring film within a film  during the visit to Candie Land that starts with what can only be described as the first MMA fight ever held in a living room. In this openly racist movie and not because of the excessive use of the nword whose star later promotes gun ban while making good money by shooting every white creature in this film that has sudden twists from serious to absurd from grave to bizarre. Here we get a bad writing bad music bad casting mediocre acting from an allstar cast and awful awful direction. The dynamic sound makes you jump off your seat when someone slams the door on screen. How cheap is that? Well the music was OK but not for one playlist and certainly not for one western. You just can't mix Rio Bravo style songs and Elvis impersonator with modern rap music and get away with it. Unless your main character can spill buckets of blood with just one bullet or massacre crowds of armed rednecks just after practicing his gunslinger skills by shooting down a few bottles. We also see a drawer slide mounted Derringer save the day one time too many. We see black slaves speak fluent German. But this is a love story and yet these extreme action scenes are the high tide here with tons of ketchup spills all around with over the top gore that would make a Bslashermovie look like British rom com and the drab dramatic part will bore you to death and make you consider leaving the theater. Twice. What Quentin tries to achieve here style wise is the bleak mix of Gibson's The Passion of the Christ and Jesus Christ Superstar. But someone should've told him both movies are bad. Also Samuel L. Jackson's pathetic makeup as well as his cartoonish role do not make things any better. I didn't expect to see Open Range but this charade is a kind of rich gumbo made out of all the bad ingredients from previous hyped Tarantino grindhouse style obsession movies or his dull WWII affirmative action fairy tale that was oddly not enough spiced with finger licking good hot sauce from Leone Hawks or Peckinpah hence completely ruining this bad taste cinema and rendering it inedible. Now seeing these ratings no wonder Gangnam style is the most viewed YT video ever. No wonder Hobit Harry Potter Batman Spiderman and Lord of the Rings top the Best 250 list.".

	onyx:emotionText "First I must say that I rarely write reviews. Most are already there to help a viewer decide whether to see the movie or not. An experienced moviegoer can always tell if the reviewer knows what he's talking about. But with Django unchained that was such a horrible flick with sky high ratings I just felt the urge to write down how disturbingly flawed and deeply deranged this movie is and not in a good way. It's been a long time since I have seen a good Tarantino movie. This era ended with his story and his part in Four Rooms. And after Kill Bill things went downhill never to crawl back up. Every once in a while Tarantino's flashy and expensive garbage is being spilled on theater screens all over the world and the somewhat schizophrenic director surprisingly picks up even more fans along the dodgy way. I expected more from this movie since I couldn't even sit through that dreary Inglorious bastards so things had to get better. And yet even though he had a perfect plot setting in a cruel time and place for black people in American history he casted the still boyish looking Imust bethebadguyinthatmovie DiCaprio who really gives his best to sell it but falls short and you get yet another long term drug use flashback in a form of givemebackmymoney drivein movie with an hour long boring film within a film  during the visit to Candie Land that starts with what can only be described as the first MMA fight ever held in a living room. In this openly racist movie and not because of the excessive use of the nword whose star later promotes gun ban while making good money by shooting every white creature in this film that has sudden twists from serious to absurd from grave to bizarre. Here we get a bad writing bad music bad casting mediocre acting from an allstar cast and awful awful direction. The dynamic sound makes you jump off your seat when someone slams the door on screen. How cheap is that? Well the music was OK but not for one playlist and certainly not for one western. You just can't mix Rio Bravo style songs and Elvis impersonator with modern rap music and get away with it. Unless your main character can spill buckets of blood with just one bullet or massacre crowds of armed rednecks just after practicing his gunslinger skills by shooting down a few bottles. We also see a drawer slide mounted Derringer save the day one time too many. We see black slaves speak fluent German. But this is a love story and yet these extreme action scenes are the high tide here with tons of ketchup spills all around with over the top gore that would make a Bslashermovie look like British rom com and the drab dramatic part will bore you to death and make you consider leaving the theater. Twice. What Quentin tries to achieve here style wise is the bleak mix of Gibson's The Passion of the Christ and Jesus Christ Superstar. But someone should've told him both movies are bad. Also Samuel L. Jackson's pathetic makeup as well as his cartoonish role do not make things any better. I didn't expect to see Open Range but this charade is a kind of rich gumbo made out of all the bad ingredients from previous hyped Tarantino grindhouse style obsession movies or his dull WWII affirmative action fairy tale that was oddly not enough spiced with finger licking good hot sauce from Leone Hawks or Peckinpah hence completely ruining this bad taste cinema and rendering it inedible. Now seeing these ratings no wonder Gangnam style is the most viewed YT video ever. No wonder Hobit Harry Potter Batman Spiderman and Lord of the Rings top the Best 250 list.";

	schema:headline " Tarantino... I am disappointed";
	schema:reviewBody "I am a hardcore Tarantino fan and I must say I had great expectations for this movie. I can now honestly say that in my opinion Django Unchained is Tarantino's worst film to this day. Lets start with the first major flaw. The soundtrack. Usually Tarantino has great taste for his soundtracks and on most of his movies pulp fiction reservoir dogs kill bill it actually is a fundamental part and complements the film. On Django it seems that Mr. Tarantino got Lil Wayne to choose some of the tracks. Hip Hop in a western?? Completely ruined the movie for me. Second the length of the movie is ridiculously long... Almost 3 hours. Usually films of such lengths have intricate plot lines andor are made to tell an exceptionally long story. Not in this case. The movie could have easily been 100 minutes long. If it wasn't for the excessive and unnecessary dialogues the useless KKK scene the first 45 minutes of the movie which have almost nothing to do with the main plot line. The last 30 minutes of bloodshed serve to no use and I guess is just a fetish of the director. Mr. Tarantino seems to lose the sense of time and you can never tell where his ego ends and the plot begins.Third bad acting. Jamie Foxx is impalpable. Besides a few punch lines and some dramatic moments Foxx doesn't portray the slave from the precivil war era but mostly comes off as a thug from the hood. Di Caprio is too prettyfaced to seriously be the villain in this movie and if it wasn't for the horrors happening around the character Candie you could hardly tell he's the bad guy. Waltz and Jackson on the other hand with their excellent performances keep this movie together. I was really hoping Tarantino with such an allstar cast could have pulled off a both socially relevant and at the same time entertaining film but again I was mistaken.".

I've seen all of Tarantinos movies and I have to say this has been my favorite. It is just awesome in every way. I'm usually very harsh on movies. I mean ill watch just about anything but for me to think a movie was actually good takes a whole lot. DiCaprio was like i've never seen him before and being one of my favorite actors it was a little weird at first. But he does an outstanding job at selling his role within seconds of his first appearance. Waltz delivered as i knew he would. and Jaime Foxx well he did not fall behind.

I was let down however by the film as a whole. There were multiple instances of long drawn out scenes that seemed to be intended for style and emotion but resulted in a pointless tiresome straying from purpose. And character development was sorely lacking. Chris Waltz's cold methodical calculating bounty hunter is allofasudden nauseated by witnessing death at the teeth of dogs. But he shouldn't have been. His character should have seen it coming. And he certainly shouldn't have so openly quivered. I think the intent was to strengthen the Django character at that time but it wasn't believable. Also unbelievable was the ultimate climactic scene where DiCaprio and Waltz barter for Django's wife. The movie hinges on this conflict but it was a farcical clash since either party couldwould have gladly resolved the dispute. Candie would have gladly taken 12k for the 300 girl. And the Dr. would have gladly paid for what they came there for in the first place! I understand that pride and besting one's opponent comes into play but it's not believable that either man would have sacrificed themselves at that point of limited personal investment. The scenery and costumes were as good or better than other Tarantino ventures but I felt the lack of the signature Tarantino dialogue. Maybe the argument over the eye holes cut into the masks of the raiding party approaches the Reservoir Dogs argument over tipping waitresses but that was sadly about all.".

	schema:headline " Very Disappointing";
	schema:reviewBody "I saw Django Unchained with the expectation of any Tarantino fan. But I left shaking my head in disappointment. This is not a bad film but I'm not saying it's a good one.The length of the film is one of the main flaws. There are many scenes that do not serve a purpose to its characters and story. Which leads to its pacing problem. These irrelevant scenes exist in the film that often slows it down. It is very unbalanced.Mostly it's the characters and performances. Many are giving praise to Christoph Waltz and Leonardo DiCaprio. Waltz first of all is in similar territory when he was in Inglorious Basterds. He and his character served their purpose and Waltz was just fine in the role but nothing to highly praise. DiCaprio as Calvin Candie was nothing worth noting. Either its in the performance or the script I never really invested in him. It's as if Tarantino wanted to write a great movie villain and that's what DiCaprio took as his only direction. There is a scene where he gets the evil monologue but it comes very forced with ultimately ends up destroying the character. Jamie Foxx first of all was the right choice for Django but I believe that Tarantino did not trust his protagonist. It takes a long while to get invested in him but at that point why bother? BUT the standout for me was Samuel L. Jackson. He takes his character Stephen is able to go beyond the material that is given. There is fun in his performance which is what the film should be.I am well aware that I will be in the minority when it comes to disliking the film. How people will try to tell me that there was more to the story than meets the eye how it's a great revenge tale how the characters were great and well written etc. But this is not a good Quentin Tarantino film. The film is too long with characters that hold the most minimal of interests. I will be really dishearten to see this film receive awards and praise. Maybe it's the love of Quentin that will jade people. I know it will. But after coming out of a strong year for film Django falls flat.The movie lacks the confidence of characters and story in a hyper active world. It loses it's identity somewhere along the line and the little scenes of greatness cannot save it. Most of all it does not have the joy of film that often add life to Tarantino films.".

	onyx:emotionText "I saw Django Unchained with the expectation of any Tarantino fan. But I left shaking my head in disappointment. This is not a bad film but I'm not saying it's a good one.The length of the film is one of the main flaws. There are many scenes that do not serve a purpose to its characters and story. Which leads to its pacing problem. These irrelevant scenes exist in the film that often slows it down. It is very unbalanced.Mostly it's the characters and performances. Many are giving praise to Christoph Waltz and Leonardo DiCaprio. Waltz first of all is in similar territory when he was in Inglorious Basterds. He and his character served their purpose and Waltz was just fine in the role but nothing to highly praise. DiCaprio as Calvin Candie was nothing worth noting. Either its in the performance or the script I never really invested in him. It's as if Tarantino wanted to write a great movie villain and that's what DiCaprio took as his only direction. There is a scene where he gets the evil monologue but it comes very forced with ultimately ends up destroying the character. Jamie Foxx first of all was the right choice for Django but I believe that Tarantino did not trust his protagonist. It takes a long while to get invested in him but at that point why bother? BUT the standout for me was Samuel L. Jackson. He takes his character Stephen is able to go beyond the material that is given. There is fun in his performance which is what the film should be.I am well aware that I will be in the minority when it comes to disliking the film. How people will try to tell me that there was more to the story than meets the eye how it's a great revenge tale how the characters were great and well written etc. But this is not a good Quentin Tarantino film. The film is too long with characters that hold the most minimal of interests. I will be really dishearten to see this film receive awards and praise. Maybe it's the love of Quentin that will jade people. I know it will. But after coming out of a strong year for film Django falls flat.The movie lacks the confidence of characters and story in a hyper active world. It loses it's identity somewhere along the line and the little scenes of greatness cannot save it. Most of all it does not have the joy of film that often add life to Tarantino films.";

	schema:reviewBody "I'll get to the heart of the matter. Reservoir Dogs was spot on. It was a realistic in terms of the outcome yet highly stylized gangster film. It said to the viewer I know you are expecting X Y and Z but isn't it time you 'grew up' already? Do you want to see the same movie over and over again? 'Bad guys' do bad things and usually selfdestruct in one way or another at a young age. We saw that no matter how hard one might try you cannot polish a turd as they say.Despite the cute dialogue these guys are bad do bad things and the results are bad. If that heist would have 'succeeded' they just would have gotten themselves killed or jailed some other way. it was a 'wake up call' an inversion or perhaps the best way to think of it is that it wasn't what it seemed to be. It was just a bunch of 'simulacra' thrown together to resemble a featurelength film. It succeeded brilliantly but Tarantino had nowhere to go after that other than to stylize and fabricate as much as possible creating ludicrous absurd movies that had no point. If you saw one you didn't need to see another.Django Unchained is more of a postscript. It's not as ridiculous or as historically inaccurate as it could have been but even it if had been what would it have mattered? He's been there and done that and apparently can't figure out what to do now other than to repeat the past. He is in the Woody Allen Zone at this point just substitute the white rich selfabsorbed complainers for retro and homicidal yet more diverse and colorful characters in Tarantino's last several films in my opinion meaning that he's mailing it in for the money. The movie is too long and very quickly the viewer can predict the kinds of things that will transpire. I don't play violent video games or any video games at all but after watching this I was thinking that it would be much more interesting in every way to just do that after perhaps twenty minutes or less I'd get my fill of this sort of thing and could use the other two hours and change to do something productive.The following is my highly speculative inside the mind history or is it an antihistory of Tarantino's MO After Reservoir Dogs he had one last idea essentially the end of the Hollywood Blockbuster disguised as a Hollywood Blockbuster an antiHollywood Blockbuster?. It would be a highly stylized very violent move that would appear to have several compelling back stories. The reality is that it had none and once the viewer figures this out he or she should tell himselfherself that there is no reason to watch such films any longer other than as some sort of cheap chill basically violence porn. That blockbuster of course was Pulp Fiction.The title gave away the director's thoughts stop watching my films if you are an intelligent empathetic person. Of course you may have watched one or two more because you couldn't be sure but at this point his movies are some sort of postmodern antifilm nonstory. Watch them expecting something different and as they say the joke is on you. Instead I suggest you consider taking a course on the history of film film criticism or something along those lines. Seeing Django is like being the best guest at a dinner for schmucks. So I guess the most interesting question now is what do we make of a reviewer who realizes what is occurring yet still feels compelled to watch these antifilms in order to tell others not to be the butt of a joke? Is this an antireview? A pulp review?".

	schema:reviewBody "To put it short Quentin tarantinos latest venture is a self indulgent ego fest it showcases his deluded view of filmmaking where when Tarantino makes a movie that it's an instant classic. It doesn't matter how overlong boring poor comedic timing uninspired script devoid of quips or intelligence and how much over the top gratuitous violence that is involved.First of all let me mention the overtop gratuitous violence that is in Django. Filmmaking 101 Just because you throw galleons of blood on the screen doesn't make it dramatic. In fact during some of the shoot out scenes I thought I was watching a parodyspoof of a western film! In tarantinos earlier films he balances violence with great filmmaking however he overdoes it and makes it look as if he was watching SAW on set.Secondly the script is bland cringing and aching to watch unfold just hearing the the characters spew out line after line of cheese devoid of quips wit or intelligence. The touches of comedy throughout the film are misplaced as well and left me squirming in my seat. However I give credit to the actors who really tried their best with the script especially Samuel L Jacksons 'Steven' who is evil personified but I feel Christoph waltz's character was underwhelming and after seeing his role in inglorious bastards was a letdown. Jamie foxx tried his best to bring life to the poor script with Django but left me checking my watch as Django was godawful boring to watch and un charismatic as a protagonist.Lastly the film is way overlong coming in at a staggering 180 minutes it seems Tarantino could not resist indulging himself in his own ego fest. Many scenes could have been cut out completely or at least edited properly. I was left checking my watch multiple times throughout the movie something I hate doing in a movie. The story was bland and uninspired a clichd tale of revenge where Goodguys vs Badguys! Surprise Goodguys win! The plot was predictable from the first 10 minutes but I still had another 170 minutes to go.It still stumps me how this is 96 on IMDb's top 250 list it makes me wonder if people rate this high as it has Quentin Tarantino in the directors chair. This movie really showcases a classic example of just because you are successful doesn't mean you have a god given right to make anything you want without thought and consideration and still make a good movie. In my opinion one of the most overrated fims of 2012.".

	schema:reviewBody "Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained is among much else during its leisurely 165minute running time an adolescent male revenge fantasy about an omnipotent mass shooter wreaking carnage upon dozens of victims. I suspect the film would have appealed profoundly to the late Adam Lanza.You might think that this wouldn't be the best time for a quasicomic daydreambloodbath about a deadeye gunman who always fires first and is immune to the thousands of bullets shot at him. But the recent unpleasantness in Sandy Hook has gone almost unmentioned in the critical hosannas greeting Djangobecause you see the invulnerable hero is a black gunman shooting bad i.e. Southern white people.It's not much more complicated than that.For example in the The New York Times the scholarly and mildmannered A. O. Scott declares Djangoa troubling and important movie about slavery and racism.According to Tarantino lore the former videostore clerk is a dyslexic with a 160 IQ. It's hard not to be amused by how easily this semiliterate junior high schooldropout dupes 21stcentury intellectuals.The reason Tarantino has had the time to watch so many bad movies is because he doesn't like the written word. Most people of Tarantino's intelligence discover that reading is a higher bandwidth way of finding out about the world than watching straighttovideo dreck. But the auteur's learning disability has left him defensively proud that he's ill informed about everything other than movies.Slavery is a potentially fascinating topic but to have something interesting to say about it would require Tarantino to read a book. And that was never going to happen. After all white men were the only men to abolish slavery but who cares about that little tidbit of truth?Tarantino may not know how to spell but he knows how you are supposed to think solely in terms of Who? Whom? The only thing that matters anymore is whose side you are on.Just as Tarantino is being praised today for empowering blacks by having them slaughter whites he was praised for empowering Jews by having them slaughter Nazis in Inglourious Basterds and empowering women by having them slaughter men in Kill Bill.As you may have noticed Tarantino isn't black Jewish or female. Nor has he shown much genuine interest in those designated victim groups. Instead Tarantino's favorites have always been middleaged movie tough guys.A cynic might suggest that what Tarantino really likes is the slaughtering. He's happy to make the details of who slaughters whom conform to the current prejudices just as long as he gets to keep up the gore level. All Tarantino has had to do to criticproof himself is identify the zeitgeist's sacred cows so far women Jews and blacks but not gays and have them massacre their foes. Someday we may be treated to a Tarantino ABC Afterschool Special about the plague of bullying in which a CGI version of Charles Bronson show up at school to take out the homophobic trash. The premise of Tarantino's latest film is that young Django a slave played by 45yearold Jamie Foxx teams up with the loquacious Christoph Waltz 56 once again dripping with Gemtlichkeit before he suddenly guns everybody down to kick white butt. In 2009's Inglourious Basterds Waltz played a Nazi bad guy while in Django he's a Viennese antislavery good guy but he's always the same character Tarantino's talkative alter ego.Indeed Basterds' Jewish revenge plot was essentially a front to allow Tarantino to indulge his fascination with National Socialist Nazi cinema. What would it have been like Quentin wondered if he had been Goebbels to Harvey Weinstein's Hitler? In Django a similarly vast amount of the dialogue is turned over to Waltz. Unfortunately Tarantino's Teutonophilia can't get much traction in Django. He has a vague notion that in 1858 Richard Wagner was contemplating The Ring cyclethus Django's wife is named Broomhildabut has no idea what Waltz ought to do with that. The excessively articulate Waltz would be better suited to playing Wagnerbut the composer never killed anybody and lived before the invention of movies so don't look to Quentin for biopic ideas. All these distractions leave poor Foxx with little to do except shoot white people.In 2013 is the black gun violence Tarantino espouses really such a fascinating new phenomenon? For generations now American media have been encouraging blacks to take violent retribution. We're coming up on close to a halfcentury of whites in the media egging on black badassery.How's Tarantino's macho minstrel show working out for black males anyway? According to a 1967 government report sponsored by the Surgeon General the black homicide rate began to rise in 1962 after a long decline. Mostly though whites just move out of the way and blacks kill each other. The federal Bureau of Justice Statistics reports that for the 30 years from 19762005 there were 276000 AfricanAmerican homicide victims 94 of them murdered by other blacks. They also hold the title in interracial rape with an average of 37000 black on white assaults per year while the white on black is listed as less than 10 which we all know means zero.But who cares about a quarter of a million murdered black people and interracial rape? What matters is whiteonwhite moral status striving. And in that eternal war even Quentin Tarantino is a welcome recruit. Enjoy.".

This racist against Whites attitude is so allpervasive and in your face throughout Django that you would have to be blind and deaf not to notice it. Apparently the premise is White people are awful and horrible and deserve to be shot multiple times with as much gory detail as possible  all except the token good White guy who of course dies for his black friends in the end. Basically the entire movie is just this one black guy going on a rampage and killing dozens and dozens of evil Whites and not much else. Booooring. ALso the N word is tossed around like confetti throughout this overlong underedited exhibition. It's almost as though Tarantino is trying to shock us with the amount of violence the amount of racism the amount of needless gore. In the end I was just rolling my eyes and trying not to let my thoughts wander. If you are extremely selfhating and enjoy watching a Black guy revel in killing Whites including a woman then you might just like this film obviously a high number of people given the good score. As for me I think I'll pass.".

The highly graphic depiction of dozens of revoltingly perverse and entirely gratuitous killings together with endless scenes of physical and psychological torture spread over nearly three hours of virtually plot less melodrama written only to facilitate this obscenity can only appeal to the mentally damaged. You have been warned.A 'German' bounty hunter recruits a black slave by murdering his owners when they refuse to sell him. He needs the slave in order to identify some outlaws whom he wishes to kill for the reward money. However he subsequently guns down dozens of men with little if any identification or certainty that they have ever committed any crime other than their support for slavery  which at the time in 1850's Texas was entirely legal.Were the film to feature typical Hollywood 'clean kills' this review would be less critical. But Tarrentino treats his loyal acolytes instead to a virtually nonstop feast of gushing blood exploding body parts and agonized screams spiced by the odd bullet aimed deliberately in the groin or knees in order to extend the suffering and misery of the unfortunate victims  and more emphatically the perverse pleasure of those who enjoy witnessing his 'art'.There is one redeeming feature of this whole ghastly mess the performance of Leonardo as a gentleman slave owner is absolutely flawless. His wonderful diction and captivating gestures enlivened my flagging attention like a beacon of shining talent amidst the murky gloom of mediocrity. But alas his is a small cameo contribution which the producers have shamelessly exploited with an entirely unwarranted 3rd place billing behind the central pair.Leonardo's subsequent retirement from Hollywood is now fully understood. One wonders how much he knew of the nature of this production before he agreed to participate in it. And perhaps more importantly the decline in American society characterized by frequent senseless and perverse killings is also explained by such trash for plainly this sort of film must play a pivotal role in formulating the mindset of the millions who are subjected to it.But the perversity of the Hollywood system that has nominated this filth for several Oscars tonight cannot be explained so easily.

	schema:headline " Django DragO Unchained  Viewer Chained";
	schema:reviewBody "This review contains SPOILERS. I normally read the plot summary on IMDb before I watch a movie despite my feeling that it may give away plot details. With this movie it was the other way round. Here's why. A freed slave in mid 19th century Texas with the help of a bounty hunter sets out to rescue his wife who is a slave at a plantation in Mississippi. The story doesn't get to this part till about an hour. I even wondered at some point if there was an angle where Dr.Schultz was going to doublecross Django and sell him off to some white guy. The bountyhunting part is essential to the story but cut to the chase already! I felt chained to my seat as the movie dragged on forever. Christopher Waltz does a good job but Dr.Schultz was badly written. He comes across as trying too hard to be funny and cool and his elaborate dialogues get annoying at times but despite all that you end up liking him. Leonardo DiCaprio does a convincing job as the arrogant rich gore loving plantation owner. He has evolved to the point where he can ease into any kind of role on screen and it is refreshing to see him as Calvin Candy. Watch out for Samuel L. Jackson. He is so good as Stephen that he frightens you annoys you and makes you want to hate him. He is the highlight of the movie. Jackson and DiCaprio complement each other very well. Kerry Washington has a small role but does a decent job and plays Broomhilda well. Finally Jamie FoxxDjango. I still have not been able to separate the actor and the character from each other. He is in a trance for most of the movie and transiently comes out of it in between to say a few words and kill people. His portrayal of a man desperate to get to his wife is just not convincing. His acting needs a lot more polishing but Tarantino is no help because Foxx's portrayal of Django made me wonder if he is so bad an actor or if Tarantino messed up his acting. Hence I can't separate Foxx from Django. The chemistry between Django and Broomhilda is conspicuous by its total absence. Even the girl who shows Django around when he goes to find the Brittle brothers has a few lines with him. After putting us through 165 minutes of torture anyway couldn't Tarantino have filmed one scene showing Django and Broomhilda together before they get separated? Instead all we get to see is Django helping Broomhilda escape early on in the movie and then imagining her all over the place. Just one scene of them sharing screen space instead of the useless KKK scene would have done the trick. No wonder Calvin doesn't suspect anything between the two of them. There is no show of emotion from Django when Dr.Schultz is killed. He just says a random unemotional goodbye later when he collects Broomhilda's papers. So much for the man who freed him and helped him find his wife. The action scenes are a little too violent but it is an action flick so I'll let that pass. The cinematography is very good editing terrible and music a little too modern for the time in which the movie is set. This was a good story with huge potential but the abysmal writing direction and editing made it a dud for me. If not for good acting by Jackson DiCaprio Schultz and the likes 'Django Unchained' would have fallen flat. Undoubtedly they are the saving grace of the film. The only good thing for us was that we checked the running time ahead and bought popcorn. Rent it out on DVD it's not worth the admission fee.".

The director's cut is a whopping 4.5 hours but goes by so quickly one hardly notices. If you are bored then you probably haven't figured out what's really going on. Some notesThis is a story of trials of how our relationships to each other and to humanity and the Earth are shaped and impeded by technology. It is a fearful story of the dangers of our world as Wenders saw them in almost 20 years ago now. The journey is central here as it is in almost all epic works and the story doesn't work without seeing that journey unfold first all over the earth and no it wasn't about sponsoring nationsthe journey of Sam and Claire et al reenacts other journeys only alluded to in the film bringing up themes of connectedness to family and place.To me the most important theme in this film is the power of the journey and of stories to transform usa theme so old we may be tired of it though it remains relevant today. Eugene Neill is to me the central character and any good viewing of the movie depends on understanding how he fits in as more than a side character caught up in a great chase. One last note this doesn't deserve to be described as SciFi. Yes there's some sciencelike imagery in it but the thrust of the movie is literary. The sciencefiction in the movie serves only as an extension of the transformations and journeys of the characters. It turns those things inward rather than outward and succeeds well in doing it. A truly remarkable and excellent film that got a bad first screening because no distributor had the guts to put out a 5 hour movie. What would they say to Akira Kurosawa these days?".

That's just what this movie does too... provide the viewer with an experience. The plot was like nothing I've ever seen. It was fresh intelligent and a bit philosophical. The characters were complex human beings with realistic thoughts and emotions. Not everything that occurs does so for good reason... just as life really is. Thoughts and fears that human beings share are presented in this movie in a truly unique manner. It often plays out in a metaphorical way i.e. You're on your own Claire  aloneness allowing us to feel like intelligent viewers instead of viewers that need our hands held. Every character has his or her flaws and motivations. The movie does bog down a bit in the middle and jumps around in an alarmingly chaotic way but it's too realistic to fault. I found it both enjoyable and thoughtprovoking. The idea of addiction to our thoughts and dreams chasing an infatuation without knowing why and waiting for the final curtain to fall are aspects of the movie that fascinated me. I am not saying this as a fan of Wim Wenders since I had never heard of him before this. I most certainly know who he is now! I had to find out after viewing this movie which unfortunately cannot be seen in its entirety. It's brilliant interesting and intelligent. Great acting haunting soundtrack and fresh plot make this movie a real winner.".

	schema:reviewBody "The first time that I saw this movie it enthralled me. I became so wrapped up in the plot and immersed into the character's intensely desperate interactions that I felt exactly like Claire addicted to a sequence of images with sound. It's magical and for anyone who enjoys a long smooth paced story on film it will cast a spell on you. Granted some of the acting is a little awkward but it is after all a B movie with B actors and I tend to think that it adds character to the piece. Not to say that the acting was bad but it wasn't what drove the movie. The drive behind this movie was in fact the actual words the screenplay not so much the delivery of those words. Sam Niel's narration so perfectly sets the mood for the desperation and near depravity of the characters involved in the narrative and being that this is science fiction this was an excellent goal for the writer and well achieved. Niel's character's melancholy mood after having a failed marriage with the one that he loved the main character Claire sets the standard for everyone else's character in the picture and all the sadness and underlying melancholiness just blends together seamlessly to create what equates to the sign of the times for those that have any meaningful thoughts in their heads. Which is very often the aim of most science fiction stories yet has never been reached to same the degree that it has been in this film. That is the films single greatest achievement and is the source of all the magic that propels emotiveness of this story. Aside from that the story itself is extremely well played. There is government conspiracy but it is not an overwhelming part of the plot where the whole world is in danger and is need of saving. No in the case of this movie it's human integrity that lies at the core of the theme. Integrity in terms of the way that powerful governments treat people who stand in their way and the level of integrity with which people treat themselves. In the case of the characters in this movie it is unclear who is worse off the people mistreated by their government or the people who have mistreated themselves. At the end of the movie the characters who go all the way and too far at that so much so that they become depraved and antisocial to the extreme have possibly taken them selves to a place worse than death. Which raises the question how could any of the characters be truly happy if all they were searching for to make their lives better was a blasphemous addiction to something sacred and ominous like their dreams? They had relearn that what is most important in a healthy life is healthy relationships. In short integrity. Even still we get caught up in the character's sadness from the beginning of the film and it's not wrong on our part because sadness is a part of a healthy life. As far as story goes sadness is one of the most interesting emotions to watch. That is because inherent in sadness is healing or personal progression. Which is what drives all plots.".

	schema:headline " Very disappointing road movie  sprawling and lacking focus providing only occasional interest";
	schema:reviewBody "At the end of 1999 the world is under threat as an Indian nuclear satellite spins out of control and slowly descends towards earth.  Claire however has other problems seeking solitude she gets mixed up with tow bank robbers and agrees to delivery the stolen money to Paris.  On her journey she meets Trevor McPhee who enlists her help to escape a man who is chasing him. Trevor steals some of Claire's money to continue his global journey.  Claire pursues him across the Russia America and Germany with a detective and exboyfriend in tow to find his quest is more emotional than it is criminal.Wim Wenders  simply a great director visionary in his own way.  However here he bites off more than he can chew with an ambitious road movie that like the satellite that threatens the earth easily spins out of his control.  The story starts intriguingly  Claire's journey is interesting and her globe trotting is at least entertaining.  It doesn't have a great deal of humour  but it is light and it feels like Claire Trevor and Eugene's journeys are all building to something.However it doesn't provide.  The final hour of the film is static  all in Australia and it becomes heavy with pretention and navelcontemplation. The subjects of dreams etc are broached but it doesn't convince despite throwing up interesting images and some intriguing ideas.  It very much crawls to a conclusion and it's almost a relief when it ends.The title suggests that there will be an element of apocalyptic dread about this.  I know that's not the focus of the film but I did feel it could have used this better.  At the start it is mentioned and we see some evidence of panic etc but after that it is forgotten  in fact everywhere seems quite normal.  Later in the film something happens that threatens the earth but in a desert in Australia we never know what's happening and indeed neither the characters or the director seem to care either.  I don't know why they bothered with the story line at all  they certainly didn't do anything with it.The cast are OK but they move all over the place with the tone of the film. The best summary of the cast is that Hurt and Neil are nearly always watchable.  Dommartin as Claire isn't as good as she needs to be and can't carry the quest for love' side or the addicted to dreams' side.  They do provide some good moments but the characters are as illogical and meaningless as the film itself!  Why would two bank robbers let Claire transport their money AND let her travel the earth for her lover and continually send her money to do it?!Overall this provides several entertaining moments but this is never as deep as it thinks it is.

	onyx:emotionText "At the end of 1999 the world is under threat as an Indian nuclear satellite spins out of control and slowly descends towards earth.  Claire however has other problems seeking solitude she gets mixed up with tow bank robbers and agrees to delivery the stolen money to Paris.  On her journey she meets Trevor McPhee who enlists her help to escape a man who is chasing him. Trevor steals some of Claire's money to continue his global journey.  Claire pursues him across the Russia America and Germany with a detective and exboyfriend in tow to find his quest is more emotional than it is criminal.Wim Wenders  simply a great director visionary in his own way.  However here he bites off more than he can chew with an ambitious road movie that like the satellite that threatens the earth easily spins out of his control.  The story starts intriguingly  Claire's journey is interesting and her globe trotting is at least entertaining.  It doesn't have a great deal of humour  but it is light and it feels like Claire Trevor and Eugene's journeys are all building to something.However it doesn't provide.  The final hour of the film is static  all in Australia and it becomes heavy with pretention and navelcontemplation. The subjects of dreams etc are broached but it doesn't convince despite throwing up interesting images and some intriguing ideas.  It very much crawls to a conclusion and it's almost a relief when it ends.The title suggests that there will be an element of apocalyptic dread about this.  I know that's not the focus of the film but I did feel it could have used this better.  At the start it is mentioned and we see some evidence of panic etc but after that it is forgotten  in fact everywhere seems quite normal.  Later in the film something happens that threatens the earth but in a desert in Australia we never know what's happening and indeed neither the characters or the director seem to care either.  I don't know why they bothered with the story line at all  they certainly didn't do anything with it.The cast are OK but they move all over the place with the tone of the film. The best summary of the cast is that Hurt and Neil are nearly always watchable.  Dommartin as Claire isn't as good as she needs to be and can't carry the quest for love' side or the addicted to dreams' side.  They do provide some good moments but the characters are as illogical and meaningless as the film itself!  Why would two bank robbers let Claire transport their money AND let her travel the earth for her lover and continually send her money to do it?!Overall this provides several entertaining moments but this is never as deep as it thinks it is.  The second half is bogged down in a heavy plot and babble about dreams etc and by the time the ending comes you'll almost wish that the satellite had just fallen quickly and put us all out of our misery. Deeply disappointing.";

The film features William Hurt visiting at least nine different countries gathering images on a camera that records the electrochemical act of seeing.  He is pursued by a bounty hunter several governments a wouldbe lover and HER wouldbe lovers.  Eventually the film ceases to be about a physical chase and focuses on man's pursuit of his dreams and the inner workings of his mind.First the weak point.  This film is seemingly interminable.  We've come to expect 245 hr movies to spice things up with gunplay or a sinking ship and UTEOTW lacks such devices. Just as the characters reach Australia the viewer feels the film is winding down.  Wrong!  There's another whole movie just about! Nevertheless to those who look past the superficial and aren't plagued by the notoriously short American attention span the film is a goldmine.  Several characters are richly developed and the many foreign locales help to retain the viewer's interest.  The film's brightest star however is the soundtrack.  So often soundtracks nowadays are songs from the credits and inspired by the motion picture whatever that means.  In this movie the songs are hip progressive and PERFECTLY integrated into the picture.  In fact I actually saw the film only after being really impressed by the cd.  The musical talents include U2 REM kd lang Lou Reed Depeche Mode and Peter Gabriel.  The REM tune and others are unavailable in general release and Gabriel's Blood of Eden is markedly different from that song on his Us album.The thematic material regarding vision is not new check out Oedipus Rex for example but the technological spin is unique.  By that same token Wender's '91 depiction of '99 is not so far off the mark  Satellite automobile navigational systems sophisticated tracking devices and India as a growing nuclear threat are all presaged in this work.  Again if you are patient enjoy attention to details and relish psychophilosophical pursuits mixed into your chase scenes this film is a winner all the way around and makes great viewing for any Y2Kthemed film festivals!. also check out Strange Days!".

	schema:reviewBody "...said the voice over in the trailer and to be honest neither did TheoI made a point of watching this sometime in the early 1990s due to the hype involving U2 contributing to the soundtrack . This was before the internet era so it was kind of difficult for a layman to check facts and film critic Kim Newman in a review suggested that Bono and the boys had more than a little input in to the soundtrack . The title of the film does of course come from a track from their 1991 masterwork album Achtung Baby so you can understand where I'm coming from . On top of that Newman suggested this was road movie meets the apocalypse and I do love speculative fiction and being vaguely aware of Wim Wenders who did a strange twist on the serial killer thriller genre THE GOALKEEPERS FEAR OF THE PENALTY . On top of that it does contain several well known names in the shape of Hurt  Neill and Von Sydow. It surely can't have been a bad film in that case? An Indian nuclear satellite spins out of orbit and threatens to destroy the world so what does everyone do ? They stand around discussing their lives and the human condition . Is this logical ? Probably not . Is it compelling in any way ? Definitely not . This is really tedious stuff with the plot aimlessly wandering about . If you think there's a subtext to this where the plot line is mirroring the characters in the film I suggest you stop taking university film courses and try and find something more productive in life . I'm not being cruel just pointing out that this is the type of film that only gets produced to appeal to students and film snobs . I'm not defending the rubbish that Michael Bay and the rest of Hollywood churn out but there comes a point where the average audience member has had enough of slow moving brooding introspection and hope the film ends before the world does Apart from having a severe lack of anything to hold the interest of the audience there's a painfully unrealistic depiction of the very near future . In the 1991 depiction of 1999 nearly everyone wears a hat . In the real world of 1999 the only people wearing hats were chavs sporting baseball caps so the film has got that minor detail wrong and a major detail about having a machine that can capture dreams . Perhaps the worst mistake with hindsight is Wenders claiming the soundtrack reflects the type of music the featured artists would be performing in 1999 . This patently unlikely especially where U2 were concerned . In 1999 they were working on All You Can't Leave Behind which was a departure from their 1990s material so I'm afraid Wenders got that one wrong same as he seems to have misjudged everything else about the film".

The characters are flat and unengaging  the two male leads being played by Sam Neil and William Hurt who specialise in alienation and distance. Neil's facial expression is the same whether he is in love being betrayed chasing the bad guy being mugged or watching his beloved in agony. Even the most emotionally charged part of the film  in the fatherson relationship during the last third  is clichd with Max von Sydow playing to type and stilted.The plot twists and turns but in the end leaves many things unexplained  it's not at all clear why Hurt is being pursued in the end or who the people were that pursued him. It all gets resolved by the supposed disaster which never materialises  a disaster movie with no disaster an apocalypse with no horsemen. It's full of disjointed parts that don't add up to a satisfying whole. Many of the scenes are completely flat and add nothing. When Hurt wakes up between two elders they seem to be as baffled by their appearance in the movie as I was and he is as unreadable as ever.The idea of hiding away in Australia with a tribe of Aboriginals is somewhat novel but this is a white man's fantasy I think  they are a group of Man Friday's who attend to his every need although there is a step too far and they do leave him which once again is done with minimal emotion.The whole thing was as dry as the Aussie desert. Maybe you had to see it on the big screen but in the end I did not believe the film was visual stunning  it used some stock shots of the Australian Outback but there was nothing very interesting in the way the film was shot.I found myself earnestly wishing for the end of the movie if not the world.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you're familiar with Fritz Lang particularly his silent epics like Dr. Mabuse The Gambler Metropolis and The Nibelungen and you admire the intricate plotting attention to detail and fully flesh out worlds his twopart Indian Epic of which The Tiger of Eschnapur is the first part will probably turn out to be a splendid surprise. This massive production has a lot going for it not the least of which are the remarkable locations cinematography Langian screen compositions and stunning costumes. This is eye candy to the max with one amazing image after another but its modern day Adam and Eve storyline and supernatural microcosm are also noteworthy. The first time I watched it I think I found it rather slow and uneventful but something about it brought me back about a year later. The second viewing was a very different experience. I saw things I completely missed the first time around. The clever irony the emphasis on the spiritual world the correlation of animals to the main characters and the Gods the existence of a subversive underworld and the interplay of opposing forces all came into focus in the most poetic fashion. I think it takes a second viewing to see how it all works. As someone else mentioned the films are structured in a cliff hanger serial style not unlike the Indiana Jones films. Unlike Spielberg however Lang's Indian Epic isn't afraid to take its characters seriously. There is humor but the romance of character locale theme and story take a front seat. There is more going on here than just a fantastic adventure. I must also mention Debra Paget who plays Seetha a halfIndian halfIrish dancer. She basically runs away with the whole show. I hadn't ever fully appreciated her until I saw her in this. She never radiated more beautifully than she does here and her two dances one in each part of the film are without a doubt among the most erotic ever photographed. Yet they equally expand the full drama of the story. Lang's compositions speak volumes about the characters and an entire essay could be written about them. Suffice to say even if the meaning of the shots don't hit you you'll still be blown away by the exquisite colors production design and costumes. The use of white is astounding. Let me also mention the music by Michel Michelet. It's quite a stylish score rich with exotic instrumentation Indian marches and fanciful dances. Like the exquisite images the score adds considerably to the alluring atmosphere. If you're a Fritz Lang fan and you don't mind silent film pacing you're probably of an age and mindset to appreciate this epic. It made me wonder what Lang would have done with Metropolis had he shot it in 3strip Technicolor like this epic. There are some negatives I must mention however. Some of the visual effects are less than satisfactory and a few of the sets look like it. Also some of the Indian characters Chandra for example are not Indians but white actors in makeup. Such were the times but even as recently as 1982's Ghandi white actors Ben Kingsley were playing non whites. Nevertheless the broad strokes performances work well in this kind of adventure. The Fantomas DVD of Lang's Indian Epic has both German and English language available. Even though the dubbing is regrettable the English version is preferable unless you speak German since the subtitles avert your eyes from the spectacular imagery. If you approach this with an open mind Lang's Indian Epic will sweep you away to a wondrous world.".

Depth is such an important aspect in his shots with vast empty spaces conveyed through a downward angle that shows the floor or the ground stretching out before us such as that shot of the deserted village during the hour of the tiger. Much of the movement is in depth rather than across the screen with business at the sides of the frame to create a tunnel effect. Lang a former architecture student must have also been delighted at all the breathtaking Indian buildings and atmospheric studio recreations he gets to play with here. As usual with Lang his characters appear trapped within the spaces they inhabit with claustrophobic shot compositions and now even colour schemes that make people seem one with the background. There's a great and rather comical shot where the Maharajah is leaning against a pillar in which the shape and style of his outfit mean he looks like a pillar himself. The fact that most of these rooms are real 360degree spaces rather than backless sets also gives Lang a real advantage. Notice how in Debra Paget's lavish quarters in the gold birdcage scene even the windows look out onto a high wall. Lang creates an impression of a palace of endless passages and no exits. It's this slightly nightmarish vision which really drives the adventure along.With the exception of Debra Paget who had a handful of prominent Hollywood roles over the previous decade the cast is mainly made up of Europeans who will be unfamiliar to most in an Englishspeaking audience. Lead man Paul Hubschmid is not a very interesting actor but at least he underplays his performance  far preferable to awkward hamming. Ms Paget herself is not really exceptional either but she does prove herself to be a superlative and hypnotic dancer. The real standout actingwise however is Walter Reyer who portrays the Maharajah as calmly authoritative with just a hint of madness.One final point  fans of the Indiana Jones movies may find themselves recognising a few sights and scenes that remind them of stuff from The Temple of Doom. While a lot of Temple of Doom's plot comes from an older Hollywood movie called Gunga Din 1939 Fritz Lang's Indian diptych seem to have given Spielberg's picture much of its spirit. This is a comic book vision at India barely realistic but filled with a sense of both fun and genuine menace. Forget about Lang's reputation as a dark and cynical purveyor of film noir. Although he never got the recognition he deserved at the time with his childlike sense of adventure and breathtaking imagery when given his creative freedom he could be the Steven Spielberg of his era.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was wary of purchasing Fantoma's 2Disc Set of Fritz Lang's Indian Epic after being somewhat let down by the 1921 Silent original coscripted by Lang himself and also its lessthanstellar reputation. For this reason when the second part of the saga turned up on Italian TV a couple of years ago I decided to check it out just the same so as to get an inkling of what to expect! I recall thinking it pretty kitschy and unworthy of Lang's enormous talent but Fantoma's sale through their website of their entire DVD catalog a few months back made it an irresistible acquisition! Well having now watched the entire saga with dialogue and in color as opposed to the rather static Silent version directed by Joe May  although hearing the Indiangarbed characters talking in German took some getting used to I was pleasantly surprised by how genuinely engaging and sheerly enjoyable it all was! Though it was sold as an epic production to the point of concluding ESCHNAPUR with the promise that Part II would feature greater thrills and even more spectacle at a time when such films were all the rage the saga was actually a pretty modest undertaking by eclectic and prolific German producer Artur Brauner. Despite the two films' exotic handsome look not least in the provocative dances of Debra Paget the budgetary constraints were painfully obvious in the special effects department especially the hilarious appearance of a 'ropey' cobra which is intended to 'test' the scantilyclad Miss Paget's faithfulness to the Maharajah!! All in all even if these films hardly constitute Lang's greatest work though he harbored an evident affection throughout his life for this particular tale which was originally conceived by his former wife Thea von Harbou they have great  and enduring  appeal for aficionados of oldfashioned seriallike adventure stories tinged with romance and mysticism.Even so while I don't subscribe to that school of thought myself there are some film critics Tom Gunning Jean Douchet and Pierre Rissient among them who think very highly of Lang's Indian diptych  the first considering it one of Lang's towering achievements and the last two numbering it among the ten greatest films of all time!!".

They travel together to Chandra's palace and Berger saves Seetha from the attack of a tiger in the road through the woods. The widower Chandra intends to get married with Seetha and thanks Berger for his heroic attitude giving an emerald ring to him to express his gratitude and friendship.

Chandra sends his men to hunt the couple while Berger's sister and her husband and Berger's partner Walter Rhode Claus Holm arrive to the palace to begin the construction of the buildings. However Chandra changes his mind and orders the engineer to develop a project of a monumental tomb to his lost love. In the meantime Berger and Seetha's horses die they run out of water and they are surprised by a sand storm.Der Tiger von Eschnapur is the first of the two Fritz Lang's Indian Epics of the director Fritz Lang in his return to German. The exotic and mystic romance has many action scenes and engaging subplots of betrayals with the gorgeous Debra Paget performing magnificent choreography with her dance.

It was the sort of film that was like a throwback to the 1940sto the films of Universal Studios. In many ways it was a bit like The Cobra Woman Thief of Bagdad or a movie serialfull of action romance and escapism. On the other hand it certainly was not a great piece of artmore like a Bmovie with a slightly higher budget and a nice locale. Plus Miss Paget had one of the sexiest dance numbers I can recall having seen apart from Rita Hayworth's in Gilda. However to put it bluntly it was a decent film but not good enough to enable the director Fritz Lang to be able to mount a comeback to his former greatness. But with small bad touches onedimensional characters and some bad special effectssuch as the obviously stuffed tiger during the big climactic scene and the woodenlooking severed head it certainly isn't a great work of artmore just Saturday matine escapism and nothing more. But frankly sometimes that is all you need to have a bit of fun.".

In 1960 both movies were combined and edited down to a mere 94 minutes. The resultant hardtofollow pastiche was then released as Journey to the Lost City. I thoroughly enjoyed The Tiger of Eschnapur. Admittedly the plot is Boys Own Paper stuff but on its juvenile level it offers plenty of spectacular action  and typical Fritz Lang suspense  set against some truly magnificent backgrounds. And who could resist Debra Paget as she appears here so lovingly photographed and so exotically attired? The only drawback is that the movie ends like the chapter of a serial and you are then forced to view The Indian Tomb to see how it all comes out. I found this sequel a little tiresome but many of my colleagues disagreed. To them this chapter was even more exciting and colorful than The Tiger of Eschnapur. I would hazard that how you react depends to some extent on the interval of time involved. I watched the sequel straightaway. My colleagues viewed it at intervals varying from a week to six months. Both films are now available on excellent DVDs.".

	schema:headline " Brilliant Sets Do Not Make a Brilliant Movie";
	schema:reviewBody "Fritz Lang's two part Indian Epic made up of the films The Tiger of Bengal and The Tomb of Love is to put it lightly a cinematic enigma. While Lang is no stranger to both pulp fiction and long films he oddly fails at both in this twopart travesty.Watching a film like Lang's Metropolis or his five hour epic of Die Nibelungen is a magical experience. The films flow at such a brilliant pace drawing in the viewer and creating a world of high drama and excitement amidst some of the most lavish and beautiful sets of the silent era. Yet somehow this magic is lost in his Indian Epic as the nearly three and a half hours that comprise both films drags for what seems like an eternity. While the first film The Tiger of Bengal starts off like a pleasing pulpy adventure story it soon peters off nearly halfway through setting the pace for what will be the rest of the first and the entire second film.Production was evidently a very expensive and impressive one complete with jewelstudded clothing immense and desolate dungeons and large and grandiose palaces stocked with every little intricate detailed imagined yet these impressive settings are hardly utilized in to making this the films it could have been for they remain nothing more than eyecandy in what is ultimately a theatrical play of the most dire sort. Stilted bland dialogue and scenes that drag and repeat play out almost cyclically Where is the princess? She's over there. Where is the foreigner? He's over there. What should we do? We should do this... and so on ad nauseam until nearly three and a half hours of a film still unrealized is completed.Even in some of Lang's previous minor failings he never achieved such a monotony as this.

After reading this was a remake of the Indian Epic that he originally produced earlier on in his career I was so excited to finally sit and view what I imagined would be a wonderful adventure.

	onyx:emotionText "Fritz Lang's two part Indian Epic made up of the films The Tiger of Bengal and The Tomb of Love is to put it lightly a cinematic enigma. While Lang is no stranger to both pulp fiction and long films he oddly fails at both in this twopart travesty.Watching a film like Lang's Metropolis or his five hour epic of Die Nibelungen is a magical experience. The films flow at such a brilliant pace drawing in the viewer and creating a world of high drama and excitement amidst some of the most lavish and beautiful sets of the silent era. Yet somehow this magic is lost in his Indian Epic as the nearly three and a half hours that comprise both films drags for what seems like an eternity. While the first film The Tiger of Bengal starts off like a pleasing pulpy adventure story it soon peters off nearly halfway through setting the pace for what will be the rest of the first and the entire second film.Production was evidently a very expensive and impressive one complete with jewelstudded clothing immense and desolate dungeons and large and grandiose palaces stocked with every little intricate detailed imagined yet these impressive settings are hardly utilized in to making this the films it could have been for they remain nothing more than eyecandy in what is ultimately a theatrical play of the most dire sort. Stilted bland dialogue and scenes that drag and repeat play out almost cyclically Where is the princess? She's over there. Where is the foreigner? He's over there. What should we do? We should do this... and so on ad nauseam until nearly three and a half hours of a film still unrealized is completed.Even in some of Lang's previous minor failings he never achieved such a monotony as this.

Well he had to adapt to the American Motion Picture Industry then his Art would be stemmed obstructed.The pity is Fritz Lang never topped himself after his marvelous silent works of the 20s. Metropolis is overrated but despite all the wooden sentimentalism in it we have insights of the German director at his best. With M he gave us the best out of the silent era but he never again reach the magic of his previous work. While it took twenty years to Hitchcock to come to the masterpieces he shot in the 50s Lang did not improve his visual mastering.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie should have been so much better. Lang is capable of a lot more. Unfortunately it did not live up to its creator's abilities. The writing was stilted and awkward with unrealistic dialogue. Whenever anyone spoke they basically said whatever they needed to advance the plot regardless if it was believable. There were a few lines about the gods thrown in to remind us we are in India. There is absolutely no subtlety here at all.The worst part about this film was the acting. Not one of these actors was believable or natural. I realize acting styles have changed over the years. The prince with his bad Indian makeup and phony looking jewelry had two moods bland or outraged. He marched in front of cages of tigers for no apparent reason other than that he's a prince who controls everything and because this movie has tiger in the title. Some of the other actors were caricatures of what they thought Indians should be like. Dark brown makeup with blue eyes and Nordic features? What was Lang thinking? Then we've got the two leads the dancer and the German architect. Paget the dancer was beautiful to look at but that's where her talent ended. If she's sad she's sitting there with a huge frown. If scared an exaggerated wide eyed look. It's ridiculous how badly she acts in this movie. Reminds me of acting from the 20s. At least then they had no dialogue to work with so movement was everything. Another thing that is bound to make the acting awful is that the lead actress is not speaking the same language as her paramour... Literally. This makes it impossible for them to relate to and respond to one another. Her lines were overdubbed in German while she spoke them in English in the scene. Her lover spoke German throughout. I'm not sure why Lang chose to cast someone who didn't speak German. Finally we come to the love interest for our dancer. He's not only creepy but he's got zero charisma and is unpleasant to watch. At times he's yelling his lines just to inject some emotion into his scenes. It's the work of an amateur. Again no subtlety. They all are behaving like a bunch of people who have never acted a day in their lives. Considering they are all experienced i can only lay these errors at the director's feet. Even the costumes and props looked unrealistic and poorly constructed. Perhaps Lang was past it or maybe he just wasn't able to change with the times. Either way it made for a very poorly constructed picture.".

	schema:reviewBody "Fritz Lang is one of those directors who managed the transition from silent film to sound film even if most people will probably argue that his best works come from the days when there was still intertitles in films to tell us what the characters were saying. Der Tiger von Eschnapur is one of the last films of Lang and he was already in his late 60s when he made this one and it's actually a remake of a film that Lang already made considerably earlier in his career. This is also why Thea von Harbou a couple years dead already by 1959 is listed as the writer. She also worked on the script of the original blackandwhite films. This one here is in color and the first 100 minutes from a duology that continues with Das indische Grabmal another 1959 film. The cliffhanger ending also indicates this.I personally did not enjoy the watch too much. It starts off fairly solid the characters are interesting but sadly it does not stay this way for the entire film. I quickly lost interest in the story of an architect falling in love with a dancer a woman that the local Maharajah also has an interest in. It's a tale about love power and deceit but it's nowhere near as good as it could have been. Looks like Lang already had his best days behind him and I cannot say I have a whole lot of interest in seeing the sequel although I probably will soon and I hope it's actually 100 minutes that are improved to the 100 minutes we have here. As for the 1959 version of The Tiger of Eschnapur I do not recommend watching it unless you're a Lang completionist. It's not a failure but also it's not a good film. Thumbs down. Oh yeah and a quick note about the cast. Do not be fooled by the characters in the film and the dark skin makeup because pretty much the entire cast is German. of course the clean speaking with no accents in this film also gives them away.".

	schema:reviewBody "Dolph Lundgren made his directorial debut with the Defender. A great little action movie that was really what his fans could have hoped for a triumphant return to his best. Now his second film shows that it wasn't merely a flash in the pan or a fluke. Yes people Dolph Lundgren never considered much kop in the acting department has now proved he is a more than capable director even suggesting that his new role deserves him a shot at the big time.The Mechanik's plot is thus Nick Cherenko Lundgren is an exspetznaz parachutist who served in Afghanistan. He now lives in his homeland of Russia with his wife and son working as a mechanic hence the title.. During a drug deal involving Russian mobster Sasha his wife and child are killed in the crossfire Sasha gunning down Nick's wife. Nick later hunts down Sasha and his men wiping them out and leaving Sasha assumed dead with a nasty bullet hole in the face. Seven years later Nick is working in LA illegally as a mechanic when he is approached to do a job. He is to retrieve the kidnapped Julia daughter of a wealthy businesswoman. Nick refuse until he discovers who kidnapped her Sasha. He travels to Russia and meets with Burton Ben Cross who will supply him with weapon's and assembles a team of mercs to help Nick get back Julia while at the same time finishing what he did 7 years previously killing Sasha. The plot is simple yet writer Bryan Hill allows more focus on characters clearly in the style of directors like Michael Mann. There are great character moments here and some superbly played out scenes in amongst the action scenes focusing on character. it's the sort of quiet moments never seen in DTV action films including a great dinner sequence where Nick and his men relax and unwind a kind of calm before the storm. The dialogue is also engaging.The film looks fantastic. The washed out colours make this reminiscent of brutal 70's revenge flicks like Death Wish and Get Carter. Cinematographer Ross Clarkson has made sure this looks far beyond it's small budget. Similarly Dolph's visual style has developed even more since his exciting debut. He shoots the film with conviction stylistically picking little apples from different orchards not simply as many directors do picking from merely John Woo's orchard that guy has no apples left on his trees I can tell you but Dolph gives reference to a varied group from Woo to Mann to Peter Yates and to modern indie directors like the Bourne films' Doug Liman and Peter Greengrass.The action is excellent a step up from the Defender. Again it's plentiful yet the action is different in style. This time as opposed to a siege movie this is an ass battering revenge flick so the action consists of bloody and violent shootouts where like so rarely in his previous movies every bullet has it's own bullet hole. Windows shatter splinters fly chest cavities burst open and things blow up. The fights scenes are brilliantly paced and use martial arts realistically. it's all done in one or two moves. No flashy Van Damme kicks it's arm breaks shoulder tosses and neck breaks. Also the film has some vehicular chases that impress too.The music from Elia Cmirel is atmospheric and delightfully reminiscent of his work in Ronin simple low key and effective. He doesn't go through the motions here he creates a score as if proud to be scoring this movie. This is possibly Dolph's best score particularly in the context of it being a genuinely good little film. In terms of the sound mix this like Defender is pure class. The use of sound is excellent while the general editing of the film is slick well paced and never goes overboard.The cast are good. Dolph Lundgren gives probably his best performance. He doesn't overstretch himself as many action stars have been prone too yet he raises his level of performance and does well. Olivia Lee is a rising up and comer who does well as Julia. The remainder of the cast are also excellent. Real class is also added by Ben Cross. He is given a good role as drunk Brit Burton. Burton is in love with a hooker who helps get them into Sasha's club to retrieve Julia. Cross is excellent in a role more significant than I thought it would be. He is comical and shows conviction in the dramatic scenes and his presence is a real bonus to an already quality piece.This film really does show the future to be bright for Lundgren should he carry on directing his own movies. His cash cow power allows him to get his way on how he wants to film his action meaning every last penny is spent and time is taken for more elaborate setups. Lundgren shows himself worthy of another shot at the big time in a film Van Damme and Seagal could only dream of having on their CV's. In a generally great year for films Dolph has produced that rare thing a decent well made DTV movie. Not only that but he has done it twice! This is Lundgren's best by some way! ".

He doesn't overstretch himself as many action stars have been prone too yet he raises his level of performance and does well. Olivia Lee is a rising up and comer who does well as Julia. The remainder of the cast are also excellent. Real class is also added by Ben Cross. He is given a good role as drunk Brit Burton. Burton is in love with a hooker who helps get them into Sasha's club to retrieve Julia. Cross is excellent in a role more significant than I thought it would be. He is comical and shows conviction in the dramatic scenes and his presence is a real bonus to an already quality piece.This film really does show the future to be bright for Lundgren should he carry on directing his own movies. His cash cow power allows him to get his way on how he wants to film his action meaning every last penny is spent and time is taken for more elaborate setups. Lundgren shows himself worthy of another shot at the big time in a film Van Damme and Seagal could only dream of having on their CV's. In a generally great year for films Dolph has produced that rare thing a decent well made DTV movie. Not only that but he has done it twice! This is Lundgren's best by some way! ";

It is really a surprise because it has some great little moments in it. Also it packs a punch in the more violent scenes and doesn't hold back and I mean I was really wincing in some moments.It didn't occur to me until the film opened and credited Lundgren himself as director. He did a fantastic job and his portrayal of violence really hits home like my favorite director Mr Paul Verhoeven. Lundgren I know is someone critics always mock like Schwarzenegger but Lundgren really shows talent as a director. I will have to watch his other film the Defender. In regards to the acting Lundgren also did a good job. Ben Cross is a good actor too and he does well in this film.This is overall a quality piece well worth watching.".

But to my surprise during a DTV rampage of these guys The Hard Corps Shadow Man and also the Cutter too Dolph's film the Mechanik was by a long long way the best of the bunch. I've fallen by the wayside a little in recent years and haven't kept up to much with the action boys but when your in the mood your in the mood. Anyway The Mechanik was fantastic. It's a simple storyline and a simply delivered film but it promises something and delivers. The result is a violent dirty and damn fun action movie. It's a great little regression to 70's and 80's action films. I also understand it was shot on a fraciton of the budgets of Chuck's Stevens and Jean Claudes movies and still manages to look the most expensive too.Lundgren too gives a solid performance and looks in great shape. In fact dare I say it the other guys like either old tired or overweight all three in Seagal's case. Lundgren looks fresh and in great shape. Ben Cross was really good. That guy should have been a bigger star a really good actor if anyone's seen his earlier work.On the negative side the girl in the movie seems little more than a pointless inclusion to aid the bloodshed and the bad guy is a little too hey look at me I'm the bad guy! After all though it's expected from this sort of film so it's not a big problem. I also wasn't too sure what was with all the dissolves either but on the most part this film is directed with assurance and a great sense of pace and of course directed by Dolph himself! This film really acts as a showcase for Dolph Lundgren. It's the Dolph show and it's a good show. It brought back fond memories of cool Peckinpah movies. Good work Dolph!".

There were missed opportunities to develop these characters especially when they stayed overnight with the family in the countryside. by the way Bulgaria seems like it is a beautiful country.

A good guy a bad guy shooting close combat blood and broken bones and a huge death count at the happy end. The story is very simple. Nikolai Cherenko Lundgren is a former spetznas Russian special forces who after his family was killed by a mafia boss went to the US to work as a mechanic. After 7 years a lady comes to him and wants to hire him to save here daughter which was kidnapped by the same gangster. Nick finally takes the job but of course it is not about the money but all about vengeance. He gets a backup team and from here on the story and the end is quite predictable. But it is not the story that makes this movie a must see. It is the details and mostly it is what the movie leaves out. You won't find long dialogs about morale and ethics heroism in terms of leave me behind I'm just slowing you down! and then the obligatory never I'd rather die!. There are also no long man on man fights. What do you do if a black belt attacks you? Well if it would bee any other movie such a situation would develop into a 1 hour bare hands fight. But not here. Take your gun and shoot him. It is that simple. A very similar situation the bad guy falls to the ground and loses his gun. Wait till he gets up? Continue the fight without weapons? Bah! You are standing he is on the ground you've got a gun he hasn't. Shoot him! Not very honorable but very fast and effective. After all he is there to get the girl not to win a karate tournament. At the end The Mechanik is not your typical action flick. The hero is not as heroic as you would perhaps like to have him. He is not doing all this because it is the right thing but because he wants to see blood. The Mechanik is a great action movie just like in the good old times when action didn't try to bee anything else but simply action. It is simple violent direct and pure as the best Russian vodka!

Rescuing a girl in the process is just secondary to satisfying his blood thirsty rage. I must admit that I enjoy a certain style of actioner mainly the type in which the action is big brutal and solid. Of course I was mildly surprised by Lundgren's last movie The Defender due to it's good action and solid story however I generally don't rent straight to video movies because I got burned way too many times however when this came on TV I saw it and was VERY impressed with it. The Russian Specialist is a throw back to the Charles Bronson days when the heroes dispensed ruthless justice and walked away with an ending that was happy for everyone but them. Certainly there are some minor flaws and the main one being that Lundgren has softened his accent so much he no longer can pull off that great of a Russian accent. Also Ben Cross Best known from Chariots Of Fire is somewhat out of place in this movie but i'd be lying if I didn't enjoy this brutal throwback to the classic revenge actioner. So this one is worthy of a rental. In fact I may go onto Amazon and see if I can find a cheap DVD of this to add in my collection. The last Lundgren movie I bought on DVD was Bridge Of Dragons   out of 4Good".

This is a story about crime that's sure but the movie is very objective with quite OK script and even not that bad acting.

	schema:reviewBody "Dolph's first directing effort The Defender was a nice little action piece. Granted the movie was low budget but there was enough enthusiasm and excitement to make it worthwhile.The Russian Specialistaka The Mechanik as it should be called is a distinct step UP for Dolph. His direction is incredibly assured for someone who's only directed one other movie.I won't go into story specifics here because everybody already knows what this about. However I will go into the production and performances.Dolph has changed as an actor. He's matured he's confident in his skin. That is half the battle and he wins bigtime.Ben Cross is the comedy reliefdramatic Brit. He's one of the film's better assets.The rest of the performers are more than adequate. The villains in particular are slimy and nasty. It's a good thing they're slaughtered in such a brutal fashion!!! The script for this film while hardly original is pretty good for low budget fare like this. It pushes all the right buttons at the right time. The dialog is also quite good.Dolph the director is in very good form. His style is loose and fluid. Think Tony Scott meets John Woo and you're on the right track.The score by Elia Cmiral is haunting when it needs to be and tense when the crap hits the fan. Which brings us to the action set pieces.Although they're not numerous the action scenes are well done and VIOLENT! Dolph pulls no punches with this flick. The deaths come fast hard and furious! Overall this little film is quite good. I eagerly await the next Dolph film. To those who have not checked out this film and The Defender I recommend you do so.".

You know where the 'hero' gets wronged and has go after the bad guys regardless of the fact that he is one man and he is going up against a well connected organisation. But this movie was very different as the hero uses his brain as much as his brawn accepts help albeit a bit reluctantly and has a second reason for his quest.The direction is very tight and classy  I commend Dolph as I can't even remember the name of the last film I saw him in  I just seem to remember that it was fairly awful.The characters build well in this film  not just a bunch of bullet fodder and although there are quite a few deaths you actually feel for some of the characters.There is a lot of violence  the fighting scenes are well orchestrated and look very realistic it's definitely not one for the kids and being a fan of gore and splatter effects I was pleasantly surprised to see that when people got shot there was a real bloody impact in each scene that didn't seem at all over the top like some squibs end up looking.The acting was superb from all involved although I do think that one scene where the rescued girl has a grizzle was a tad hammy but it lasted seconds and didn't spoil my enjoyment or the flow of the film.For what it was I would say this is one of the best films of its genre I have seen.If when you think of Dolph Lundgren you only get a picture of him saying I must break you from the Rocky film think again and check this movie out.You'll be glad you did !".

Not only did Lundgren pen the story but he also staged the action and he's a rather capable action director based on the opening sequence that establishes him as a widower who loses both his son and wife in a deadly gunfight. The Russian Specialist is nothing but a Bmovie with a menacing villain and surprise of surprisesBen Cross playing a sympathetic good guy for a change. This is Dolph's second picture to helm and he does a good job keeping everybody straight and the action coherent. A tough former tank commander during the Russian invasion of Afghanistan Nick Cherenko wipes out most of the thugs that gunned down his wife and son and relocates illegally to Los Angeles. Seven years of quiet peaceful living elapse and then he finds himself put in the awful position of having to return to mother Russia to rescue a kidnapped girl of a wealthy family from the slimy likes of the man who destroyed his family. Russian mobster Aleksandr 'Sasha' Popov Ivan Petrushinov of The Bride with the Most Beautiful Eyes has abducted Julia Abramoff newcomer Olivia Lee and demands 5million ransom. The catch is that the kidnapper is the same dastard that killed his family. Reluctantly Nick leaves his job as a mechanic in L.A. to take care of this predicament. This lowbudget but actionpacked straighttovideo release is nothing sensational but it accomplishes what it sets out to do provide enough thrills and chills during its spare 94 minute running time to keep you engaged and cheering for the heroes.".

THE MECHANIK has a barebones story  fairly big on the clichs I might add though thankfully not including a tired refound love angle  but it's put together with a consistent style you'll have to dig the contemporary look  editing though and the cinematography looks fine using faded stained colors with hard contrasts. It's all about Dolph being on a mission again and getting revenge again while at it. But it's executed in a proper fashion. What really made the film pay off was it promising a decent shoutout climax and even coming through on that promise. Western fans might even dig this film. Lots of violent kills and bloodshed and it all looks pretty damn good  realistic on screen. A job well done Dolph. I applaud you and I will be checking out MISSIONARY MAN next and I hope it'll score as high on the Dolphscale. Either way nice to see you're doing well!".

After just watching a depressing BW French movie called '13' I was in the mood for a good old action fest. I am happy to report that Dolph didn't disappoint. I found the plot to be fairly well structured not perfect but it has engaging characters and the straight forward revenge plot suited the mood I was in.After the fight scenes and chases the action ends with a shootout reminiscent of the OK Coral. This encounter is set up quite well and the final gunshot is very creative whilst giving some satisfactory closure to the viewer. The scene is very effectively shot rather like the bad guy actually! I understand that the film is released as either The Russian Specialist or The Mechanik. Incidentally the term Mechanic used to be a slang reference for a hit man although you don't hear it much now.Make no mistake this movie isn't Oscar worthy but I do appreciate it for what it is. I found this a better viewing experience than other DTV fodder being put out by faded 80's action stars. I look forward to his next project and in the mean time I will re visit some of his earlier work such as Man of War and Red Scorpion.".

It feels like a western.Unfortunately  Lundgren's lack of experience as director doesn't help the movie . The movie is too often too dark. And I mean DARK . You can barely see anything. It makes the movie visually ugly. Also Lundgren fails to make an emotional connection between his character an audience. The flashy flashbacks aren't too subtle and fail. He should work on pacing  because the first half of movie is rather boring. When it comes to action scenes Dolph decided for quick cut montage . It's badly done . Also the shootouts look rather poor. The final shootout in the village is exception  because it was done in more old school style. Old school rules. The writers could also expand the other members on Lundgren's team. If we are supposed to care about them  w should get to know them. This is not the case here. Only Lundgren and Brit are introduced.

	schema:reviewBody "Just getting back from seeing 8 below i am completely blown away by  several elements.  Firstly right away you get glimpes of STUNNING scenery that continue  throughout the whole film. Beautiful artic landscapes frame the main  story line and on the big screen it really takes your breath away.  The movie also is really able to give anyone an idea of what its like  to be in the artic and really gave a clear picture of what being an  explorer was like. This added to the appeal of the movie because its  not something most of us get to experience.   Although the acting has been in some cases been criticized I believe  the actors fulfilled their purpose within the movie. They were able to  play their roles without distracting from the dogs which of course  is the most important part. Paul Walker clearly comes across as a  strong animal lover and displays this well. He becomes relatable to  any animal lovers who will utimatly love this movie. As for the  others the fulfilled their jobs which is what matters. The character  of Cooper gave great comic relief and Katie acted out the  predicable love story line well.  But of course the most important aspect of this movie was the dogs. I  can hardly even begin to describe what a wonderful job they did. The  tricks preformed as a dog lover and trainer were some with great  difficulty. Ultimately the way the dogs interact with each other and  are so compassionate you really connect with them. The only way to  really experience this is to GO. the movie is AMAZING and a wonderful  family film. Although a part or two may be slightly scary its still an  amazing picture for ALL to enjoy it completely blew all of us a way.".

The movie also is really able to give anyone an idea of what its like  to be in the artic and really gave a clear picture of what being an  explorer was like. This added to the appeal of the movie because its  not something most of us get to experience.   Although the acting has been in some cases been criticized I believe  the actors fulfilled their purpose within the movie. They were able to  play their roles without distracting from the dogs which of course  is the most important part. Paul Walker clearly comes across as a  strong animal lover and displays this well. He becomes relatable to  any animal lovers who will utimatly love this movie. As for the  others the fulfilled their jobs which is what matters. The character  of Cooper gave great comic relief and Katie acted out the  predicable love story line well.  But of course the most important aspect of this movie was the dogs. I  can hardly even begin to describe what a wonderful job they did. The  tricks preformed as a dog lover and trainer were some with great  difficulty. Ultimately the way the dogs interact with each other and  are so compassionate you really connect with them. The only way to  really experience this is to GO. the movie is AMAZING and a wonderful  family film. Although a part or two may be slightly scary its still an  amazing picture for ALL to enjoy it completely blew all of us a way.";

The schlock they try to pass off as good films these days is ridiculous. The only upside I could see was the director Frank Marshall. He has produced some of my favorite films. Let's see what he can do behind the camera.Pleasantly surprised I think is a good term for my reaction. Although the film was about 20 minutes too long it did sustain the action and drama all the way through. I knew the basics of the story a team at a base in Antartica must evacuate and cannot take the sled dogs with them. Winter sets in and the dogs are forced to survive on their own in the brutal cold for months.The dogs are very entertaining and their scenes with the science team are warm and amusing even thrilling. Where I expected the film to fail was after the humans and dogs separate. Amazingly though this is where the Mr. Marshall seemed to kick it into gear. Watching the opposing scenes unfold of the guiltridden Paul Walker frantically trying to find anyone to help him get back down to the Antartic interlaced with the Huskies who are struggling through the rough winter scrounging for food and defending each other from predators was very emotional.While the film is a grade A survival pic I hadn't expected it to be such a tearjerker. Be forewarned. Although the human performances Paul Walker Bruce Greenwood and the necessary romantic lead Moon Bloodgood were mediocre at best the canine actors really do steal your heart.No Oscar material here but as far as family films go these days this one is above par.

Very incredible and heartwarming story. There is a monument to the dog team in the form of statues at the base of the Tokyo Tower to honor them.

They actually deserve the highest of all star ratings but I can not even think to give this movie ten stars for all the rest of it. The rest of it deserves less than zero! This movie pulled ripped and shredded all my heart strings and left me absolutely drained. The only true heart through this movie was from the dogs and Jerry. No one else cared enough or tried enough which was made abundantly clear from the very start when they first chose to take the equipment out before the dogs thus beginning the whole tragedy in motion. This mentality throughout the film made Jerry's declaration to his girlfriend near the end that he owed her for always understanding how important getting back to the dogs was very confusing to me. It seemed that she always had this sly smile on her face even in the beginning when giving condolences over having to leave the dogs she always seemed to be having a happy glow on her... really disconcerting. Just felt like So sorry so sad but must move on now! If the intention of her character was to be understanding throughout the movie her part was sorely lacking. At best she came off as patronizing and just barely patient through his worrying so much over something that she made very clear should be let go of even though the dogs were at that very moment starving lost lonely and dying. It wasn't a year later... or even six months yet... but this was her attitude at the beginning until they finally decided to go back. Did she not get that you don't get past something WHILE IT IS STILL HAPPENING???!!! Only after you understand that it is over truly done with do you even start to think about the journey of learning to live with it. But out of sight out of mind right?!!! So that scene and the fact that no one ever actually apologized or made some motion that they were responsible with their lack of previous action made me somewhat sick at heart. Even if they couldn't go back through winter due to the impossible nature of weather or what have you they could have  should have!  been a much better support system or even any kind of support system at all!!! to Jerry. Even when the doc finally gave in way later it felt like he was inching his way to it as if through guilt alone begrudgingly doing Jerry and the dogs a FAVOR instead of finally understanding that HE OWED THEM ALL and was doing what he should have done from the start saving them all  as he should have Dewey and Old Jack  as they had saved him time and again. The fact is that even if this movie wasn't based on a true story it would irk me and make my heart ache... but the sad truth is that not only was there one dog Old Jack that died through starvation alone and immobile in the snow... but in real life there were actually SEVEN  and SIX more unaccounted for!!! In real life there were 15 dogs and only two known to have survived. So I don't even get the comfort of Well at least this was just a movie. Needless to say this is the movie that finally outdid the one other movie that ripped my heart to shreds as a little girl  Old Yeller  but at least that one was truly just a movie. So yes this movie is a spectacular viewing the dogs are beyond awesome Paul Walker is fantastic a true hero An avid dog lover in real life as well! with a considerable joyous relief in the end for the dogs that did survive... but I just can't get past the absolutely avoidable TRAGIC deaths of those other loyal loving trusting dogs... betrayed... and the fact that the ones that did survive were no doubt scarred for life. So many are heralding this movie as a human bonding growing thing. While I do say that it is a lesson of the true love and loyalty that dog holds for man and that man should hold for dog... for the rest of it it's a painful reminder of all the dogs left behind ex The heroic Vietnam war dogs the K9 Katrina victims the no longer interested family leaving their pup in the woods an acknowledgment of the ungratefulness and insufferable selfishness of so many out there and the heartbreaking destruction that too often comes from it. View this movie so to let the haunting images fill you and then never allow such a horrific thing to happen again. NO ANIMAL LEFT BEHIND! These dogs story needs to be told so that their deaths are never ever in vain and such tragedy is never allowed to ever happen again. For those that are looking to buy the original movie that this one is based on you can often find used copies of the video at Amazon.com. If it's not there when you look keep checking  under both of its titles Antarctica and Nankyoku monogatari meaning The South Pole Story... It goes in and out. It's also been seen in ebay.".

So many are heralding this movie as a human bonding growing thing. While I do say that it is a lesson of the true love and loyalty that dog holds for man and that man should hold for dog... for the rest of it it's a painful reminder of all the dogs left behind ex The heroic Vietnam war dogs the K9 Katrina victims the no longer interested family leaving their pup in the woods an acknowledgment of the ungratefulness and insufferable selfishness of so many out there and the heartbreaking destruction that too often comes from it. View this movie so to let the haunting images fill you and then never allow such a horrific thing to happen again. NO ANIMAL LEFT BEHIND! These dogs story needs to be told so that their deaths are never ever in vain and such tragedy is never allowed to ever happen again. For those that are looking to buy the original movie that this one is based on you can often find used copies of the video at Amazon.com. If it's not there when you look keep checking  under both of its titles Antarctica and Nankyoku monogatari meaning The South Pole Story... It goes in and out. It's also been seen in ebay.";

If you love animals this movie was very enjoyable.The story is about a guide in Antarctica who has to bring a scientist on an expedition by means of a dog sled team.Things get a bit hairy and the weather does not cooperate and eventually the dogs are left behind. The guide reluctantly leaves the dogs with a promise to return. The return becomes nearly impossible because of extreme weather conditions.You can't help but fall in love with these beautiful dogs. Throughout the movie they fight for their survival while exhibiting team work and compassion for each other.It is almost impossible to hold back the tears while watching the way these wonderful dogs care for one another. The rest of the plot is almost unimportant other than the fact that the owner of the sled dogs obviously has tremendous love for his loyal and hard working dogs. The film sort of splits into two separate story lines the dogs alone in Antarctica fighting to surviveand the main human character trying to get back to save the dogs.I would strongly recommend this movie. If your kids are under six I might use cautionas one scene is pretty scary. It's a fun little story that might help a child develop some compassion for animals.".

I know that makes me sound pretty crazy but when you see this movie you know it's true. This is an awesome movie for all ages.

	schema:reviewBody "Eight Below was the inflight movie on my way to Aruba. I don't know about you but starting off a week long vacation on a beautiful sunny island by sobbing myself into near hysterics is not the way I like to begin any vacation. You may think I'm exaggerating in regards to the movie or that I'm a bit of a sap but personally I could care less. This film traumatized me for a good day and a half and all I could think about afterward was the movie and all the things that made me enjoy it so. This is one of those films that will destroy most kids who see it and will linger in their memories as the one film that left them huddled in a corner with wide eyes. It's not as sadistic as say The Velveteen Rabbit Bambi or Watership Down but it comes close.This movie is basically the Munich of animals in peril movies.In all honesty I just wrote that last bit because it made me laugh but believe me it's not too far off the mark as Munich traumatized me as well... I'm not sure exactly why but I was near tears throughout the entire goddamn movie even at the beginning when the dogs were just being introduced. I absolutely love dogs and if you like them in any way shape or form you're going to love these little guys. Anytime they were on screen I could feel the dam behind my eyes bulging a little bit especially after they were left to fend for themselves. By the end of the film I was sobbing into my hands. I don't feel too bad admitting it because the couple next to me were both crying as well.I was actually very surprised by Paul Walker who I have bashed pretty regularly since I first saw him in The Fast and the Furious. I think he has made up for his past sins with this film. He was a very likable and believable lead as Jerry the owner and friend of the dogs who he was forced to leave behind.Going back to the dogs whoever trained these guys in real life is damn talented. Off the top of my head I can't think of a better performance by animals in any other movie and the things the dogs do in terms of expression and the fact that they carry the movie with no other humans around is impressive. The movie really grabs you because of them and even when they're not on screen you can literally feel them. I'd be kidding you if I told you that all the dogs survive. When one goes that's when you'll be reaching for the tissues or the tshirt of the person next to you.That's not to say that the film itself is perfect. It feels sort of formulaic in that Disney movie kind of way. I wasn't crazy about some of the plot setups in the film which felt kind of contrived and there just to satiate the kiddies. Some of the acting was a little weak and Jason Biggs character was almost intolerable as the comic relief. Anymore complaints about the film would just be an excuse to nitpick though as the good far outweighs the bad.After watching the film I had some time to think about it and I think I realized what it was that touched me so deeply. See the movie is a tribute to these animals and recognizes the loyalty and spirit that they possess. I've always felt that dogs were better than us in that way and this film was made by people who see this as well and appreciate the fact. Underneath the kidfriendly surface is a very touching and moving story about this very thing.So yeah I cried like a baby. Make fun of me if you want but I'm not ashamed to admit it. Chances are you will too. Strongly recommended.RATING  out of .NOTE Just some things I have to mention There's one scare in this movie and it's a big one. Sensitive kiddies might get seriously freaked out by it. Also if you can't handle the sight or even the thought of a dog in trouble you may want to seriously consider whether you want to watch this film or not. It's rough viewing and I'm really serious about it. This movie was inspired by true events and by a Japanese film called Nankyoku Monogatari Antartica which I hear is even better but not currently available on DVD.".

He goes against his wish but only if someone agrees to rescue his dogs after it. When he is back in U.S.A. the mission to rescue his dogs is canceled. Now the poor dogs will need to survive by their own in the cold Artic winter the worst and most evil winter of the world.''Eight Below'' is one of the cutest Disney's movies I watched in these last years. Not only the fluffy dogs but also the love of the dog trainer for them is very touching. Of course there are things they used in the film that I hardly imagine dogs doing  like their strategy to take the birds or to eat the whale...honestlyI have sincere doubts about the dogs planning such a complex attack for themselves..but since I am not a dog trainer or scientist I will not talk about these points. The fact that this movie was based on a Japanese expedition in 1958 is another surprise since we think about the real dogs in the Antarctica's cold. But I imagine that their real trainer and team were not so worried with them as the movie shows.Ps That Leopard Seal is scary!".

	schema:reviewBody "This remake of a Japanese classic Nankyoku Monogatari is very similar to comparing The Magnificent Seven to The Seven Samurai and that is being generous since the Mag 7 at least had some assets.The story of an Antarctic sled team abandoned by their humans is barely told. We actually see more of the boring humans than of the dogs. No one cares about these people. If you want to see an adventure involving the dogs don't bother. You don't see much. They have one little adventure with a big leopard seal.The Japanese movie took a few liberties but stuck to the facts. This movie is watered down even by Disney standards. You never really feel that the dogs are in any danger. They even look like they're sun bathing in California.I would like to say something good about this film but if you see Nankyoku Monogatari first you will be very disappointed in this cheap remake. It isn't a bad movie. It is dull plodding and the acting is not nearly as good as the Japanese classic.".

	schema:headline " An exciting and moving tale of survival";
	schema:reviewBody "This is an amazing story of survival for members of man's best friend. Set in 1993 at an Antarctic American research facility the story begins when the facilities expedition guide Paul Walker and his team of sled dogs is recruited by a scientist seeking out proof of a fallen meteorite. When the scientist is severely injured the team gets him back to the research station saving his life. A major storm blows in and that coupled with the human injury forces the researchers to evacuate quickly leaving the dogs behind due to lack of space on the plane. The rest of the movie is told in two parts. One being Walker's quest to find a way back to his dogs even though he knows he may not find them alive. He simply has to know. The dogs are his family and his love and he believes he owes them every effort to save them. The other part of the film follows the dogs across the frozen tundra in their quest to survive. They hunt play fend off an attack by a leopard seal and stick together in a remarkably structured group. But their situation is not without tragedy and if you take kids to the movie be prepared to explain to them what is happening.SPOILER WARNING...2 of the dogs do not survive. But it is not shown in a violent or gratuitous way. It's simply nature and I give the filmmakers credit for not making this a fantasy where all's well that ends well. They add a touch of realism and the movie is all the better for it. END SPOILER...For the record I brought my 6 year old daughter and 9 year old son and they LOVED the movie. It is and exciting tension filled adventure with an ending guaranteed to make the animal lover even grown men cry like a baby! If you cry easy I recommend you bring a BOX of tissue. Odds are it will be empty at the end. I highly recommend Eight Below and if you enjoy this type of movie I also recommend Disney's White Fang and Iron Will. All of them are visually stunning wilderness adventures.".

	schema:reviewBody "I just watched this movie last night. I had this DVD sitting for about a week since I knew I would cry during this movie. I was right I began crying about 13 of the way through and did not stop until the end.The worst for me was when they left the dogs chained so securely I thought surely they would starve or freeze on the chains. I wondered why didn't they just leave them inside the shelter instead of outside after all no one else was using it. Plus they could have left them food and water.When old Jack dies it broke my heart. Then the twin dog died when he fell and got hurt while chasing the lights and of course we think Maya is dead until the very end. The look on Maya's face all the time she is watching and waiting for Jerry you can tell. So faithful and loyal.I totally felt Jerry's frustration and desperation about the situation especially when he wakes up at the base to learn that Katie never flew back like she promised to. I don't know how I would have handled that I would be so angry with her even though it really was not her fault. And then Davis would not even help Jerry despite that these dogs saved him I wanted to scream! If it were me I would never have left the dogs I would have stayed and then someone would have to come back to the base since they would not leave a human being there for the winter apparently its okay to leave the animals behind.My only critique would be the seal that attacks the dogs and injures Maya that was very fake and you could tell it was CGI.Otherwise this movie reminds me of classic Disney like Old Yeller which also broke my heart. Also it had a bit of a Jack London Call of the Wild White Fang flavor to it except it is not set in the Klondike as those stories are. Being a dog lover and owning a Belgian Terveruen dog this film touched me deeply. I don't know if I will be able to watch it again it was too sad and I cried too much but it is a wonderful story. Highly recommended for animal lovers.".

But if that sounds like a familiar formula don't be fooled. This is quite unlike any other film you will see this year.The dogs of course steal the show. You probably need to be a doglover as I am to enjoy it properly  but I would stick my neck out and say that non doglovers should also see it. What is extraordinary is that as you watch the huskies interact with each other you actually understand what is going through their minds  and yet very rarely does the director slip over into the trap of 'humanising' their emotions. It would have been very easy to make this like an overly 'cute' kind of Disney movie but that trap is avoided. The film is perhaps a little too sentimental at times but not once do you expect the dogs to start talking! As for the humans Paul Walker is developing into a very good movie actor and Jason Biggs is always good fun on screen. The film is as much about human loss fears and emotions as it is about canine intelligence. It also tells you a thing or two about what life is like in a remote Antarctic outpost.I'd certainly recommend this movie to anyone searching out a couple of hours worth of entertainment. Oh and there is one moment in the film which is genuinely terrifying it'll make you jump out of your skin. I'll say no more about that except you'll know it when you see it You have been warned!".

The acting was great both on the part of the actors and the wonderfully trained dogs. Max was my favorite his eyes were awesome and he looked so intelligent in every scene. I thought the scenes were breathtaking especially since I didn't have to feel the extreme cold that the characters did. It gave me a new appreciation for what people have to put up with in extreme weather conditions. I have experienced snow but never 35 degrees or colder. This film shows exactly what it's like coping with extremely cold weather and to be honest since I am used to a tropical climate I don't think I could withstand that kind of cold. I give this one 10 stars because it has everything I look for in film great acting griping action amazing scenery and animals that are so well trained that you almost forget it's a movie! I am definitely going to buy this one to add to my collection.".

	schema:headline " A minor Murnau work but remains essential viewing";
	schema:reviewBody "As I've discovered after relatively recent viewings of 'Nosferatu 1922' 'The Last Laugh 1924' and 'Faust 1926' F.W. Murnau was one of the most exciting and influential European directors working during the 1920s. His contributions towards early German cinema are rivalled only by Fritz Lang and his ability to use lighting and shadows to create atmosphere are almost unparalleled. 'Herr Tartff  Tartuffe 1926' was apparently forced upon Murnau by contractual obligations with Universum Film UFA and you suspect that perhaps his heart wasn't quite in it but the end result nonetheless remains essential viewing as are all the director's films. The story is based upon Molire's successful 1664 play Tartuffe which explored the notion of hypocrisy particularly among selfproclaimed religious devotees. Murnau and screenwriter Carl Mayer stripped the story to its bare essentials removing any extraneous supporting characters and creating a closeknit triangle  Herr Orgon Frau Elmire and Tartff  around which the story revolves. Murnau also added an interesting framing device whereby the story of Tartuffe becomes a filmwithinafilm that a young actor shows to his grandfather to warn of his housekeeper's evil intentions.Interestingly I found the story's prologue  of the old man and his scheming housekeeper  to be a more engrossing story than the film that the characters are later shown. The conniving old woman Rosa Valetti with a devilish grin like a Cheshire Cat manages to convince her senile employer Hermann Picha that his grandson has dishonoured the family name by becoming an actor and so she sets herself up to inherit his entire fortune. When the sincere young actor Andr Mattoni finds out about this betrayal he plans an ingenious stratagem to outwit the malicious housekeeper and convince his grandfather of her evil. Murnau was obviously a great believer in the power of cinema and so it's no surprise that the young man chooses the cinematic medium with which to reveal the ultimate truth about hypocrites. The film by employing a few deceptively simple shots immediately translates the inner motivations driving each character the housekeeper greedy and malevolent kicks aside her master's slippers whereas the kind loving grandson delicately sets them back into place. Also notable is a moment during the narrative when the young actor turns to the camera and addresses the audience directly one of the earliest instances I've seen of a character breaking the fourth wall.The tale of Tartuffe himself is also worth watching for its technical accomplishments even if the story itself seems somewhat generic and uninteresting. Most astounding is Murnau's exceptional use of lighting assisted of course by cinematographer Karl Freund and in many cases entire rooms are seemingly being illuminated only by candlelight. This story concerns a happilymarried woman Frau Elmire Lil Dagover who is distraught to discover that her beloved husband Herr Orgon Werner Krauss has become obsessed with Tartff the great Emil Jannings a grotesque little man who speaks with divine importance and claims to be a Saint. However hard she tries Elmire cannot convince Orgon that he has been duped by a religious fraud so great is the cunning of Tartffe's deception. In the film Jannings predictably gives the finest performance playing the unsavoury title character with a mixture of sly arrogance and lustful repugnance. Nevertheless the role falls far short of the silent actor's greatest performances which include Mephisto of 'Faust 1926' and the hotel porter from 'The Last Laugh 1924.'".

His contributions towards early German cinema are rivalled only by Fritz Lang and his ability to use lighting and shadows to create atmosphere are almost unparalleled. 'Herr Tartff  Tartuffe 1926' was apparently forced upon Murnau by contractual obligations with Universum Film UFA and you suspect that perhaps his heart wasn't quite in it but the end result nonetheless remains essential viewing as are all the director's films. The story is based upon Molire's successful 1664 play Tartuffe which explored the notion of hypocrisy particularly among selfproclaimed religious devotees. Murnau and screenwriter Carl Mayer stripped the story to its bare essentials removing any extraneous supporting characters and creating a closeknit triangle  Herr Orgon Frau Elmire and Tartff  around which the story revolves. Murnau also added an interesting framing device whereby the story of Tartuffe becomes a filmwithinafilm that a young actor shows to his grandfather to warn of his housekeeper's evil intentions.Interestingly I found the story's prologue  of the old man and his scheming housekeeper  to be a more engrossing story than the film that the characters are later shown. The conniving old woman Rosa Valetti with a devilish grin like a Cheshire Cat manages to convince her senile employer Hermann Picha that his grandson has dishonoured the family name by becoming an actor and so she sets herself up to inherit his entire fortune. When the sincere young actor Andr Mattoni finds out about this betrayal he plans an ingenious stratagem to outwit the malicious housekeeper and convince his grandfather of her evil. Murnau was obviously a great believer in the power of cinema and so it's no surprise that the young man chooses the cinematic medium with which to reveal the ultimate truth about hypocrites. The film by employing a few deceptively simple shots immediately translates the inner motivations driving each character the housekeeper greedy and malevolent kicks aside her master's slippers whereas the kind loving grandson delicately sets them back into place. Also notable is a moment during the narrative when the young actor turns to the camera and addresses the audience directly one of the earliest instances I've seen of a character breaking the fourth wall.The tale of Tartuffe himself is also worth watching for its technical accomplishments even if the story itself seems somewhat generic and uninteresting. Most astounding is Murnau's exceptional use of lighting assisted of course by cinematographer Karl Freund and in many cases entire rooms are seemingly being illuminated only by candlelight. This story concerns a happilymarried woman Frau Elmire Lil Dagover who is distraught to discover that her beloved husband Herr Orgon Werner Krauss has become obsessed with Tartff the great Emil Jannings a grotesque little man who speaks with divine importance and claims to be a Saint. However hard she tries Elmire cannot convince Orgon that he has been duped by a religious fraud so great is the cunning of Tartffe's deception. In the film Jannings predictably gives the finest performance playing the unsavoury title character with a mixture of sly arrogance and lustful repugnance. Nevertheless the role falls far short of the silent actor's greatest performances which include Mephisto of 'Faust 1926' and the hotel porter from 'The Last Laugh 1924.'";

And while not the very best silent film available it's certainly among the better ones.This story differs from Molire's play in that the entire play is actually part of a larger storywith a prologue and epilogue. The story begins with a rich old man living alone with his supposedly devoted housekeeper. She has convinced the man that his grandson is evil and should be disinherited because he is oh horrors...an ACTOR!!! Instead she's fooled him into making her the beneficiary. When the grandson shows up to say hello the old man chases him away and it appears the housekeeper has won. However given that the young man is an actor he dresses up as a traveling showman and comes to the house to show them a filmTARTUFFE.The film stars Emil Jannings as the evil priest Tartuffe who has fooled a rich nobleman into forsaking the pleasures of life and becoming an aesthetic like him. But the man's wife soon realizes the priest is a charlatan and much of the movie is spent trying to trap the priest in his lies. Naturally all this is symbolic of the relationship between the housekeeper and the rich man.The sets direction and acting are all excellent. The acting is rather restrained compared to some silent films and the story is told in a brisk and watchable manner.".

	schema:headline " Not his best but still excellent by anyone else's standards.";
	schema:reviewBody "Personally I think the other reviewers have been way too hard on this film and I certainly don't agree that it is extremely average throwaway or plain and forgettable. OK  it's not his best by a long shot but Murnau was such a talented directerartist that even his weaker films urinate all over the films of most other directors. I thought that the 'film within a film' structure of it worked brilliantly. The cast were all excellent in their acting. The film is pretty great visually too as one would expect from Murnau  the 'outer' film is shot in a crisp modernist style with adventurous camera angles and no make up while the central 'film within a film' section was filmed in a more classical softfocus style. The film was also quite risky for it's time in its depiction of sexuality and corruption within the clergy and several scenes were censored for American audiences.The central theme of the film is hypocrisy particularly with those who are overly pious judgemental and puritanical. This is encapsulated in the words of Tartuffe when he admits Who sins in secret  does not sin. Murnau expertly exposes the true roots of fanatically pious behaviour  behind which lies its very opposite. This is very similar to what Freud termed 'reaction formation' whereby a character trait or impulse which one finds unbearable to oneself the ego is disguised and repressed by bringing a complete opposite tendency to the facade of ones personality  but this is always noticeable by its exaggeration. The Tartuffe character also indulges in another Freudian defence mechanism called 'projection' whereby one relieves the anxiety caused by an unwelcome trait by projecting it onto others.It's important to mention that this film also works brilliantly as a satire and at times I found myself laughing out loud at the grotesque character of Tartuffe. In one scene the obedient Emile is seen rocking Tartuffe as he yawns and lazes in a hammock like a selfish baby. Yet despite the ridiculing there is always a deep humane concern underlying the film  as there is with all of Murnau's films.So like I said this is not one of his best but any Murnau film is worth seeing.".

	schema:reviewBody "In 1992 an Italian TV channel showed a twoweek latenight retrospective of Silent films the bulk of which were expressionist classics. Unfortunately I missed out on a couple of these and TARTUFFE was among them. More than a decade had to pass before I could watch it by which time I had come to consider Murnau  despite the fact that only a small portion of his work has survived the ravages of time  as one of the undisputed masters of cinema.For some reason TARTUFFE has been littleseen over the years so that it never had much of a reputation which may explain why I bypassed its sole TV showing to begin with! having watched the film now it clearly emerges as a masterwork from the golden age of German cinema and its place in Murnau's irreproachable canon still impressive 75 years after the director's untimely death! should not be overlooked.Having watched OTHELLO 1922  which also starred Emil Jannings and Werner Krauss  relatively recently I couldn't help noticing that it offers an interesting rolereversal with Murnau's film for these two powerhouse actors in fact Jannings' largerthanlife performance here is played alongside an impressively restrained turn from Krauss whom I had previously only seen essaying villainous characters. One of TARTUFFE's most interesting elements is its 'filmwithinafilm' structure that looks back to THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI 1919 featuring Krauss's most famous role interestingly enough and forward to Hiroshi Teshigahara's THE FACE OF ANOTHER 1966  which coincidentally I watched the very next day my review of which is shortly to follow without having prior knowledge of this! Criticized at the time for being a pointless flourish on the filmmakers' part I strongly feel that  with respect to TARTUFFE at least  this device merely underlines the universality of the main theme being dealt with. I see however a third connection at play here this time with Murnau's own NOSFERATU 1922 Tartuffe is presented as a different form of bloodsucker one who is not undead but very much alive or human if you like and just as dangerous  not to mention that much more common in our daily life than the vampire of myth and literature besides the fact that  as in NOSFERATU  here it is the devoted wife of the man under the influence of Moliere's symbolic figure of hypocrisy From now on all hypocrites shall be called 'Tartuffe'! reads a subtitle who brings about his comeuppance by 'sacrificing' herself only helps reinforce this particular aspect.Despite the film's relative brevity explained in my notes for the accompanying documentary below its intimate nature and also the fact that Murnau was handed the project at short notice his trademark stylistics of expressionistic lighting and acrobatic camerawork are well in evidence. Finally I would like to say something about the English subtitles  displayed over the original German intertitles  for all three of Masters Of Cinema's Silent releases the others being of course SPIONE 1928 and ASPHALT 1929 I admire EurekaMoC's decision to preserve authenticity in every aspect of their DVDs but the interweaving text with the English translation appearing in too small a font makes it a comparatively labored read overall! At this juncture I truly regret missing out on the retrospective of Murnau's work shown a few years back at London's National Film Theatre  and I can only long for the time I will be able to watch the likes of JOURNEY INTO THE NIGHT 1921 THE HAUNTED CASTLE 1921 when I was in Hollywood I held in my hands a DVDR of this film but since it had been announced for DVD release by Image I didn't rent it THE BURNING SOIL 1922 PHANTOM 1922 the same comments for THE HAUNTED CASTLE apply here its DVD release from Flicker Alley has been imminent for some time now! THE GRAND DUKE'S FINANCES 1924 and CITY GIRL 1930. It's inconceivable how the work of such an important filmmaker so long as it is available is kept mysteriously under wraps  thus denying film buffs everywhere the opportunity of enjoying it! The 41minute documentary TARTUFFE THE LOST FILM 2004 TV is an essential watch for fans of Silent films and director F. W. Murnau although TARTUFFE may not be among Murnau's greatest films it is certainly one of his most personal as he identified himself with the young relative who is shunned from his inheritance because he has chosen the lowbrow way of the artist rather than a more lucrative profession. Besides the documentary highlights the depressing state of most Silent films in existence today while we should consider ourselves lucky that the U.S. theatrical version of TARTUFFE from which the DVD transfer was made is in such a good state it is considerably shorter than the original German version. Fragments of the lost scenes shown in the documentary include a couple of key sequences which as incomplete as they are in the film now seem a little rushed. Although the quality is understandably inferior one wonders why they weren't included in the main feature itself.".

The elderly man has shunned his actor grandson who visits him and after discovering the housekeepers use of poison is sent away. He returns disguised as a travelling cinema worker who upon getting into his grandfather's house proceeds to show them the story of Herr Tartuff. Rich landowner Herr Orgon Werner Krauss brings his new friend and religious fanatic Tartuffe Emil Jannings home much to the dismay of Orgon's wife Frau Elmire Lil Dagover. After she spurns Tartuffe's sexual advances she sets out to prove to Orgon that Tartuffe is an imposter who is seeking to inherit Orgon's vast estate.Why director F.W. Murnau decided to use the filmwithinafilm device in his adaptation of Moliere's famous play I'm not sure. Maybe it was to put his own new spin on what is now a wellknown story and moral tale or perhaps it is just to bring it up to date. Either way it's an effective device and allows Murnau to advertise his unbelievably advanced filmmaking techniques and ideas. His better known classics such as Nosferatu 1922 and Sunrise A Song of Two Humans 1927 showed his ability for expressionism and breakthrough techniques but Tartuffe displays his eye for the science of cinema. Every frame every camera movement and every cut is sheer beauty. And everything is helped by one of the giants of silent cinema Emil Jannings.Tartuffe is an absolute monster and it needed a true monster to play him. Jannings is colossal  his hulking frame making him look like a kind of evil spectre capable of anything what a shame that Jannings would later commit career suicide by becoming Goebbels pet propaganda tool. The film takes some surprising risks for its time as well. During the opening scenes before we are introduced to Tartuffe we see the young grandson being booted out of the house. Then something amazing happens  he walks up to the camera and looks at us the audience smiling. He assures us that the matter is not finished and that he will be back to avenge his grandfather. This was back in a time where directors felt they had to have the characters looking a certain way went conversing and that camera shots had to be at a certain level for fear the audience simply wouldn't understand what was happening. Directors were simply terrified to try new techniques but not Murnau.There is also a shocking scene involving the first exchanges between Tartuffe and Elmire. She is in the midst of demanding him to leave when the camera droops down from her face and lingers on her cleavage which is slightly visible due to the way she is looking down upon Tartuffe. All is seen from Tartuffe's point of view and this happens a number of times. Surprisingly saucy given it's age. Murnau is simply a genius and you can watch almost any of his films to realise this. Tartuffe is not his best and even if it seems to be breathlessly sprinting for the end in the final ten minutes it is still a brilliant film.www.thewrathofblog.blogspot.com".

Apparently Murnau was forced by contract to make this film. So this film is to Murnau what Spartacus was to Kubrick. Even though it's still a Murnau picture again Murnau knows how to give a quiet flat story more depth by suggestion and style. I liked the film it's hasn't got the outdoors scene's that Sunrise and Nosferatu had or the huge sets and special effect of Faust but still it remains an exciting film. Don't hold back by the negative reviewers of the film this is by all means not a bad film. It's just that Murnau made so much breathtaking stuff in his other work that this film seems not so historical interesting. But if you're a fan of Murnau's other work I'm sure you'll like this as well. Make sure you'll watch the Masters of Cinema edition. It has a great documentary about the making of this film. It gave me a lot of new insights about the film and about Murnau.".

But if you're a fan of Murnau's other work I'm sure you'll like this as well. Make sure you'll watch the Masters of Cinema edition. It has a great documentary about the making of this film. It gave me a lot of new insights about the film and about Murnau.";

	schema:headline " Expressionist Version of the Moliere Classic";
	schema:reviewBody "Based on Moliere's classic seventeenth century comedy this version of TARTUFFE has the eponymous antihero Emil Jannings being ultimately outwitted by the family at the same time the head of the family Orgon Werner Krauss remains as blissfully unaware of how to distinguish truth from falsity as he did at the beginning. F. W. Murnau's version is set in a large rambling house full of wide staircases and plenty of doors. He proves himself a master of the camera his closeups focusing on the pockets as Tartuffe stashes away his illgotten gains while pretending to embrace religion or on Elmire's Lil Dagover's breasts as Tartuffe tries and fails to keep his hands from touching them. Jannings is given full rein to show off his range of facial expressions as Tartuffe here is a genuinely evil man who believes he can do anything under the cloak of religion. What makes this TARTUFFE most interesting at least for students of history is the speciallyadded prologue and epilogue in which a young man Andr Mattoni shows his wealthy grandfather Hermann Picha the film of TARTUFFE in order to alert him to the old man's hypocritical governess Rosa Valetti and her designs on his fortune. The young man is impoverished but shown to be much more able to understand human behavior than his grandfather. Through this device Murnau takes a potshot at how capitalism and wealth often destroys judgment creating a covetous society in which everyone is out for themselves. This could be a microcosm of Germany in the mid Twenties before the Nazi accession to power. This TARTUFFE moves along at a brisk pace complemented by a jaunty soundtrack. Worth watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "When released in 1998 Out of Sight was Steven Soderburgh's most mainstream film to date after he burst onto the indie scene a decade earlier with Sex Lies and Videotape. Based upon the novel by Elmore Leonard Get Shorty Jackie Brown the movie tells the tale of odd couple Jack Foley George Clooney a career criminal and federal marshall Karen Sisco Jennifer Lopez. After a unique first encounter their paths continue intersecting with various degrees of intent to comprise the bulk of the story.Similar to the Soderburghhelmed Ocean's Eleven Out of Sight blends the standard apples and oranges of genres into a delicious smoothie. This is a drama minus the driving intensity lighthearted enough to pass as a comedy. It's a comedy but not of the HAHA sort. The humor lies in things like Clooney's glances JLo's relationship dilemmas the paradox of Ving Rhames' selfrighteous thief and the sheer absurdity of Don Cheadle's gangsta. It's also a romance and a copandrobber story but neither love nor crime is the whole point. All of these pieces unite to form a fantastic puzzle of a picture.The tasty complexity is further deepened by the nonlinear storytelling technique. Flashing backward here and there throughout the film is a good choice because the viewer can only fully understand the previous events with the 2020 vision of hindsight. Plus it eliminates what could have been a painful first half hour of exposition instead spreading the backstory through the rest of the film.The stylistic singular color palettes for different locations that Soderburgh later used magnificently in Traffic are present here as well. From bright sundrenched Florida to the ice cold blues of Detroit this technique serves as virtual atmosphere allowing one to determine the geography even without the convenience of titles. In a nonlinear film like this that ease in recognizing time and place facilitates comprehension of what is happening when. Unique among Soderburgh's work to my recollection is the film's use of occasional freeze frames. Stopping the picture for just a second or two Soderburgh gently identifies poignant moments obvious or not allowing an extra moment to deservedly linger on them.With the high technical accomplishments the acting almost doesn't matter but the slightly understated method works wonders. Clooney is his usual suave self complete with snappy dialogue and a cornucopia of confidence. In a role that Enough can only dream about JLo almost looks like a real actress joke. She is absent her toocommon ditziness and easily holds her own despite being a tad too glamorous. Rhames Cheadle and Albert Brooks are their usual solid selves playing parts both similar and drastically different from their wheelhouses. Everyone seems to have perspective in their parts not utilizing excessive gravity or levity but rather hitting the appropriate notes as they inhabit their roles to perfection. Ultimately you believe all of these actors in their parts even if JLo's skirts are entirely too short for a federal agent.Like Ocean's Eleven Out of Sight is a very good film merging quality in all aspects of filmmaking into a fully enjoyable two hour experience. The main themes of crime and love are basic so the movie doesn't soar to remarkable heights. But if you're looking for a brilliantly made film that you might have missed on its theatrical run espy Out of Sight and settle in for a quirkily involving night. If you saw it a few years back check it out again to see Soderburgh's foundation for his own excellence.Bottom Line A wholly absorbing movie that serves as a filmmaking clinic of brilliance. 8 of 10.".

	onyx:emotionText "When released in 1998 Out of Sight was Steven Soderburgh's most mainstream film to date after he burst onto the indie scene a decade earlier with Sex Lies and Videotape. Based upon the novel by Elmore Leonard Get Shorty Jackie Brown the movie tells the tale of odd couple Jack Foley George Clooney a career criminal and federal marshall Karen Sisco Jennifer Lopez. After a unique first encounter their paths continue intersecting with various degrees of intent to comprise the bulk of the story.Similar to the Soderburghhelmed Ocean's Eleven Out of Sight blends the standard apples and oranges of genres into a delicious smoothie. This is a drama minus the driving intensity lighthearted enough to pass as a comedy. It's a comedy but not of the HAHA sort. The humor lies in things like Clooney's glances JLo's relationship dilemmas the paradox of Ving Rhames' selfrighteous thief and the sheer absurdity of Don Cheadle's gangsta. It's also a romance and a copandrobber story but neither love nor crime is the whole point. All of these pieces unite to form a fantastic puzzle of a picture.The tasty complexity is further deepened by the nonlinear storytelling technique.

OUT OF SIGHT is a little masterpiece of filmmaking despite the fact that when it initially screened in 1998 it seemed to slip by theatergoers' attention. Based on the inimitable Elmore Leonard novel the story begs indulgence in credible situations but shines in quality of script and characterization and an atmospheric cinematic capturing of a dark film noir comedy drama that grabs you by the head and holds you glued to the screen for the duration.The story is rather simple on the surface  a jailed bank robber escapes with the help of his buddy and plans a major hit only to encounter a federal agent in pursuit of the two who becomes the love interest portion of this strangely convoluted tail. Subplots and sidebars are sprinkled throughout Soderbergh's telling of Leonard's story serving to keep our minds alert and mesmerized by the plot development.The cast is absolutely first rate with George Clooney Jennifer Lopez and Ving Rhames especially pungent in roles that seem written for them. The strong supporting cast includes such fine actors as Steve Zahn Catherine Keener Don Cheadle Luis Guzman  Isaiah Washington Dennis Farina and Albert Brooks. And for those who enjoy powerful sexual chemistry Clooney and Lopez offer some of their finest collaborative acting. This is a fine movie and one that doubtless in time will be considered and under appreciated Film Classic. Grady Harp".

The humour is extremely enjoyable the action is full of surprises and the characters with their various flaws and weaknesses provide the movie with its strongest element.Jack Foley George Clooney is a bank robber extraordinaire who's spent too much of his life in prison. His modus operandi involves the use of charm and intelligence rather than guns and masks but when his getaway car fails to start after his latest robbery he soon finds himself incarcerated in a Florida prison.He joins some other inmates in a jail break but is suddenly confronted by Federal Marshall Karen Sisco Jennifer Lopez who threatens to shoot him if he continues. Fortunately Jack's friend Buddy Bragg Ving Rhames had also been waiting for him outside the prison and quickly bundles Karen and Jack into the trunk of his car before driving off at great speed. Surprisingly during their time together in this exceedingly confined space the couple develop a certain rapport and it's quickly evident that there's a strong attraction between them.During his time in prison one of Jack's fellow inmates was Richard Ripley Albert Brooks an exWall Street man who'd been convicted for being involved in insider trading. He'd openly told others in the prison about the 5 million worth of uncut diamonds that were hidden in his mansion in Detroit so after the jail break some of the escapees make their way to Detroit with the intention of robbing Ripley's house.Jack having reached a point in his career where he felt that he could never face another spell in jail decides to take part in the robbery as it could provide him with one last big pay day before he retires from his life of crime. Karen however is determined to stay on his trail and their confrontation at the Ripley mansion turns out to be both tense and unpredictable.Jack and Karen are both repeat offenders. He's had a long career of robbing banks and spending time in prison and Karen has consistently been attracted to the guys who she should be bringing to justice. They're both intelligent but also have lapses where their normally good judgement fails them. Getting involved with each other is dangerous for Jack and unprofessional for Karen. Jack also aims to profit from one last job although by his own admission he's never known of any criminal who's successfully achieved such a thing.Clooney and Lopez are both very good individually and sensational together as they so powerfully convey the intensity of their mutual attraction. The supporting cast are also top class. Ving Rhames is superb as Jack's good friend whose weakness is his regular need to confess his wrongdoings to his sister. Don Cheadle is faultless as a vicious exboxer and ruthless murderer and Steve Zahn is funny and convincing as a slurring stoner who's not very bright and also totally unreliable.Out Of Sight is a witty and offbeat film and the style of Steven Soderbergh's direction reflects this perfectly. The story about two opposites who attract each other is presented with great originality and the finished product is so engaging and enjoyable that it becomes one of those movies for which repeat viewings become irresistible.".

Was I expecting HAMLET here?  No what I was expecting was a sensuous electric pulsating movie.  Well I didn't get it. I felt there was little chemistry between the two stars and that is killer in this kind of movie.  The most laughable scenes have Clooney standing up to genuinely dangerous looking black and white cons isn't Clooney afraid he is going to break a nail? This movie could have been a hoot if it didn't contain Elmore Leonard usual mean spiritedness.  The best performances come from the peripheral players Ving Rhames like THAT is a surprise! Don Cheedle Catherine Keener Dennis Farina Nancy Allen looking surprisingly fetching and especially Albert Brooks.  Michael Keaton is also a hoot in an unbilled cameo as Lopez's thick adulterous boyfriend however THAT relationship undermines the credibility of Lopez's character. The movie is confusing.  It starts with a botched bank robbery which ends with Clooney incarcerated in the Glades Prison in Florida.  Clooney escapes with the help of Rhames but Lopez just so happens to be on the scene.  Lopez apprehends Clooney but is overpowered by Rhames coming up behind her like Lopez wouldn't have been sweeping the area with that shotgun duh? Lopez and Clooney wind up locked in a trunk together and they talk as Clooney gets familiar with her thigh like real romantic guys. Rhames and Clooney talk about a botched robbery not the same robbery as the beginning mind you then are left behind by Lopez as she talks another thick partner into running off with the getaway car.  We then see Clooney and Rhames arriving at the hideout. Clooney soaks in a hot tub as Lopez sneaks up stands over Clooney with her gun drawn. She then bends down and Clooney kisses her essentially pulling her into the tub.  Suddenly Lopez wakes up in the hospital. What the hell is going on? Ah dream sequence duh... The film flashes back and forth in time with very little sense of transition thankfully there are no more dream sequences.  The director gives us quite a few flashes of razzledazzle photography and editing none of which really adds to the excitement. I found myself squirming before this was over. If you liked GET SHORTY you'll probably like OUT OF SIGHT. Include me out of any more Elmore Leonard.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is so unique and so utterly amazing in its ability to present us time after time with real believable characters.  And there are lots here and even though they may appear for about 5 minutes e.g. Michael Keaton Albert Brooks etc. somehow we get to learn a little bit about them to catch a small glimpse of their life.  Even the three ad guys at the bar seemed like the type you'd meet up with in real life.  If their parts were totally irrelevant to the movie somehow they just fit anyway.How do the filmmakers achieve this effect and how do they do it so seamlessly?  I thought the technique was by not presenting the characters to through their great accomplishments but by their natural human faults.  I know it is wrong to love someone for their errors we should rather love them for their virtues etc etc.  But I feel there is an aspect of imperfection in an individual's failures that is a major quality of what makes us human.Jack Foley George Clooney is a graying bank robber who despite a sense of good nature and intelligence does unplanned and unarmed bank heists and consequently spends most of his time in prison no doubt scheming up new plans to get out.  Foley doesn't seem like the typical criminal who'd blame his antisocial habits on a bad childhood rather he carries a cocky comical air of someone who does it for the heck of it or maybe to quote Foley he's just not a ninetofive kind of guy.  Karen Sisco Jennifer Lopez is Foley's feminine equivalent who ignores her conscience and carries her cat and mouse games to the fullest extent jeopardizing her career.  Sisco is very firm and bubbling with selfesteem yet she's dating an married FBI agent who carries an arrogant macho look on his face.Of course I could go on forever from Buddy's Ving Rhames certainly dullwitted habit of calling his sister to confess of jobs especially one confession that got him and Foley busted to White Boy Bob who you'd write off as a basic bad guy character until he does that thing to himself near the end of the movie.Now there are many who will fault the movie for lagging having too much dialogue etc.  But I felt that if the movie was slowed down in any way it was because the filmmakers took the guts to devote a little bit to create and flourish each character.  And that is why I love this film so much this was made for an intelligent audience for an audience that wants a little more out of dialogue wants to get aroused without explicit sexuality onscreen styles director Soderbergh is known for and enjoy a good crime movie without the repetitive drawn out gun battles.Soderbergh wanted to go mainstream with this movie but you can only see him going deeper and deeper into film avantgarde.  Just hope those corrupt Hollywood producers after seeing the lagging there's that word again box office receipts don't get to him.10 of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Macho action roller coaster thrill ride with two action stars Sylvester Stallone and Kurt Russell. This is one of my favorite Stallone's action films it is a buddy cop action comedy. I grew up watching this movie I first saw this film as a 9 year old kid on TV. Rocky IV was my favorite childhood action movie at the time and when I saw Sly destroying bad guys in this movie I shouted mom Rocky! That time I didn't know the actor's name who played Rocky and Ray Tango but I loved the action that was delivered in this movie and I taped the ending cause I loved seen Rocky in this movie so much.As a kid I watched Rocky IV Rambo III the most those movies I could got on VHS in a video store near my home those are my childhood movies. Rambo Trilogy Rocky IV Rocky V and this movie were the only one I saw as a kid from Stallone. Sylvester Stallone is my favorite action star and Kurt Russell is also my favorite action star. John Rambo teaming up with Snake Pliskin.Why I like this film? It is for two action stars who delivering this movie good. It is silly action but it is good. I like the prison setting in the film I like the prison escape. I like practical effects and real stunt work. I like Ray Tango and Gabriel Cash who are the opposite and both competitive cops. The movie is original in which both rival cops are set up for a murder of an FBI undercover agent from a drug kingpin who didn't commit the crime. The movie has lighter tone and it also has comedy elements that work in it so is not brutal it is a decent action movie that I like and enjoy very much.The movie also star Teri Hatcher who plays Ray's sister Jack Palance who plays Yves Perret a crime mastermind who set up those two cops because he is a drug kingpin and Tango  Cash are his competitors who takes down his drug operations and they become a treat to him. James Hong is also in this movie in which he co started with Kurt Russell in Big Trouble in Little China and reunites with Kurt again. Brion James also plays Requin Perret's henchman and he is a decent villain. Geoffrey Lewis from Van Damme's Double Impact is in this movie who plays Tango and Cash's supervisor Captain. Robert Z'Dar is also in this movie who played Maniac Cop Officer Matthew Cordell in this movie he is simply called Conan who has a rough fight with Tango on the roof top who becomes electrified that was a good action scene my favorite in the film.The music by Harold Faltermeyer who did an excellent music score for this movie he also made a lot of music scores on action movies like Beverly Hills Cop I II Top Gun The Running Man and Kuffs.This isn't my favorite Buddy Cop action film my favorite Buddy Cop action film is Showdown in Little Tokyo because it is Brandon Lee in it. Still Rambo films Rocky films Cobra Demolition Man and Cliffhanger are in my opinion much better movies than Tango  Cash but this is a good decent action macho roller coaster thrill ride movie I like it not my favorite action film but I like it.".

They break out and go after the bad guys to clear their names.The film has got some excellent action scenes particularly inside the prison and during the break out. It's got some nice eye candy courtesy of one Teri Hatcher. The script also delivers some very funny lines now and then. Couple that with the fact that I actually do like Stallone do comedy and Russell has always been somewhat of a mini favourite Tango and Cash is very worthy of my time every once in a while.Downsides Excellent actor Jack Palance is horrible in the clich ridden bad guy role I can't figure out if he's trying too hard or not at all and the film has a really silly final 10 minutes where the action goes from cool to basically slapstick. Still early 90's action fans should enjoy this flick.".

I assume he wants to physically and mentally torture them so he orchestrates a yet once more unreal frameup that lands the two in jail.  There's even an obligatory You're goin' down for this from a fellow officer at the scene of the crime.  Then on the inside ALL the guards are corrupt which allows prisoners to roam the grounds at will the powerful drug guy to pay visits Russell and Stallone to be tortured in a boiler room etc.  Each guy has a friend on his side Russell the warden Stallone his captain.  Now it's odd that the captain who knows Stallone is innocent fails to share this with other authoroties.  Even the address of a henchman that he's obtained.  After a prison break there's the big bad finale where the two take on armies of machine gun blasting toadies of Palance's.  Then a dopey final gunshot that puts an exclamation point on the list of unreal moments. Now with all that said why did I still like this?  The dynamite script. Feldman provides a ton of oneliners and comic moments which aided the implausibility of the proceedings.  Not to mention some nicely shot moments of action.

	schema:reviewBody "Back in the 80's kitsch cinema had two main sections  gory horror movies and daft action films of which this film obviously fits into the latter. While the gory horror movies of the eighties often lacked credibility that section of kitsch movies beats the daft action films because of the much higher content of inventiveness but more often than not the daft action movies make for good entertainment even if they're somewhat less than brilliant. Tango and Cash is a notable action movie because it stars two of the eighties most popular action stars  Sylvester Stallone and Kurt Russell whose antagonistic partnership makes up the core of this movie. The plot device to get the maverick cops to work together is hardly important but nevertheless it follows the two as a corrupt state buys into a plot by a criminal kingpin to land them both in jail which promptly sees our hero's in with the masses of criminals they themselves have sent to the clink. As you can imagine they're not the most well liked of inmates. Especially not by 'Maniac Cop' himself Robert Z'Dar...The action in the movie comes thick and fast and this when combined with the oneliner packed script make the movie feel more like a parody than a serious take on the genre. This is all good however as this movie is pure entertainment and seeing two of the 80's hottest action stars fire off silly dialogue at one another is a treat to say the least. The action is over the top and we get to watch our hero's do such things as slide down electrical cables and drive a souped up SUV around an explosion packed warehouse and it makes for great entertainment. Of course what the movie packs in action and snappy dialogue it lacks in other areas such as credibility and depth but nobody tunes into a kitschy 80's action movie for plot depth and sophistication so blaming the movie for not offering these things is ridiculous. On the whole if you're after a good two hours of solid action fare you could certainly do a lot worse than Tango and Cash. This movie packs a lot of punch delivered by two strong leading men. Thumbs up!".

	schema:reviewBody "Tango is a smooth cop who dresses like a banker deals in stocks and shares but loves the action. Cash is a rough and ready action man who lives life fast and dirty but is a better cop for it. Each man serves on opposite sides of the LA and both are thorns in the side of crime kingpin Yves Perret  accountable for losing him millions in seized drugs and weapons. Rather than just have them killed Perret sets them both up for the murder of an undercover cop supposedly in a sting operation. With all the evidence against them they cop a plea for minimumsecurity sentence  which they don't get. With a violent and angry welcome for them Tango and Cash decide they need to escape soon or be carried out  plus bringing down Perret is now their sole focus.Although I know just what this film was going to be like I thought I'd try to give it a chance and watch it again with a fresh pair of eyes. Nothing about the plot summary would lead you to expect anything other than a clichd action movie and all that comes with it. And that is almost exactly what you get with this. The plot is predictable and really you are just watching it go through the motions and do just what you expect it to at almost every stage. The action is typically overthetop and lacking the touch of realism that is usually needed to make it really engaging and exciting  instead it is noisy and overblown managing to be quite fun but certainly not gripping or involving. The character dynamics are also clichd  it is lovehate bantering mismatched cops stuff but ironically it actually works pretty well. The main reason for this is that the script shows that at least Feldman wasn't taking it too seriously  the dialogue allows both to mock each other and stops them settling into their macho images too much.Happily both Stallone and Russell buy into it and let themselves be made fun of as much as they get to give it. Neither are brilliant but at least they seem to have got the joke and avoid playing it too straight or just going along with the macho clichs. Of course they eventually get back to basics and along with the film eventually just gets down to big bangs and action movie traditions but for the majority of the film they just about do enough to make it fun  albeit fun in a silly rather guilty way. Hatcher doesn't add a great deal but it is interesting to see how good she looked then and how well she has aged in the past 15 or so years. Palance hams it up something awful and is a little painful to watch  but he is matched by equally poor bad guys from James Hong and a few others. Pollard does his usual stuff and is typical comic relief.Overall this is a dumb action movie and if you hate that type of film then you will hate this. I must admit that by the end the sheer cheesy stupidity of the whole thing had started to grate on me somewhat but up till that point it had been silly and quite fun. The amusing banter is one plus and at least Stallone and Russell aren't taking it too seriously for the most part and provide enough to stop it being a totally predictable genre film  even if it is a close run thing.".

	schema:headline " Unadulterated Sheer Brilliance the Perfect Film..Tango and Cash";
	schema:reviewBody "This masterpiece of Americana is perhaps the Greatest film ever made. The amalgamation of Sylvester Stallone's sheer magnetism and Kurt Russell's commanding stage presence has yielded a sonnet the likes of which all Films aspire to be. Stallone portrays Raymond 'Ray' Tango a highly decorated narcotics detective from Beverly Hills who penchant for the stock market has granted him not only the finer things in life but also a means to express his sophisticated nature and aspirations of financial independence. Stallone masterfully shows the dichotomy of a character who is highly educated and well mannered yet is beset in a cesspool of crime and depravity Tango yearns for a better society yet will not rest on his laurels of law and order. Gabriel 'Gabe' Cash portrayed by the immaculate Kurt Russell is the antipodean of Stallone's level headed Tango. Cash is pugnacious assertive and zealous yet his diligence to enforce law and order at all cost define this tortured soul. Although this crass inner city detective has a disheveled appearance and tough exterior he is simply trying to hide his true feelings and desires for true love in an otherwise barbaric society. The story begins as these two rival officers are competing for the title of LA's best cop. Although their methods and approaches differ their goals are the same to imprison Yves Perret a diabolical drug lord who catches wind of the duos escapades. With his Criminal Empire in danger of being toppled Perret masterfully played by Jack Pallance enacts his plan to destroy the two. In an act of carnal malevolence he frames them for the murder of an undercover FBI agent. Perret's corruption and debauchery know no bounds as he weaves a duplicitous web of conspiracy the likes of which have not been seen since the Warren Commission. Evidence is tampered socalled experts bribed and in an attempt to save their lives Tango and Cash agree to a plea bargain under the guise that they will be sent to a Minimum Security prison not amongst the general population. Perret then has them sent to a Maximum Security faculty amongst inmates that have been jailed by the two supercops in an attempt to have them assassinated. Tango and Cash must then set aside their petty differences and discover the true meaning of friendship to escape the prison to clear their once proud names and stop Perret once and for all in a conclusion that will rattle even the sternest of men. The chemistry between Stallone and Russell is reminiscent of Redford and Newman if not greater with snide remarks being made by both parties. The action adventure and violence are nonstop yet the humanity of the characters is prevalent throughout the film adding a much needed dimension to an otherwise clich and tired genre. Tango is not just a mindless cop he is multidimensional protagonist who hearkens to the days of Bogart and Cary Grant. Cash desires the admiration of a women to complete himself which he finds in Catherine kiki Tango he is not simply a generic action hero who shoots guns and makes wise ass remarks Cash has a quintessence and Russell pours his soul into the character. All in all this film is the crowning achievement of Stallone and Russell and the Hollywood film industry. It is a cut of history when master Artisans the like of Russell and Stallone are brought together at their peak with visionaries leading them to produce what is their destiny..FUBAR!!!!!!!!!".

	schema:headline " Despite a very problematic ending Tango and Cash still has plenty to make it an at least enjoyable film";
	schema:reviewBody "Tango and Cash is one of those films that people can get a huge amount of enjoyment out of when taking it for what it is or there will be others who'll find it not to their taste. From personal taste there are a number of shortcomings but I cannot bring myself to hate it.Pros It's stylishly made if very 80s and competently directed nothing comes over as amateurish. The soundtrack does pulsate with energy and is easy to remember if a little intrusive in placesnot that that is uncommon in action films. The script is snappy and delivered like dynamite the banter between Stallone's Tango and Kurt Russell's Cash is a lot of fun. The story on the whole while very silly and predictable but it doesn't really ever become dull and it is easy to follow the standout scenes being the opening which is one of those scenes that sets things up so well it makes one excited for what will happen next and the brilliant prison escape the prison scenes in general are among the better scenes in the film actually. The action while very overthetop is decently edited cool and endearingly kitsch without feeling too much. Sylvester Stallone is charismatic and effectively lowkey and shows that he is at ease in the action scenes his comic timing while much criticised in general is pretty good here while Kurt Russell is a witty soulful partner the two of them being a wellmatched pair. It is not everyday where you see Russell in drag don't worry it is not as weird as it sounds.Cons Tango and Cash does have problems. The biggest problem is that it falls apart in the final 10 minutes an ending so disappointing that it's easy to bring the film down more than one notch. It loses the energy that the rest of the film has and it goes well overboard in the silliness factor with the slapsticky final fight feeling out of kilter. The main villain Perrett's comeuppance is also very anticlimatically handled. Teri Hatcher is probably at her sexiest here but her acting feels vapid. More problematic are the villains here are very stereotypically writtenespecially Perrett the drugs baron stereotype has been done a number of times and nothing interesting is done here and only Brion James here looking as if he is having so much fun is memorable. You'd think that Jack Palance a master of suavity deadpan and intimidating menace would be but here he gives one of his weakest performances but it is not helped by that he is very underused and that he is the most clichd character in the whole film. Palance was a great actor and excelled better than most in villain roles but this is a portrayal where he does try way too hard that he's almost pantomimic it also manages to be quite bland compared to his usual standard. His henchmen are even more blandly written and sees James Hong in a rare completely uninvolved performance.All in all won't work for some and it is a long way from flawless but still incredibly entertaining and has a good deal of charm. Don't expect sophistication anything new or depth you'll be disappointed. In its defence though Tango and Cash never strived to be that kind of film. But if you are looking for an enjoyable switchyourbrainoffatthedoor film there is a good deal to like. 610 Bethany Cox".

But surprisingly enough this is actually quite a winner and succeeds far more in being a parody of the LethalWeapon style films than say... Loaded Weapon does. This is for several reasons.Firstly Stallone is the star of the show here turning in a selfmocking parody of his own screen persona. He is flash and indestructable yet the film acknowledges and exploits this to comedic ends. Secondly Palance is excellent as a sneering and menacing bad guy plotting the two cops downfall. He deserved more screen time than he actually got and actually did a good job of being the obligatory stereotypical badguy.However the best thing of all about this film is the snappy dialogue. There is so much good banter between the twocops that no matter how bizarre the film's scenario's get the dialogue rescues it.The first time I saw this I enjoyed it and was only really let down by the ending which feels hollow and unsatisfying in comparison to the first two reels of the film. However this nagging problem alone I have no hesitation in recommending this to any fan of the actiongenre.Overall 6 12 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "I remember back in my early teens when my movie watching obsession really broke. I discovered Stallone and 80's action films and just was completely hooked. I remember Tango and Cash being paramount to that obsession. It was a buddy cop film with Stallone and Russell and it was just awesome. So I decided after probably a decade or more since I'd seen it last to try it again. Imagine my surprise when I was nearly completely disappointed. I still remember my favourite parts but they didn't have the same effect on me. I found the film really vapid empty pointless silly and the constant barrage of homosexual innuendo humour was honestly more than I could handle. Maybe I was too young to notice it then but it was irritating. The story is so weak its unbelievable. Even the action scenes lack a certain punch and the final showdown in the gravel pit which I fondly remembered being AWESOME wasn't so awesome this time around. A lot of stuff explodes for no reason and it is so over the top that it loses credibility. The film starts strong because the opening scene with Stallone chasing a tanker truck is undeniably awesome as well as his Rambo...was a py line which was truly outstanding. There are many many one liners in the film some are good some are forgettable so it has that going for it. But it was a total miss for me this time around sadly.I am a huge Sylvester Stallone fan and I did enjoy his Tango character. He is sort of uptight and proper and looks very dapper in his suit and glasses in the beginning. I found him sort of weak though further on in the film and really lacking that Stallone charisma. Kurt Russell is the wild and unpredictable Cash. He is good as the unhinged scruffy and crude street wise cop. Together the two of them have decent chemistry but not outstanding. Their banter feels a little forced and his sarcasm almost becomes too much. Their moments when they work together are awfully cheesy high fives?! but with a better script I think they would have been great together. Teri Hatcher has a mostly small role as Stallone's sister and the object of Russell's fascination. Her role barely makes a blip in the film and she's only recognizable because of what she has become now in Television. Her character is to give them something to fight for and she does that and only that. The legendary Jack Palance should be the absolutely perfect 80's action film villain. He seems absolutely ideal and his few scenes are done well with his trademark suave personality. The problem is that he is underused and almost made comical instead of a worthy adversary. Brion James was almost a better villain and used far more properly as Palance's number one henchman. There is a great fight scene between him and Stallone.Tango and Cash has become an 80's cult classic and I suppose I am being so hard on it because I remember loving it so much. Maybe I just have higher expectations now or maybe it doesn't hold up well to time. Russian director Andrey Konchalovskiy has a lot of credits but it would seem this was his only mainstream action flick so that a bit of an odd choice for director. I would hazard to guess that his heart wasn't really in it. I suppose when you're looking for the quintessential buddy copy films that in many ways this fits the bill but I just felt like I held in such high regard that seeing it now left a bad taste in my mouth. It has shoot outs fights a prison break car chases and explosions galore but it all felt mostly empty. It has some killer one liners and some genuinely good action sequences but something was definitely missing. 5.510".

	schema:headline " Derivative action movie competent in the destruction department but pretty weak in all other areas.";
	schema:reviewBody "I was surprised to see Andrei Konchalovsky's name on the original poster advertising the cinematic release of this 1989 action movie. Konchalovsky was the director who in 1985 had made the existential thriller Runaway Train and in 1986 had followed it up with the moving drama Duet For One. Not really then the type of filmmaker you'd expect to direct a buddybuddy actioner along the lines of 48 Hours and Lethal Weapon. In some ways I was quite excited at the prospect of Konchalovsky tackling a film of this kind. Could he bring something new to the genre? Could he stamp some of his directorial flair on stale and predictable material? Could he twist a few conventions on their head and create a fresh breed of action film? Unfortunately Tango  Cash is a thoroughly disappointing and familiar addition to the genre. Not only does it derive all of its inspiration from earlier and usually better films it also makes itself excessively foulmouthed and violent into the bargain. Konchalovsky has not done his talent any justice with this one.In L.A two cops from different precincts dominate the front pages of the newspapers for their constant drug busts. One is Ray Tango Sylvester Stallone the other Gabriel Cash Kurt Russell. Both good cops both hellbent on preventing drug traffic from making it onto the streets of their city and both enormously competitive with the other. One notably mean drug baron Yves Perret Jack Palance decides he's had enough of them meddling into his criminal activities so he arranges for them to be framed for a murder. Tango and Cash fall into his trap and are duly imprisoned. Their only hope is to team up to bust out of jail and to nail Perret before the cops nail them.Stallone and Russell trade off each other quite nicely though not as brightly as Gibson and Glover in the Lethal Weapon flicks and Palance once again brings raspy menace to one of those villainous roles he could play in his sleep. But the plot is totally derivative with nothing fresh or original to get excited about. And the action sequences are totally soulless and excitementfree with plenty of scenes of destruction but no raw energy to bring depth and emotion into the fireworks. Tango  Cash is a real disappointment in so many ways but the biggest is probably the fact that from this director we've come to expect so much more.".

Their only hope is to team up to bust out of jail and to nail Perret before the cops nail them.Stallone and Russell trade off each other quite nicely though not as brightly as Gibson and Glover in the Lethal Weapon flicks and Palance once again brings raspy menace to one of those villainous roles he could play in his sleep. But the plot is totally derivative with nothing fresh or original to get excited about. And the action sequences are totally soulless and excitementfree with plenty of scenes of destruction but no raw energy to bring depth and emotion into the fireworks. Tango  Cash is a real disappointment in so many ways but the biggest is probably the fact that from this director we've come to expect so much more.";

Tango  the fine dressing gentleman  and Cash  the guy from the hood  have to work together to save their lives and careers after they both get framed by a drug lord Jack Palance and get sentenced to jail.I really like Kurt Russell and Stallone isn't a bad actor either but in here they both really lower the bar in their acting way low. The buddycop premise doesn't work between the two  and the two actors don't seem to care as long as they're getting paid for it. It doesn't help that the script isn't really working either. Teri Hatcher as the compulsory eyecandy also does the only thing she knows how to  which is looking good. Jack Palance does the same routine as he did in Batman 1989 1989 must have been a pretty convenient year for Jack playing one character and cashing two checks from two different films. Thet's real Hollywood Magic for you.The good thing with the film is that it has a nice 80's vibe in it. The music the visual style  so generic but comfortable and entertaining. So you watch the film once...What keeps you from watching it again are the action sequences the script and the editing which all lack quality very badly plot holes incoherent action sequences poor directing  the film's bewitched. The final showdown it's a 80's action movie what else there could be other than a showdown at the end? for example is horrible for no reason the film turns into Carmageddon or something by bringing cars with mounted assault riffles and rocket launchers to the screen  it's ridiculous. Also there's a lot of cars and security who just disappear into thin air due to some odd editing in that scene...In conclusion the film was a nice idea on paper which turned into something hellish in production. Some of it was bad luck I assume some of it was lack of talent some of it just poor judgement. Whatever the case might have been the film's bad it's simple as that. Even Kurt Russell couldn't walk away from this caraccident on his own two feet. 14".

The boys' uncle comes to visit recently out of prison and life quickly changes for them all and the true beauty of this film comes out. Where many movies fail is in focusing too heavily on the main characters or the action of the story. Undertow makes no such mistakes. In between the more intense scenes we are introduced to the world around our heroes. We meet fully developed characters each of whom could easily fill a movie of their own. Rather than creating a world for us to watch Green has instead allowed us into a living breathing world as observers. We don't get explanations for everything only what we see on the screen. Miraculously none of these characters slow down the film. They add humor or romance or suspense before we are snapped back to the main story. On top of all that the film is beautifully shot perfectly actedcast and the music fits the moods in each scene. There is finally a movie that can thrill us but still take time to make sure we care and believe in it's world. I cannot recommend it enough you will not be disappointed.I'm not sure what world Green will next allow us to enter but I can't wait.".

	schema:headline " Intense brooding grimy  this is the best film I've seen in a long time";
	schema:reviewBody "Director David Gordon Green's critically acclaimed Undertow is a strange but gripping experience. I don't know any other film quite like this. We've seen the slow pacing build up tension in the plot before in films but it's so much more than that in Undertow  it's the pace of a family's life in the deep backwoods of Georgia and it it patiently lets us absorb everything. Maybe I was in a sensitive and impressionable frame of mind when I saw it because I remember being so shaken and touched by this fare that its visuals and mood still haunt me.But this patient slow pace is the calm before the storm as it comes to an end when the brother of the father of the family comes to visit newly released from prison. Josh Lucas is this brother and he captures the shady nature of his character with effortless conviction. His presence is felt in scenes he is not even in. Upon arriving to the family the film just takes a completely different turn and we follow the two brave kids in the family on the run in the south from their uncle.This is further emphasized by attentiongrabbing frames that freeze whenever intensity builds up. This may seem anticlimactic but it's extremely effective and it makes the chase sequences very exciting and 1970sinfluenced. So it essentially shifts between chase mode and eerily quiet Southpaced calm in a genius way. If you like your films fastpaced and actionfilled however its brilliance may be lost on you  but if you give it time Undertow will surprise you as it's unpredictable even in style. This is just how meticulouslycrafted it is.The film is grimy dense brooding and realistic and it zooms in on the deep necks of Georgia featuring some gorgeously striking visuals making you feel the dirt and heat of the deep south as if you were right there breathing the murky warm air from the brown rivers. Some say Green's directing style is reminiscent of Terrence Malick it is very visuallydriven but I don't think so  rather it is an insult to the former Green clearly knows what he's doing and lets nature visuals facilitate the story he tells while Malick lets the story facilitate his pointless nature visuals.I loved Undertow more every minute it progressed and am now prepared to give this film a 9 out 10. I also have it firmly stapled in my top 10 films of all time list and that is quite a feat for such a lowkey dark horse. 910".

	schema:headline " The Dukes of Hazzard Go to Hell";
	schema:reviewBody "Taking a popculture icon and flipping it on its head is a favorite pastime of young film directors. In 1986 David Lynch took his boyscout memories and essentially in his own words sent The Hardy Boys to hell with Blue Velvet. Likewise with a bit of Terrance Malick inspired poeticism director David Gordon Green sends the good old Duke Boys to hell with Undertow. Josh Lucas is effectively menacing in a Night of the Hunter kind of way as the recently released from prison brother of the stoic Dermot Mulroney who has secluded himself and his two sons from the rest of the world on a hog farm following the death of his wife whom was previously involved with Lucas' character. Some family folklore involving a hidden stash of gold coins sends Lucas' excon on a rampage that ends with the tracking of the young brothers on the run through rural American Gothic hell on earth. There's a lot to fault in a film like this but also a lot to treasure if you give it the time. Jamie Bell and Devon Alan as the two brothers are very convincing and easy to route for and some directorial flourishes from Green and nice character acting from Lucas keep the film fresh and original even as it channels past classics from Malick Badlands Lynch Blue Velvet and the Night of the Hunter. There's also a score from my favorite minimalist composer Philip Glass. All in all not a bad way for a film buff to spend their evening.".

	schema:headline " A pull toward convention";
	schema:reviewBody "A teenage boy smashes his would be girlfriend's window and gets chased by the cops. He leaps out of a barn and lands on a plank driving a long nail through his foot  but surprises us by keeping on running howling with pain plank and all. When he's taken to jail he's patched up and released and given the plank back. When he gets home he carves it into a birthday present a toy airplane for his little brother. This is how this movie begins. Undertow takes place in an unnamed rural part of Georgia near water where at first we meet two boys Chris and Tim Munn Jamie Bell and the young Devon Alan who live on a small isolated pig farm with their moody father John Munn Dermot Mulroney a widower who's buried himself in this far off place because he can't deal with his wife's passing. The Munns the opening titles tell us were real people in Georgia and this is based on their lives. Suddenly John's brother Deel Munn Josh Lucas unexpectedly appears just out of jail and full of anger and envy. Even if the father was edgy with the boys and Chris was obstreperous and Tim was odd it was a solid little world but Deel's presence leads to violence and flight. The action hinges on a set of gold coins that have an almost fairytale significance and the Brothers Grimm were an influence on the story.Yes indeed the story. This new movie by much admired young American director David Gordon Green arouses disappointment in some of his fans who miss the quirky stylized meanderings of his George Washington and All the Real Girls because Undertow moves squarely into the more conventional world of plot and action. Others who like myself admired almost everything about his earlier efforts but their lack of a strong narrative line are glad that this time there is one. But no doubt it comes at a price. There's a tug of war between the old Green and the new one going on.The movie divides itself into the time leading up to the violence and the period of flight and pursuit that ends in climax and denouement. There are those who say Undertow is derived from Seventies thrillers or The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter or Terrence Malick whose producer imprimatur the movie bears. These associations pop up because indeed the story is not brilliantly original even if the texture and look are as distinctive as those of Green's earlier movies. Two thirds of the way through Undertow's narrative arouses expectations of momentum and suspense that are temporarily disappointed because in the course of flight and pursuit the movie starts to wander a bit. The idiosyncratic dialogue and fresh characters are what makes Green's work so interesting but they do slow things down particularly here. In the end neither the diehard fans nor newcomers will be completely satisfied. It's his very independence that keeps him from completely pleasing anybody but himself. Green has gone too conventional in some ways such as cheesy opening titles and an initial series of attentiongrabbing freezeframes which also continue to reappear sporadically throughout the picture at random moments. The former amateurishness has been replaced with some pointless overslickness. The cinematography by Green regular Tim Orr is lovely though with its rich locales and saturated color. Green's earlier movies fell flat for me  George Washington was singular and engaging but went nowhere and All the Real Girls had more character development but suffered from bad casting and embarrassing dialogue. At its worst moments which tended to stick in the mind both movies seemed like Hallmark cards for rural retards. But Undertow does not disappoint despite its flaws. It retains the distinctive style. And this time because it's successfully plotdriven from very early on the meanderings  having a firm foundation in action and character  come to seem engaging digressions rather than mere selfindulgence. The stuff about a chocolate cake at Tim's ruined birthday party Chris's run with the plank stuck to his foot even Tim's disgustingseeming habit of eating mud and crud and paint and throwing up wake you up and make you pay attention because of their particularity. It's true that Lucas and Mulroney are too much the Hollywood hunks just as Zooey Deschanel in Real Girls was too much the Indie pinup queen Green may still have some problems with casting. But not with Jamie Bell who's about perfect. And he still stays true to the composite southern milieu he grew up in. The grandparents who appear in the denouement are priceless like so many of the incidental characters. Deel's arrival at the farm is electric in its effect. From then on the scene is nothing but tension. Mulroney and Lucas if we discount the tooperfect hunkiness make a good pair of brothers. Both are big physical attractive men whose faces aren't unalike. Mulroney has sullenness about him Lucas is edgy and aggressive. It turns out John's late wife was Deel's girlfriend first and John stole her away from him so the fraternal conflict was truly primal. Their confrontation makes you realize how successfully violence conveys a sense of structure in any story. After that the boys run off pursued by Deel carrying away the gold coins Deel thinks he should have gotten from his father instead of John. There are hints of Huckleberry Finn in the boys' adventures when they go wandering on the run from Deel while the boys' meditative voiceovers suggest Malick. It's strange that the sickly little Tim is the one who runs carrying the bag that has both his books and the couple dozen gold coins in it. But despite such inconsistencies and the suggestion by critics and viewers that the narrative is hackneyed the treatment and the mood are pure David Gordon Green. With this third film his methods finally make sense. Rather than thinking of Seventies actioners and the movie The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter you'd do better to refer to Carson McCullers whose novel that film is based on or to the stories of Truman Capote or Eudora Welty or William Faulkner or  closer to today  the early novels of Cormac McCarthy or to the photographs of Ralph Eugene Meatyard or Sally Mann. Like those artists and unlike any Hollywood director Green has a rich particular overripe deeply southern vision. The fun is in the particularity  in the cashier for instance who flirts with Deel and chokes on her gum in her mechanic husband who rambles on about some obscure musical group called the Storics in Tim's storytelling from his books and the way he is filing them at home according to their smell. Despite a few narrative confusions Jonathan Rosenbaum has written of Undertow I found it pure magic. You could be cynical and say it would take magic to justify the confusions. But Rosenbaum isn't far wrong. For whatever faults it has Undertow really sings.".

Tim in particular is a fascinating character that has some sort of eating disorder where his body rejects food but craves things like paint mud and worms. The supporting characters the boys meet on their journey are equally bizarre. Some scenes come across as ridiculous or absurd but Undertow is a film that is rich in both symbolism and metaphor and it is necessary to look for the deeper meaning of such scenes.Alternately charming and disturbing Undertow is a powerful film about the horrors of betrayal and family violence and the beauty of forgiveness. Highly recommended but be warned that the violence is graphic and very difficult to watch.My Rating 810".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of the more unique films you are ever going to see. It takes place in a nightmarish world that resembles backwoods Georgia circa 1973. The story centers around a father and his two sons who live in what could best be described as a dump. The father is demanding the older son a rebel and the younger son...just plain weird. Well something evil this way comes and the two sons escape into the backwoods in search of safety. While the boys are on this journey they meet interesting characters that help them in some way. It really does play like a white trash fairy tale. I applaud the effort put forward by this director. He wanted to make an escapist movie that resembles some classic midnight movie from the 1970s and he does. The performances and dialog are excellent. I recommend this film for anybody seeking something different and something entertaining.".

The story centers around a father and his two sons who live in what could best be described as a dump. The father is demanding the older son a rebel and the younger son...just plain weird. Well something evil this way comes and the two sons escape into the backwoods in search of safety. While the boys are on this journey they meet interesting characters that help them in some way. It really does play like a white trash fairy tale. I applaud the effort put forward by this director. He wanted to make an escapist movie that resembles some classic midnight movie from the 1970s and he does. The performances and dialog are excellent. I recommend this film for anybody seeking something different and something entertaining.";

	schema:reviewBody "In Undertow the third film by David Gordon Green George Washington All the Real Girls two young brothers Tim Devon Allen and Chris Jamie Bell flee their home in rural Georgia after their father Dermot Mulroney is murdered by his convict brother Deel Josh Lucas. Coproduced by Terrence Malick Undertow has aspects of a conventional thriller but it bears Green's unmistakable languid dreamy style though many are comparing it to Terrence Malick's Badlands and Charles Laughton's classic Night of the Hunter. Using an abundance of yellow brown and red tones Cinematographer Tim Orr effectively captures the atmosphere of the poor South with its abandoned spaces junkyards urban rot and backwoods pig farms. Green has a feel for the way people talk and the dialogue achieves a rare naturalism but it is not a film in the neorealist tradition. It's lyrical tone puts it in more in the land of Huck Finn and Robinson Crusoe territory reserved for myth and poetry.Using freeze frames slow motion color manipulation and transitional fades the opening sequence captures Chris's escape from his girl friend's menacing father after he accidentally breaks a window trying to alert her of his presence. Impaling his foot on a board and nail he stumbles home with his foot bleeding severely and later uses the board to make an airplane to give to his 10year old brother Tim. In a subplot makes us aware of the eccentricity of the characters Tim has some strange stomach problems and eats paint and dirt to induce vomiting a condition according to the director who suffered the same malady called pica brought on by malnourishment. The early pace is leisurely but things heat up when Uncle Deel shows up. Recently out of prison he harbors resentments against his brother for marrying his sweetheart and taking part of his inheritance of Mexican gold coins. Oddly his brother invites him to stay at the farm but we can tell that he's there for more than hominy grits and southern fried chicken. Resentment soon turns to violence and the boys threatened by the wounded uncle escape on foot seeking out food and shelter wherever it is available. On the run they undertake a nightmarish journey through forests and swamps on freight cars and foot spending time with people living on the margins a friendly black couple and some runaway girls who Chris is drawn to out of loneliness and fear. As Uncle Deel closes in the film becomes less about the chase and more about the characters and the relationship between the brothers. Jamie Bell the English actor who played Billy Eliot turns in a magnificent performance as Chris and Josh Lucas is convincing as the deranged uncle. Utilizing a haunting score by Philip Glass Undertow gradually builds its lowkey tension to a power that becomes riveting. In spite of some repetitive chase scenes and a few superfluous camera tricks it is Green's best film and deserves more than a limited release.".

	schema:reviewBody "UNDERTOW is a perplexing film one that seems like it could be a superb atmospheric contemplation of poverty and its consequences in the back roads of the South but ends in a prolonged ennui that suggests that a growing director doesn't know when excess has been met and indulged.John Munn Dermot Mulroney lives with his two sons Chris Jamie Bell and Tim Devon Alan in mud and squalor in rural Georgia a place of escape from inquisitive society after the death of his wife. Chris is lonely and curious and is repeatedly arrested for minor crimes while Tim is psychically injured and lives in an unhealthy mental state eating paint mud and anything that will make him vomit. John Munn tries valiantly to cope with being a single father of these two problematic boys but clearly needs help.Into this setting arrives Deel John's ne'redowell brother with whom he had a rocky childhood who has been recently released form prison for a crime that apparently tangentially involved John. John takes Deel in to provide shelter in exchange for helping him with his pig farm and with his boys but we soon discover that Deel's true motivation for visiting his longlost brother is to gain access to gold coins given to John and Deel by their father references to the use of gold coins to pay Charon for passage over the river Styx into Hades and the subsequent curse on these coins is explained by John to his boys.The crisis of the movie is the conflict and ultimately deadly encounter between Deel and John and when the boys observe the loss of their father they gather the coins and a backpack and begin their flight to safety. The remainder of the movie is how these two brothers learn to grow up and fend for themselves in the most difficult of circumstances and always under the threat of Deel's discovering their whereabouts. Along the way we meet some interesting if repetitively impoverished folk each adding a bit of philosophy both said and unsaid to the boys' growth. The ending is Grand Guignol and to reveal it further would be a disservice to the surprise it holds.David Gordon Green is a 30yearold director who has a penchant for tales of the impoverished South. He understands mood and atmosphere makes use of freeze frame camera angles poignantly and is able to draw unfettered realistic performances from his actors both main characters and bit players. He wisely elected to enlist the fine cinematography of Tim Orr the quasiappropriate musical score by Phillip Glass and tries to work with a shaky dialogue by screenwriter Joe Conway based on a story by Lingard Jervey. At this point in his career and yes he is the assigned director for the upcoming 'The Secret Life of Bees' he is a creative artist who needs to watch his own completed films carefully to see where he loses control of the story and allows it to disappear in the mists of bland blathering. There is so much good in his work that surely the services of a brave outspoken editor will repair his indulgences.The four main actors are all excellent Mulroney and Lucas have an unkempt ofthedirt sensuality that keeps them constantly engaging and each develops a fully realized character from the material they are given. Jamie Bell proves that he can take on tough roles and make them appear naturally simple and Devon Alan is a sensitive purveyor of a damaged boy.If there were just some way to condense this twohour film down to tolerable proportions this would be a truly fine film. Be patient with it and you will be observing the work of a director who will probably become an important voice. Grady Harp".

	schema:reviewBody "I watched Undertow at the Stockholm International Film Festival in November 2004. I had previously heard nothing about the film and it was more or less a coincidence that made med watch it. It was a pleasant experience though.Undertow is about two brothers living with their father in rural America. They live inside the woods since their father wants to keep away from other people. The oldest son Chris is a troubled kid almost always in trouble with the law. The youngest son has health problems. One day the fathers brother comes to visit recently out of prison. He stays for a while before starting a new job. Soon though there is trouble. Things happen and before long the two brothers are running from their uncle.The story here is perhaps nothing you haven't seen before at one time or another. But it's well executed and the strange almost surreal mood of the film is well maintained throughout. What stands out though in my opinion is the acting. All the main characters are acted very well. Especially Jamie Bell is excellent as the oldest brother. Also Josh Lucas does a terrific job playing the boys' unpleasant uncle.I wouldn't call this a masterpiece but it's well worth the watch. If for nothing else then at least for the acting. It was one of the better films i saw at this years film festival and i feel it's worth recommending. I rate it 610.".

And despite a fall from a second story window and multiple attacks the uncle had only a slight limp and a small cut on his forehead. It just wasn't believable and after so many stupid choices I didn't care if the entire family died. They never explained why he ate paint. They clearly didn't care about the coins so why keep running with them? How did that nasty girl not see the huge bulge from the coins in his front pocket? How did the older brother stab the uncle? Where did he go when he went underwater? Everyone was a dumb as a box of rocks except for the uncle with nine lives.".

It's not enough that something bad occurs you should be on the edge of your seat panicked about that bad thing. Throughout this entire film I could barely muster interest never mind panic. The characters rarely show any strong emotion. Even in scenes where you would expect great anger or sorrow they seem relatively apathetic and rarely change facial expressions. There is no twist no mystery just 100 minutes of talking calmly a few minutes of running and a few minutes of fighting. This movie is by far the greatest let down I've had for a film in a very long time. If you are extremely patient and are able to connect with the most unbelievable characters then by all means go ahead and watch it. If not don't waste your time. I certainly wish I hadn't. 310".

This film was so bad it's hard to find a place to start.We are 'treated' to a loser father who has dragged his weird boys into the countryside to raise pigs and live in their filth. One boy appears perfectly normal yet the movie portrays him as a criminal. He breaks a window pane to get his gf's attention and they send TWO squad cars after him fishtailing up the gravel roads in true Dukes of Hazzard style. Pathetic and AS IF. This was after the kid got a nail in a board stuck to his foot and then jumped in a river. Leave your believability at the door.His younger brother is worse much worse. He goes around eating pig crap and paint and dirt and whatever he can stuff in his weird little mouth. By the middle of the movie we were laughing insults at 'Paint boy' and asking him to please shut up his voiceovers which are endless INANE pointless! stupid and completely ANNOYING and go eat some nuclear waste and DIE for goddsake!Then we have the mysterious case of the loser father allowing his jail bird brother to stay with them after apparently the murdering psycho KILLED THE DAD'S WIFE??!!?? This is never fully explained in the movie but heavily implied.Then he's surprised when the guy tries to steal his father's inherited coins and instead of grabbing a shotgun calmly just asks the guy to put them back... the idiocy and lack of believability in this movie is stunning.So obviously which we saw 12 an hour ago and from 50000 feet he kills the dad. The stupid kids instead of running IMMEDIATELY into the woods TO THE NEAREST POLICE STATION try HIDING IN THEIR ROOM!!! OMG! This is worse than a gradeB slasher movie!!! Then when they do get away ignoring dad's station wagon btw and choosing to run on foot the killer psycho tracks them like some sort of demonic bloodhound mysteriously always finding them again.In the final scene instead of running away the older kid mysteriously decides to commit suicide by challenging the fully grown man WHO IS ARMED WITH A KNIFE to a wrestling match in a nearby slough. Predictably the kid is quickly drowned but somehow mysteriously manages to plunge the guy's knife into the guy while under water and oh yeah BEING DROWNED.Thank god they cut out the part where annoying PAINT BOY comes back and calmly sits down beside the psycho who just drowned his brother and oh talks about crap and annoying bs while the guy dies.What a complete TRAIN WRECK of a movie thank the GODS I borrowed this off my girlfriend's sister and did not have to pay a DIME to watch it. I STILL feel ripped off from my WASTED TIME though.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie would not end. It just kept going on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on. I began to wish that my house would catch fire so I would have an excuse to stop watching it.This interminable tale starts out with John Munn Dermot Mulroney and his two sons. Chris Jaime Bell is a teenage delinquent with a crush on a neighbor girl. Tim Devon Alan is the brainy kid brother with a 1970s era Bee Gees haircut who makes himself sick by eating any appalling garbage he can get his hands on. They live out in the sticks and don't interact much with the rest of the world. Then John's brother Deel Josh Lucas shows up. Deel has gotten out of prison and is looking for work. John asks him to stay and help look after his boys. Deel agrees but the reason he's really there is to find the old coins their father had. He finds the coins things go terribly wrong and the rest of the movie involves Chris Tim and Deel wandering aimlessly and pointlessly through the countryside in one of the most boring stretches of film I've ever seen or even imagined.There are so many scenes in Undertow that are so dumb and so purposeless they could only exist to stretch this story out to legitimate movielength. We get to watch John Munn eat cake! We get to see him smoke a pipe! We get to listen to Tim prattle on about chiggers! We observe Chris and Tim performing chores for a black couple! And we also get to experience the slowest speed chase in the history of anyone chasing anybody! I am not exaggerating when I say that 90 of the second half of this film is useless crud. It serves no function within the story and it has no greater thematic or emotional significance for the audience.Compounding the awesome lack of meaning and direction in this story is that these characters talk about their emotions like they're guests on the Dr. Phil show. These people are portrayed as unsophisticated country folk yet they speak as though they've been in therapy since they were born. There is nothing in this story that is left under the surface. Every last little possible nuance or subtlety is just splayed out in front of the audience as though the filmmakers were worried that this film might be a bit too smart for people. It ain't.Josh Lucas is the only actor who manages to give an even halfway decent performance and he's stuck with a character who stops making sense halfway through the film. Mulroney and his two young costars are just stiffs. Though to be fair it's not like the story is asking them for more and they fail to deliver. The characters are just blocks of wood so I suppose their uninspired work may have been a case of good acting in crappy roles.Finally there's a lot of inexplicably arty direction going on here. Something will happen and that image will be repeated again and again. The film will flash to negative for a second or the image will freeze while we still hear people talking. Slow motion is used not for some important moment in the story but for a homeless chick walking. That's all she was doing. Walking. And they put her in slowmo! None of these fancy tricks mean anything to the story or to how the audience is supposed to perceive it. I think the director simply thought they looked really cool. He was wrong.Undertow starts out like it's a family coming together movie runs into a big moment of melodrama and then mutates into this ponderous tiring idiotic drool. I can understand why someone may have thought the first half of this film was worth making. I cannot for the life of me figure out what went wrong with the second half.".

	schema:headline " Southern Gothic";
	schema:reviewBody "A Southern Gothic fairytale directed by David Gordon Green and shot by his regular DP Tim Orr and scored by Phillip Glass with a cast of superb actors young and old. Doesn't that sound too good to be true? The critical consensus when the film was originally released bar raves from Jonathan Rosenbaum and Roger Ebert and positive notices from other reputable sources such as the New York Times Village Voice AV Club and Chicago Tribune seemed to suggest basically that it was. Lots of talk about David Gordon Green and Southern Gothic being a clumsy fit totally ludicrous suggestion there being no real movie beneath the allusions and style banal criticspeak and more banal criticspeak dismissing the film as a derivative mess.I suppose my opinion is no more valid than that of those who dismissed the film but Undertow strikes me with five viewings of it under my belt as David Gordon Green's best and most interesting film. The characters are welldeveloped within the ideals and ideas of the story and film. My fiance's biggest problem with the film was the characterization of the villain played by Josh Lucas. He shows up snarling and menacing and remains so for the movie given clear motivation but hardly 'welldeveloped'. However the movie seems to be perfectly content with following the traditional style of the Southern Gothic story the chase movie and the fairytale. This villain might not be the bestdeveloped in film history but he works within the story.The screenwriters director David Gordon Green and cowriter Joe Conway an English teacher apparently you can tell just by watching the movie write their characters to fit within a certain ideal and as such one could argue that most of the characters in Undertow are mythic figures more than characters with the focus being largely on the two brothers at the core of the story played by the immensely talented young actors Jamie Bell and Devon Alan.The film's predictability appears to be an issue for many but I like how earnest Gordon Green and his cast and crew are in telling this story. I like that there's no cheap hipster irony. The reason it's predictable is that it's been done a thousand times before but clearly nobody involved thinks there was a problem with doing it again. Where I disagree with several critics and IMDb reviewers is on the idea that Undertow doesn't distinguish itself from those which came before. I disagree. All a film needs to distinguish itself is quality and Undertow has plenty of that. It's remarkably wellwritten outside some narrative confusion and Tim Orr's gloomy Southern Gothic imagery match perfectly with what is easily Phillip Glass' most underrated score and one of his very best overall creating a stark beautiful atmosphere. David Gordon Green again focuses more on ambiance and character but also seems more interested here than in his earlier films in telling a single story but does so with a decisive preference for story over 'plot'.Perhaps the victim of unfair and incorrect expectations Undertow seems to have at least held on to a relatively high reputation and hopefully will be remembered in the future for the masterpiece it is. Looked at for what it is a fanciful tale of the bond between two brothers and their journey together including numerous episodic encounters along the way again the fairytale aspect comes into play and not really the gritty chase film some critics seem to have mistaken it for Undertow is a unique triumph. A tourdeforce from a director below the age of 30 blessed with class and sophistication and intelligence and a cinematographer and composer and cast who seemed destined to make this film.".

	schema:headline " a Terence Malick production of a David Gordon Green film... so you know the stakes";
	schema:reviewBody "David Gordon Green explores the story in Undertow with an intention to tell the story but there's also an intention to explore the spaces his actors inhabit or run to or from and occasionally with the lyricism of a grungy street poet. This isn't to say the film is pretentious it can be enjoyed by those who just want a good harrowing chase movie. Yet it asks a little more for an audience complacent with the norm in Hollywood used to the conflict being simplistic with respect to the characterizations. Its presentation calls attention to a director attempting to find the thematic beats through what could otherwise be a conventional ride. It's also no mistake to make the connection to films of the 70s or specifically Terence Malick's austere visual approach Malick is credited as producer so it's bound to have some informal mark of his own somewhere.It's really a tragedy of the rural family where a single father Mulroney raising two kids Bell and Alan the older one something of a troublemaker constantly brought in to the cops. When the father's brother a perfect antagonist in Lucas gets out of prison and comes to visit it's more than a friendly family call greed and vengeance bring him there and a horrible incident occurs that sends the two children running away now with their uncle in tow. He's after some valuable old gold coins family heirlooms or sacred Mexican lot depending on what story is to be believed and nothing will stop him. Meanwhile the two kids the younger of the two pretty sick most often are left to their own devices looking for work hiding in junkyards or with the help of fellow underworld travelers.Aside from that which is the basic plot a lot of Undertow sways between tense and taut drama and action with a couple of really visceral fights and bits of violence and an understated character study. There's the performances that feel right in the thick of it with Bell giving it all in a breakout role. But it's just... hard to explain the sensibility that gives this an edge over other dramas out there. The setting is one thing where for the most part with a few exceptions Green doesn't succumb to total clichs with these southern hobos and backwoods folk or at the least there's a humanism caught by having what would appear to be nonactors in roles like convenience store clerks and towtruck drivers. And also it's the cinematography which is clear and cool and handheld for some subjective impact plus the eerie unusual score by Philip Glass.All of these punctuations on a story that is dark and compelling are abound but it's also this bond between the two brothers and the memories that they share and how memories in general work into the narrative that score Green success. It's about mood as much as plot about sorrow and anger and fear and all these things and it's never something to scoff as too artsyfartsy. It's just about right.".

In Undertow the remarkable banality of the dialogue and the quite arbitrary prolongation of the stale action at best a mediocre ugly and meaningless variation of Huckleberry Finn  awkwardly contrast with the beauty of the film's photography. While the acting of the principals the aforementioned Bell and Josh Lucas is also a credit it too cannot hide director David Gordon Green's primary interest in camera angles and unnecessary freezeframes. My point is that the screenwriter may be as necessary as if not more necessary to a distinguished film than the director or the cinematographer and that here Green's limitations are embarrassingly apparent.".

I found the freeze frames in multiple parts of the film to have little meaning and almost seem forced for no apparent reason. There is also some slow spots in the film that make you wish that the scene would hurry up and play out. These scenes again have some purpose but not anything immensely important.

Liz turns amateur psychologist to discover what's ailing Van. The Big Hangover is an amusing comedy from MGM not hardly in the top ten of films for either of its leads. It does have an interesting subplot involving discrimination and the enforcement of antidiscrimination laws that were being passed by a lot of states at this time New York among them where the story takes place. A Chinese doctor Philip Ahn is being thrown out of an apartment the owner is represented by Percy Waram's firm. Which leads to the highlight of the film and the best performance in the film by Leon Ames who plays the city attorney who is charged with enforcement of the nondiscrimination statute. After Johnson chastises him Ames gives an eloquent statement about how money and success are the gods we cherish. The Big Hangover is amusing in spots is serious in spots has a bit of trouble making its mind up whether it's a comedy or a drama of social significance.

There is good acting aplenty by the mentioned leads as well as by Leon Ames and Edgar Buchanan but the honors must go to the veteran English stage performer Percy Waram whose delivery is perfection.";

A public servant Leon Ames comes along and sensing his ideals reveals the truth to him about the people he works with. Elizabeth Taylor is the daughter of one of the partners who takes an interest in Johnson's drunken predicament and sets out to help him.At first this film is a bit aggravating because this is a onenote joke that just goes too far especially when the other partner Reynolds goes out of his way to humiliate the idealistic Johnson. Reynolds we learn is the jovial sort who puts on ladies' hats at parties just to get attention and is truly meanspirited behind his lighthearted demeanor. But when the film's message comes out you begin to see that Johnson is meant to do something more than become a ruthless attorney make a high salary and set out to bring down the little people. Taylor must discover that his high integrity is the desirable choice for a husband even though it is obvious that she has learned from her father that if one wants to be successful in business and live in the cremedelacreme of society one must be ruthless in order to get it and keep it.Reminding me of Gary Cooper's Mr. Deeds Johnson's veteran is the model of the idealistic man who has two roads to choose from with his success both in the military and in college. Like Mr. Deeds when he is discovered to be honest he is humiliated because he is trying to integrate integrity into a ruthless sector. This is where the film succeeds not with its onejoke sitcom like situation that has Johnson having drunken conversations with his dog. That results in a mixed bag although the payoff for Reynolds' obnoxious character is perfect for the epitome of the saying There's No Fool Like an Old Fool. So much for old fools wearing ladies' hats.".

This very daft premise results in a number of drunken inspired comic moments for David including interactions with his pet dog and singing out loud to the amusement of those around him. The comedic partner to this foolish fiasco is Mary Daughter of David's soon to be employer who enlist her help in an attempt to cure David of his bizarre problem and in archetypical fashion becomes his love interest.The premise is well established by the time a more serious element in form of a subplot begins to develop regarding Dr Lee a Chinese doctor who along with his Wife are forced out of their home due to overwhelming racism on part of the owners of the property and certain Lawyers who are involved including those of the establishment in which David hopes to join. Although there is nothing wrong with this subplot as it takes a honest look at racism during this period it does not fit into The Big Hangover's primary status as a zany comedy. It is impossible to go from a scene in which the antagonistic Lawyer spikes David's food to make him look ridiculous for laughs right to David confronting the people involved regarding their morality to the Dr Lee situation without as a viewer noticing the irregularity of the narrative's direction.Due to all the patchiness in tone The Big Hangover contains by the time the narrative concludes there is no real resolve to the main premise or the subplot.

Maybe I just liked all the great shots of a lovable mutt named Mike. Anyway I stayed with it and it pays off. The story has a way of setting up ludicrous scenes and then hitting you in the gut emotionally. This first happens in the Belney study with a bottle of scotch on Sunday morning and starting here the whole film worked for me culminating in the banquet scene which is written and timed and played perfectly for its purposes. THE BIG HANGOVER is ultimately a cominghomefromthewar story and gives us in later times a subversively comic insight into the heart of an era where buried grief was both shadow and spark and where society's acknowledgment of its own racism was only just beginning to gather witness from the idealistic young. Van Johnson makes us care about David and what David cares about!. The entire cast is very well managed by the writerdirector Norman Krasna.

Alas the comedy takes an offensive loutish turn while the social commentary ends up trivialized an afterthought.Van Johnson valedictorian of his law school class interns at a whiteshoe firm but hides an awkward secret.  In France during the war a bombing raid on a monastery almost caused him to drown in Napoleon brandy.  Ever since he has zero tolerance for booze in a way that's different but not entirely so from abnormal drinkers who sometimes refer to their allergy' to alcohol even a whiff sets him off into sustaining conversations with floor lamps and sheep dogs like another inebriate of that year Elwood P. Dowd. But pains are taken to stress that he's not an alcoholic.'  Luckily Elizabeth Taylor daughter of the firm's head rescues him from embarrassment and sets out to cure' him.In the Scotchandmartini days of postwar drinking maybe audiences swallowed the fallacy that Johnson's aversion to spirits was a crippling obstacle to his happiness and success at one juncture he even laments Why couldn't I just have been shot in the war?'  The unthinkable is never proposed  that like millions of others with and without problems he simply abstain.Then about halfway through the movie suddenly springs its serious' theme. Johnson is lied to about an incident of antiAsian discrimination in which his firm is involved this seems courageous until it dawns that a Jim Crow incident could never have been used.  Everything comes to a head at a selfcongratulatory banquet where the partners  with the connivance of their wives  become merry old pranksters spiking Johnson's soup in hopes that he'll discredit himself.  But Taylor at his side Johnson surmounts his disability and blows a clarion call for truth justice and the American way.Appealing performances by Johnson Taylor Leon Ames Gene Lockhart and many others help the movie go down rather smoothly.  But then The Big Hangover lives up to its title afterwards It's foolish unpleasant and regrettable.".

Dowd. But pains are taken to stress that he's not an alcoholic.'  Luckily Elizabeth Taylor daughter of the firm's head rescues him from embarrassment and sets out to cure' him.In the Scotchandmartini days of postwar drinking maybe audiences swallowed the fallacy that Johnson's aversion to spirits was a crippling obstacle to his happiness and success at one juncture he even laments Why couldn't I just have been shot in the war?'  The unthinkable is never proposed  that like millions of others with and without problems he simply abstain.Then about halfway through the movie suddenly springs its serious' theme. Johnson is lied to about an incident of antiAsian discrimination in which his firm is involved this seems courageous until it dawns that a Jim Crow incident could never have been used.  Everything comes to a head at a selfcongratulatory banquet where the partners  with the connivance of their wives  become merry old pranksters spiking Johnson's soup in hopes that he'll discredit himself.  But Taylor at his side Johnson surmounts his disability and blows a clarion call for truth justice and the American way.Appealing performances by Johnson Taylor Leon Ames Gene Lockhart and many others help the movie go down rather smoothly.  But then The Big Hangover lives up to its title afterwards It's foolish unpleasant and regrettable.";

	schema:headline " Guaranteed Liz is always worth watching";
	schema:reviewBody "I only saw this one because I always watch anything with Elizabeth Taylor and she never disappoints. It's an odd little movie with a typical screwball comedy gimmick that also veers in and out of social commentary. The gimmick is that Van Johnson was a WWII Army Air Corps pilot who got wounded and had to recuperate in an Alpine monastery basement that was filled with barrels of brandy. The Luftwaffe bombed the monastery and Johnson spent 14 hours being literally up to his nose in brandy. The experience gave him psychological issues with alcohol. If he drinks even the tiniest amount he instantly gets fallingdown hallucinating blind drunk but in a comical way. After the war he becomes valedictorian at his law school and gets hired by an uppercrust law firm owned by Elizabeth Taylor's father. Liz is an eyepopping 18yearsold at this point and she plays yet another headstrong daughter of a rich guy. It's a role she could play in her sleep but Liz was the consummate professional and she always gave great value no matter what the part. Here she's a hawkeyed meddler who immediately appraises Johnson as possible husband material but first she has to fix his alcohol problem. She used to work for one of New York's top psychiatrists so she takes it upon herself to provide Johnson's therapy.Meanwhile the social commentary comes in when the law firm is retained by a bigtime real estate company to prevent a Chinese doctor from moving into one of their apartments. Johnson gets accidentally entangled in this situation and he feels very strongly about helping the doctor out. There's some drunken slapstick throughout the film and it alternates jarringly with the racial injustice aspects.At any rate Liz comes through with another radiant performance same as always. Also she wears another topshelf wardrobe again same as always. She even does some reaction shots where she arches her eyebrows and makes her entire hairline move up and down. I never noticed her do that before.Anyway if you're a Liz fan you'll appreciate this flick. It's only 82 minutes long and it zips right along. A topnotch cast gets a lot of crisp dialogue which they all deliver with admirable aplomb. All that plus an 18yrold Elizabeth Taylor. It can't get any better.".

	schema:reviewBody "'The Big Hangover' did intrigue me. The premise sounded very silly but it seemed oddly interesting and comedy and seriousness together has been done well on film a number of times. Love classic film too but the biggest drawer was the cast full of performers that are generally watchable. Elizabeth Taylor especially at her best was great.Not much to add to what has been said very well by the other commentators but 'The Big Hangover' took its potentially silly premise and executes it in an even sillier and at times utterly bizarre fashion. It is not a terrible film and has merits but it mostly left me cold despite on paper liking and admiring what it was trying to do and say. It just didn't come together and came over as strange and not in a particularly good way.Its best asset is the cast. Van Johnson excels in a difficult role the subdued quality to his acting fitting the character well while Taylor charms and looks lovely in one of her earliest adult character roles exuding a good deal of warmth. All the supporting cast fare well but the standout performance came from Leon Ames who is amusing and sincere with the highlight moment of the film.Visually it looks good shot with a lot of effort and care. The music fits nicely and is pleasant enough in its own right. There are some amusing moments thanks to some expert comic timing from the cast and also moments of charm. Ames' speech at the end strikes a chord and is very memorable by far the highlight of the writing.However 'The Big Hangover' didn't for me come together as a mix of comedy and seriousness and both on their own are patchy in how they come across. The comedy has too many moments where it is far too silly and contrived and the seriousness veers on too preachy. The low point was the dinner party scene as a scene it was misplaced and the humour was distasteful. The racism subplot was well intended but suffered from having the subtlety of a sledgehammer. The direction is hardly inept but somewhat uninspired and with not much distinction.From a story perspective any worries of it being silly does come true sadly and in a way that's very contrived and try too hard. It's also rather disjointed in trying to balance the comedy and seriousness and having too many instances of the shifts in tone being too abrupt and jarring creating the bizarreness factor and the sense that the film wasn't completely sure what it wanted to be. The script could have done with more sharpness and focus and while the film is not dull as such there is not an awful lot that engages properly there are moments but one wants a film consistent all the way through.Overall well cast and has some good moments but a very odd film. 510 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "Saw the world premiere showing of the Good Night at the Sundance Film Festival last week and have come to report back on my findings. Was really looking forward to this one story sounded interesting in an Eternal Sunshine kinda way and the cast is top notch. The Good Night stars Martin Freeman as former brit pop star Gary who hasn't exactly been doing a whole lot since his famed band went on the skids. Gary lives a less then fulfilling life with his long time girlfriend Dora played by the excellent Gywenth Paltrow and keeps company with successful ex bandmate Paul played by the hilarious Simon Pegg. Gary spends his days doing meaningless commercial gigs in which his creative talents are kept in check in order to create more familiar music that sounds like the theme from Cheers. Understandably Gary needs an outlet from his less then stellar career and from his almost nonexistent relationship with Dora. One night Garys finds that outlet in his dreams more specifically in the perfect female form played by Penelope Cruz. Desperate to escape reality Gary finds himself wanting more to live in his sleeping life then in his real life and he finds an unusual guide in Mel played by Danny Devito. Mel mentors Gary on this lucid dreaming and soon Gary finds himself mastering his dreams but in reality his good nights are turning into bad days. Sounds interesting but does it work well not so much. Much like a dream the story is scatter shot and incomplete. We only get a glimpse into the characters lives and as the story goes along we still don't have a lot of info here. Does Gary want to be a pop star again is he jealous of the success of his friend does he really care about his girlfriend  did he ever and whats so special about his dream girl? Gary is as lost in life as he is on the audience he feels distant as do most of the characters here aside from the amusing Paul. In the end this movie just doesn't quite work out maybe it wasn't supposed just like a dream. All that being said its a nice first movie by Jake Paltrow he's got a good vision and his effort here is obviously promising but frankly the story was beneath his directing talents. As for the actors Martin Freeman Gywenth Devito  all very good work but again the story just is soso and the acting can't save that. The Good Night just a decent night at the movies".

The Good Night stars Martin Freeman as former brit pop star Gary who hasn't exactly been doing a whole lot since his famed band went on the skids. Gary lives a less then fulfilling life with his long time girlfriend Dora played by the excellent Gywenth Paltrow and keeps company with successful ex bandmate Paul played by the hilarious Simon Pegg. Gary spends his days doing meaningless commercial gigs in which his creative talents are kept in check in order to create more familiar music that sounds like the theme from Cheers. Understandably Gary needs an outlet from his less then stellar career and from his almost nonexistent relationship with Dora. One night Garys finds that outlet in his dreams more specifically in the perfect female form played by Penelope Cruz. Desperate to escape reality Gary finds himself wanting more to live in his sleeping life then in his real life and he finds an unusual guide in Mel played by Danny Devito. Mel mentors Gary on this lucid dreaming and soon Gary finds himself mastering his dreams but in reality his good nights are turning into bad days. Sounds interesting but does it work well not so much. Much like a dream the story is scatter shot and incomplete. We only get a glimpse into the characters lives and as the story goes along we still don't have a lot of info here. Does Gary want to be a pop star again is he jealous of the success of his friend does he really care about his girlfriend  did he ever and whats so special about his dream girl? Gary is as lost in life as he is on the audience he feels distant as do most of the characters here aside from the amusing Paul. In the end this movie just doesn't quite work out maybe it wasn't supposed just like a dream. All that being said its a nice first movie by Jake Paltrow he's got a good vision and his effort here is obviously promising but frankly the story was beneath his directing talents. As for the actors Martin Freeman Gywenth Devito  all very good work but again the story just is soso and the acting can't save that. The Good Night just a decent night at the movies";

	schema:reviewBody "It's pretty obvious that firsttime directorscreenwriter Jake Paltrow was heavily inspired by Michel Gondry's surreal offkilter work in The Science of Sleep and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind in making this downbeat 2007 dramedy. Barely in theaters before heading right to DVD the film works on an intriguing albeit unoriginal premise but is then undermined by a muddy execution and unlikable characters despite some nice visuals. The plot concerns putupon Gary a TV commercial jingle writer who was once an '80's Britpop star. His professional life has become a drudge as he begrudgingly works with his best pal and former bandmate Paul who has sold his soul to become a successful advertising executive. Meanwhile life at home is no picnic since Gary has to suffer from the constant passiveaggressive derision of his frumpy needling girlfriend Dora.Into this emotional void Gary starts to have vivid dreams of a beautiful fantasy woman named Anna who turns out to have a basis in reality. It's no wonder that Gary seeks the counsel of a lucid dreaming expert from New Jersey named Mel who helps him find ways to elongate the dreams for fear of having them evaporate entirely. Once all this is all established Paltrow lets the film flail around in a series of frustrating scenes that have Gary turning more and more into an emotional zombie. Moreover the marked contrast between Dora and Anna comes across as overstated with the result being complete indifference toward both women. Paltrow also uses a framing device of documentarylike testimonials from colleagues in Gary's past a technique that doesn't make sense until the abrupt ending. None of the principal actors are terribly remarkable here except Simon Pegg Shaun of the Dead Hot Fuzz who brings a muchneeded energetic brio to the comically unsavory role of Paul. His cutting scenes with Gary are the best the movie offers.As Gary Martin Freeman BBC's The Office Breaking and Entering is likeably dweeby at first though he doesn't make credible his past as a debauched rock star. Danny DeVito merely plays a plot device in his customary matter and not much more as Mel. No matter how gorgeous she is and she truly is in this film Penlope Cruz is given short shrift by the script so much so that her character remains incoherent and incomplete. But ironically a worse fate befalls the filmmaker's famous sister Gwyneth who has been so deglamorized as Dora as to render her character nearly unsalvageable. Granted there are some funny offthecuff bits like Dora reacting to Gary's maniacal installation of foam over the bedroom windows by asking if it comes in white or Gary inexplicably reading The Idiot's Guide to Understanding Iraq in bed but there isn't enough such cleverness to sustain the film. At 93 minutes it actually feels overlong. The 2008 DVD provides a rather inchoate commentary from Jake Paltrow that is not very insightful.".

	schema:reviewBody "I see that this movie isn't wellreceived. . .? . . . I loved it!I like dark humor and subtlety and a script that trusts the viewer enough to simply suggest what's happening and this movie satisfies all of that. Written and directed by Jake Paltrow starring a mostly British cast of Martin Freeman sister Gwyneth Penelope Cruz Simon Pegg and Danny DeVito in a strange ensemble none of whom seem to really know one another. There's a sense that this movie isn't really happening that the characters aren't sure who or what they are to one another that the action may or may not be delusional dream? notdream? the boundary edges of reality have been softened or erased to the point of ambiguity. I believe this is what the director was striving for and he got it perfectly. I am still reeling by the few comments I saw that disliked this movie were we watching the same flick? Jake has captured the ennui and uncertainty of intimate relationships especially when artistic personalities are involved. Wishes are faded hopes for success mega or otherwise are withering or stunted and the concept of dreaming becomes itself part of the uncertainty of the storylinean uncertainty purposefully part of the script. We live our dreams we get caught up in our dreams yet our dreams exist often aside from how we live. And who's to say what's real? Is night consciousness less or more than daytime consciousness? Nothing is 100 real.I don't want to give anything away. I hate spoilers if I haven't seen a movie and don't want to even accidentally mention something that would detract from another's enjoyment of discovery. Freeman's character is going through a minor meltdown his life increasingly one on the outside looking in. He's married but the love and desire has diminished for both of them. He seeks help from a most unlikely and most unprofessional pseudotherapist DeVito and the reality of his life begins to unravel as he struggles the more to make sense of it all. It is a brilliant study of a mentally ill and conflicted world with pervasive fears and worries. The cast is excellent. Couldn't be better.I love this movie. I love its dark humor and its subtlety. Well done Jake!".

	schema:reviewBody "Saw this one.... loved it. Variety sums it up perfectly.Sweet dreams indeed. As becalmed and refreshing as a good night's sleep writerdirector Jake Paltrow's first feature delves assuredly into the mind of a lost soul who literally encounters the woman of his dreams. Though its forays into the subconscious may strike more adventurous cinematic palettes as precious and unimaginative few will be able to resist Martin Freeman's appealing lead turn or the wry Brit wit that gives this fanciful confection a robust comic core. Given the right push emphasizing its marquee names The Good Night could hit sleeper status. Compared to David Lynch's convulsive dreamscapes and Michel Gondry's The Science of Sleep  all films that seek to strand the viewer in an impenetrable chain of dream logic  The Good Night's fascination with hallucination and reverie doesn't go much deeper than the surface level. Fortunately it's an enchanting surface that doesn't wear out its welcome for a good 93 minutes.Puzzling mockdoc prologue introduces a trio of characters discussing the life of sadsack musician Gary Sheller in tones of hushed regret. Of the three only Paul Shaun of the Dead's Simon Pegg plays a part in the story that follows set two years earlier.Gary Freeman is a thirtysomething Londoner now living in New York a nice but hapless bloke with all the detritus of a movie midlife crisis. Since his band broke up seven years ago he has eked out a living scoring TV commercials to the increasing chagrin of his mildly depressive livein girlfriend Dora the helmer's sister Gwyneth Paltrow. Even worse Gary's friend and former bandmate Paul is doing quite well for himself in an advertising career.Given Dora's irritable demeanor and Gary's tendency to aggravate it by saying exactly the wrong thing it's no surprise that their love life is mutually unsatisfying. So when Gary starts having recurring dreams about a beguiling mystery woman Penelope Cruz who seems to offer more of herself to him every night they have a rejuvenating effect. Wanting more he takes an active interest in lucid dreaming  the act of becoming aware of and even controlling one's dream state  getting all sorts of tips from a New Agey selfstyled expert an amusing Danny DeVito.Gary's growing obsession with manipulating his nocturnal entertainment  he soundproofs his bedroom and gets cranky whenever he's awakened middream  doesn't improve his relationship with Dora somehow even Paul's foolhardy dalliances in cybersex manage to widen the rift. Eventually Dora announces they need time apart and jets off to Venice leaving Gary to indulge his fantasies to the fullest.But after a wideawake Gary sees Anna's face plastered on the side of a bus he soon learns she's a reallife model whose actual name Melodia strikes a rather obvious note and Paul all too conveniently books her for a commercial. The foundation for Gary's discovery and facetoface meeting with his fantasy lover isn't particularly welllaid but by this point the script has set a fascinating structural dilemma for itself and Gary and Melodia's waking interactions easily compel one's interest and anticipation.Subsequent plot turns are anything but predictable and the tale begins to take on a quiet gravity as Gary's fantasy life is increasingly infected by his reality. The moving denouement is both a testament to the power and necessity of dreams and a bittersweet acknowledgment of their limitations.With so many firsttime helmers lately piling on the flash and visual gimmickry the measured pacing and almost crystalline purity of Jake Paltrow's direction can't help but come as a soothing relief. The filmmaking is arguably too tasteful at times intriguing as they are Gary's dream sequences are absent any real sense of mystery or danger and the use of stately fadeins and fadeouts as delineating markers leads to some rhythmic awkwardness. In The Science of Sleep dreams and reality blurred together inscrutably here they exist opaquely sidebyside.Best known Stateside for The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and the BBC's The Office Freeman carries the movie in his sleep so to speak showing terrific leadingman chops in a delightfully shaggy selfeffacing role. Continuing her dowdybrunette look from Running With Scissors Gwyneth Paltrow comes through with a prickly witty characterization that despite a maudlin streak occasionally lets the sun peek through.Supporting perfs are similarly well handled. Looking as ravishing as she did in Volver with no small help from Verity Hawkes' splendid costumes including one striking white tux Cruz breaks her socalled Englishlanguage curse with a role that requires her to be seductive and not much else. Needless to say she acquits herself admirably. And Pegg with his crack comic timing pockets every other scene as Gary's lovable bastard of a best friend.Production design is aces the predominantly gray scheme of Gary and Dora's dreary apartment providing a Wizard of Ozlike contrast with the vivid colors and textures of the film's dreamscape Giles Nuttgen's cinematography astutely follows in kind. Alec Puro's unobtrusively melodic score which incorporating a tender composition Gary writes late in the picture plays an especially significant role.Gothamset pic was largely filmed in London  a disjunction that given the film's Anglophilic bent almost makes sense.".

Many parts of the film are sweet but in general it drags and refuses to flesh out the characters enough to make us really care.

	schema:reviewBody "If indie dramas are to believed there are essentially two reasons why there is so much unhappiness in the world at least among the more privileged classes who have the time and resources to think of such things a people can't stand the idea of being alone in the world yet they also can't stand the idea of being with another person for long stretches of time either and b it's hard to come to terms with the contrast between what we imagined our life would be like and what it actually turned out to be.A case in point is The Good Night a midlifecrisis drama with a surrealistic twist. Gary is a songwritermusician who used to be part of a band but who has now been reduced to writing commercial jingles and scores for secondrate TV shows. A somewhat deglamorized Gwyneth Paltrow plays Gary's nagging longtime girlfriend who's definitely become disenchanted with their relationship while the ultraglamorous Penelope Cruz stars as the literal woman of his dreams  until she materializes and becomes a part of his waking world that is. In fact a fairly large chunk of the movie's running time is taken up with Gary's dreams which inevitably feature this alluring figure who stands in obvious counterpoint to Dora's fleshandblood imperfections. And then there's Danny De Vito as the scenestealing New Age dreamwhisperer who attempts to maneuver Gary through his crisis.The point of the film written and directed by Jake Paltrow brother of Gwyneth seems to be that ideal worlds and ideal relationships exist only in dreams and that if you want to survive and maybe even find a little bit of happiness in this life you had better start accepting some compromises and limitations and not as Voltaire once opined make the perfect the enemy of the good. Even Gary's dreamwoman is eventually unmasked as a relatively pedestrian fashion model who definitely does not live up to the dreams and fantasies Gary has about her before he meets her in the actual flesh.The movie does a nice job transitioning back and forth between the world of reality and the world of dreams and the actors demonstrate an astute understanding of the roles they are playing. Some of the conversations and arguments the lovers engage in are almost too painfully realistic at times with Dora in particular unloading her feelings on Gary to withering effect.It's not exactly a worldshaking human drama but it offers some insightful observations into those maddeningly messy things we euphemistically call romantic relationships.".

	schema:headline " Good old fashioned dark comedy";
	schema:reviewBody "There's something about dreams that requires relaxation and patience. They have a certain fluidity about them that if they're hurried or rushed they just aren't as effective. As is fitting for a film about dreams The Good Night works because of good acting and gentle pacing. The result is one of those good old fashioned dark comedies that walks the line between drama and dark humor.Martin Freeman is one of these actors that takes grips on the average guy role and has as much fun as he can with it. As Gary the band member turned commercial music composer he is effective in demonstrating his lack of joy in his current relationship with Dora Gwyneth Paltrow and sinking into obsessive dreams about the make believe Anna Penelope Cruz. Freeman is always a good lead because no matter what he does he's likable and we're always rooting him on even as Dora calls him a jerk and she's probably right at one point.But a lot of the humor in the film comes from the supporting players. Simon Pegg is always a no brainer for comedy because of his spot on delivery. As Gary's friend and boss Paul he jumps into the role of the somewhat amoral friend with his own relationship problems. However he does still listen to Gary and even takes joy in some of his obsessiveness.Then there's Danny Devito playing the typical Danny Devito character as he hosts a dream support group but works odd jobs and hasn't had a relationship of his own for over 40 years. Despite all this he still hears Gary out and Gary takes a lot of his advice. Devito has a lot of good one liners and a very funny introduction scene.As to the movie as a whole it's good but not great. Definitely worth a look. Part of me saw this as a dark comedy going through the motions and becoming very predictable as we got closer to the end. The premise was very fresh though and director Jake Paltrow really seizes the opportunity of capturing the dreamlike quality of some of the scenes. The performances and well paced direction really glue the movie together though and at 90 minutes it's not a bad movie to give a watch.".

The guy broke his leg for heaven's sake. That's not to say there's nothing enjoyable about this film but it's very little. It's okay if director's debut doesn't smash box office records or win three Palms in Venice. But Paltrow should dig deeper into his subject before making any other movie at all.

Zach Helms' script for Stranger Than Fiction 810 is the romcom answer to the theme of art and reality being interchangeable as expressed also in Adaptation 910. Jake Paltrow's The Good Night is an indiedramedy look at the subconscious vs. reality theme CK nails in Malkovich and Eternal Sunshine both 1010. This film tells the story of Gary Martin Freeman a 30 something exrocker scoring commercials in New York. His stagnant relationship with an artdealer girlfriend Gwynneth Paltrow and his complicated brotherly friendship with an egotistical exbandmate and boss Simon Pegg give him little fulfillment. So he turns to a lucid dreams with an exotic dream girl Penelope Cruz. But when both the dreams and his real life seem to unravel he struggles to fix both.The story is certainly not innovative but it is welldeveloped and the characters are interesting enough. The movie feels very authentic and sincere which makes it worth sitting through. Jake Paltrow is not a particularly inventive director but the camerawork is generally competent and the dream sequences are nicely photographed.The real highlights of the film are the subtle supporting performances by director's sister Gwen and the brilliant Simon Pegg. Freeman's role is pretty typical of his other work but he carries the movie reasonably well. Devito and Cruz are both dull and distracting in their roles. It would have been better if their parts had been given to lesserknown actors who would have cared more about the production.A rental of this movie is certainly worth 90 minutes of your evening.".

I just for a change want to give a simple and highly personal opinion as a viewer looking for a nights entertainment with a new movie. I had never seen any trailers or read any articles on the movie so I had no idea what to expect but how could I resist a movie with such an interesting blend of some top notch USUK performers? But that was part of the problem that I'll come to later.Right from the outset I was disoriented. The context and frame of the story were laid out using an opening series of documentary style interviews with both real and fictional characters. Why? It is a fictional story so adding Jarvis Cocker correctly billed as he is in real life threw me. It added nothing except confusion and took me a long time into the film to realise I was watching a completely fictional tale and no further real life characters were going to pop up.The storyline and performances were deliberately low key in order to underscore and enhance the main theme which was one of escape from tedium routine and the commitment required in real life. Because of this it is easy to see how Martin Freeman was chosen for the central character as he is a master of the droll. But not wanting to take anything away from any of the fine cast this created an imbalance which played on my mind throughout. Martin Freeman is a good actor and perfect for the part but would have thrived better if he had been supported by talented yet less famous actorsactresses. As it was he was supported by actors with a much higher Hollywood profile so I was always mindful of upstaging even if not deliberate. As it turned out Gwynneth Paltrow Simon Pegg and Danny DeVito managed to restrain their performances in keeping with the theme of the movie and in deference to Martin Freemans leading role. No easy job especially for DeVito but they managed it well in the end.The premise as it developed was interesting. Quite by accident MF found the promise of a life within his dreams that he had always desired. But could he manage to control it to the extent that he could influence its outcome? Could he find a way that this dreamworld could become his new reality? Thereafter the premise shifted to whether all of this perfect fantasy was in fact a better solution than the real world had to offer and at the end of that road how would it change us as human beings? Interesting and challenging enough to entertain no doubt. The outcome will surprise few but satisfy many.Overall I was entertained and felt that I had good value. I cannot recall a movie with precisely the same themes as this however it does flirt outrageously with many other movies that weave reality with surreality such as Eternal Sunshine as one of the better examples and because it does not explore any of it's unique aspects to any real depth I feel it is impossible not to classify it in this genre.".

	schema:reviewBody "Being a fan of Gwyneth Paltrow and Penelope Cruz seeing the neat looking poster and having an interest in the exploration of dreams in films I decided to give The Good Night a try. Little did I know the nightmare that would become the next hour of my life. The Good Night has an inadequate exposition it's a poorly introduced and explained film that flatlines for the first hour. If The Good Night would've supplied the theaters showing it with sleeping masks like 3D movies handing out glasses it would've been a more enjoyable night out.I love watching films about our dreams. When filmmakers make us think about our subconscious when we rest and the truths we realize about ourselves are extremely interesting to me. The only truth Martin Freeman learns about his dreams until the third act is how much he wants to have sex with Penelope Cruz. The storyline of the film doesn't warrant the film's existence. The Good Night tries to comment on a midlife crisis but inaccurately musters up a conventional musty representation of one. The simple thoughts the filmmakers built the film on could've been the starting point of intriguing ideas but instead feel like they were tomatoes cut in half placed on hot pavement under the sun on the hottest day of the year. Every idea is dried up and are roasted by the lack of effort. The first hour contains some really awful dialogue on top of the lack of development behind the plot. The person who designed Gwyneth Paltrow's character's look should've been fired her unflattering hair is the thing I focused on most of her screen time due to lack of interest in The Good Night's thirdrate production.A thought that I literally squealed out of my mouth during The Good Night was How did this script and director attract this cast? The cast is not as ghastly as the rest of the film. Gwyneth Paltrow actually delivers a few great scenes throughout and the film finally begins to wake up when Penelope Cruz's character is not just a figment of the imagination anymore Cruz is much to thank for the film's kick in the ass to at least shift out of reverse. The one upside of the script is the occasional sincere quotes about life. The Good Night does begin to look up in the last half hour. It finally starts to dig deeper into the PaltrowFreeman relationship I began to feel this trip wasn't completely waste of my time. When I was watching The Good Night I had no clue who the director was that I was throwing insults at in my head. After finishing I was informed it was none other than Gwyneth Paltrow's brother Jake Paltrow. When the talent was being divvied up in the family it's clear Jake wasn't given the fair amount. The Good Night is poorly made and dreadfully thought up though the film's last act begins to rectify the harm of the first hour there's no salvaging the departed film. The bottom line is The Good Night shouldn't have been telling us how to have a midlife crisis it should've been living one. It's unmistakably obvious The Good Night isn't even as deep as the paper in which its script has been typed on.Rating 4Grade C".

Or does he?Starring none other than beloved hobbit Martin Freeman as Gary the cast is wellsupported by Gwyneth Paltrow Danny DeVito and the ever gorgeous Penlope Cruz. The film starts off rather slow dull and uninteresting which in retrospect fits in well with the overall storyline. One night he dreams of meeting a strange beautiful woman on the beach Cruz as Anna but is awakened before he can go further. A turning point is reached when Gary seeks the advice of a lucid continuous dreaming expert DeVito and begins to see more and more of Anna and eventually forms a dreamstate relationship with her gradually losing touch with his lessthanstellar reality.As mentioned this is a somewhat familiar tale and one that's been treated quite a bit in films. Starcrossed lovers who can only meet in dreams dreams being better than real life which part of the film is real and which is not  they've all arguably been done before but I still enjoyed this director's take on it.

FOX AND HIS FRIENDS dates back to 1975 and remains one of Fassbinder's most successful films. As with all of his films Fassbinder deals with the homosexual subculture in Germany but his main message goes far beyond the characters he creates the examination of how people manipulate people for personal gain and the destruction that produces is a recurring problem and one that this film certainly explores.'Fox'  a nickname of Franz Bieberkopf  acted with consummate skill by Fassbinder himself is a lower class gay carny kid whose lover is arrested leaving the carnival to collapse and leaving Fox without support. Enter handsome Max Karlheinz Bhm a wealthy antiques dealer who picks up Fox helps him buy the requisite 'lottery ticket' on which Fox bases his hopes for financial survival ! via manipulative means and takes him home introducing Fox to his gay friends who regard Fox as scum but show obvious physical attraction to his rawness. Surprisingly Fox wins the lottery and suddenly has 500000 DMs and with his new money Max's friends abruptly see a target for obtaining that money. One of the friends named Eugen Peter Chatel takes Fox in as a lover and talks him into investing in Eugen's family business of bookbinding. Eugen's father Wolf Adrian Hoven and mother Ulla Jacobsson tolerate their son's life with a low class wretch ridiculing his manners and lack of culture and education but willingly take his money to salvage their business.With a lover and a business and a role model to make him suave Fox dons fancy clothes banters with his old friends in a tawdry club and makes the pretenses that at last he is secure and happy. But in time Fox is blamed for problems at the business and when his funds have been depleted on expensive vacations and apartments by the smarmy selfcentered Eugen Fox realizes that now without money he has no 'fancy friends' no lover no security and his life becomes unbearable the ending to the film is a tragedy beyond description.Some would say the film is mannered in ways that depict stereotypes of the gay world effeminate men transvestites opportunists hustlers etc but Fassbinder is completely honest in his attempt to recreate a subculture of a specific time in Germany. And the characters are well written and well acted allowing us to look at Fassbinder's greater picture of depravity between social class antipathies. In many ways this is a difficult film to watch but Fassbinder wisely places the main character whom he enacts in a place where his foibles and lack of higher class knowledge can be at once very humorous as well as pitiable. FOX AND HIS FRIENDS has some minor flaws but it has already become a classic in gay cinema repertoire. In German with English subtitles. Grady Harp".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm continually blown away with Fassbinder. And it's all the more affecting because like all great artists he challenges your conceptions and forces you to have a new experience. We have to fight our way through his movie critiquing everything we see. Fox is sure he will win the lottery. Today will be the day. And he does. Like the ending of Ordet this is a clich embraced but why? Fassbinder is far too intelligent and original a talent to be conventional without a reason. In fact in a regular movie Fox's lottery win would be a thrilling setpiece sitting in front of a TV screen in a living room with some dying family member in a hospital bed awaiting money for treatment. Here we don't even see the win. Of course the lottery win is a setup for the way money affects a relationship especially in gay culture. Basically Fassbinder is truth. There's a much more honest depiction of factory work here than in say von Trier's later films where he dotes on the common man just as often woman as if a simpleton that we should feel sorry for I doubt they feel sorry for themselves von Trier just obliges us to feel that way on their behalf. The mistakes made here are by the controllers of the factory  it's Fox's scheming lover's father who gets the business bankrupt and it's Fox after he lends his lover money to get them out of debt who screws up the printing. But Fox isn't humiliated by his mistake whereas a blind helpless Bjork in Dancer in the Dark is made to be a pitiable object. To be fair both Fassbinder and von Trier have a tendency to wallow in the miserable. Fassbinder focuses his film mainly on the class barrier  Fox's lover makes insulting comments to him regarding proper manners  but he's also giving us a kind of gay relationship film noir  we see exlovers kissing in a ceiling mirror! behind current lovers' backs and money corruption plays a large part in the film. Fox's lover is excellent in his role he never plays a character who's sole purpose for living is to plot in a corner about how he'll be evil today. And Fassbinder's view of society as something that destroys people is very noirish Fox isn't completely in the dark he does understand he's being used as it's happening. But to be sure Fassbinder is also detailing the upperclass homosexual in a very critical way but I think he could have done much more exposing the shallowness of gay culture. He mainly treats Fox's lover and his exsecret lover with peekingthroughkeyhole disdain no doubt partly from Fox's perspective but I find that somewhat childish and not terribly interesting. It's the view of someone who's been screwed over and feels depressed about it not someone intent on exposing why people are corrupt and how. You don't know quite how to feel about this in a way Fassbinder is very brave  he casts himself in an incredibly unromantic role. And at the same time it's interesting because while Fassbinder doesn't seem too pleased with the superficial manner of the gays whose eyes immediately fixate on money and looks his own film features an abundance of male nudity early on of young very attractive boys that Fox himself is quite attracted to.On a more technical aspect there are plenty of interesting shots of reflections or obscurities or of the backs of heads or bodies one particularly standout scene is the one where Fox and his lover are vacationing in Morocco and cruise for a man and when in a taxi with him the camera observes the festival around them while we listen to their discussion. The man they pick up is Ali from Fear Eats the Soul and many of Fassbinder's stable appear in the film. The fact that it's Ali playing a Moroccan  albeit one that's ostensibly gay so it may not in fact be Ali  gives the film a selfreferential bent though it's never gimmicky rather a continuous web of obsessions there is a comment on racism inputted in this scene as well. The ending of the film is a bit too cruel and heavyhanded though the pessimist in me appreciates it the part of me that believes society is a pitiless social system out to wreck anything with a pureness of soul. 910".

	schema:reviewBody "From the opening strains of lilting carnival music set against a colorful fairground swarming with people there's no doubt about Fassbinder's goal in this film To show the insanity and the depravity of the world in all its hectic disgrace. This extended metaphor smoothly gives way to the story as Klaus Fox's manager and boyfriend is arrested we meet Fox's drunken sister Fox meets Max Fox wins the lottery and Fox makes his notorious friends. All these events happen in rapid succession but when the plot slows down a little Fox has a new lover Eugen a slick highbrow conman. Fox doesn't realize it at the time but when he utters the words There's no one that can't be had Eugen agrees completely albeit in silence. Eugen proceeds to take Fox on a ride milking him for money to save his father's failing company a posh apartment and the furniture for it fancy clothes a vacation to Morocco and a car. Fox loses everything and kills himself but that's to be expected in a Fassbinder film.The irony in the U.S. title Fox and His Friends is twofold. His old friends the ones who hang out in the bar he frequents the ones who are down to earth and genuine are the same ones he no longer has any use for. His new friends the ones who are well cultured the ones who make fun of him behind his back and criticize him to his face the ones who fleece him for every penny he has are the ones he can't get himself away from. The lives of Fox's friends from both sides get tangled together as they all watch Fox sink lower and lower and do nothing to help him. Fox and His Friends is a good enough title for this film but the original title Faustrecht der Freiheit Fist Fight of Freedom in English is much more telling. Fox wants to be happy and happiness is freedom but he is far too vulnerable and trusting to attain either in the world he's living in. A world where no one is trustworthy and worse than that everyone is amoral and selfish. The characters in this movie are all involved a metaphorical fist fight where only the strong survive where only those who are willing to connive cheat trick and steal are going to come out on top.Just like in life no one in this film is entirely sympathetic once you get to know them. Fox is the most likable character but even he has questionable morals. This aspect of the film is highlighted in Fox and Eugen's first conversation where Fox declares that there are three types of people in the world Those who are clean those who wash and those who stink no matter how much they wash themselves. He goes on to say that the latter is okay because some people like a little stink. This declaration of humanity sums up what Fassbinder is trying to say in this film and many more. The statement is matched by the visual fragmentation of the characters who rarely shown in the whole are instead fragmented by stray objects windowpanes or mirrors. The scenes of the fair the boutiques the bars and Morocco are all lies as Fassbinder lays these colorful settings under truth after truth about the drab and mundane world in which we live. In the end Max and Karl representing the best of each of Fox's groups of friends find Fox dead from doctor prescribed sleeping pills in a subway station and decide to leave him there because they don't want to get involved.At first it seems that Fassbinder has nothing good to say about human nature. That people are bad and Fox the world weary victim is an exception to the rule. But if Fox is an exception couldn't there be other exceptions too? Surely Fox isn't one of a kind. After all he's not a very exceptional person. Ultimately the message here is bittersweet that one can be happy but they have to fight for it with their life. Fox takes it one step further and sacrifices his life for happiness. Or rather because of his lack of it in life.".

And his intentions were realized since it's not about homosexuals persay but about class. In the film Fox Fassbinder himself in part of the title role is a carnival worker Fox and the Severed Head the act is and in a clever turn Fassbinder never shows us his own character's trick perhaps as an allusion to disappointment in the film for Fox and loses his job only to miraculously win the lottery and meet a man Peter Chatel who is a little more wellspoken and wellraised from a richer background than Fox's workingclass roots. But Fox falls in love and soon they get an apartment as well as Fox becoming a business partner for his new lover's father's business.There is some melodrama to be sure but it's only somewhat about romance between two men or about men who want to pick up other men for sex there are a couple of very interesting scenes of this such as when Fox and Eugen are on vacation and bicker with one another as to what to do with a Moroccan Salem from Fear Eats the Soul in a great bit part. But it's more about money about status and the crushing sense of selfworth that comes in a society based on a value system  even in the lower class like the guys at the bar and the bar owner who have their own sense of worth in their community one that is not totally at ease with Fox after a while. Often Fassbinder has dealt with the element of the outsider in society and here one can find no better example Fox is awkward doesn't always say the smart things is not book smart to get by with intellectuals nor does he have the butch capacity of those like the travelingthrough American soldiers.And yet at the same time Fox is as well as the way Fassbinder brilliantly plays him a good person at heart not meaning to really hurt anyone but just fing up a lot of the time like when he puts through 40000 pamphlets the wrong way through a copy machine at his work. Indeed I can't think of anyone else in Fassbinder's circle of actors who could've done it better he's someone we sympathize with even when he messes up royally or does the wrong thing at a family dinner or when his sister a classic bluecollar woman gets drunk and embarrasses those around her. He is at least more human than the outforhisown Eugen and likewise Chatel portrays this coldness very effectively like when we see his eyes darting around and lying right behind Fox. It takes a little time in the middle for things to get really interesting with the plot in seeing Fox rising little by little to his quasiascension to a plastic happiness as it were. But once Fassbinder gets there to the meaty parts of the drama it's hard to resist its pleasures.And also there's some funny moments too and as Fassbinder is such a likable guy on screen ironic considering his reputation there ends up being a few sardonic moments of humor little jabs here and there about sex or that very obvious scene where Eugen is caught with having Fox in his apartment with another man coming by in the morning... and the twist late in the film when this situation becomes reversed. Fox and His Friends is not a masterpiece but it is essential viewing in the Fassbinder cannon for the way he goes about telling this story how he avoids making it about gay people just as he avoided making it simply about race in Fear Eats the Soul and he himself proves himself a very good actor here in his own right.".

It is with regret however that I have to say I have been continually unimpressed.Fassbinder is an interesting director and I enjoyed much of how Fox was directed. What ruined it for me was the uniformly terrible acting and the most repetitive banal and juvenile screenplay!El Hedi ben Salem's performance is so poor I actually sniggered at one point during the film. While Fassbinder is interesting to watch maybe just as a curiosity he gives a terrible performance in this film acting like he is in a completely different movie. Regardless of the acting though it is the screenplay that ruins this film. No character development exposition through dialogue and the overall point is just way too heavy handed. Yes I get it Fox is being used for his money. But it goes on and on forever reiterating the point. Fox is the dumbest character on earth!Well I can't slate such a well respected film maker such as Fassbinder without good reason so I am obliged to detail some of the flaws that made this film so disappointing to meOne annoyance with this film is that a lot of things happen off screen. For example Fox wins the lottery but it isn't clear when so for a while I wasn't sure if he'd won the lottery before the film started or during it. A second example of this is when Fox is telling his boyfriend that he is really ill verging on a breakdown and this has caused him to suffer black outs and chest pains. The thing is we never got to see any of this. When did it happen?? A quality writer would show a character slowly disintegrating over time. Fassbinder just does it in one scene via dialogue. At no point do we feel he is suffering a breakdown or anything of a sort!Character development is nonexistent in this film. When we are introduced to Fox he is shown to be a mysterious rebellious character. But then he falls in love with a man he's just met and turns in to wimpy clingy dork in the next scene without ANY transitional period. It really is as quick as that. They meet in one scene then are in love the next. And Fox has a complete personality change between the two scenes. To me that is just bad writing. The characters just chopped and changed to suit what ever was needed to be stated in the heavyhanded storyline.There were other problems. Like for example Fox loans money to his partner's business and is paid back in monthly installments. Seems pretty clear right? Well...then Fox starts working at the company like a regular employee. I assumed he was just helping out because he had a financial interest in the business. Then near the end Fox's boyfriend tells him he doesn't have to work there and that he can come  go as he pleases. Fox says I don't understand and his partner says I've always told you that. Well I didn't understand either because at no point was it made clear to the audience that Fox thought he was a regular employee and at no point had his boyfriend told him he could come  go as he pleased. So I wondered...why had that random piece of information been placed there so late in the film? Well a couple of scenes later I got my answer when Fox and his boyfriend have split up and Fox comes to get his loan back. His ex boyfriend then tells Fox that they already paid him back every month over 2 years. So for all this time Fox had apparently thought that the money he was getting each month was his wages?? Which means he thought he was an employee when he wasn't?? Is this really believable???? It was during these scenes that I found out the story had been going on for 2 years. My God there was no indication of this whatsoever I thought it had been taking place over a number of weeks maybe months at the most! Since there is no proper character development and the scenes are so repetitive I could not empathise or feel connected to any character so I didn't care at all for Fox whom obviously we were meant to care deeply about as he is portrayed in such an OTT sympathetic manner. After the film finished my first thought was what was the point of that? It was kinda silly kinda childish and had characters with no depth. I have to say that if the screenplay for Fox was critiqued properly it would be ripped to shreds!".

	schema:headline " Fassbinder's most personal perhaps";
	schema:reviewBody "Faustrecht der Freiheit or Fox and His Friends is a West German Germanlanguage film from 1975 so this one had its 40th anniversary last year. The writer and director is German filmmaking infant terrible Rainer Werner Fassbinder and he was roughly at the age of 30 when he made this 120minute film back in the 1970s. And I already wrote that I think it may be Fassbinder's most personal film. There seem a lot of parallels to the filmmaker's real life in here and it shows that he put all his heart in it for example that he was not even scared of full frontal nudity to make BiberkopfFox look authentic. This one here came out 5 years before Fassbinder made his successful miniseries Berlin Alexanderplatz which is of course also known for its main character Franz Biberkopf so the name in here is certainly no coincidence. But the thing that hits closest to home is of course the ending because apart from the location we see exactly the way the real Fassbinder died. Unfortunately despite this emotional impact I never managed to create a lot of interest in the story. I guess this may have to do with me not being the greatest Fassbinder fan but also with the script which never seemed really interesting or even edgeofseat level to me. Fassbinder is nonetheless fun to watch and I still believe he is at least as good of an actor as of a filmmaker if not better. So with another lead actor than RMF who lost some weight for his role here this may have dragged even more. Nonetheless my verdict overall is thumbsdown. I do not recommend the watch. I guess Fassbinder is just superior with female main characters.".

If it does then you might not be watching this film for the right reasons.A year before Fox the combo writerdirectorcinematographereditoractor Rainer Werner Fassbinder portrayed the mishaps of a forbidden and most nonglamorous love affair between an old cleaning lady and a young  Arab  homosexual in the dangerously gorgeous film Ali. In Fox RW Fassbinder stars himself as a young bigmouthed badmannered and proudtobe gay man that looks exactly like a hybrid between the middle boy in the Von Trapp family and Tintin and chronicles his endeavors as he falls in love with a guy out of stupidity while the latter falls in love with him for his newfound money. Everything you don't want to mix in a feature film. Yet it works.You don't have fun while watching Fox And His Friends but you don't struggle that much through it either at least not the way some people would struggle through say Querelle or a middleage Goddard. Pace does plunge from time to time but it ends up being an irrelevant issue. Fassbinder knows very well that the audience measures its excitement and boredom on a Hollywoodestablished scale and he makes it perfectly clear that he doesn't care. He's not trying to annoy you. He's too busy voicing issues that would never get a chance in a corporatefunded film so he simply couldn't care less.And speaking of corporate it feels very satisfying to watch Fassbinder unfold his utter disgust of corporations as you sit through the perfect recipe of a Hollywood suicide lighting is terrible editing is all over the place nobody was paid to record live sound and don't get me started on dubbing the narrative proves that the author trimmed holes in his script like squares in a backyard 95 of the characters are gay lovers or gay lovers the directormain actor walks around naked in half of the film while he congratulates himself on having very questionable hygiene actors never bother to deliver more than one dimension the cinematographer sticks to the classic 43 academic ratio in a generation where ultrawidescreen formats rule and the film finally performs Hara Kiri in the most nonpretty nonhappy ending ever.A rather intriguing aspect of watching Fox And His Friends in the 21st Century is that it triggers AIDSrelated goose bumps as the eponymous character is tested for a mysterious illness despite the film being released years before the AIDS epidemic broke in the West. When Fox was produced in 1975 AIDS didn't even exist as an unidentified enemy but homosexuality was a very degrading thing to be and perhaps this film acts as a voice to this unspoken terror. There wasn't AIDS yet but there was sexual terrorism. Fox even goes beyond sexual fear and labels and encapsulates the problematic of social identification altogether the workingclass sister who's afraid to confront the world of socialites because of her manners and her drinking problem the lover who judges Fox's intelligence based on his musical tastes and later who forces him to dress listen and behave like him because he's in denial of social cleavage the Maitre D who'd rather send white male stewards for prostitution instead of local Moroccan men. Fassbinder ultimately dresses his film to kill which reminds you that punks are and will remain a community that refuses to conform and this ideology is indispensable for a working group of people like Fassbinder and his crew as it allows them to be liberated from any commitment to please sell or attract and lets them underline such topics as the fear of belonging to a category be it social sexual or aesthetic. This antimasterpiece stinks of artistic merit.Not even for the sake of academic documentation but rather for the sake of tolerance payback to minorities respect of the punk community social and sexual awareness and hell freedom of speech I think that every single person in the world should watch at least one Fassbinder film at some point in their life.".

And you watch while he takes the whole nine yards around your hearth  eventually your gravestone as well. Fox and his Friends resonates many themes from Ali Fear eats the Soul Fassbinder's soothing Melancholic masterwork. In 'Ali' the protagonists Emi and Eli literally dance into each other's arms whereas in Fox Eugen and Fox clash and spar with unabashed animal magnetism. Franz Bieberkopf a.k.a Fox is a variety show entertainer named The Speaking Head. He is an abnormal on an Itinerant stage as one line introduces us to him. His lover is arrested the show is packed off and so is Fox who is too polite and cowardly to remonstrate the Manager's unfairness. A latter line alludes to Fox being picked up from a pubic urinal. 'Fox and Friends' is unapologetic and brutal in its portrayal of Sexual Politics and Power Equations. That it bases its premise on homosexuality is a moot point. What the mood of the film conveys or what the acting styles convey is a hopeless recursive silent Machinery laughing away at genuine peoples efforts to wriggle out. Fox's luck changes after an escapade he engineers. His singular belief in winning a lottery drives him to the deed though he is initially mugged after he legally borrows an amount. Fox is picked up by an aristocratic gent named Max. This brief scene is memorable for the three lightning edit cuts and freeze frames that show a rendezvous being established through codes and signals.Fox is introduced to Max's friends and is promptly attracted to and simultaneously repulsed by Eugen Thiess a vain and ambitious bourgeois upstart. These are probably Fox's most liberating moments when his street gab and penny tricks help him parry Eugen's sarcasm. But these defenses are soon exhausted when Fox's limitations loom large. He is ugly poor unschooled and unskilled as Eugen later points out. He is a homosexual from the streets. He will find no sympathy in a society that compels one to find power and to use it. His proletariat potency he knows is transient and viewed as a natural disposition to boozing scoffing and screwing. Eugen is an opportunistic entrepreneur who is quick to move in on Fox's vulnerability to acquire all the trappings that will win him society's approval.The editing here has amaelstrom like effect events unspooling at a breathless pace sharply contrasting the layers being peeled off Max's slight persona. Eugentactfully manipulates Fox as he climbs the social ladder rescuing a family business and acquiring tasteful 'possessions.' Fox is useful for as long as he has the prize money. Eugen's family is respectful to Fox when in need but quickly change colors when tides change. Fassbinder casts himself as Franz and his interpretation of the role is pitch perfect. Peter Chatel is suitably stoic as Eugen the scheming lover. I could sense an icy chillness each time Karlheinz Bohm appeared on screen. It was no small surprise when my rusty memory discovered that my only introduction to his work was in Michael Powell's icy voyeuristic 'Peeping Tom.' Bohm as Max the antiques dealer infuses a chilling menacing air to his character. Intermittent and lurking he lands up at important intervals in Fox's journey. Michael Ballhaus' also a Kubrick and Scorsese regular camerawork has a languid dexterity that together with Fassbinder's frames create moments of lingering pathos. Filters and geometrical motifs accentuate the fractured personalities and hollowness of meaningless lives. The contributions of other characters lend a dramatic weight to the final act of betrayal  the stampede of the Herd. Two performances merit special mention Hans Zander as the snide barman Springer and Peter Kern as the lecherous florist 'Fatty' Schmidt. The subject matter of the film created a huge controversy upon release. Fassbinder was accused of being homophobic despite being openly homosexual. There are some nude male frontal scenes that have never been depicted so openly since. Some frames depict young boys as Adonis like props objectified for sexual predators or as mute adornments in depraved Saturnalia. In one telling scene Fox blocks out the reflection of a nude boy to prevent Eugen from looking on. In a polarized world Fox is easy meat even for the weakest of predators. His body is the only commodity he can sell and as Eugen explains  Fox is not the kind of guy money can make rich.With 'Ali' Fassbinder floored me. With 'Fox' he has me hooked for life. My personal rating 7.810".

Fassbinder is effective in the main role and the whole proceedings are engaging even if like me you happened to miss the scene where the lottery win happens. Watch for it though its important.";

Basically Franz 'Fox' Bieberkopf Fassbinder is a working class homosexual carnival worker and when he finds himself out of work and his boyfriend the owner Klaus Karl Scheydt arrested for tax fraud he is in need of money.

This includes low on money Eugen Thiess Peter Chatel who dumps his boyfriend Philip Harry Baer to make his move and try and take advantage of him and his fortune. Max suggests to Fox that good things could happen if he invests in Phillip's company so he does give him 100000 marks and then he ends up paying high amounts for apartment stuff and clothes and then when he hears about Klaus being released he gives him 30000 marks so he really is being taken advantage of.

Also starring Adrian Hoven as Wolf Thiess  Eugen's father and Ulla Jacobsson as Eugen's mother. Fassbinder does a good job of directing but he mostly excels playing the leading role of the ordinary gay man being propelled into high society and unsure of how to handle it the film is full of the eerie stuff with all the homosexual material and the rich people's sleazy activities and there is the prominent despair as well but overall it is interesting drama.

	schema:reviewBody "Fox and his Friends  also known as Fox and FirstRight to Freedom  is one of the keyworks in the cinema of Rainer Werner Fassbinder. The film like many of the director's other great works focuses on a torturous relationship  this time between a working class youth and the older son of a wealthy factory worker  and how their differences in class and upbringing can begin a tragic chain of events that lead ultimately to personal despair. As a film Fox and his Friends works best as an unflinching expos of the classsystem and offers a new variation on one of Fassbinder's key motifs the idea of human suffering and the causes of such.Like the characters in past Fassbinder films like The Merchant of Four Seasons and Fear Eats the Soul Fox is led to his downfall but also embraces it. As a character he is blinded by love and although we know that he regrets his actions the moment he has taken them he proceeds regardless... convinced that he's doing the right thing for the person he loves. Fassbinder also makes light of the idea of how money changes people. Not just those that have come into money but those 'surrounding' people who have come into money. At the beginning of the film Fox tries desperately to collect enough money for his weekly lottery ticket... begging friends and family for loose change and convinced that this week he's going to win. In these first few scenes Fassbinder has painted Fox as a lovable loser so when we find out later that the character has indeed won the grand jackpot of 500000 German marks we as an audience are ultimately as shocked as the upperclass gay sophisticates that Fox has subsequently fallen in with.It is here that Fassbinder begins to expose the dark heart of his story as these characters descend on the course and immature Fox and begin to force their own ideals and ideologies on him... even going so far as to belittle him in front of his old friends who still hang out in the same dimlylit lowrent cabaret club as before. This is innocent enough but when Fox takes up with Eugene one of the keycharacters in the upperclass gay milieu Fassbinder pushes the melodrama to the next emotional level... destroying everything that Fox had always wanted and had finally achieved leaving him as penniless loveless and hopeless as he was when we first met him. Fassbinder doesn't sugarcoat his message here with 'Fox' standing as one of the most depressing and hopeless films ever made perhaps rivalled only by the director's own later film In a Year with 13 Moons.The mood of the film throughout is caustic and claustrophobic with the director and his cinematographer Michael Ballhaus using tight fragmented composition to separate the characters constantly. There's also a great deal of mirror symbolism with Fassbinder getting at the notion of personal reflection and the idea of seeing beyond the faade ...whether the faade you put up to hide true feelings for others or the faade that others present to you etc. The use of colour and overall production design seems more drab and uninviting too all adding to the general mood of oppression and spiralling despair so central to the script. With this film Fassbinder seems to have an important message to convey about the class system and how the working class will always be seen as inferior to those born with a silver spoon in their mouths even if they eventually attain to the same social and financial level as them!! It is on the one hand a relationship drama but is a relationship drama entirely tied to the idea of class exploitation. One shouldn't let the use of homosexuality deter them from watching the film as this is really secondary to the ideas discussed above and yes the film does feature some mild love scenes and frontal male nudity... but it's hardly Sebatianne or Taxi Zum Klo!! with Fassbinder much more concerned with the idea of abuse in the face of love.The central performance by Fassbinder here is a real revelation as he manages to make Fox seem real and sympathetic... never the tragic or pathetic figure that he could have become in the hands of certain other filmmakers. He begins the film confident arrogant and to some extent happy with the life he has been leading... but ends up a broken shell with no money no friends and no hope. I won't go in to too much detail surrounding the ending though needless to say it's like the last kick to the guts when you're already at you're lowest point with the director taking his melodrama beyond the required level of despair and into something much more heart wrenching. It obviously won't be to everyone's taste with the idea of spiralling desperation and depression sure to put a lot of people off... but it's no less a powerful film one of the many masterpieces that Fassbinder directed before his untimely death in 1982.".

	schema:reviewBody "Watched a great movie last night R.W. Fassbinder's Fox and Friends. It's the one that stars Fassbinder as a gay dude. He lost a lot of weight for the part because he's fully naked like ten times and that's pretty weird because he's got one of those muscleless skinnyfat bodies where 60 of his bodyweight is in the chin. But it's easy to get past that. Him being all weirdlooking is part of his scrappy appeal. He's like the David Eckstein of fat directors who lost a bunch of weight in order to star as naked gay guys in their own movies.The picture was gorgeous since Fassbinder made it. A few observationsI don't know anything about European gay culture before the advent of dance music. Like nothing. The stuff I know about American gay culture is all sad and historical then happened Stonewall and well my main insights into it up until the 90s or so are John Waters movies. No need to dig any further. Things were different in Europe it seems. OrI hope. I wish to god that Fassbinder movies were real life. The sleazy gay bar that Fox hangs out in is maybe the most prettiest place I've ever seen on film. It had the same lighting and color scheme as the castle from Suspiria and the lamps and gimcracks look like they all came from or were won on what a 70's daytime gameshow would have looked like if the Nazis won the war. Good god is Fassbinder a lot like Douglas Sirk. Sirk it turns out was from also Germany. I never knew that. German critics dismissed him for the same reason American critics dismissed Sirk. And neat enough it was only when each director started getting respect in other countries that they were taken seriously in their homelands. Anyhow they both made what critics now call melodramas but I prefer to call fairy tales and I don't mean the use of fairy as a slur. The lessons are heavyhanded and depressing. Everything and everyone is handsome and bluntly boldly representative of some breed of actual person that disinterested viewers are guaranteed to either adore or despise. Romance happens. Just it happens. Tragedy strikes. Men drink too much and get sloppy women have large passions that they get punished for expressing and no one ever understands the decency of picture's main character. I've nothing against realism. But I like my fairy tales to be fairy tales. I want them blunt and pretty and I really really hate it when they're made light or believable. That's why Kate Hudson movies suck so hardnot because they're stupid but because they're too tame. If you want to make a movie that's supposed to make me feel really bad or really good then please for the love of god beat me over the head with it. Abandon all restraint and try to actually craft a movie make something that's genuinely funny or pretty or interesting and I'll forget to nitpick about whether or not it's believable.".

This is not unlikely to be caused by the controversy of the subject. Based on a script by wellknown German journalist Stefan Aust who himself based the script on his lengthy book The BaaderMeinhofComplex about 1970s terrorism in Germany and directed by Reinhard Hauff who already had experience with political themes in film not least in Messer im Kopf Stammheim reconstructs the trial against four leading figures of the socalled Red Army Fraction. The RAF was the prime terrorist movement in Germany from the early 70s on split in three different generations with the prisoners of this trial being the first. The second consisting of people who hardly knew the first was far more violent the third is still some sort of mystery today since almost nobody was ever caught. Stammheim is a suburb of the city of Stuttgart and here stands the jail house especially build for terrorists and equipped with an own trial room to host prosecution against as it was called then participation in terrorist alliances. During the course of this particular trial  which became famous as the Stammheim trial thus the title  the defendants used every opportunity to display their political propaganda and chances were given quite a lot during the 192 days it ran. At the same time they aimed at unmasking the judge and the attorneys as ideologically driven quasiNazis they tried to manipulate the trial supported by their lawyers some of which later became famous politicians but not all of them remained leftist and their eager agitation gave insight into their own thoughts perspectives and prejudices. In essence the four RAF leaders two men Baader and Raspe two women Ensslin and Meinhof claimed that the German government was on it's direct way back to fascism especially after supporting the USAmerican attacks on Vietnam. Therefore it was just to fight the state destroy it's facilities or even kill people in charge.This is the outline of the recitations that make up this film. Hauff presents scenes from the trial by juxtaposing few fictional elements with lots of quotes from the actual protocols. The atmosphere is theatrical and indeed Stammheim was coproduced by a Hamburg theater company and a bit surreal with the setting  as realistic as it is  looking almost like scifi as did the courtroom in the real Stammheim. Given the impact that the RAFs terror made in German politics and society from the 70s up until 1998 when the third generation announced the end of their mission the picture is dynamite For instance it dares to focus on the highly controversial topic of raison d'etat which stands  in the eyes of the RAF and their lawyers  for the German authorities' secret strategy of killing political prisoners. When in 1977 the Baader Raspe and Ensslin killed themselves Meinhof already committed suicide during the trial many supporters and intellectuals accused the state of murder. But before that following the sentence to lifelong prison for each defendant came the most famous kidnapping case in German history. It is not seen in the film which ends with the sentence but viewers should be aware that the second generation abducted an influential industrial manager with personal Nazi background to blackmail the freeing of the first. After that failed a plane full of travelers on their way home from summer holiday was hijacked additionally. In the end the manager was killed the passengers were freed violently and the inhabitants of Stammheim took their own lives that very same night. The film is all about talking confronting positions discourse. The action is in the words. For those familiar with the background of the story and it's social psychological and political implications Stammheim delivers stunning entertainment by making the trial visible. Even if you don't know about the roots of the film it is still impressive. It's a laudable achievement in bringing together fiction and political reality in a unique and thrilling way.".

The writer is Stefan Aust and the director is Reinhard Hauff and for both it is among their most known cinematic works today. If you know a bit about German history you will immediately realize from the title that this is about one of the darkest times in German history the days of leftwing terrorism from the RAF. This 105minute film however is not about what they did but it is a reconstruction of the trial against the members Baader Meinhof Ensslin and Raspe. Holger Meins is dead from a selfimposed hunger strike right away and does not play a major role in here.This movie is 95 courtroom scenes so you can decide for yourself if you like that kind of approach. One who did not like it was Gina Lollobrigida who presided the jury of the Berlin Film Festival back then and announced that this film was the winner after a controversial discussion during which she strongly opposed the win. One of the biggest scandals in the Berlinale's history. I personally think it was a good watch. I am not sure if I would call it awardsworthy but it's an important chapter in German history and I think writer director and cast did a decent job here. The only really known cast member three decades later is Ulrich Tukur who plays Andreas Baader in here. It's interesting to see him in his younger days. I will not tell you if I recommend this film as you should know very well yourself if it interest you. Like I said it is almost exclusively courtroom drama and you probably have seen the much more recent Oscarnominated film from Germany that deals with the same issue if you consider checking this one out. If you liked that one give this one here a go I would say.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the light of Faith Akin's 2004 'Gegen die Wand' 'Kurz und Schmerzlos' is relatively The most impressive point of the movie is the grim poverty which penetrates into the close friendship between Gabriel Costa and Bobby. Even though these three members of the GrecoTurkishSerbian gang have sufficient amount of goodwill and mutual respect for their inferiority complexes combined with poverty have detrimental effects on all of them.Bobby hungry for more street respect starts to work for an Albanian mafioso and Costa joins his friend reluctantly as an experienced car thief. Gabriel fresh from jail tries to stop his two best buddies from joining the thugs.

Gabriel fresh from jail tries to stop his two best buddies from joining the thugs.

	schema:reviewBody "Kurz und schmerzlos or Short Sharp Shock is a German movie from almost 20 years ago and the language in here is German for the most part too with occasional exceptions doing justice to the characters' origins. Writer and director Faith Akin was only 25 when this one came out and after some short film work it was his very first full feature film. Taking that into account it is a decent effort I guess but as a whole I was not convinced. The characters were not as interesting as I hoped they would be apart from the breathtakingly sexy Idil ner and the effort this movie makes on an emotional level in terms of love and friendship also never really touched me. I cannot really put a finger on what exactly caused this as the acting was decent from start to finish. Maybe it was just me.However generally I like crime dramasthrillers but this one here did not feel right to me. I also wonder how police was absent from start to finish with everything that happened in here. Akin already works with actors that would keep appearing in his films throughout his entire career. Moritz Bleibtreu however was not present yet. Two years later Akin made Im Juli. and this is when the two collaborated for the first time. But back to this one Akin himself also has a minor role in here and it's not too uncommon that he also acts in his own works at least back then it was. All in all the plot never had me at the edge of my seat maybe also because I somewhat disliked Kurtulus' character and that surely wasn't intended. The negative outweighs the positive and that is why I do not recommend Kurz und schmerzlos. Thumbs down.".

	schema:reviewBody "My opinion on this film is that it draws a very questionable image of people coming out of conditions of an immigration background in Germany and beyond that it plays down violent behaviour there is no obvious stance against acts of revenge it shows an absurd relationship between human and religion and the screen play leaves too many gaps for a credible depiction of its acting characters.I have seen a lot of films playing in a similar surrounding but I cannot remember of a film burdened with so many stereotypes even if those might be partly true. Costa is a drugaddicted small time criminal whose life is noticeably slipping out of his hand. The character of Bobby is depicted very authentic likewise a small time criminal on the rise who boasts with doubtful achievements and watches out for his big chance. And finally the character of Gabriel which I am going to examine in the course of this review.There are many movies and films with a comparable plot for instance Snatch In China They Eat Dogs etc. In most comparable films on condition that the minimum demands of a good film are fulfilled the events and the main characters are overdrawn in such an extent that there is spread only an amusing entertainment which is not to be taken serious by its spectators.But this is not the intention of Kurz und Schmerzlos. All characters are taken serious and the plot wants to gain a penetrating access to its viewers. It is exactly here where the crucial deficit is to be found. To achieve a certain comprehensibility and an internal monologue in the viewers mind the script ought to give more space to the precedenting development of Gabriels character. The fact that he still lives at home and probable also lived at home before he got into detention in connection to the depiction of his fathers peaceful personality and his sisters way of living which is very European for a family influenced by the Islam are only hardly but rather not at all consistent with Gabriels outdated view on friendship when he takes revenge on Muhamer. If you look at families with an immigration background which are connected to comparable deeds like killing women for being together with a man who is not accepted by the family or even only violent or criminal behaviour by the familys sons like shown in Kurz und Schmerzlos there is almost every time a quite patriarchic upbringing and subsequent a domineering head of the family. Thus the depiction of Gabriels father is the most obvious inaccuracy in the whole film.The vehement opposing to the request of resumption of his criminal past and the following behaviour are likely to assume a purification which he gained during his stay in prison. But in the course of the film this will be revealed as only superficial and he has not got a realization that the way he behaved was wrong. This circumstance alone is not to be assessed in a negative way but the plot does not let enough space for the presentation of this substantial change and the inevitable internal conflict. Furthermore the influence on the rehabilitation of Gabriel by his father is restricted on a few attempts to pray together which are all refused by Gabriel except in the end. Here the script leaves a big dramaturgical gap because the relationship between father and son regarding religion would have been very interesting and important for the understanding of Gabriels character instead of a few unnecessary and annoying dialogs. Thus Gabriel remains insignificant and is carried basically by the acting skills of Mehmet Kurtulus. The coldblooded execution of Muhamer without questioning him about the circumstances of Bobbys death is a reflection of Gabriels fall back into archaic behavioural patterns. But even if Gabriel had asked Muhamer about that incident it is likely that he would have killed Muhamer in that intense situation anyway. However there will be a short examination of Bobbys death He was pursed and attacked by Muhamer but it was him who rashly raised his revolver and threatened his interceptor with the ultimate request to let him through. Besides it is not obvious who pulled the trigger in the following fight. Therefore it is not possible to blame someone alone for the death of Bobby. Regarding that Bobby has known the risks as he got involved with the organized crime it is his responsibility trying to fix the failed weapon deal and for instance to attempt to talk with Muhamer and to get the money back. The fact that Bobby is responsible for himself is taken into consideration by Alice in fact but finally it comes to that exaggerated act of self justice by Gabriel even though Costa lied seriously injured in his arms and it is to be supposed that Gabriel has lost every motivation for further violence in the face of what violence and counter violence is able cause. There is no inner conflict leaking out and at the latest this sequence should bring up an aversion against Gabriel. But for this the film leaves no space unfortunately.The last scene shows the father and his son doing an Islamic prayer after Gabriel has turned away of his fathers religious way of living in the course of the film. In my opinion this is a very absurd image of the relationship between human and religion which stirs up reservations against Islamic fellow citizens in every attentive viewers mind. This is faded over skilfully by nice oriental music. Concerning this it is to be marked that this has another statement in the current political context than ten years ago. But nevertheless in a reasonable intelligent and enlightened society acts of revenge and self justice have never been compatible with an actual peace preaching religion.".

To achieve a certain comprehensibility and an internal monologue in the viewers mind the script ought to give more space to the precedenting development of Gabriels character. The fact that he still lives at home and probable also lived at home before he got into detention in connection to the depiction of his fathers peaceful personality and his sisters way of living which is very European for a family influenced by the Islam are only hardly but rather not at all consistent with Gabriels outdated view on friendship when he takes revenge on Muhamer. If you look at families with an immigration background which are connected to comparable deeds like killing women for being together with a man who is not accepted by the family or even only violent or criminal behaviour by the familys sons like shown in Kurz und Schmerzlos there is almost every time a quite patriarchic upbringing and subsequent a domineering head of the family. Thus the depiction of Gabriels father is the most obvious inaccuracy in the whole film.The vehement opposing to the request of resumption of his criminal past and the following behaviour are likely to assume a purification which he gained during his stay in prison. But in the course of the film this will be revealed as only superficial and he has not got a realization that the way he behaved was wrong. This circumstance alone is not to be assessed in a negative way but the plot does not let enough space for the presentation of this substantial change and the inevitable internal conflict. Furthermore the influence on the rehabilitation of Gabriel by his father is restricted on a few attempts to pray together which are all refused by Gabriel except in the end. Here the script leaves a big dramaturgical gap because the relationship between father and son regarding religion would have been very interesting and important for the understanding of Gabriels character instead of a few unnecessary and annoying dialogs. Thus Gabriel remains insignificant and is carried basically by the acting skills of Mehmet Kurtulus. The coldblooded execution of Muhamer without questioning him about the circumstances of Bobbys death is a reflection of Gabriels fall back into archaic behavioural patterns. But even if Gabriel had asked Muhamer about that incident it is likely that he would have killed Muhamer in that intense situation anyway. However there will be a short examination of Bobbys death He was pursed and attacked by Muhamer but it was him who rashly raised his revolver and threatened his interceptor with the ultimate request to let him through. Besides it is not obvious who pulled the trigger in the following fight. Therefore it is not possible to blame someone alone for the death of Bobby. Regarding that Bobby has known the risks as he got involved with the organized crime it is his responsibility trying to fix the failed weapon deal and for instance to attempt to talk with Muhamer and to get the money back. The fact that Bobby is responsible for himself is taken into consideration by Alice in fact but finally it comes to that exaggerated act of self justice by Gabriel even though Costa lied seriously injured in his arms and it is to be supposed that Gabriel has lost every motivation for further violence in the face of what violence and counter violence is able cause. There is no inner conflict leaking out and at the latest this sequence should bring up an aversion against Gabriel. But for this the film leaves no space unfortunately.The last scene shows the father and his son doing an Islamic prayer after Gabriel has turned away of his fathers religious way of living in the course of the film. In my opinion this is a very absurd image of the relationship between human and religion which stirs up reservations against Islamic fellow citizens in every attentive viewers mind. This is faded over skilfully by nice oriental music. Concerning this it is to be marked that this has another statement in the current political context than ten years ago. But nevertheless in a reasonable intelligent and enlightened society acts of revenge and self justice have never been compatible with an actual peace preaching religion.";

All this is the work he is most remembered by.To this day most people don't know that he started his career by recording readings of world literature. In a time span of about four to five years he made 32 records. And he toured the country with his recitations. This work got very high praises and made him well known.He would have done very well on stage too but the film paid much better. His strange looks expressive voice well trained by the readings and his cool attitude made him quickly famous. But this fame had its price. Soon his roles in film were mixed up with the person Kinski himself. Sure he had something to do with this. Being very sensitive and easy to hurt he was always ready to attack before he got attacked. The tabloids connected his behavior with his portraits of psychopathic killers and sold him as slightly crazy. It was easy to get him up the wall. This image stood in his way when he wanted to do serious work.At the beginning of the seventies after doing an endless string of movies he wanted to pick up were he had left and start recitations again. Always being intrigued by great personalities he wrote thirty pages of text mostly direct quotes from the New Testament about Jesus Christ. He rented the Deutschlandhalle in Berlin Germany and had a full house with 5000 listeners. He was so full of hope that he would start a new chapter in his career that he had a team of cameramen to film bits of the recitation for further use.But it was the time of the 68' generation and Kinski had no part in their agenda. He was over 40 already and for them an old man. He did not know what was to happen on this evening. Spoiler from here onEven before he delivered the first lines of text insults were shouted and did not cease for the rest of the official performance. The insults were not aimed at the text but at Kinski and his life. Several times he stopped reciting and shouted back at the riffraff as he called them. He left the stage several times swearing not to come back but unusually for him he returned starting from the beginning or picking up where he had stopped.Watching and listening to this unusual and never before seen document is heartbreaking and aggravating at the same time. I was never a great admirer of Klaus Kinski but here I did respect and feel with him because beside all his outbreaks at the attackers you can clearly see he wanted desperately to get his work done and finish his project. What happens to him here he had not deserved. The attackers are few but they never stopped for long. After several breaks Kinski called the evening off. Most people went home but about a hundred remained and for them he started from the very beginning and finally managed to finish without interruption at about two o' clock in the morning.His reciting of the text is fantastic the aggressive atmosphere only seems to fuel his expression he often uses the phrases he quotes as a weapon against the agitators.The director of this documentary had nothing to do with the filming he was five years at that time. But he managed to puzzle together all the bits of film that were exposed and luckily could also get hold of the entire sound tape from the Deutschlandhalle who had forgotten to close their microphones after the official event ended. Kinski never did anything with the material so it is completely unknown. This film is a truly moving document of a great performer under unusual and very trying circumstances.".

It was an on again off again affair that lasted until past 2 AM when alone with 100 people Kinski finally got to deliver the full piece.The film was pieced together from an audio recording and the film shot that night to record the event.Its an intense emotional film where we watch the mob attempt to destroy the performer. As Kinski is quoted as saying at least they let Jesus speak before they nailed him to the cross. The performance filmed with few cut aways is possibly the most intense Kinski performance you're ever likely to see.The piece Kinski wrote to perform is a masterful restatement of what Jesus is and is perhaps as clear a statement of why God isn't listening as one might ever get.Its a wonderful record of what happened and it's you are there feel is just as frustrating as the jerks who need to speak wreck what should have been a magical evening.Possibly one of the best filmed records of any event you're likely to see it contains a brilliant performance by Klaus Kinski as you are ever going to see speaking some of the most enlightening words that almost no one has ever heard.If you can go with the bumps of the night this is a must see.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is an exhibit of a very disturbed man who was part genius part eccentric and part mad but a true 100 Artist. Klaus Kinski was a very good actor and he tried this show called Jesus Christ Saviour. Many people think he was trying to be Jesus or impersonating him. That is one way to look at it of course but I think he tried to convert the bible New Testament into modern times. Most of the things he says here are included in the Bible. This movie being a documentary that actually has no voice over but only Kinski doing his monologue though very often interrupted by some members of the audience.There is so much to be said about a man that evidently thinks he was better than most other people who also thinks he was misunderstood. The latter being of course more than true but his erratic behaviour didn't help much either. But this concert let's call it that on display here actually had some valid points. You almost wish people would not have interrupted him making him go offstage a couple of times. Still returning after a while but why would you do that? You don't go to the Opera and shout at the actors now do you? Either like what you see or leave the room.The fact that he was able to switch from almost normal to maniac rage made him so appealing to many. A controversial figure in German film history he definitely will make you want to know more about him ... Which would lead you to the movie Mein liebster Feind where Werner Herzog talks a lot about his favorite actor. Watch this and be amazed and frightened maybe by one of the best artists German cinema has produced!".

	schema:reviewBody "Jesus Christus Erlser or Jesus Christ Saviour is a German documentary from 2008 but the contents depicted in here are a lot older namely from the early 1970s. It is all about infant terrible Klaus Kinski giving us his take on Jesus Christ the Bible and the New Testament. With this controversial topic and a man like Kinski in charge you can already imagines how it would turn out. It is a oneman show by Kinski and his performance is constantly interrupted by audience members trying to provoke the artist. And it would not be Kinski if he did not have some nice words for the people disturbing his performance. Occasionally audience members move to the stage and try to say a few words. Kinski in his 40s here interrupts the show on several occasions and finishes it very late at night in front of a really small group of audience members those who stayed until the very end. You could certainly criticize the audience on many occasions here and Kinski's reactions or material are also far from flawless but isn't this exactly what theatre makes so interesting?I am talking about the clash of differing opinions and how they occasionally manage to coexist and occasionally don't manage to do so. And completely aside from this I must say I was extremely wellentertained during these 85 minutes. Say what you want about Kinski and his personal life but pretty much nobody back then had such entertainment value thanks to his ability to polarize. A big thank you to filmmaker Peter Geyer for using the material from this performance and putting it together into this extremely memorable piece of art. Highly recommended.".

Bloodsport II wasn't exactly great In fact far from good but when compared to this boring dud of a sequel it almost feels as if you can sense how bored the movie is with itself. The fight sequences this time are terribly staged with martial artistry so sloppy you'd swear you walked in on a drunken fight. The movie starts off reasonably well enough but once the training montage begins you'll be so bored that your only excitement in the fight sequences will be getting closer to the ending. The movie is just so lame. Also the singing in which Amber van Lynt does is quite positively more damaging to the human body then any harm The Beast inflicts. I'm not sure if i'm the first to bring that up but how nobody remembers such awful singing is mind boggling.  out of 4Bad".

	schema:headline " In the white tuxedo scene he truly is Daniel BernBond.";
	schema:reviewBody "Alex Cardo Bernhardt is a Punchfighter but he'd rather be having tender hearttoheart talks with his classically 90's son Jason David Schatz. While he trains his tot in the ways of Martial Arts he regales him with stories of the time he won the Kumite thus eliminating any sense of suspense or drama and telegraphing a spoiler alert from the getgo. Alex recounts the tale of his time in the Far East when he used to frequent casinos while dressed in a white tuxedo. Jason clearly riveted continues to listen. Alex tells of the evil fight promoter Duvalier RhysDavies and how he murdered his mentor Master Sun Hong. He neglects to mention why Pat Morita is only seen for about 30 seconds and for no apparent reason. To win the tournament Alex goes to the countryside and begins training extensively which is a prerequisite if you want to win. Alex soon dons his singlet and enters the ring and proceeds to work his way through a bunch of fighters with no character development beyond their names such as Bruce Burly McElroy though why J. J. Perry had to play a guy named J. J. Tucker remains unexplained. Finally he faces off against The Beast Oleson an almost comically oversized meathead of the highest order. Will Alex live to tell the tale to his son? Well yeah of course he will.Grown men punching and kicking each other. It can take on many wondrous and colorful forms. Apparently there's no real limit on how many of these types of movies can be made. The original Bloodsport and Kickboxer films truly opened the floodgates during the video store era for Punchfighters for decades to come even up to the present day. But the problem with movies like this is during the last halfhour at least it gets very boring and repetitive. But you have to show the Kumite right? So on and on it goes.Before the internet and even PayPerView renting movies like this was one of the only ways to see fighting of this kind on film. It's easy to forget that in this day and age. So the movie gets somewhat of a pass but it really should have bothered to do a bit more character development and maybe concentrated a little less on extended Kumite footage. We realize we're talking about Bloodsport III here but still we think that's a fair criticism. The first half of Bloodsport III is actually a lot of fun. It has that silly funny absurd vibe we love so dearly. But then it slows down and becomes more standard unfortunately enough.Daniel Bernhardt must have been an obvious choice to fill the shoes of Van Damme because let's face it he's basically the same person. We've never seen them in the same place at the same time have we? It must have been tough living in the shadow of JCVD. But somewhere in between Van Damme and Olivier Gruner the Bernhardt dwells. At many points throughout the film you could swear that it IS Van Damme. But Bernhardt puts forth his best suave eyebrow to woo the ladies and why wouldn't he go after Crystal Duvalier Van Lent with a singing voice like that? In the white tuxedo scene he truly is Daniel BernBond. But the man has his own personal problems and demons as well as he has nightmares of recycled footage that he has to contend with.Perhaps in the end Bloodsport III raises more questions than it answers what exactly is the timeline of all these Kumite matches as they relate to parts II and III? Why do deathfights to the death have a ref? And so many others.... But it does have a noteworthy endcredits song Rhythm of the Kumite  a techno tune where you think at any moment someone will yell Mortal Kombat!!!!!  but they do indeed yell Bloodsport!!!!! so no harm no foul. So basically the first half is entertaining but it devolves into a slog. So watch it on YouTube and save the money on your credit Cardo.".

Obviously the continuity is very very poor JJ and the bandage of the long haired fighter and the biggest mistake??? location...

My 2year old brother can act 1000000000000000000 times better than the actors in this movie. Watch the first movie instead. And stay far far away from this crappy movie.I hope to god there will not be a Bloodsport 4. out of ".

The only reason you would watch this is to laugh at how bad it is which I did for the first half hour or so. But the novelty of that wears off quickly especially once you realise that it is for real ... they're not kidding ... this isn't a comedy. So on second thoughts don't even see it for that reason. If you want to watch something that's so bad it's enjoyable go rent out Plan 9 From Outer Space. Hell this film is even worse than Scary Movie 2 and I really REALLY hated that film. But don't go see it if you liked Scary Movie 2. It's nothing like it.".
