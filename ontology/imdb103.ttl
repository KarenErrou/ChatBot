	schema:reviewBody "I went into this film with the knowledge that it had been the second film in history to win the 'top five' Oscars for Best Picture Best actor Best actress Best director and best screenplay and has been praised as one of Jack Nicholson's finest roles and one of the classics of the 70's. Naturally after hearing all this I had high expectations for One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest. But nonetheless I was surprised at how easily the film surpassed my expectations and easily led me to understand how it merited all that praise.Based on the novel by Ken Kesey the story follows Randle Patrick McMurphy Jack Nicholson who in an attempt to get out of spending more time in prison pleads insanity for his crime and is therefore sentenced to time in a mental institution. This was McMurphy's intention as he believes the conditions in a crazy house will be significantly easier to contend with than another harsh stay in prison. However he quickly finds out that surviving the institution with it's desolate patients including Christopher Lloyd Danny DeVito Vincent Schiavelli and an absolutely brilliant Brad Dourif as the stuttering Billy Bibbit and the monstrously repressive Nurse Ratchet Louise Fletcher in a career defining role is considerably harder than he imagined. McMurphy plays pranks horseplay and is generally defiant to the rules of the institution in an attempt to raise spirits. His constant optimism and reckless defiance to the out of date rules in the institution can be very uplifting and often quite funny as well but much of the movie can be very depressing  the generally decrepit state of the institution is a consistently and intentionally bleak background to a superb story with a truly bittersweet ending.Jack Nicholson is at his best here head and shoulders above other excellent performances such as in 'Chinatown' or 'As Good as it Gets'. McMurphy is an apparently unquenchable optimist refusing to succumb to the defeated spirit of all the other patients. His livewire antics inspiring the patients are generally uplifting and when his indomitable spirit is finally broken we really feel for him and his fellow patients. Nicholson conveys the essence of McMurphy to perfection demonstrating his excellent understanding and interpretation of the character. When McMurphy announces that he is going to lift a huge stone fountain and hurl it through the window to escape the other patients are so caught up in his intoxicating spirit of freedom that they honestly believe he can do it despite the fact it would be impossible for a man much stronger than him. When McMurphy finally discovers that despite his best efforts he cannot lift the fountain he is so openly crushed that we can't help but feel for him. Beneath the frequent profanities and livewire antics there are real human emotions which come across as truly touching.What can be said about One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest which hasn't already been said? It has an excellent storyline top notch acting painfully bleak visuals perfectly setting the tone for the movie and alternates between being truly uplifting to devastatingly depressing. It features perhaps the most memorable film ending ever next to a man on his horse riding off into the sunset and leaves the viewer beaten down by the conflicting emotions unaware what to think of the picture next to reveling in it's glorious entirety. It's hard to produce a final outcome any better than this.1010".

	schema:reviewBody "Jack Nicholson is a great actor. No not a great actor a spectacular actor. This is a film from fairly early in his career as well as it is for several other actors in this film who later have had long great careers too including Danny DeVito Christopher Lloyd and Brad Dourif. The film has some unforgettable moments... who could forget Louise Fletcher's icy stare Jack Nicholson's smartaleck remarks or Will Sampson's impressive almost entirely silent performance? The film portrays the horrible truth about how patients were treated in mental institutions back then and tells the story of someone who desperately wanted to break out to rebel to change things for himself and for the others. I was compelled by this film from the very first frame. I never took my eyes off it and I will definitely be thinking about this film for a while. I thought it was great the way one of the very first frames depicted the institution as something far more similar to a prison than a hospital. Milos Forman did a great job of making that contrast very powerful to the viewer. The film is very moving and a truly beautiful cinematic experience. Every single actor gives a stellar performance every single character is perfectly written every single line every single frame is absolutely perfect. I wouldn't change a thing in this film. It has a great pace you never lose interest but it never seems to be rushing to get through it either. It's simply perfect. I have not read the original book but if I ever come across it I might check it out. I have only seen this film once but I will definitely watch it many times in years to come. I recommend this amazing piece of great cinema to anyone who has at least a slight interest in the drama genre or any fan of any of the actors as they are all in their absolute prime in this film. 1010".

He makes friends with lunatics and starts his own circle of admiration within the hospital much to the dismay of Nurse Ratched the central authority figure in the story and one of the greatest movie villains ever.The movie exists to show not only how corrupt and poorlyconstructed society's approach to the mentally unstable is but it creates characters that we have all met in life and shows how the McMurphylike figure that we all wish we had fights for freedom of choice and basic human rights. In addition to the movie's great spirit the acting is fantastic. Jack Nicholson is at his best and Danny DeVito can be seen in his very first acting role  which he absolutely triumphs in . And of course there's the unforgettable Chief Bromden. The directing by Milos Forman is very welldone as the camerawork is excellent and follows the pace of the movie perfectly in how it is used. What really impressed me was the editing especially as far as the use of audio goes some parts just made me go ...wow.My only complaint is that I believe the movie could've been slightly more effective if it were based more closely on the novel at certain points but the modified point of view of the film does make a great point anyone who has ever hated their job been accused of something had some person so selfrighteous and convinced of their own authority and dependency on order get in your way or attended the American public school system at any point in their life should be able to identify with this movie.".

I've seen many movies but there aren't much movies which had such an impact on me. Nowadays almost all filmmakers believe they can only make a good movie by adding loads of special effects and lots of huge explosions ... This movie is so good so convincing without them. The actors played their roles in such a convincing way that you would think these weren't actors at all but real psychiatric patients.This movie may be 30 years old but it hasn't lost any of its relevancy. OK we don't put our mentally ill people in that kind of prisons anymore the bars in front of the windows have gone and now we call it hospitals in stead of nut houses. But the treatment hasn't changed all that much. I once worked in such a hospital as a volunteer and still saw things like forced feeding giving people so much medication until they no longer know who or where they are...When the movie first came out some people were shocked because when you watch the movie you can't help it feeling more attached to the patients than to the doctors and nurses. This movie shows that cinema can make a difference. It can help to open people's eyes. If there is a movie that should be seen by everyone this sure is the one. I give it a well deserved 1010.".

	schema:reviewBody "The opening shot of ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST is a bleak  glance at an Oregon morning.  Stirring haunting music plays gracefully on the soundtrack and a car approaches.  Inside the car is one of film history's most remarkable characters.   Randle McMurphy is about to bring hope humor and a glimmer of reality to some disturbed people in a mental hospital. Jack Nicholson as McMurphy is something of a paradox.  Is this guy crazy or is he really the lazy conniving criminal most believe him to be?  That is the magical mystery and start to a journey into mental illness and the effect this man will have on some truly messed up men.Milos Forman directs this alltime classic which swept the Oscars deservedly and holds up so well 25 years later.  It is a simplistic film about small people living in their own small worlds.  Manic moments are mixed with poignant acting all leading to an astounding climax.  Not before or since CUCKOO'S NEST has a collection of different characters had such an impact on me.  You could write a book report about each of the patients in the ward.  The two most important people here are of course Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher.Nicholson has his greatest moments in this picture.  One brilliant scene has him doing an imaginary playbyplay commentary of the 1963 World Series to the group who are not allowed to watch the game on TV.  It is a poetic sequence and Nicholson goes crazy with his delivery describing baseball with colorful anecdotes and profanity.  McMurphy immediately makes an impression on the crazies and shows them how they don't have to stick to the normal routine.  He knows their names right away he sprays them with water he makes impossible bets with them he introduces them to fishing and he even gets a suffering young kid played well by Brad Dourif a date.  Louise Fletcher plays one of the more reprehensible human beings in film as Nurse Mildred Ratched.  She is a hardened woman one who makes the daily meetings with the group a contest to see who will win.  Her stubbornness and lack of compassion for the poor guys is rather one dimensional.  That's perfect because that is exactly who she is.  Her strong will to keep things monotonous leads to a final showdown with the free spirited McMurphy in what is easily one of the most shocking and disturbing climaxes in recent memory.ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST does not try to make a statement about mental illness or how the unstable should be treated.  Rather it is a very simple portrait of the long days and hilarious scenarios that can come about when a mixed bag of suffering people are thrown together.  Mental illness is nothing to laugh about but the fact that Nicholson is not really crazy at least in my opinion allows us to be amused.  He seems to love his compadres in the hospital.  He is mislead however into thinking he can do as he pleases.There is no denying the power of CUCKOO'S NEST.  The two main powerhouse performances are golden the cinematography is morbid and gritty like it should be the Chief is great as Nicholson's right hand ah protagonist and you care a lot about what will happen as the film moves on.  The famous final shot ironically happens to be an exit of a major character into that bleak Oregon morning. NOTE I have never read the book and I find it hard to believe author Ken Kesey has never watched the filmed version.  Comparing a book to a movie is impossible.  They are 2 distinctly different artistic methods of storytelling.".

One brilliant scene has him doing an imaginary playbyplay commentary of the 1963 World Series to the group who are not allowed to watch the game on TV.  It is a poetic sequence and Nicholson goes crazy with his delivery describing baseball with colorful anecdotes and profanity.  McMurphy immediately makes an impression on the crazies and shows them how they don't have to stick to the normal routine.  He knows their names right away he sprays them with water he makes impossible bets with them he introduces them to fishing and he even gets a suffering young kid played well by Brad Dourif a date.  Louise Fletcher plays one of the more reprehensible human beings in film as Nurse Mildred Ratched.  She is a hardened woman one who makes the daily meetings with the group a contest to see who will win.  Her stubbornness and lack of compassion for the poor guys is rather one dimensional.  That's perfect because that is exactly who she is.  Her strong will to keep things monotonous leads to a final showdown with the free spirited McMurphy in what is easily one of the most shocking and disturbing climaxes in recent memory.ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST does not try to make a statement about mental illness or how the unstable should be treated.  Rather it is a very simple portrait of the long days and hilarious scenarios that can come about when a mixed bag of suffering people are thrown together.  Mental illness is nothing to laugh about but the fact that Nicholson is not really crazy at least in my opinion allows us to be amused.  He seems to love his compadres in the hospital.  He is mislead however into thinking he can do as he pleases.There is no denying the power of CUCKOO'S NEST.  The two main powerhouse performances are golden the cinematography is morbid and gritty like it should be the Chief is great as Nicholson's right hand ah protagonist and you care a lot about what will happen as the film moves on.  The famous final shot ironically happens to be an exit of a major character into that bleak Oregon morning. NOTE I have never read the book and I find it hard to believe author Ken Kesey has never watched the filmed version.  Comparing a book to a movie is impossible.  They are 2 distinctly different artistic methods of storytelling.";

She is quietly evil and amazingly cruel to those within the asylum.  Nicholson and Fletcher are getting ready for a headoncollision that will prove to be the decisive factor at the end of the movie.

A chilling disturbing and revealing look into the mental institutions as seen through the eyes of a con. Jack Nicholson Louise Fletcher Brad Dourif Danny DeVito and Christopher Lloyd round out the excellent and very well casted cast.Jack Nicholson brilliantly plays Randall Patrick McMurphy an excon who fakes being mentally insane to enter the institution. As he goes to the hospital he doesn't realize that the people and the atmosphere there is so out there. The patients are really psycho and creepy. Randall must try and survive these days before he has to go to Jail. He has to entertain himself while at the same time find good in this place of craziness.Lousie Fletcher plays Nurse Ratched a soft but strong willed nurse who will not take anything from anyone or put up with misbehavior. She watches Randall and notices something different about him he's not as psycho as the others but he is a little out there. Her job is tough indeed having to put up with all these men who don't listen some go crazy and throw fits and others just sit there and don't do anything.Randall meets many new friends in this place Brad Dourif who plays Billy Bibbit is a mentally unstable but voluntarily institutionalized person. Danny DeVito plays Martini a slow but charming and sweet man who means know harm in what he does or say. Christopher Lloyd plays Taber a man who also voluntarily institutionalized himself. He also meets Chief a big 'dumb and deaf' Indian who happens to like to play basketball. Randall must try and survive these days with his new friends and the hospital as well as an everlasting war as to which they can watch the world series on TV. Put up with Nurse Ratched and the other patients doctors vistors and nurses. Ultimately leading up to a dramatic finale that makes you want to stand up and cheer.I think what was best about this film was the realism. I had no problem believing that this was happening. Almost like a documentary it was striking and powerful making the viewer not want to stop watching till the end. Some of the sequences are memorable as the basketball game and the fishing trip. Jack Nicholson who as always plays his character absolutely excellent and makes the viewer want to hand him an Oscar himself.The supporting cast Louise Fletcher Danny DeVito Christopher Lloyd and Brad Dourif also give terrific performances. Danny Christopher and Brad's careers all were made with this superb movie. It's all sentimental funny dramatic intense chilling disturbing diverting and tragic. The finale leaves the viewer stunned and sitting there thinking about what he just saw. See this film and believe it. I think you will find its one of the BEST ever.The second film to win all five major Oscars Best Picture Best Actor Nicholson Best Actress Fletcher Director and Screenplay.

	schema:reviewBody "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest 1975 is a film you'll appreciate more as you mature. I saw it a few times when I was younger and while I thought it was good I didn't 'get' a lot of the insights the film conveys. Viewing it again recently I 'got' it.Set in the early 60s the story involves R.P. McMurphy Jack Nicholson and his arrival at a mental institution in Salem Oregon where the film was shot. He plays the mental illness card to get out of prison time thinking it'll be a piece of cake but he's wrong very wrong. Everything appears well at the hospital and Nurse Ratched Louise Fletcher seems to be a benevolent overseer of McMurphy's ward but there are sinister things going on beneath the surface.The movie criticizes the way institutions deal with mental illnesses. Their therapy is futile and only makes the patients dependent on the institution itself thereby creating its need for existence at the taxpayer's expense. McMurphy is a threat to the establishment and therefore must be dealt with. A lot of people criticize the film by suggesting that Nurse Ratched isn't that bad or that she was only trying to do her job etc. I had the same reaction the first couple of times I saw it. This reveals an aspect of the film's brilliance Ratched's malevolence is so subtle that the filmmakers allow the possibility for complete misinterpretation. Yes from an administrative point of view she seemingly does a good job she's authoritarian without being sadistic and she cares for the residents as long as they follow the rules more on this below. Yet she is absolutely demonic as a robotized arm of a dehumanizing system. She maintains the residents in a state of oblivion and marginalization they are deprived of their dignity because the system sees them as subhuman.The filmmakers and Fletcher make Nurse Ratched a more effective antagonist by showing restraint. Compare this to say Faye Dunaway's portrayal of Joan Crawford in Mommie Dearest which pretty much turned her into a cartoon villain. Ratched isn't such an obvious sadist yet she uses the rules to tyrannize the men and reduce them to an almost infantile state of dependency and subservience. Her crowning achievement is Billy Bibbit Brad Dourif.McMurphy despite his obvious flaws is the protagonist of the story. Although he's impulsive and has a weakness for the female gender which got him into prison in the first place he has a spirit of freedom and life. His problem is that he needs to learn a bit of wisdom then he can walk in his freedom without causing unnecessary harm to himself and others.Nurse Ratched on the other hand represents legalism which is an authoritarian spirit obsessed with laws or rules. This is clearly seen in the World Series sequence Even though McMurphy gets the final vote he needs for his ward to watch the Series Ratched refuses to allow it on a technicality. When McMurphy then PRETENDS to watch the game and works the guys up into a state of euphoria Ratched reacts with sourpuss disapproval. That's because legalism is the opposite of the spirit of freedom life and joy. Legalism is all about putting on appearances and enforcing the LETTER of the law or rule. The problem with this is that appearances are not about reality and worse the letter kills. Despite his folly and mistakes McMurphy does more good for the guys in his ward than Ratched and the institution could do in a decade. How so? Not only because he has a spirit of freedom and life but because he loves deeply but only those who deserve it  the humble  not arrogant abusers. When you cast restraint to the wind and love with all your heart you'll reap love in return as long as the person is worthy. A certain person hugs McMurphy at the end because he loves him. McMurphy set him free from the shackles of mental illness and worse the institution that refuses to actually heal because it needs mentally ill people to exist it only goes through the motions of caring and healing not that there aren't any good people in such institutions of course.No review of this film is complete without mentioning the notable character of Chief played effectively by Will Sampson.The film runs 2 hour and 13 minutes.GRADE A".

She maintains the residents in a state of oblivion and marginalization they are deprived of their dignity because the system sees them as subhuman.The filmmakers and Fletcher make Nurse Ratched a more effective antagonist by showing restraint. Compare this to say Faye Dunaway's portrayal of Joan Crawford in Mommie Dearest which pretty much turned her into a cartoon villain. Ratched isn't such an obvious sadist yet she uses the rules to tyrannize the men and reduce them to an almost infantile state of dependency and subservience. Her crowning achievement is Billy Bibbit Brad Dourif.McMurphy despite his obvious flaws is the protagonist of the story. Although he's impulsive and has a weakness for the female gender which got him into prison in the first place he has a spirit of freedom and life. His problem is that he needs to learn a bit of wisdom then he can walk in his freedom without causing unnecessary harm to himself and others.Nurse Ratched on the other hand represents legalism which is an authoritarian spirit obsessed with laws or rules. This is clearly seen in the World Series sequence Even though McMurphy gets the final vote he needs for his ward to watch the Series Ratched refuses to allow it on a technicality. When McMurphy then PRETENDS to watch the game and works the guys up into a state of euphoria Ratched reacts with sourpuss disapproval. That's because legalism is the opposite of the spirit of freedom life and joy. Legalism is all about putting on appearances and enforcing the LETTER of the law or rule. The problem with this is that appearances are not about reality and worse the letter kills. Despite his folly and mistakes McMurphy does more good for the guys in his ward than Ratched and the institution could do in a decade. How so? Not only because he has a spirit of freedom and life but because he loves deeply but only those who deserve it  the humble  not arrogant abusers. When you cast restraint to the wind and love with all your heart you'll reap love in return as long as the person is worthy. A certain person hugs McMurphy at the end because he loves him. McMurphy set him free from the shackles of mental illness and worse the institution that refuses to actually heal because it needs mentally ill people to exist it only goes through the motions of caring and healing not that there aren't any good people in such institutions of course.No review of this film is complete without mentioning the notable character of Chief played effectively by Will Sampson.The film runs 2 hour and 13 minutes.GRADE A";

	schema:headline " One of the greatest movies and life lessons of all time";
	schema:reviewBody "Not many movies have won the big five in the academy awards. It's enough to win just best picture for a lot of movies. This movie portrays every film element to the highest degree from the beautiful panoramic shots of the mountains outside of the mental institution to the story of ultimate redemption McMurphy and Chief find at the end.The movie is seen through the eyes of Randle McMurphy Nicholson. He is sent to the mental institution because he would rather be considered insane and live in luxury other than being a jailbird in prison. Once he gets into the actual living area where the insane are he looks up at this tall native looking man they call Chief. McMurphy's initial reaction to Chief was his little Indian dance he did to mock him but once Chief didn't react McMurphy asked him if he played football and says to chief God damn boy you're as big as a mountain. Little by little you could see their friendship start to unfold out throughout the movie.In One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest the title villain would definitely belong to Nurse Ratched. She gave threats to the patients she was even friends with one of the patient's Billy mom. She also tries to toy with McMurphy's mind by trying to get him to conform with the customs of mental facility. It doesn't work out for her as planned. Including a classic scene where Nurse Ratched's threats cause little Billy to commit suicide. In rage McMurphy has seen enough and actually chokes her out. This causes McMurphy to go through a lobotomy and become a vegetable at his stay at the clinic.I know many people probably disagree with this but I think Chief killing McMurphy at the end was beautiful as much as it was heartbreaking. It symbolized that McMurphy still had a chance to redeem himself and become a hero even if it were death. It also gave Chief clearance to finally escape the premises and fly from the cuckoo's nest and how he did it at the end was classic. That's what makes this movie one of the greatest of all time not only because of the sensational acting and the sociological significance but because of the message and symbolism of the story.The directing by Milos Foreman was phenomenal not only with the memorable acting by Jack Nicholson but with the camera shots he used in certain scenes. For example the scene before McMurphy was about to get electroshock therapy they show a very close up angle of him to show the intensity and crowdedness he had to go through while getting the shock treatment. Nicholson also makes it pretty believable that he is actually getting shocked by making gurgling noises and such.They actually go back to the lying down closed angle shot at the end of the movie when Nicholson passes away. I thought it was very brave of the director to keep that long shot of McMurphy's dead self because by making it last as though it were a still shot to me it seemed more and more believable that McMurphy was actually dead. I don't know how Nicholson just lied there stiff as a board. I know he may have won his Oscar because of his heroic and charismatic character but how he dealt with himself in those two scenes is what tickles my fancy.The ideology of this film is in my opinion what makes it one of the greatest of all time. The story brings up the question of who's actually the insane McMurphy and his patients or Nurse Ratched and the staff? Clinically McMurphy was not insane. Even the doctors and professors stated that but since he didn't follow the norms and the dictatorship of Nurse Ratched he had to stay at the sanitarium longer. I also loved the allusion of Chief by acting deaf and dumb. He played the omniscient or godlike role of hearing and seeing everything yet not saying anything himself. It almost seems as he was the narrating the story until he befriended McMurphy.I don't know if I could think of a more evil villain in a movie other than Nurse Ratched Louise Fletcher. The evil looks she gave to her patients when they were doing something wrong was as coldhearted as one could get. Also her audacity to tell Billy's mother about his sexual deviance is as sinister as you can get. She knew that it would hurt Billy deeply which was a major reason he was insane is because of his relationship with his mother. He eventually killed himself angering McMurphy.I never thought I would cheer out loud when a grown man was choking out a little woman but I did here. This scene did a fantastic job of not making it taboo but making you want her dead even more. This did change Nurse Ratched however it made her a little nicer to the patients at the end and made her realize that if she abuses her power as a nurse it can come back to haunt her.The meaning of this story is wonderful and helped Jack Nicholson set the bar for acting. The symbolism of Chief's and McMurphy's redemption serves as a corner stone for many many movies today. Whether it be the costumes of the patients the crazy acting or even the beautiful classic shot at the end of the movie where Chief runs out to freedom This movie will never be forgotten. And it serves as a good lesson for everyone out there who feels left out can all come together and get freedom. I advise anybody who says they love movies to watch this film because it will not only change your views it will change your life and you can't say that about a lot of movies.".

I loved his performance in The Shining and am ashamed to say I have yet to see As Good as it Gets one of three movies he won best actor Oscars for. He delivered an average performance in The Departed and isn't getting any younger but I do hope he gives us at least one more role that comes close to the show he put on in Cuckoo's Nest.

Louise Fletcher did a great job as the leading actress and strong performances by all the supporting characters made the movie brilliant. Good screenplay good directing and the music by Jack Nitzsche played nicely with the film.I've seen some hate about the ending but in my opinion it couldn't have been better.

	schema:reviewBody "This is undeniably one of the best films ever made in the history of movie making.. In 1975 One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest swept all four major academy awards... Best Actor Jack Nicholson Best Actress Louise Fletcher Best Direstor Milos Foreman and of course Best Picture!! Only on very rare occasion does this occur... Only a handful of films may lay claim to such an honor!! One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest is a stunning portrayal of mental illness and how even the most affluent nation on earth The U.S.A. is totally unequipped to deal with it properly!! Jack Nicholson's performance in this movie is one of the greatest performances ever by an actor... The array of all the psychologically debilitating diseases was itemized to a flawless state of depressing realism.. The emotional explanations for the dysfunctional dispositions with everyone in One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest were so astutely broken down that it evoked a concise indication that not just any producers directors actors or actresses could partake in this film!! Such a depiction upholds the proverbial contention that if you are not mentally disturbed when you go into the Booby Hatch you will be when you get out of it!! In the case of Jack Nicholson's character he seemed relatively nonculpable for any intense psychiatric affliction it was a matter of slight discrepancies!! It is as if he was severely punished for not finishing his cereal at breakfast time!! The talent in this movie is incredible.. I liked the television show Taxi and it stands to reason why... So many of the actors who starred in One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest were in the T.V. Show Taxi too!! The gripping conversation which dealt with a man who was impotent was perhaps the single most poignant part of this film!! The line I remember in particular was Do me a favor and don't be on my side okay... In the normal world the average person is burdened in his ability to communicate with someone else due to a conflict of interests!! In the case of a poorly funded mental health facility this apocalyptic predicament manifests itself horrendously and thus has an intolerable proliferation!! Authorities in the mental hospital are restricted by a serious lack of funding so they are quick to generalize!! The overall situation which garners societal sympathy at a mental health facility is categorized as sad and platitudes such as we will do all we can are everybody's precarious form of consolation!!! Mental illness gets a generic label and from there becomes something which is basically swept under the rug!! Here is where the film One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest expounds on their abysmal dissertation concerning mental illness!!One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest was based on a true story!! Mr McMurphy Jack Nicholson was a lone rebel from start to finish with this film!! Whatever the orderlies or the nurses would say he would disagree with!! It was always an issue that could not be looked at rationally by one patient or the other that compounded the dilemma of mental anguish... Such a plight became the culprit to a lack of thorough communication and thus invoked an overreaction from the administration of the hospital!! You are branded mentally ill and that is all anyone has to know!! The total lack of egalitarian commiseration with administration was why McMurphy was so belligerent!! The status quo was to subject patients to grave consequences for their actions... Are the nurses and administrators wrong for doing this? Usually not!! It was the gray matter in this film that made it so intellectually riveting!! Mental health patients are often times aware of the fact that they are vilified in the same manner you would a bunch of seven year old kids for not doing their school work!! Their self respect gets relegated to a bureaucratic mandate and all of this is subconsciously and consciously demoralizing!! If someone were to have a conversation with Charles Manson they would realize so many depraved patterns of illogical behavior to him however if Charles Manson were to say that two plus two equals four the correct answer does not get changed to five!! What is the point of this example? Mental health patients are not inaccurate in every assessment that they make just because they are labeled mentally challenged!! What was Mr McMurphy's contention with so many issues is that he would assume a premise of mutual self respect when engaging in an argument with an orderly... This is not a case of defiance rather an instance of a one on one debate... How quickly the administration would then resort to the cop out of Well!! What do you expect!! This guy is mentally illI have never seen a film like this one!! Woman Under The Influence which was made around the same time was incredibly spellbinding as well... One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest however is something which should be put in a category all by itself!! Director Milos Foreman articulates cerebral despondence to a state of dissonant plausibility with this film!! This becomes an avenue for political debate... Foreman's movie breaks ground on mental illness being one big cacophony of our nation's failure to communicate!! Louise Fletcher is tremendous as Nurse Ratched her dedication to the tenets of disciplinary policy became vicariously ruthless her devotion to this standard was extremely deep rooted!! Nurse Ratched's insolence was an aspect of infuriation that was in of itself amazingly thought provoking!! As I have previously mentioned Jack Nicholson was excellent as McMurphy the mental health patient who reoriented the ideology of what it means to deal with mental illness... Tremendous film maybe the best American film ever made... Do you think that sounds strong? Watch the movie first and then tell me I am exaggerating!! REMARKABLE!! UTTERLY REMARKABLE!!".

	schema:headline " The Ultimate Backfire";
	schema:reviewBody "It took a dozen years for One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest to make it to the big screen from Broadway. In 1962 Kirk Douglas made his one and only return to Broadway to star as Randall P. McMurphy on stage with Joan Tetzel as his nemesis nurse Ratched. Douglas bought the screen rights but by the time anyone was interested in doing the film version Kirk was too old for the part.That may have been a break for the movie fans because as much as I like Kirk Douglas I can't see anyone but Jack Nicholson doing this role as the free spirited McMurphy. McMurphy's a low level career criminal type who statutorily raped a girl as he put it '15 going on 35'. He decides to fake a crazy act while in prison to get out of the work farm he's assigned to.So Nicholson's goes to the mental hospital where he meets an odd assortment of people whom he discovers voluntarily checked themselves in there mainly because it's easier to stay there and not take all your psychological baggage into society. That's a crucial difference that Nicholson finds out the hard way his new friends most of them can pack up and leave anytime they want. He's sent there by the state and the state determines when he's ready to go even if it's past the allotted jail time he was sentenced to.The state in this case is Louise Fletcher as Nurse Ratched one of the great Dickensian names ever given a movie character. Louise is the ultimate control freak and these people who've shut themselves away from life are her ultimate tools. When Nicholson comes in he hasn't given up on life like the rest of these poor souls he becomes a threat to Fletcher's little empire.It's hard to believe that such a smart guy like McMurphy would not have known the rules about commitment.

	onyx:emotionText "It took a dozen years for One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest to make it to the big screen from Broadway. In 1962 Kirk Douglas made his one and only return to Broadway to star as Randall P. McMurphy on stage with Joan Tetzel as his nemesis nurse Ratched. Douglas bought the screen rights but by the time anyone was interested in doing the film version Kirk was too old for the part.That may have been a break for the movie fans because as much as I like Kirk Douglas I can't see anyone but Jack Nicholson doing this role as the free spirited McMurphy. McMurphy's a low level career criminal type who statutorily raped a girl as he put it '15 going on 35'. He decides to fake a crazy act while in prison to get out of the work farm he's assigned to.So Nicholson's goes to the mental hospital where he meets an odd assortment of people whom he discovers voluntarily checked themselves in there mainly because it's easier to stay there and not take all your psychological baggage into society. That's a crucial difference that Nicholson finds out the hard way his new friends most of them can pack up and leave anytime they want. He's sent there by the state and the state determines when he's ready to go even if it's past the allotted jail time he was sentenced to.The state in this case is Louise Fletcher as Nurse Ratched one of the great Dickensian names ever given a movie character. Louise is the ultimate control freak and these people who've shut themselves away from life are her ultimate tools. When Nicholson comes in he hasn't given up on life like the rest of these poor souls he becomes a threat to Fletcher's little empire.It's hard to believe that such a smart guy like McMurphy would not have known the rules about commitment. Still it doesn't detract a bit from the overall quality of One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest.Though the topic is not a fixed one to any era the script does leave many oblique references to the Sixties in the film. The electroshock treatment and the lobotomy operations depicted here were by 1975 no longer in use.

	schema:reviewBody "'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' 1975 based on the novel by Ken Kesey and directed by Milos Forman centers around R.P McMurphy Jack Nicholson a prisoner serving time for the statutory rape of a 15 year old among other things. In an attempt to escape from the work yards in the penitentiary McMurphy fakes a mental illness leading to him being admitted into a mental hospital. There he befriends many of the other patients in the ward and attempts to break them out of the strict and monotonous routine set by Head Nurse Ratched Louise Fletcher.OK first of all it has to be said I had quite high expectations for this movie. It came highly recommend by both my parents is number 8 on IMDb's Top 250 list and won the grand slam at the 1975 Oscars Best Picture Director Actor and Actress. However I was left extremely disappointed with this film.While the first 20 minutes seem promising showcasing Nicholsons immense talent the film drags for the next hour trying to convince you to love McMurphy and loathe Nurse Ratchet unsuccessfully I will add. Which brings me to my first and largest problem with this film. On the back of my DVD case it states that Nurse Ratchet is among the coldly monstrous villains in film history. Based upon that assessment I expected numerous unnecessary unethical punishments and a complete lack of care for her patients. Well I did not receive that no instead we got a firm cold woman that takes charge of her ward filled with mentally unstable and perhaps dangerous people with an iron fist being nothing but a true reflection of the mental health system at the time. That being said I am not in anyway completely condoning her behavior. She is far too cold to be an effective nurse and her use of manipulation would not be accepted in today's society. However to asses her as being the one of most wicked evil heartless is completely and utter over exaggeration and unfortunately paints the film in a 'State vs Rebel' way.Which leads also to my other major problem with this film. McMurphy is not likable. At least not to me. He is an arrogant selfcentered 'rebel' who has made the rather laughable decision to get himself committed to this mental hospital as he is tired of the prison work yard. But no we are supposed to cheer him on in his attempts to rid the ward of rules and boundaries in other words 'fight the system'. Perhaps it was 'in' to rebel against the state in the 70's? To me this film reeked of this ideology spoiling much of it.There are certainly positives to 'One Flew Over' and I can understand on one level why is rated so highly by many critics and audiences. It is well directed the acting by the two leads regardless of my objection of the use of their characters is extremely well done but I do not believe it to be Nicholsons best work as many praise it to be. There are genuine funny moments to be had and a certain scene revolving around cigarettes is the perfect example of acting at its best. The last 20 minutes is also very well executed and left me somewhat vindicated.Overall however the particular framing of the 2 leads left me simply annoyed with this film and as such I was left underwhelmed.".

	schema:reviewBody "Put a straightjacket on me because I think this movie is insanely good! Based off Ken Kesey's novel of the same name and directed by Milos Forman One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest tells the story of Randle P. McMurphy Jack Nicholson a convicted criminal admitted to a mental ward when he pleads insanity to escape labor duties in prison. Once there the rebel wildman McMurphy bump heads against the authority figure and head administrative nurse the oppressive Nurse Mildred Ratched Louise Fletcher on the way she treats her patients. McMurphy believes that they should be treated like real men with more personal freedom while Ratched couther his argument by stating that any more freedom would lead to chaos anarchy and death. In my opinion while she play as the villain she's in fact she was somewhat right and correct by her judgment but the way she enforced order on the mentally disable in highly crude and inhuman. In fact by egging McMurphy on she made things much much worst. One might view this movie as antiinstitution antireligion or antigovernment. One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest was written in 1959 and published in 1962 in the midst of the civil unrest. It deeply changes to the way psychology and psychiatry were being approached in America while also challenging how government should treat its people. By the end of the 1960s the controversial movement towards deinstitutionalization has become a real deal while trust in government officials were in an alltime low. When 1975 came most of the mentally ill found themselves untreated and living in the streets and government being highly criticism for corruption and overused of power. The 1970's were bit anarchism at the time. It wasn't until later that things became more balance and confinement. In a way social institutions do serve a purpose and the movie serves as allegory tale showing how things like order vs chaos can become really offbalance. The movie really goes into deep detail on how different authorities McMurphy and Ratched control individuals through subtle and coercive methods. A supporting character like the Chief Will Sampson talks about 'the Combine' in reference to the mechanistic way both manipulate and process individuals. Nurse Ratched controls the inhabitants of the novel's mental ward through a combination of emasculation and subtle shame. While McMurphy controls his fellow men by encouraging them to be wild men and challenge conformism. It was no surprise that both Louise Fletcher and Jack Nicolson won Best ActorActress at the Academy Awards that year as both delivered such a gripping gritty and genuine performances. The movie has just as good supporting cast with several unknown actors of the time stars like Christopher Lloyd Danny Devito and Brad Dourif helping in. I like how the movie was shot. Forman's direction is deadon as he manages to capture the monotony of routine on the ward without allowing the film to drag. You get how eerily quiet it is. Order is impose on the patients with almost religious cultlike rigor. When the medicine is delivered. It's like communion. It's so zombielike. The animal running along a manmade chain fence representing wild vs civilize. The movie is full of hidden gem themes like those examples. Yet the movie was missing a few things from the novel such as the Fog which symbolize a lack of insight and an escape from reality and McMurphy's Moby Dick Boxer Shorts which interpretation as a phallic symbol and blatant sexuality. It can also represents the pervasive evil that inspires Ahab's obsessive futile pursuit. Both Ratched and McMurphy is trying to humiliation the other by exposing the faults of each other's gender. A third interpretation is that MobyDick stands for the power of nature signifying McMurphy's untamed nature that conflicts with the controlled institution. Although it's hard to find fault it's certainly possible. Overpowering women are seem to evil by the writers and weak women are shown to act like sex object. It's somewhat noticeable that the movie is a bit misogyny. Another thing is the movie's love letter message to society anarchy and black and white approach when it comes to the hospital vs the patients. Another fault of the film is how the Chief was cut down as the narrator and put into a much smaller role. Much of his life prior to the hospital was not shown. You see a lot of NativeAmerican themes throughout the film despite that. The music by Jack Nitzsche sounds something out of a western. It's represented the struggles of true freedom over confinement. Despite its dark and strong drama undertones there were some comedic tendencies. It was a lot of fun to watch as the drama slowly evolves into tragedy toward its conclusion. It's wasn't slow and painful. It was a very entertaining well rounded film. The movie has aged well with newer DVD copies putting out the best quality for it. Overall The film is powerful and moving. It's a mustwatch. I recommended it.".

	schema:headline " A great classic concerned with human dignity and insanity.";
	schema:reviewBody "One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest may be Milo Forman's best work to day and stands the test of time as an enduring classic about an eccentric McMurphy Jack Nicholson at odds with a wound up nurse Ratched Louise Fletcher. If any film examines the social issues on people's minds back in 75' as well as One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest it's grandeur should replace this one because this film takes a thorough and complex dive into insanity and its definition. Based on the book by Ken Kesey One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest is a fleshed out and realized story of a man who pleads insanity to get out of jailwork time and is therefore admitted to an insane asylum. While there he disrupts the inmates flow of order and routine and wreaks havoc on the employees with Nurse Ratched. The film tends to balance this tightrope of insanity by presenting characters we not only believe in but somehow feel we know personally. Potentially due to incredible characterization through outstanding performances plausible dialogue and clear direction from Milo Forman. One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest features one of Jack Nicholson's best performances ever put to film Understandably winning Jack Nicholson a Best Actor in a Leading Role Oscar. His electric and wildly entertaining performances however doesn't overshadow Louise Fletcher's stern and deeply intimidating performance as a menacing strict and unfeeling antagonist. While both our protagonist and antagonist are clear from the beginning the story wisely blurs that line of hero and villain by asking the audience Who is crazy? near the end of the film. The film also makes a case to examine the individual consequences wrought on by mental institutions with all their imperfections. When we see images of cages walls and windows to represent barriers we understand a humanistic need to break them and explore uncharted territory. Alternatively most inmates in the asylum feel so institutionalized by said asylum which stunts further healing from whatever conditions debilitate them. So while One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest is wonderfully characterized and unified in plot right up to the end it feels like an important film with things to say and questions to ask about insanity and what makes a person crazy.While One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest is indeed a masterpiece of filmmaking as many lead it to believe it isn't without its flaws. As the film draws near its end we learn who was really changed in this story and who's story this is to tell. This was indeed a powerful narrative tool in the end which makes its climax sensical more context and characterization for this character would've improved the ending for a more satisfying conclusion. A lot more catharsis could've been rendered if we had a chance to connect with that character more and the movie could've driven some more clearer points home to help understand why watching the film would be important regardless of time period. Aside from the smaller negatives One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest is an unforgettable and wonderful movie that deserves to be watched and studied as carefully as possible.".

His electric and wildly entertaining performances however doesn't overshadow Louise Fletcher's stern and deeply intimidating performance as a menacing strict and unfeeling antagonist. While both our protagonist and antagonist are clear from the beginning the story wisely blurs that line of hero and villain by asking the audience Who is crazy? near the end of the film. The film also makes a case to examine the individual consequences wrought on by mental institutions with all their imperfections. When we see images of cages walls and windows to represent barriers we understand a humanistic need to break them and explore uncharted territory. Alternatively most inmates in the asylum feel so institutionalized by said asylum which stunts further healing from whatever conditions debilitate them. So while One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest is wonderfully characterized and unified in plot right up to the end it feels like an important film with things to say and questions to ask about insanity and what makes a person crazy.While One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest is indeed a masterpiece of filmmaking as many lead it to believe it isn't without its flaws. As the film draws near its end we learn who was really changed in this story and who's story this is to tell. This was indeed a powerful narrative tool in the end which makes its climax sensical more context and characterization for this character would've improved the ending for a more satisfying conclusion. A lot more catharsis could've been rendered if we had a chance to connect with that character more and the movie could've driven some more clearer points home to help understand why watching the film would be important regardless of time period. Aside from the smaller negatives One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest is an unforgettable and wonderful movie that deserves to be watched and studied as carefully as possible.";

The real problem with the movie is that it runs like a typical SciFi action plot inserted under a Star Trek banner.This movie is missing the hallmark epiphany moments Star Trek is famous for. Mainly it is missing the philosophical WOW factors that don't just blow your mind but rather expands it making you realise that everything you thought you knew is wrong and that everything you thought the Federation had figured out is also wrong. These expansions used to pave the way for the audience to mentally and emotionally take that next step to Boldly go where no man has gone before... This movie has no epiphany. Where is the deepness that Star Trek is synonymous with? This movie gives us what? A federation struggling with internal corruption and terrorism a la the typical disgruntled ex employee who in this case was cryogenics frozen for 300 years as is the plot. Big deal. These are familiar themes we've all seen in movies before. Just trade the Federation for any corrupt financial medical educational government and or religious institution. Trade the John Harrison character for any Bond villain and you have a movie that sounds like a bunch of other movies or what the news broadcasts. Boring.To me the Federation meant a time in the future when Humanity had finally gotten its act together and to a certain extent had rooted out all this corruption and terrorism. Unless a Klingon or Romulan shows up things are supposed to be refreshingly illuminating. Not something that degrades into ordinary mainstream average caveman fist fight showdowns. How can we boldly go where no man has gone before in the future unless we have thrown off the shackles of the past? What a sadshamey day it is when a Star Trek movie presents a not so optimistic future just as dark as today's headlines. I can readwatch the newsThe Matrix if I want that. IS THERE NO ESCAPE?!!! IS THERE NO HOPE?!!! Obviously Gene Roddenberry's spirit could not find a way to keep the franchise on track.

	schema:headline " The movie got Trek cannon wrong got basic 21st century science wrong and in no way contributed to Gene Roddenberry's dream of a better world";
	schema:reviewBody "The film was horrible.With that said I'll start with the good. Karl Urban's Dr. McCoy was the one shining star in the film. His deadpan line He'd let you die Jim was perfect. It showed the struggle between compassion and logic that was so well portrayed by Kelly and Nimoy in the original series. First the film completely disregards Star Trek cannon. Christopher Pike does not live through the movie to end up as a quadriplegic on Talos IV. The Klingon home world Kronos appears to have a moon Praxis that has exploded except this doesn't happen until Star Trek VI. All this is forgivable however new movies for a new generation that knows nothing about Star TrekSecond what isn't forgivable is that basic Newtonian physics and science is so poorly understood by the film makers that it distracts from the movie. Some examples of plainly not understand that the world around you is governed by science and not magic are the heat from the volcano is attributed to damaging shuttle craft Galileo yet the heat caused by deorbiting the shuttle craft would far exceed any heat caused by a volcano. In the same sequence the Enterprise is parked underwater. Are we to believe that a star ship that must be constructed in space and is designed to be used for interstellar travel also doubles as a submarine? When was the last time that you boarded a 747 to go on an undersea adventure? And why in the hell would they park the Enterprise underwater when they could be invisible in orbit directly above the volcano and use sensors and transporters? Other big issues are that the crew of the starship Enterprise does not know the distance of the moon's orbit. Ask Neil Armstrong I bet he figured it out 300 years earlier. I think the first question on starship helmsman's exam should be Where is the moon and so you don't hit it? Next when the ship can no longer hold orbit it falls back to earth in a few minutes like a stone dropped into a pond. Newton? Never heard of him! What laws of motion? I think movies reflect a lot upon a generation. This new generation claims nerds are cool but has no manned space program. Your parents' generation actually walked on the moon.Third when the script however fails to make common sense it throws you outside the movie and this makes the movie 'unfun'. After a secure secret Starfleet facility is attacked Starfleet Command decides to meet in an unprotected high rise. I guess in the 23rd century rank isn't correlated with intelligence or experience. Next the Klingons are a war like race equally as advanced as humans that have developed space travel but they don't bother to guard their entire home world. They actually sound pretty easy to conquer. That's okay because humans are just as dumb two Federation ships appear in earth orbit to duke it out and there are no other Federation ships around. Please will one ship randomly fall on San Francisco? We sound pretty easy to conquer too. Let's not forget about the unnecessary obligatory giant tittied girl in skimpy underwear to make all the 14 year old boys have happy wet dreams. I love nude women as much as the next guy but porn has it's time and place and this wasn't it Unless you are a 14 year old boy with 10.50 for a movie and no other access to porn.When Kirk died why did Dr. McCoy need Kahn's blood to save him? He had 72 genetically engineered humans from the eugenics war frozen in front of him. The Eugenics Wars are well documented. He actually had to thaw one of those guys out to put Kirk in the life support tube. Why not use his blood or one of the other 71 samples of super blood?Fourth I remember when Spock died in Star Trek II people cried it was debated if he could really be dead. It was an emotional heartfelt moment that asked the audience to way the needs of the many versus the needs of the few. Did anyone really think Jim was dead in this movie? He was dead for all of five minutes! It was a completely wasted scene because it was devoid of emotional connection. I believe it was 30 seconds wedged in the middle of two action sequences. This may be because modern movie audiences lack the social skills such as empathy which are necessary for bonding with others. So the film makers simply recreate a scene from the past devoid of emotion and the audience believes it has the received the same spellbinding moment that their parents received.The only emotion portrayed in the whole film is the Caulfield like teenage angst of Captain Kirk. Great men are no longer portrayed as being challenged with great responsibility or moral questions but now face the pubescent problems of spoiled teenagers. This is the greatest reason why this new Star Trek movie fails. Gene Roddenberry created a future where men had moved beyond many of humanities vices. He created a series of moral plays in his Wagon train to the sky the original series is more like twilight zone episodes than anything else. Where in this movie did you feel good about humanity? Did this movie make you feel like we could end the Iraq War? That's how the old series made you feel about Vietnam and the Cold War. Did it make you feel that bigotry toward gays would end? That's how the original series made you feel about racism. The movie is an epic fail that reflects a generation that is an epic failure.".

Christopher Pike does not live through the movie to end up as a quadriplegic on Talos IV. The Klingon home world Kronos appears to have a moon Praxis that has exploded except this doesn't happen until Star Trek VI. All this is forgivable however new movies for a new generation that knows nothing about Star TrekSecond what isn't forgivable is that basic Newtonian physics and science is so poorly understood by the film makers that it distracts from the movie. Some examples of plainly not understand that the world around you is governed by science and not magic are the heat from the volcano is attributed to damaging shuttle craft Galileo yet the heat caused by deorbiting the shuttle craft would far exceed any heat caused by a volcano. In the same sequence the Enterprise is parked underwater. Are we to believe that a star ship that must be constructed in space and is designed to be used for interstellar travel also doubles as a submarine? When was the last time that you boarded a 747 to go on an undersea adventure? And why in the hell would they park the Enterprise underwater when they could be invisible in orbit directly above the volcano and use sensors and transporters? Other big issues are that the crew of the starship Enterprise does not know the distance of the moon's orbit. Ask Neil Armstrong I bet he figured it out 300 years earlier. I think the first question on starship helmsman's exam should be Where is the moon and so you don't hit it? Next when the ship can no longer hold orbit it falls back to earth in a few minutes like a stone dropped into a pond. Newton? Never heard of him! What laws of motion? I think movies reflect a lot upon a generation. This new generation claims nerds are cool but has no manned space program. Your parents' generation actually walked on the moon.Third when the script however fails to make common sense it throws you outside the movie and this makes the movie 'unfun'. After a secure secret Starfleet facility is attacked Starfleet Command decides to meet in an unprotected high rise. I guess in the 23rd century rank isn't correlated with intelligence or experience. Next the Klingons are a war like race equally as advanced as humans that have developed space travel but they don't bother to guard their entire home world. They actually sound pretty easy to conquer. That's okay because humans are just as dumb two Federation ships appear in earth orbit to duke it out and there are no other Federation ships around. Please will one ship randomly fall on San Francisco? We sound pretty easy to conquer too. Let's not forget about the unnecessary obligatory giant tittied girl in skimpy underwear to make all the 14 year old boys have happy wet dreams. I love nude women as much as the next guy but porn has it's time and place and this wasn't it Unless you are a 14 year old boy with 10.50 for a movie and no other access to porn.When Kirk died why did Dr. McCoy need Kahn's blood to save him? He had 72 genetically engineered humans from the eugenics war frozen in front of him. The Eugenics Wars are well documented. He actually had to thaw one of those guys out to put Kirk in the life support tube. Why not use his blood or one of the other 71 samples of super blood?Fourth I remember when Spock died in Star Trek II people cried it was debated if he could really be dead. It was an emotional heartfelt moment that asked the audience to way the needs of the many versus the needs of the few. Did anyone really think Jim was dead in this movie? He was dead for all of five minutes! It was a completely wasted scene because it was devoid of emotional connection. I believe it was 30 seconds wedged in the middle of two action sequences. This may be because modern movie audiences lack the social skills such as empathy which are necessary for bonding with others. So the film makers simply recreate a scene from the past devoid of emotion and the audience believes it has the received the same spellbinding moment that their parents received.The only emotion portrayed in the whole film is the Caulfield like teenage angst of Captain Kirk. Great men are no longer portrayed as being challenged with great responsibility or moral questions but now face the pubescent problems of spoiled teenagers. This is the greatest reason why this new Star Trek movie fails. Gene Roddenberry created a future where men had moved beyond many of humanities vices. He created a series of moral plays in his Wagon train to the sky the original series is more like twilight zone episodes than anything else. Where in this movie did you feel good about humanity? Did this movie make you feel like we could end the Iraq War? That's how the old series made you feel about Vietnam and the Cold War. Did it make you feel that bigotry toward gays would end? That's how the original series made you feel about racism. The movie is an epic fail that reflects a generation that is an epic failure.";

Because the well got dry and it seemed there wasn't anywhere left to go with the franchise. So seeing as Abrams alluded to everyone that by taking the franchise back to where it all began and altering the time line it was his intention to retell stories from the original series and breathe new life into them. Naturally I thought he was talking about the original TV series from the 60's. Fine by me because the original TV series was cool but it's pretty much outdated.This latest movie has shown me that it's obvious he just wants to do the films of the 80's and 90's all over again but in his own image which is... an abundance of lens flares and people who are only good at looking pretty on screen. And that in my opinion is not what Star Trek is about. He even stated in an interview with Jon Stewart recently on The Daily Show that he never was a fan of Star Trek as a child because he didn't get the philosophy of Star Trek. This movie is proof that he still doesn't get it. If he wants to make flashy scifi movies with no depth or substance fine there are plenty of scripts out there for him to make this kind of bland movie that attracts dimwitted people. So please Mr. Abrams leave Star Trek alone you are only making it worse.Abrams might be trying to get nonTrekkers to enjoy the franchise but in order to do so he is replacing everything that made Star Trek what it was in the first place. I'd love for more people to get into Star Trek but not at the expense of my enjoyment of it. This movie has nothing more to offer than Transformers did snazzy special effects and a story line riddled with plot holes and lovehate relationships between the characters that seem forced and unauthentic.Which brings me to my next point. Orci Kurtzman and Lindelof. Where did these men learn to write? They use the technology of Star Trek only to advance the plot or create tension when needed. For instance a transporter that the enemy uses can transport him light years to another planet but the transporters on the Enterprise have a hard job locking onto a person on the planet they are orbiting a handheld communicator that can call someone in a bar on Earth from the Klingon home world light years away infiltrating a top secret military base with a shuttle craft without being spotted by sensors and the list goes on.The last part of the movie they just got so lazy that they recreated the whole death scene at the end of Wrath of Khan but mirrored it by reversing the roles. And if that's not enough the writers blatantly do a copypaste of most of the dialogue like If we go in there we'll die the radiation will kill us and The decontamination process is not complete you'll flood the whole compartment.Later on they even forget that the attributes that makes Khan's blood special and which is needed to revive Kirk also flows through the veins of the other 72 augments sitting in cryogenic tubes in McCoy's sick bay the same cryogenic tubes that McCoy himself says earlier in the movie he could not risk opening without possibly killing the person inside which could have been a solid reason to send Spock chasing after Khan in a foot chase through downtown SanFrancisco to retrieve a sample of Khan's blood but instead they have McCoy open a cryogenic tube and remove it's occupant in order to freeze Kirk so he can preserve his brain functions I believe his exact words were Get this guy out of the cryotube keep him in an induced coma. but still poor McCoy doesn't realize he could use that person's blood to revive Kirk. So now we are led to believe that McCoy the same McCoy who based most of his arguments on ethics throughout the series and movies is perfectly capable of opening one of the tubes risking another being's life in the process all to save another man? A little unethical if you ask me. These guys obviously don't know what the hell they are doing when it comes to writing Star Trek movies.This movie is in my opinion the worst in the entire series.

	schema:headline " The entire franchise is now in 'Darkness'";
	schema:reviewBody "Since it has now become dilithium crystal clear that J.J. Abrams and his team of writers have COMPLETELY dismantled the entire Trek universe we once knew  the one that was built so meticulously by Gene Roddenberry and later Harve Bennett and Nick Meyer too  we must now embrace a Trek product that will likely insult and disgust most purists plus any ticket buyer who wants something more than a movie enjoyed by ADHD attention spans.This Into Darkness film continues where the 2009 effort left off and with much the same approach but the decibel level is harder on the eardrums this time more explosions more stunts more fistycuffs more chases both in space and Terra Firma more phaser shots and more temper tantrums from Kirk and Spock both.I could rhetorically say something like WTF? Why is this STAR TREK? WHY!?!?!? and then launch into a heated Trekpurist diatribe attacking the intellectuallychallenged comic booklevel screenplay penned by Orci Kurtzman and Lindelof. But instead let us try to examine the movie as a spacebound ripoff of the Die Hard franchise which obviously are the terms on which the film hopes to succeed.The film's plot presents a saturnine blackovercoated menace named John Harrison played woodenly by Benedict Cumberpatch who starts blowing up buildings in London then shooting at a roomful of Starfleet's top brass during a staff meeting. He then escapes to the Klingon homeworld to hide out and will presumably resume his mysterious rampage against the Federation later.But not if James T. Kirk can help it. Even if it means starting a war with the Klingons our risktaking Captain gets the green light from Admiral Marcus Peter Weller to warp the Enterprise over to Kronos armed with some secret missiles and an undercover mission imperative. As Kirk tells his crew over the intercom Let's go get the son of a bitch.Such a standardized bythenumbers action yarn has succeeded in efforts produced by the Jerry Bruckheimer stable for example or even the second Aliens movie. But here the film feels so overstuffed with chases phaser beams and mortal combat it's much like the second Indiana Jones movie from 1984 after a while we become numb to the excitement and viewing this movie is like riding a roller coaster that simply won't stop even long after the rider has had enough thrills.SPOILERS START HERE  Further ruining the film is the decision by Orci and Kurtzman to unmask John Harrison as Khan the geneticallyengineered superbaddie from the original Trek that the late great Ricardo Montalban elevated to legendary Trek status. By forcibly shoving Khan into the Into Darkness storyline the writers seemed almost desperate to include a familiar face as a crowd pleaser but I found this unmasking about as convincing as a cheesy moment in a daytime soap opera and it is essentially where I gave up on the film about when the third act began.From there the movie worsened for me because soon after we are then supposed to shed tears for our gallant Captain Kirk sacrificing himself in the Enterprise's warp core chamber to save his ship and crew. Orci and Kurtzman try to duplicate the same touching moment from the The Wrath of Khan when Spock dies by practically duplicating some of the dialogue from that 1982 film. They are reminding us that they know their Star Trek but I found this moment to be gimmicky and as such it registered a complete emotional zero.Spock himself as written by Orci and Kurtzman also seems little more than a gimmick in these films now especially at the film's climax which uses our everlogical Vulcan as a John Rambo wannabe as he mercilessly pounds his fists into Khan's face all in the name of revenge for the loss of his pal Jim Kirk. Much of the movie portrays Spock in the same simplistic manner and his pointcounterpoint interaction with the allmore human Kirk has none of the old magic that Shatner and Nimoy once provided so effortlessly.As I said earlier forget the fact that this movie is a horrifying abomination for Star Trek purists. Instead just consider the fact that we have a new franchise one where you check your brain at the door don't concern yourself with characterization and just ignore the words to boldly go where no one has gone before. those words were spoken by Chris Pine at the fadeout and hearing them after watching THIS film was a moment of bitter irony for me I might addI wish J.J. Abrams would stick to the new Star Wars films and leave it at that.".

Abrams and his team of writers have COMPLETELY dismantled the entire Trek universe we once knew  the one that was built so meticulously by Gene Roddenberry and later Harve Bennett and Nick Meyer too  we must now embrace a Trek product that will likely insult and disgust most purists plus any ticket buyer who wants something more than a movie enjoyed by ADHD attention spans.This Into Darkness film continues where the 2009 effort left off and with much the same approach but the decibel level is harder on the eardrums this time more explosions more stunts more fistycuffs more chases both in space and Terra Firma more phaser shots and more temper tantrums from Kirk and Spock both.I could rhetorically say something like WTF? Why is this STAR TREK? WHY!?!?!? and then launch into a heated Trekpurist diatribe attacking the intellectuallychallenged comic booklevel screenplay penned by Orci Kurtzman and Lindelof. But instead let us try to examine the movie as a spacebound ripoff of the Die Hard franchise which obviously are the terms on which the film hopes to succeed.The film's plot presents a saturnine blackovercoated menace named John Harrison played woodenly by Benedict Cumberpatch who starts blowing up buildings in London then shooting at a roomful of Starfleet's top brass during a staff meeting. He then escapes to the Klingon homeworld to hide out and will presumably resume his mysterious rampage against the Federation later.But not if James T. Kirk can help it. Even if it means starting a war with the Klingons our risktaking Captain gets the green light from Admiral Marcus Peter Weller to warp the Enterprise over to Kronos armed with some secret missiles and an undercover mission imperative. As Kirk tells his crew over the intercom Let's go get the son of a bitch.Such a standardized bythenumbers action yarn has succeeded in efforts produced by the Jerry Bruckheimer stable for example or even the second Aliens movie. But here the film feels so overstuffed with chases phaser beams and mortal combat it's much like the second Indiana Jones movie from 1984 after a while we become numb to the excitement and viewing this movie is like riding a roller coaster that simply won't stop even long after the rider has had enough thrills.SPOILERS START HERE  Further ruining the film is the decision by Orci and Kurtzman to unmask John Harrison as Khan the geneticallyengineered superbaddie from the original Trek that the late great Ricardo Montalban elevated to legendary Trek status. By forcibly shoving Khan into the Into Darkness storyline the writers seemed almost desperate to include a familiar face as a crowd pleaser but I found this unmasking about as convincing as a cheesy moment in a daytime soap opera and it is essentially where I gave up on the film about when the third act began.From there the movie worsened for me because soon after we are then supposed to shed tears for our gallant Captain Kirk sacrificing himself in the Enterprise's warp core chamber to save his ship and crew. Orci and Kurtzman try to duplicate the same touching moment from the The Wrath of Khan when Spock dies by practically duplicating some of the dialogue from that 1982 film. They are reminding us that they know their Star Trek but I found this moment to be gimmicky and as such it registered a complete emotional zero.Spock himself as written by Orci and Kurtzman also seems little more than a gimmick in these films now especially at the film's climax which uses our everlogical Vulcan as a John Rambo wannabe as he mercilessly pounds his fists into Khan's face all in the name of revenge for the loss of his pal Jim Kirk. Much of the movie portrays Spock in the same simplistic manner and his pointcounterpoint interaction with the allmore human Kirk has none of the old magic that Shatner and Nimoy once provided so effortlessly.As I said earlier forget the fact that this movie is a horrifying abomination for Star Trek purists. Instead just consider the fact that we have a new franchise one where you check your brain at the door don't concern yourself with characterization and just ignore the words to boldly go where no one has gone before. those words were spoken by Chris Pine at the fadeout and hearing them after watching THIS film was a moment of bitter irony for me I might addI wish J.J. Abrams would stick to the new Star Wars films and leave it at that.";

It showed a future where mankind put its differences aside. We worked together for a common goal. We seek knowledge through exploration and looking back at our own history.

It pisses on what Star Trek 2 was really about The man who never faced death but stared it in the face Only in this one he dies and is brought back to life without a sequel.

Let's not forget the pride of TOS was the fact all 80 episodes were well written.Something Into Darkness isn't. This isn't even good fanfiction. This is an embarrassment. It cost millions to make it will make over billion at the box office.Like I said this is more of a reflection on our society in general and it disturbs me that Star Trek as turned into a mindless 2 hr romp and not a beacon of hope for the future of mankind like the original series did.The only HOPE these JJ Treks bring is the Star Wars movies he'll make will be just as mindless which fits perfectly for Star Wars not for Star Trek.".

As soon as I heard the Khan rumors I was both excited and anxious. Unfortunately I think the anxious side won out.Don't get me wrong. It's a solid action flick and the acting by pretty much everyone is fine and Cumberbatch is amazing. But it's not star trek and it especially is not wrath of khan no matter how much it wants to be. Other reviews have focused on the good so I'm going to focus on the bad as I see it.First in the originals Khan is from central Asia and was played by a Mexican. In this movie Khan is as English as the queen herself. Cumberbatch's excellent performance notwithstanding why is he called Khan Noonien Singh if he's Engilish? The time travel event in the first movie would not have caused a fundamental change in Khan's race accent etc. It's a minor point I know but it really dragged me out of the movie.Second key parts of the plot are uncomfortably repetitive of the original with special effects added for the sake of hyperbole and all of the thoughtfulness of the original removed for simplicity. Though Kirk's journey into maturity is obviously meant to be introspective it couldn't have been less subtle with a sledgehammer particularly at certain key points in the plot. Parts of London and San Francisco are destroyed just to make the effects and reinforce what a bad guy Khan is but the consequences of the horror go unrealized. Khan himself is the mechanism of a really cheesy reincarnation that follows a really cheesy exploitation of the original film.Third although the acting by the crew is fine the dialogue is sophomoric and obvious. McCoy is meant to be the conscience of the crew the thoughtful one holding everyone back from rash decisions. Here Karl Urban is given nothing but shoddy oneliners. Simon Pegg and Anton Yelchin are similarly disused.Abrams thankfully doesn't use as much camera shake as last time but there are still plenty of lens flares fast zooms and weird angles as well as nods to star wars. They're cheap hack and do nothing to advance the story. As a fan of both franchises I hate that they will all soon suffer from these faults. Cut the redundancy and hack cinematography and try to come up with some creative original plots JJ!".

The character that really showed potential was the one played by Cumberbatch because for a couple of minutes I really though his rendition of a famous villain could be so good. I was wrong. He was simply wasted in favor of some brainless action and as a result of yet another plot hole.However the most insulting thing in the whole movie had to be the scene at the end which was simply a recreation of the famous death scene from the original Wrath of Khan yet with reversed roles. It just showed how lacking the whole idea of rebooting Star Trek was because on one side it insists that it was a separate timeline and everything can happen but on the other side it shows that the best it can come up with is a refined idea from the originals.To conclude this short review. My 110 score is not affected by any kind of rant or feeling that I need to rate the movie so low just to counter all the high scores. No. It is my honest opinion deeply influenced by so many flaws and scenes that any honest Trekkie would deem insulting.".

Abrams has done to Star Trek.Already some of you might be sneering Another bashing from someone who knows nothing about Star Trek. I reiterate what I wrote 4 years ago about the previous movie review 347 posted 592009 I was a Star Trek fan since The Original Series was on NBC. I have seen every episode of every TV series including The Animated Series and all 12 movies. I found the previous movie repulsive but hoped that Abrams would deliver a better 2nd act. Instead this movie was even worse.I shall begin by listing the few positives in this movie. Once again Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto gave very good performances. Once again ILM produced very good visual effects.End of positives. Here come the negatives in random order.The dress uniforms were comical. They looked like parodies of Nazi German uniforms. The standard uniforms still looked like cheap knockoffs I would find in a secondrate costume shop.Once again the Enterprise's Bridge looked like a disco. Once again Abrams included irritating shots of glare to make the movie more realistic. Once again Engineering looked like an oil refinery. Once again this Enterprise is a pale shadow of the original NCC1701.Once again we had a very loud and very forgettable soundtrack.Once again we saw Scotty's pintsize companion Keenser  a.k.a. Cabbageface a.k.a. Rockface a.k.a. the Jar Jar Binks of Star Trek.We saw Doctor Carol Marcus but now she's British?? And a weapons specialist?? Now Chekov is not only an Engineer but temporarily the ship's Chief Engineer?? Apparently Paramount is allowing J.J. Abrams to turn the Star Trek universe upsidedown and insideout.When the Enterprise visited Nibiru she was underwater and Spock and eventually Starfleet Command were worried about the Nibirans seeing the ship emerge from the sea. Objection 1 Why was the ship underwater? Couldn't the mission be conducted with the Enterprise in orbit? Objection 2 Considering the water pressure on the ship's hull why didn't we hear any creaking in the hull or see any breaches caused by the pressure? The shields weren't up because Scotty complained about the sea water corroding the hull. Objection 3 How did the ship enter the water without any Nibirans seeing her? Was the Enterprise invisible during descent? Are all the planet's humanoids in that one small village?What I did in the previous paragraph is called Thinking About What I'm Watching. This is what we should do when watching any Star Trek story. But in J.J. Abrams' version of Star Trek we are expected to stop thinking and just watch the loud frantic action.Now we come to Khan Noonien Singh. Abrams has transformed Khan from a Sikh Indian into a Brit. Is Abrams obsessed with Brits? Also Khan's blood can resurrect the dead! So now Khan is like Robert Neville in The Omega Man 1971 or  dare I say it  Jesus Christ. This Is The Cup Of My Blood The Blood Of The New And Everlasting Covenant etc. Obviously Starfleet Medical should extract blood samples from those 73 superhumans so that Starfleet personnel who are killed can be resurrected. Again we are supposed to stop thinking.This movie had two scenes that may be disturbing  even traumatic  to some viewers the explosion in London and the crash of the Vengeance in San Francisco. Many people in the Boston area after 4152013 the New York City area after 9112001 and the London area after 772005 may be appalled by this exploitation of massive tragedies. Abrams might be trying to assuage such objections by dedicating the movie to firstresponders and military personnel after 911. But this still looks like exploitation.I'm not the only veteran Star Trek fan who saw the ripoff of Star Trek II  The Wrath Of Khan and Star Trek III  The Search For Spock. The minor changes Kirk enters the radiationfilled warpcore chamber Spock gets to bellow KHAN!! which was almost comical instead of The Genesis Effect the resurrection agent is Khan's blood. Also Kirk's death gives Spock another excuse to act like a brutal savage what would Sarek say? and Abrams an excuse to stage an absurd highaltitude fight scene.Let's debunk the basic defense of J.J. Abrams i.e. that he saved Star Trek. He has replaced Gene Roddenberry's version with his own version. In the preAbrams chapters of Star Trek we saw intelligent stories with stronglydefined characters. But Abrams has replaced that with movies loaded with loud frantic action but thin on story and logic. Obviously this is appealing to the only movie fans who count teenagers who expect every movie to resemble a 3D video game. I saw the 2D version on the night of May 19 and noticed that the theater was only halffull and devoid of teenagers. Apparently the Target Audience gathered in the 3D theater. We can expect every future Star Trek movie to follow the Abrams Canon virtually nonstop loud 3D action with very little intelligence.Paramount's weak excuse is We still have Star Trek. We still have Saturday Night Live too. But both have become pale shadows of their original selves. Thanks to J.J. Abrams I am no longer a Star Trek fan.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Star Trek universe resplendent in Gene Roddenberry's vision of a future wherein mankind has finally got its act together while its social and economic problems are generally a thing of the past. Not in JJ Abrams' universe however in which a corrupt Starfleet Admiral and a freshly revived genetically engineered 'John Harrison' an alias for a more familiar Star Trek adversary take it upon themselves to create havoc with savage acts of treason and terrorism respectively.With seeming discount made to Roddenberry's unique take of Star Trek evolving around the prevalent Hollywood ethos of filling seats at the local multiplex Abrams' crafts what I would term a popcorn movie with plotholes aplenty. With its target audience seated in place however doubtlessly willing to overlook the obvious whilst simultaneously blinded by the startling visuals and 'tackedon' 3D the film wasn't originally shot in 3D instead the process being added in postproduction this 'casual' viewer can safely check their brain at the door and in all likelihood enjoy...In this befuddled story with its foot stuck firmly in Trek's The Wrath of Khan 1982 Into Darkness hauls its audience onto a seeming rollercoaster ride dragging the viewer from one outrageous action setpiece to another while its central characters are barely given a chance to 'grow' into their respective roles.In a likely nod to Trek VI  The Undiscovered Country Sulu is afforded a brief turn in the captain's chair a role which at least offered the actor some nifty pokerfaced dialogue whilst Chekov is contrastingly tucked away within the pipeworkstrewn bowels of the Enterprise' engine room. Scotty meanwhile refusing to sign for a delivery of conspicuously 'shielded' torpedoes resigns himself into the background with his unusual but interesting little alien friend. This is clearly Kirk's film however while his relationship with Spock and by extension Spock's relationship with Uhura being about the only things explored here. Worst of all however is Karl Urban's Doctor 'Bones' McCoy who is virtually confined to pitching nostalgictinged quips My God man I'm a doctor not a nuclear torpedo technician a character so painfully underused here  particularly given the actor's obvious talent in this role.Evolving around two villains each of whom possessing completely different agendas 'John Harrison' Benedict Cumberbatch and a warmongering Starfleet Admiral Peter Weller the latter of whom taking command of a freshly constructed battleship class vessel named USS VENGEANCE. Despite a promising start however having chased Harrison to his conspicuous Klingon hideout Kirk is somehow 'manipulated' into seeking the terrorist's help an inconceivable decision given the character's explosive introduction  which also ignores the obvious danger he poses. And let's not forget the supposed personal anguish felt by Kirk of which Harrison had been its mastermind. Oh well things disintegrate further when its finally realised just how incredibly stupid Kirk has been trusting a known terrorist whilst the viewer during the film's final reel is woefully pulled along during their frantic reattempts at his capture.With an ending pulled directly out of The Wrath of Khan albeit with Kirk and Spock on opposite sides of the radiation screen doors I was beginning feel as though I had been robbed of my admission the contrived nature of this protracted scene deriving itself virtually wordforword from its thirtyyearold original played out while the audience undoubtedly watched in astonished dj vu. I use the term 'contrived' given that not unlike the liferestoring 'Genesis Planet' seen in Trek's The Search for Spock 1984 the answer to Kirk's mortal dilemma was really only a hypospray away...As a Trek fan I was bitterly disappointed here the filmmakers might well have just reshot Nicholas Meyer's film entirely. Sincerely what an utterly shameful and wasted opportunity all this hokum was.When I emerged from the cinema I was somewhat stunned processing what I had just witnessed onscreen. And after having slept on it I was finally able to articulate the next day. What I had seen wasn't so much Star Trek  a series I so dearly love and consider myself a lifelong fan of  but some cheap albeit very expensive costing well over 120 Million and certainly pale imitation of a film series that deserved far better scripting and storyline than this. These wonderful characters  legendary even  each of whom a household name whilst some having inspired many a fan to seek similar professions in the real world reduced here to mere caricatures' of their namesakes.Overshadowed by the film's ample and certainly showy special effects these characters seemed stunted and confined instead of simply being allowed to develop properly.Such a shame. 3 out of 10".

Last chance to stop.Roger Ebert is looking down from heaven wishing he were still alive so that he could rip Star Trek Into Dumbness to shreds. God bless you Roger. And while you're up there send my sympathies to Gene Roddenberry. It's all gone to Sh Gene.Star Trek Into Dumbness will gross a mountain of money because of its solid special effects and frenetic and constant action that has apparently put many viewers' brains on stun. But make no mistake this high octane Red Bull film is flat out bad.Star Trek The Reboot jumps the shark in the very first sequence here. Spock goes into a volcano the Enterprise is now a submarine... The only way it could have been more abominable is if Jar Jar Binks had shown up. Actually the Enterprise in the water is a symbol  this movie is a turd. A giant stinking floating turd. Very sad.Um note to technical folks Cold Fusion has nothing to do with actual coldness and cannot freeze superhot molten lava. But of course bad science does not a bad film make  a bad script does that.The deftly made first film in the franchise rebirth perfectly handled the origins of multiple characters yet managed to be a rip roaring good time  a feat all in itself. It should have been downhill smooth sailing all the way after that for gents with such talent. But me thinks now our director and screenwriters are spreading themselves a little too thin with too many gigs.The film brings back an old and beloved original series villain and in doing so serves to remind fans how good Wrath of Khan really was.Into Dumbness is a convoluted mess.The characters have completely devolved into caricatures.There are too many jokes by too many characters a misstep which also strips the drama away with misplaced humor. Pity our future if everyone's making jokes when big bad things start to happen.The whole KirkSpock I am your friend stuff just doesn't work because the filmmakers have not built the friendship in a meaningful way between these two in the 120 minutes that precede it.There is in fact no relationship building for any of these characters unless you consider the insufferable Spock and Uhura teen romance squabbles an example of relationship building. Plot and character have been sacrificed for action with expository speeches in the final act used in an attempt to patch all the holes and beg viewers for forgiveness if they were still paying attention.I still can't figure out the narrative. Something about explosions I think. Oh the Klingons were in the film too pretty early on but they were forgotten along the way. We're at war with them now  or so we are TOLD I think. Can't really remember I may have have gotten an early jump on my 2013 tax returns by that point in the screening.Nice to see RoboCop getting work though even if it was a onenote role far beneath his talents.Thank the Great God of Cinema that J.J. is just directing the next Star Wars movie and that the reins of that franchise are in other hands. There still may be hope.".

The whole third act kind of felt like a slap to the face to Trek fans I'm no die hard Trekkie but I enjoy the films and every throw back to Khan felt forced and melodramatic. The fact that Quinto's Spock can call Nimoy's Spock out of the blue is cheap and out of place and the whole radiation chamber scene while clever for reversing the roles is boring and predictable. But if you haven't seen Wrath of Khan then this will be quite a shock for a few minutes at the least.Overall I wish that the Kilngons had been given a larger role as they were quite awesome and I have the feeling they will be the main antagonist in the third film in 20wheneveritgetsmade. The many bad things in this film outweighed the few good bits.".

Technically Trek never looked better.The enterprise family from the old days Shatner Nimoy etc. worked together very well dialog was top notch gags well placed and the motivations clear. No wonder they worked the characters out in the series before and they could build on that. In the new films they haven't formed that family yet hell they had just one film but the director is expecting from the viewer to believe they have already formed a bond. Why in gods sake? This doesn't work especially when Kirk saves Spock at the beginning. You know why I had to save you......No...why? Looking at the first film I think he could have saved the enterprise or the planet people better over just one crew member. Then when Kirk saves the Enterprise and Spock is getting very emotional about it I asked myself why. I haven't seen a buddy play before and didn't get the impression that the two characters are friends and hang around share private thoughts or any other stuff that the old crew did. Technically they just have met and did go through the first film hitting on each other. The saving scene was therefore totally out of context for me and spoiled the whole experience into the illogical and disbelieve. Yes I would go as far as saying that this scene was crap. They could have solved this very easily by not showing that scene and letting the enterprise crash on earth but not letting everybody die because of some dampers that spring on in the last moment. When they are saved they are told that the ship Khan was at helm somehow vanished making this a possible but not immediate future story. Looking at it now it lacks a lot of character development and the film consists mostly of effects and big bangs lots and lots and lots of running around and big again big explosions hitting people and yes big bangs. Hopefully they fix this in future films. If not New Star Trek stopped at the first new film for me.".

I can't believe how people voted this movie 8.9 There are lots of historical and scientific inaccuracies acting is terrible really terrible and visual effects are worse than acting. I can not even decide what kind of movie is this ? Romance? Drama? SciFi? Action? or anime ? Yes it is possible there are lots of bad movies around the world. But this one is overrated and on the other hand lots of money has spent on it.There are some scenes that i was ashamed like those socalled romance scenes.I decided to quit watching so many times.They could have made a great documentary without wasting such huge amounts of money.".

I don't like commenting on movies generally because it's relative you like or you hate i have no right to comment. Another thing that needs to be considered i'm from Turkey. Finally i'm not racist.Why i write this comment even if i say likingdisliking a movie is relative ? Because of highrated comments. I can't believe how people voted this movie 8.9 There are lots of historical and scientific inaccuracies acting is terrible really terrible and visual effects are worse than acting. I can not even decide what kind of movie is this ? Romance? Drama? SciFi? Action? or anime ? Yes it is possible there are lots of bad movies around the world. But this one is overrated and on the other hand lots of money has spent on it.There are some scenes that i was ashamed like those socalled romance scenes.I decided to quit watching so many times.They could have made a great documentary without wasting such huge amounts of money.";

	schema:reviewBody "17 million dollar budget may be the highest number in Turkish film making industry but this does NOT make it sufficient or even close to sufficient for a film like Fetih. Acting is less then amateur cause they don't have enough payment to hire real actors. Ships and language do Not suit ottoman era. There are enormous historical mistakes even conflicts. Make you wonder whether the director consulted some or any historians. Sword fighting scenes are unbearable. Ulubatl Hasan has nothing to do with being an ottoman nor a turk. Director tries to make a replica of Aragorn which he fails desperately. Because even if he did it successfully it would again has no value as Ulubatl Hasan was an ottoman and Aragorn a fiction hero. His way of fighting does NOT resemble Turkish techniques he is just moving like a disgustingly cheap samurai with cheaper aragorn hair and beard cut. This director has no clue about the character even about the character's outfit. He could have at least looked into any history book and get a clue. The worst scene was the illegal sex scene which has no way to happen in Hasan's life.Visual effects are worse then that are in power rangers especially the scene where the ship sinks. t was SO bad that it was the scene i left the theatre. And ships in this movie are not the ships Sultan Mehmet had transported through land which was considered impossible at the time. This transportation of battle ships across the landscape S one of the hardest decisions made by a leader if not the only one in the history of mankind. And the effect of this decision on the people or on the historians of that time is totally ignored in this movie. Sultan Mehmet the Conquerer the wise the loyal who has great piety is just an arrogant kid in this movie. The charismatic scholar of Islam great hodja Akemseddin his name means the sun of religion is again totally ignored.The scene where two kings meet on horse backs DD NOT happen in the siege it's from Ridley Scott's K.O.H. Enough writing about this film it doesn't worth to write about. Director has just edited scenes from foreign films so he is not a real director he is a fake editor.  gave it 1 out of 10 because there's no scoring system below zero in MDB.".

	schema:headline " The Fall of Constantinople...and the Fall of Truth";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie tells the story of the Life of Mehmed II...the Fall of Constantinople...well you don't have to be a historian to realize the unprecedented distortion of History. I watched this movie with the best intentions i wanted to like it since this was the first time that such a historical event as the Fall of Constantinople was depicted in the big screen. However at the end of the film the general feeling was lukewarm. I would like to judge this movie both as a piece of art and as a piece of history telling.. Production was good. There was a good effort in depicting Constantinople with special effects and credit should be given to the ones responsible for this. The bird's view shots of the city were impressive Hagia Sophia Hippodrome Palaces the Gates..all can be easily compared to shots of Rome in Gladiator or the shots of Babylon in Alexander. However there were some problematic green background shots where the special effects were poor and fakeness was obvious especially in shots were actors were implemented. The script was average not too complicated kept really simple..but faithful to the Ottomans' point of view..and the direction..well it was average to bad with awkward imbalances and gaps. This in combination with some bad acting made things worse especially for the first half of the movie. Another issue I would like to note is the absolute miscast for the film. The actors chosen to portray certain characters were purposely selected. Someone could easily see the good and noble Mehmed II and the ruthless almost satanic face of Emperor Constantine XI Palaiologos. The second half of the film was more enjoyable for me. The battles were OK and as i have already mentioned it was nice to see at last in a movie the Siege of Constantinople as Hollywood insists on depicting only the Crusades in Jerusalem the Battles of Joan of Arc and the skirmishes of Robin Hood. However I can't help it but judge the movie here as far as the history depiction is concerned...and this depiction could not be more inaccurate... Of course from the Ottoman point of view there were so many Turkish heroes that distinguished either with their actions of heroism or their death. But why this story telling is kept one sided? Why is it kept secret that the city had only 7000 soldiers defending it? Why is it kept secret that the Ottomans entered the city from a small unguarded gate? Why is it kept secret that Giustiniani was wounded by a cannonball? Why by the way is he depicted as evil? And why we hear nothing about the Emperor's last stand in the battle? This is what annoyed me the most...Constantine Palaiologos was fighting alongside his troops. After realizing that the city is doomed he tore his imperial suite and no one could distinguish him from the rest of the soldiers. He died fighting defending his city his people and his faith...he was depicted throughout the movie but his last stand was somehow suddenly forgot by the filmmakers...and last but not least..without any intention to criticize the Turks but with all due respect the last scene of the film was rather funny..it is recorded in History what happened after the capture of the city how many were enslaved and tortured..Mehmed II did indeed offer freedom to Christians but there is no word in the film about the impaled and tortured Christians or the fact that the Emperor's head was put in the Hippodrome.. Generally my rating is 610 for the effort and some quite good fight scenes.".

	schema:headline " Historically inaccurate but more importantly bad as a movie";
	schema:reviewBody "I will not go into how the movie is historically accurate it's simply inaccurate how it favors Turks and hides their devils though one should think how could balkan nations manage to preserve their religion language and culture under Ottoman ruling for 24 centuries while all British and French colonies lost all in a century before commenting on this topic how Vatican was portraited as selfish I haven't heard anything about their conditioned support until this movie.My main disappointment is the movie itself. Though its budget is quite high for any Turkish movie it's not on par with Hollywood productions. So I didn't expect Hollywood quality special effects and I'm not disappointed in this regard. They are cheap though not cheapest compared to Hollywood. But I think that's all can be done within its budget. So it doesn't bother me.My concerns are about things that has nothing to do with the budget. I don't know if it's due to script or directing but storytelling is awful. The story jumps from here to there and back so suddenly. It's like watching sketches joined as a movie. Also I don't understand why Arabic people talk in Arabic but Byzantians and Italians talk in Turkish.And there is no character development. Why Giovanni Giustiniani is bad? He behaved kindly to Era. We haven't seen him acting badly to his men. And bam he became evil. When I think objectively I see a thoughtful man who is doing his job very good just how a respected commander should be. So they should fight as respectful rivals at the end. If the director wanted us to hate him then he should have portraited him as an evil. And why Era developed a sudden feeling of revenge? As an adopted Muslim she spent all her life with Christians except her childhood and she hasn't shown any dislike to the community she's been in. She's just like an happy Christian. Also the foreseen one Mehmet The Conqueror is portraited as a man obsessed with taking Istanbul. He should have been a wise and intelligent commander. But when everything goes bad he begins to shout and insult his men. This is the behaviour we see from cruel kings in Hollywood productions. It's not the behaviour the hero should have. He should not lose his temper he should have been patient Look at Saladdin in Kingdom of Heaven while his attacks become ineffective. And his motive should not simply be based on Hz. Mohammed's word. There should be other reasons for example ongoing threat to Ottomans etc for the need to take Istanbul and the prophet's word should have been shown just before the end credits.There are many illogical things scriptwise. One of them is Ottoman tunnel diggers has been digging tunnels for 2 days and they are still outside the citywalls. But when Byzantines become aware of them they also dig tunnels but they reach them which is outside the city walls in almost ten minutes? Byzantine soldiers digging faster than digging specialists?For cinematography I won't say anything. It's just not good.Overall it's a miss. It has the potential but not because of limited budget but bad script and directing the movie wasted his chance.PS Some will say Do not overcriticize your country's work. But as I said I have nothing to say against technical aspects it's one of the best when considered within its budget but scripting and directing has nothing to do with budget and these are the ones that make this movie bad. Nothing else.".

Further Saladin did not grant every Christian save contact to Christian land. Only those who could pay for it. The rest was enslaved as it is usually done with dhimmis and kaffir. He was no benevolent soul either.Now about this movie here it's even more amusing. In what lies the bravery of besieging a city with 130000 Ottoman fighters....against only 7000 Christian city guards and knights?It is also very interesting that this movie does not show what the Ottomans did to Christian settlements and villages which they encountered on their way to Constantinople. Exaclty the same they did with those settlements in Hungary Austria Romania etc...I guess. Which is plundering enslaving of women and children while beheading the male inhabitants. But this is what does not fit into the concept of Islam where the Muslim is always free of guilt.I guess that the majority of those who rated this movie are Turks because the West is not really interested in this movie. And if more western people who have an idea of what really happened back in these days would vote this rating would immediately fall. The choreography and acting is nothing to write home about but still better than in most Turkish productions so far. This and the nice animated and filmed landscapes and OK scenery prevented me from rating this movie with 1.A final word to both Ridley Scott and especially Farun Aksoy. SelfCritizism and Reflection is nothing which should only lie on one side in this case western society. Especially the Turks could use a lot of it.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie arguably has the best cinematic concept and special effects in Turkish cinema. Because Turkish cinema has no experience in historical or action movies it would be wrong to expect a Hollywood quality production. Still it has better combat scenes than I expected. While these properties can be overlooked I am very disappointed how the movie turned out. I will be listing these in the order of importance1.The movie doesn't reflect or promote the Ottoman Empire and culture the way it should. If I watched this movie in another language I would have thought this is just another European kingdom. Only 10 percent of the movie has Ottoman Culture praying war camps janissaries2.Music.. Seriously it couldn't be worse.. There are dozens of awesome Ottoman marches. How come they are not included? is not enough HOW DARE THEY NOT INCLUDE THESE MARCHES???3.The scenario is really bad. Scenario is what people look at this type of movies and the execution of the events is just facepalm level bad. Even though I know the whole story I had a hard time understanding where we are what time is it who are these people what are these people doing here? They payed to much attention to the cannon but no attention to the ships being pulled to Hali which was clearly the main reason the siege succeeded. They should have at least made a 1 minute scene where Mehmed was offering this brilliant idea. The movie is probably really confusing to people who have no knowledge about the history of this battle. This battle changed the era of world and we should have been given more info about why Istanbul is so important why Mehmed wants it so bad. In the movie it just seems like a purposeless childish desire.4.Giovanni vs Hasan. The fighting scenes are great yeah but why do they look like twins? Why do they look like some random bandits wandering around the battlefield? They are the commanders and best warriors in the battlefield! Surely they should wear an armor and a uniform instead of running around in combat with bare arms like Hercules. Mehmed should have been the main hero in the story not Hasan..5.The Mehmed we should see in the movie is around 1722 age. However the actor Devrim Evin is 30 years old and looks 35! They should have picked a charismatic and younger actor. Btw he is the Sultan he should have the best outfit in the empire but even his viziers have better outfits.6.Troops are not promoted properly. Janissaries? They are not shown as much as they should. And where are their guns? Handheld rifles probably haven't been invented yet but I am pretty sure they had rifles that had to be set to ground before firing. 7.Where is DelilerCrazy Unit? They are known for being the first troops in battle and using Ottoman slapping technique that can knock out enemy knights and horses in armor when the enemy sees Deliler in front lines they feel depressed cause those dudes kill people by only slapping! How can this awesome stuff not be included in a movie?8.The leader of 2 sides just don't meet and chat in the middle of the battlefield before war starts. They will be assassinated at first sight.Yeah they did the battle effects and action parts but they messed up all the other parts big time! How can you have a budget this size and fail this much? The stuff I listed aren't that hard to include in a movie. They just had to think of it instead of making useless action scenes. We aren't here to watch the 1v1 battle of heroes or awesome arrow shower etc.. We are here for the history for the logic for the heroic and brilliant moments which weren't even thought of by the producers..I am sorry but 12 year old kids and illiterate people may find this movie great but in reality this actually had a great potential but is totally failed the great opportunity..In my opinion the TV series about Sultan Suleyman The Magnificent Century is better in all the aspects except action and special effects. Yeah it has some lame love scenes but the overall environment is simply better.".

	schema:headline " History without depth  filmwork without honesty but pretty nevertheless";
	schema:reviewBody "The movie is supposed to tell the story of how Mehmet II conquered Constantinople. So far so good it could be a good story given the right conditions.However it ends up being a whole lot of bad. Except for most parts of the visual aspects of the movie which look great to the human eye.Now from the start we are introduced to Mehmet and how it's his destiny to conquer Constantinople. Good but why is he portrayed as a man with no flaws? Clearly he was a great and inspiring man when he lived but he was just as human as all others of the species who have lived. Bring some depth to the characters when writing your script please. I shed a tear when I saw the death scene with his father almost at the start of the movie but no other psychological elements where ever expanded upon.The worst part of the movie is not the portrayal of the conquest itself no it's the buildup to that. There's just too many inaccuracies. Sure if you watch this movie purely from a proTurkish point of view those details might not matter but no matter how you put it you are being deceitful to your viewers about the other sides.1 There exists two languages in this movie Turkish and Arabic.2 There exists a standardized uniform for European Crusaders 11th century mail tabards Latin Auxiliaries Clunky oversized immobilizing chainmail or clothlike leather Byzantine Soldiers Grey scale armour and the Turkish army Red vests with all with the same fluted Ottoman helmet. Of course these things are historically based and fit in some kind of time period but variation is important too. To add to this the two lieutenants of the movie are again wearing some sort of fantasy leather armour no one with money at the time would have worn. Where's the plate armour for the Genoese? 3 There exists three ways of meleecombat 1 Slowly move around and wait to die All others but the Turks. 2 Thrust and slash hard with your weapon to kill your opponent or die trying the Turks. 3 Onehit kill people with agile and fast movement supporting charactersheroes.4 Apparently no sack had ever happened in 1204 and Constantinople still stood as the towering beacon of Antiquity and Medievality combined looking better than ever imagined. I know this is computer graphics but again this is dishonesty.5 The Greeks who thought it wise to speak Turkish of course are naive gluttons who think they can puppeteer with the superpower of their time. In fact at this point they were nothing more than a vassal state who where sitting and hoping for a rescue or having already given up hope most people having already emigrated to start the renaissance. This political reality could of course be less melodramatic to portray but again why not give the characters some depths? This brings me to my next point.6 Constantine XI is portrayed as a raving madman who is spoiled and possesses no diplomatic skills whatsoever. It's bad enough that his beard is so clearly fake and that he speaks in Turkish and seems oblivious to the events around him He also has to be the evil guy who hates the Turks. Kudos to whoever did the costume design but his character is nothing more than a caricature and while that could have it's place in a comedy it shouldn't have any place in a serious historical war movie. I won't go into detail with his courtiers as they are even bigger stereotypes and imbeciles than he is betrayed to be but with this kind of blackwhite relationship it's clear just how biased this film is.7 No conqueror is all kind and loving. Mehmet's outward appearance holds only the authority the script writers gave him there's nothing natural about it. Kingdom of Heaven had a similar setup but there was at least a few character developments between Saladin and de Ibelin. As said here this is just the case of Allloving energetic smiling conqueror who loves women and children vs.Megalomaniac miniatureEmperor with a Napoleoncomplex who holds the world record in cynicism and failed attempts of political spinWhere is the Devirme recruitment system and the Kapikulu? Where is the Jizya tax? Of course these things never happened as we all know.8 Where is the awesome Ottoman military music? Also the lack of any Greek in this movie prevents it from having any Byzantine Chant.9 The Women in this movie act just as terribly as the men or as the script decreed quite possibly. Also thumbs down for no real Harem of course .My recommendation Watch Tirante El Blanco if you want more on the demise of the defunct Byzantine Empire. As for a movie finally worthy of the great statesman Mehmet II I guess we'll all just have to wait.As for the movie 410 for visual effects the construction of Rumelihisar the awesome Ottoman turbans the first charge and the entrance to the city where Mehmet is truthful to the quasihistorical picture. The rest is bad.".

	schema:reviewBody "I started watching this movie last night and only watched the first hour. As far as I've seen the actors do not fit the historical characters mostly. The main character Fatih Sultan Mehmet gives a feeling of a weak man determined to destroy the Byzantium empire. He is reflected as a sick minded obsessive person with no human feelings. If you can recall the Turkish TV series Sultan Murad the 4th with Cihan Unal starring as the sultan  compared to him  Sultan Mehmed character is a weakling. I think that is an insult to the actual person who is considered as one of the most heroic sultans in the Ottoman lineage. Most of the other characters also seem like they can't reflect the persona of a 15th century historical figure. They play their parts as if they are in a contemporary movie. It seems to me that the producers didn't employ serious historical consultants in the making but they just made up stuff as they wished. If you compare the characters in this movie to a real good historical movie such as mission with Robert de Niro you can see what I mean.I think the reason behind the bad casting is in the politics in Turkey. The financiers were probably from one conservative group the production crew an the cast were from modernists and as a result they didn't cast some of the actors in Turkey who would fit to some of the roles perfectly because they were affiliated with other groups. It's a pity that political wars in Turkey weakens everything from economy to film industry.Other than these this movie deserves praise for some good action scenes computer generated graphics and visual effects costumes and set designs.".

It is an entertainment at grand level. Two actors who really stood out r the hunky Ibrahim Celikkol n Dilek Serbest. Director Faruk Aksoy divides his nearly threehour movie among battle sequences the love story and the various strategy n drama. The cinematography is awesome. Every item of clothing and weaponry has been meticulously researched and handcrafted. The camera shots are rich and engrossing.

	schema:headline " Good film but with big historic mistakes";
	schema:reviewBody "It is absolutely clear that the conquest of Constantinople was a great victory for the Ottamans who finished what the crusaders started in 1204. BUT. We must respect history and the director of the film did non respect history at all. During the siege Constantinople had nothing to do with the glorious city of the past. Only 40.000 of once 1.000.000 people lived inside the walls which were defended only by 7.000 soldiers. 2.000 of them were foreigners. The Ottomans had an army of about minimum 100.000 soldiers. Some say that the army had 200.000 or more soldiers. The Byzantine empire was found at that time at the lowest level of her past glory and in the absolute decline. It is know to everybody who knows only a few things about history that the Ottomans entered the city though an unguarded small gate known as Kerkoporta which has been left open by mistake. This gives a picture of history as it really happened and nobody can argue about that.Because it is history! The Byzantine empire had come to an end as it happens in all the empires in history. There is no place here to talk about more historic facts. I understand that the film maker wanted to give to Mohamed the part of the glory that he deserves. But the end of the film it is absolutely ridiculous and was made only for propaganda reasons. People who study history knows very well what happened at that days when a city was conquered. Massacres. That happened in Constantinople as well. The director the only thing that he does not tell us is that Mohamed gave candies to children! The conquest is without doubt a great achievement of the Ottomans. It helped them built their empire. The dominated east for about 500 years. But without of course knowing Mohamed gave west a great gift as after the fall of the city all the great men escaped to the west and they helped Renaissance to begin. The film is not bad at all and in my opinion is by far better than Hollywood films of that kind. The Turks are making a great effort to raise their country and are to be praised for this.Since i visited Constantinople a few times i can say that progress is visible in Turkey. Hope that in the future they will make again films like this and even better. But please respect history. History can not change because some people want to do propaganda thank you".

Some say that the army had 200.000 or more soldiers. The Byzantine empire was found at that time at the lowest level of her past glory and in the absolute decline. It is know to everybody who knows only a few things about history that the Ottomans entered the city though an unguarded small gate known as Kerkoporta which has been left open by mistake. This gives a picture of history as it really happened and nobody can argue about that.Because it is history! The Byzantine empire had come to an end as it happens in all the empires in history. There is no place here to talk about more historic facts. I understand that the film maker wanted to give to Mohamed the part of the glory that he deserves. But the end of the film it is absolutely ridiculous and was made only for propaganda reasons. People who study history knows very well what happened at that days when a city was conquered. Massacres. That happened in Constantinople as well. The director the only thing that he does not tell us is that Mohamed gave candies to children! The conquest is without doubt a great achievement of the Ottomans. It helped them built their empire. The dominated east for about 500 years. But without of course knowing Mohamed gave west a great gift as after the fall of the city all the great men escaped to the west and they helped Renaissance to begin. The film is not bad at all and in my opinion is by far better than Hollywood films of that kind. The Turks are making a great effort to raise their country and are to be praised for this.Since i visited Constantinople a few times i can say that progress is visible in Turkey. Hope that in the future they will make again films like this and even better. But please respect history. History can not change because some people want to do propaganda thank you";

	schema:reviewBody "Here a few facts that can be learned from the movieThe Fall of Constantinople was predicted and even ordered by the prophet Mohamed himself some 1000 years before it happened!After desperate failures to conquer the city it's the dream of some holy man that made the last battle successful.The first suicide bombing with happened there. Committed by athlete heroes while shouting Allah Akbar.The Mehmed II himself and his army are all glorious heroes while the defenders are ugly cowards.The words Allah Akbar can inspire anyone anywhere and for doing absolutely anything.The good thing about this movie is that it encourages to learn from other sources about the Fall of Constantinople. Here is what I've learned from wikipedia Thousands of civilians executed or enslaved during and after this battle.Impalement was one of the favorite types of killing prisoners by the Ottomans.The army defending Constantinople was about 7000 men 2000 of whom were foreigners.At the onset of the siege probably 50000 people were living within the walls.The Ottomans' army totalled about 100000 menThey built a huge cannon that weighted 32 tons and required 700 men to operate. Although ridiculous it actually worked and probably was the thing that made this siege successful not the prediction of their prophet or a dream of a true believer.Personally I don't care much about who wins in religious wars and this movie insists it was such and I don't care to whom the Constantinople belongs. But I wonder how people in 21st century can make such propaganda and how others can like it.The authors didn't forget to put an awfully sentimental love story in this film. Is this what what made this film international?Update after watching the last 20 minutes of the movie.The survived civilians were very happy to meet their conqueror Mehmed II in the city. They smile and admire the great Sultan. To leverage the effect the last minute of the film shows a beautiful little girl playing with his fake beard in a grotesque North Korea style. This scene is supposed to make your eyes wet.The Byzantine Emperor died while fighting among the soldiers but the film tells nothing about the circumstances of his death. However it tells that the Sultan generously allows to bury the Emperor according to local traditions. Well this is almost true 93 truth. Because only the body was buried. The head of the Emperor was placed separately in a public place probably the local hippodrome.".

Although it is not perfect in terms of the script and the digital effects we must admit that the effort is worthy of commendation. It is a significant step for the Turkish film industry with its 17M budget and more importantly its bravery to make the movie of the conquest of Istanbul a great historical event that is divine for not only the Turks but also the entire Muslim world. Of course we need to criticize but the critics should be as supportive as possible in order not to discourage people. By the way even though it is a 17M budget movie it is not fair to compare this movie with Hollywood productions since the budgets of similar Hollywood productions are more than 100M. For all these reasons it is a great production definitely worth to watch and everyone should be supportive about it to make the Turkish film industry better.".

	schema:reviewBody "We didn't need dialogs we had faces said the narcissistic Norma Desmond Gloria Swanson in Billy Wilder' Sunset Boulevard referring to the Silent Era when she used to be big  before the 'pictures got small'.The reason of this introduction is that after watching Michel Hazanavicius' critically acclaimed The Artist I strongly felt this was the perfect illustration to Norma Desmond's iconic eulogy. From beginning to end my eyes never ceased to be amazed by the communicative smile of Jean Dujardin as George Valentin the aging silent movie star and the sparkling eyes of Berenice Bejo as Peppy Miller the young and flamboyant starlet. Their faces occupy the screen with such an electrifying magnetism that they don't just steal the scenes they steal the dialogs  literally.I was awestruck by Dujardin's performance. To those who didn't grew up with French TV programs he's one of the most popular and talented comedians of his generation. Dujardin created the character of Brice de Nice a blonde surfer whose specialty was to 'diss people' but it was so funny it never sounded meanspirited. He was a member of a cult comictroop who made sketches  la SNL but even back then he had a little something that made him special a voice a smile a charisma in both TV and movies in both dramatic and comedic register. There was no doubt in France that the guy who was famous for his impressions of Robert De Niro and the camel and even De Niro doing the camel was promised to a brilliant career.Look closely at Jean Dujardin's face it's like drawn with 'classic' features the finely traced mustache who builds a Fairbankslike charisma like the strength from Samson's hair the dazzling smile making him look like the lost son of Gene Kelly and a certain macho toughness reminding of a young Sean Connery. Dujardin's face is a gift from cinematic Gods and The Artist finally lets it glide earning him the Cannes Festival Award for Best Actor. I sincerely believe he deserves an Oscar nomination because he just doesn't play an actor from the Silent Era he embodies the Era with the same level of demented craziness as Norma Desmond in a brighter and more lighthearted side.Valentin's selfabsorption echoes Desmond's cynical ego while his gaudy 'Don Lockwood' mask Gene Kelly in Singin' in the Rain hides the more poignant face of his insecurity. He's the star of the screen because only the screen allows him to express his unique talent. While Lockwood had to adapt to the 'talking' revolution George Valentin makes a conservative U Turn starting an inexorable descent into madness from an outcast to a hasbeen until being finally alienated by his own talkiephobia. The direction is so clever that it challenges many times our perceptions creating unexpected feelings of discomfort when real sounds are heard. But I was surprised to see how much it worked on a dramatic level.And this is the strength of the film although I expect it to discomfort some viewers it isn't a tribute in the literary meaning of the word. It has its moments where it tricks us into the use of sounds or dialogs but never fails to distract us from the core of the story the romance. Very quickly we forget about spotting the hints the references to silent classics chase scenes overthetop comical gesticulations slapstick jokes etc. This mindset would disappoint those who expected a film with the same material as Mel Brook's Silent Movie which was clearly a tribute. The Artist IS a silent movie featuring a beautiful romance between George and Peppy who got her break with an idea from George something that would make her different from the other actresses a beauty spot above the upper lip. A clever creditbilling montage depicts her consequent ascension to stardom until she finally dethrones George and makes a hasbeen out of him.If I mentioned the performance of Dujardin Berenice Bejo also deserves some accolades because she succeeded in looking so old from our POV yet so fresh and modern in the film with the appealing feelgood and optimistic attitude she constantly brings on screen. With her dollface and youngish smile she's like a cute little girl enjoying what she does. In a way Peppy Miller embodies the film's most inspirational element a positive message about passion and enjoyment. And this indirectly highlights George's source of troubles being deprived from what he enjoyed the most and suffering from his progressive fading into oblivion. Along with this conflict the evolution of George and Peppy's romance never feels forced quite an accomplishment when we consider how slightly overthetop silent movie stars used to act.Both Dujardin and Bejo are indeed powerful in an Oscarworthy level and at that moment I can't continue without mentioning the third character of the film George's dog. The relationship between George and the dog provides a sort of Chaplinesque feel to the movie a mix of tenderness and poignancy so natural and convincing I wonder if the Academy will think of a honorary Oscar. Anyway I applaud Hazanivicius for not having reduced The Artist to a flashy spectacle with no substance with the word 'homage' as the director's convenient alibi and make a touching romance about two people who met each other at a pivotal time in the history of filmmaking each representing a side of cinema the oldschool silent generation Chaplin Keaton Pickford and the exuberant talkers Grant Hepburn Davis  And I'm glad he found the true note to reconcile between these two universes at the end  didn't I tell you Dujardin was the lost son of Gene Kelly?The Artist plays like a missing link between Singin' in the Rain and Sunset Boulevard and it's indeed one of the best films of 2011 with the absence of words as an endearing 'beauty spot'.".

The acting is superb the chemistry between all of the actors is sizzling the comedy is absolutely hilarious the storyline grips you and never lets go the music is superb and you feel emotionally connected with the characters and story.If you check my previous reviews you will see that I am most often moved to write a review when a film was really bad but this film caught me completely off guard and I just had to express my overwhelming satisfaction with this filmmaking experience.I can't imagine how difficult it must have been to try and finance a period film with two stars who were not well known outside of their own country. I am just overjoyed that it all came together. This is how film should make you feel when you leave the theater  entertained! To the entire production team  BRAVO!!";

The filmmakers really make great use of the medium and even though there are no voices or color my interest was never lost.Jean Dujardin gives a great performance. You like him instantly and without giving too much away you want him to succeed. This movie is really chock full of great actors and actresses.

Many of the actors in Hollywood were new immigrants and dialogue coaches had not been invented yet so when silents became talkies many previously successful film careers were over. The European accents didn't translate so well. The Artist asks the question  how does one make that transition from silent to talkie? And then proceeds to answer using the silentblack and white techniques of those first pictures...absolutely brilliantly !! This afternoon I drove 2 12 hours each way to see The Artist at the Montreal World Film Festival. Being a fan of the silent film genre I was watching for nods to those first stars of the silver screen.

One can safely say now that this little experiment has paid off but to push forward such an idea and to execute it to the way it had turned out requires a lot of conviction. George Valentin Jean Dujardin is a silent movie superstar who is on top of the Hollywood tree with his huge fan following and never ending boxoffice success. His world comes tumbling down with the dawn of the talkies which he doesn't take too seriously. His find Peppy Miller Brnice Bejo is a new star overnight and the stock market crash doesn't help his cause either. While his life descends into depression and loss his pride blinds the love shown by Peppy Miller who is now the hottest property in Hollywood. Can he come out of his shell? Can Peppy Miller express her love? Can they have a future together? Jean Dujardin and Brnice Bejo are two extremely charismatic and talented actors who can switch gears so effortlessly from little subtle expressions to overthetop requirements of the era. The attention to detail starting from sets to the type of film used to get the right look is done with precision. The same story has been told in many different backdrops before but the format presented here is quite fresh. Another challenging aspect that is overcome with excellence is the screenplay as the writers mare not used to tell a story in this format. Best moments to look out for 1. Introduction of Peppy Miller and when she romances George Valentin's suit. 2. George Valentin's realization of Sound as the future in his dream. 3. The way Peppy Miller blackmails the producer. 4. Expression of Peppy Miller when she races to George Valentin's house before climax. 4. Climax duet dance. This silent movie is a twist to the technology heavy era but how well they executed this defines the success it has achieved. This movie is one that should not be missed.".

I shall be very surprised if it wins any major awards.

The musical score is completely wrong as it sounds to me a couple of decades later than the period of the film. There is too much lip movement and there are too few titles silent movie lovers will know that by the end of the silent era titles were used sparingly and the unheard dialogue was short and to the point. Add to this the fact that the lead characters were not particularly likable and the film was too long. I was expecting a tribute to the art form I love and ended up watching a spoof!

I mean they filmmakers did a fairly good job of recreating a silent film but they didn't take it any further than that. The plot acting etc was no better or worse than a real silent film. I've seen many much much better silent films on TCM's Silent Sundays each weekend. Those who are gushing over this movie have apparently not seen very many real silent films from the 20s. If they had I think they'd have found this film kind of a been there seen that kind of experience as I did. Or maybe this ArtistPraiseHysteria is mostly the result of folks desperately wanting to jump onto the bandwagon of the newest cool thing.The thing that bothered me most besides the stretches of tedium was that the cinematography was distractingly flat and graythere were no real blacks and no real whites. I understand from articles I've read that this lowcontrast glowy BW was intentional. But I didn't like it. Just looked like it was poorly shot with a bad video camera with the contrast turned all the way down. this wasn't helped by the fact that the theatre I saw it in now presents all their films via digital projectiona process that in my opinion has NOT been perfected yet and is still too low res for cinema.All in all The Artist should be nothing more than a minor vaguely interesting experiment that would have had a better home on video. How it has become an indie sensation with Oscar nominations is a totally mysterious to me. Wonder how much money it took to convince us all that is was a masterpiece?".

Characters such as our hero's wife are more cardboard than real.

What is the conveyed message? That silent films are still enjoyable? Or what...? I simply do not see any greatness in this film only much pretentiousness.";

The plot was rather thin for the most part and parts of it seemed a bit overwrought. I had no particular problems with the acting at least not with the lead parts but there wasn't a whole lot of interest to the characters because their roles were so onedimensional.

	schema:reviewBody "The Artist is a wellmade if not particularly involving homage to the silent films of the 1920s. The film itself looks beautiful and makes interesting use of its lack of sound. However the story lacks interest and is as clichd as the silent films it pays tribute to.The artist of the title is George Valentin a silent film star caught in a loveless marriage to a petulant starlet. He gives a jump start to the career of actress Peppy Miller after kissing her at a premiere. However he soon finds his stardom dwarfed by hers after the debut of talkies and losing his fortune in the stock market collapse.The film is at its best when it plays with the whole concept of silent movies. The most impressive example is a dream sequence conveying the transition from silent to sound movies. Valentin dreams that his word previously filled with a silent movie soundtrack now consumed by overly loud background sounds. This may be the first time in cinematic history in which a dog's bark has conveyed the shift of an entire world.Unfortunately the film also suffers from one of the major flaws of silent films in general. Because of the lack of dialogue The Artist ultimately has a simplistic story with largely one dimensional characters. To a large extent the plot mimics that of A Star Is Born focusing on a famous performer ultimately surpassed by his protg. As a result the film is boring and predictable.Furthermore the film emulates the least interesting of the silent movies. Rather than focusing on the more experimental films that characterized the early years of silent movies such as The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and D. W. Griffith's work it looks at the making of genre films. Given that The Artist by its very nature is aimed at film buffs with an extensive set of references one would think they would give attention to more interesting films.Still the film's cast does a lot particularly given the lack of dialogue. Penelope Ann Miller gives Valentin's harpy wife as much dimension as one can to such a one note character. John Goodman is also good as a dictatorial producer.".

To my utmost dismay The Artist not only turned out to be ultimately disappointing bringing nothing new to the table but also a member of that most dreaded genre the tribute film. In other words the type of film that says 'we've run out of ideas so let's just rehash old ideas and call it homage'. The tribute film is even worse than the remake and just one step up from clip shows in terms of unoriginality and we all know how much we hate clip shows! I can just about understand tribute bands they make sense. For instance you want the Beatles live for your party so you book a Beatles tribute band not as good as the real thing but better than a CD.

	schema:reviewBody "Look at what you've become. You've become proud! You've become stupid! The Artist is a beautiful film that pays homage to movies from the late 20's and early 30's the silent film era. In order to do so French director Michel Hazanavicius decided to make this film almost entirely without sound and in black and white. Many producers would've probably thought he was crazy for trying to make a film like this in these days where viewers are used to seeing spectacular and colorful movies with great sound and even in 3D. However The Artist works perfectly and is one of the brightest films of the year despite being in black and white. The cinematography is spectacular perhaps only rivaled this year by The Tree of Life and Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy the costume design and editing are among the best of the year and the score is also amazing. This is truly a beautiful film that many film historians will enjoy for the nice tribute it renders to the age of silent films. Many famous actors during this era weren't able to make the transition to the talkies and that is exactly what The Artist is about and it does it in a very simplistic but stylized fashion. The film has been nominated for 10 Oscars including Best Picture Best Performance by a Lead Actor Jean Dujardin and a Supporting Actress Berenice Bejo. It will probably walk away with the Best Picture title considering how appealing the subject matter is to the Academy and how well the film was crafted. Please don't be scared off because the movie is silent or in black and white because the story is really entertaining and despite being colorless it is brighter than any other film released this year. It is really worth a watch you won't regret it.The year is 1927 and George Valentin Jean Dujardin is at the height of his artistic career. He is a very successful Hollywood actor and producer Al Zimmer John Goodman is very pleased with his work. After having succeeded together yet again in a recent film they are already collaborating for their next project. During rehearsals for their next movie George runs into an extra named Peppy Miller Berenice Bejo. They hit it off instantly sharing a dance number and George insists that Peppy should get the part. Pepper falls in love immediately with George but he is married to Doris Penelope Ann Miller so their relationship is entirely professional. George gives Peppy the best advice she would ever receive In order to make it in the industry she needs to be different and he paints a spot near her lip. This will be her trademark later on as she slowly begins rising to the spotlight during the arrival of the talkies. Valentin however isn't lucky and realizes his days as a successful actor are coming to an end with the advent of these talking pictures. People want to see new faces and hear their voices. Al Zimmer realizes this and breaks relations with George so Valentin decides to produce direct and star in his own silent film. The movie is a failure as people want to see these new talkies and as Valentin's fame becomes to decline Peppy Miller begins to grow into a superstar. Valentin is left with nothing except his faithful driver Clifton James Cromwell and his Jack Russell Terrier named Jack. The times have changed for the great artists and fortunes are reversed.The Artist is among my top ten favorite films of the year and it works really well not only as homage to these silent films but as a love story as well. Along with Midnight in Paris these are perhaps the two best romantic movies of the year and would make for an excellent date. I've already mentioned some of the technical aspects but now I would like to praise the performances from Jean Dujardin Berenice Bejo and the dog which was played in most part by Uggie. I can't leave out the dog because he plays an important role in this film and in a way is Valentin's faithful companion and savior. Jean Dujardin does deserve the Oscar nomination for his performance he was terrific and I think I enjoyed it over George Clooney's. If he wins it will be well deserved. My favorite performance of the film however comes from Berenice Bejo who was also nominated as a supporting actress. She is just terrific and shines every time she's on screen. Her performance gives this black and white movie a lot of color. Both Bejo and Dujardin have worked together with director Hazanavicius in the past in the French spy spoof film OSS 117. I've never seen the movie nor its sequel but after seeing The Artist I'm very much interested in doing so. Overall this is a terrific film and one you won't want to miss.httpestebueno10.blogspot.com".

	schema:headline " A very good film but I wish it hadn't received so much praise.";
	schema:reviewBody "The Artist is a great example of a very good film that was overhyped by critics. Again and again I heard how the film was a prime Oscarcontender. So as a result I had EXTREMELY high hopestoo high actually. If I'd heard nothing about the film I would have left the theater VERY satisfied.Oddly this film is the second homage to silent films that's been released in the last few months. HUGO was simply brilliant and my hope is that it gets the Best Picture nod and The Artist is fortunately very good but quite different in style. It is aside from one song with lyrics and the end of the film silent with only some incidental music and occasional sound effects. It's a reworking of the myth about TONS of silent stars losing their careers because of their inability to adapt to talking pictures popularized by the film Singing in the Rain. I say 'myth' because actually very few major actors really lost their careers due to the coming of talking pictures. Two frequent examples often cited Clara Bow and John Gilbert really weren't lost in talkies completely because of their voices. Sure Bow had a thick New York accentbut her oddscreen antics she was the Lindsay Lohan of her day and fragile mental health really did a lot more to push her out of films. But Gilbert did some amazingly good talkies and his losing his career had a lot more to do with Louis B. Mayer hating himas well as Gilbert's heavy drinkingand nothing to do with his fine voice. But...back to the story.Jean Dujardin plays a huge silent film starone very similar to Douglas Fairbanks. Along the way he helps an aspiring actress Brnice Bejo and soon she too becomes a star. However when talking pictures come she becomes a megastar and Dujardin becomes a hasbeen. The plot is quite a bit like a reworking of A Star is Bornand is clever enough and new enough not to be repetitive. However to me the star of the film was actually Uggiethe wonderful dog actually three different ones according to IMDb who costarred in Dujardin's silent films.So why am I only giving the film a very respectable 8 when critics are going crazy talking about it? Well the story is originally but it's also VERY simple. It is also unfortunately a tad predictable...though quite satisfying as well. Not a bad filmin fact a very good onewith nice cinematography and music as well. But probably not among the very best films of the year.FYIDujardin and Bejo have played together beforesuch as in the very funny James Bondtype comedy OSS 117which is also very well worth seeing.".

	onyx:emotionText "The Artist is a great example of a very good film that was overhyped by critics. Again and again I heard how the film was a prime Oscarcontender. So as a result I had EXTREMELY high hopestoo high actually. If I'd heard nothing about the film I would have left the theater VERY satisfied.Oddly this film is the second homage to silent films that's been released in the last few months. HUGO was simply brilliant and my hope is that it gets the Best Picture nod and The Artist is fortunately very good but quite different in style. It is aside from one song with lyrics and the end of the film silent with only some incidental music and occasional sound effects. It's a reworking of the myth about TONS of silent stars losing their careers because of their inability to adapt to talking pictures popularized by the film Singing in the Rain. I say 'myth' because actually very few major actors really lost their careers due to the coming of talking pictures. Two frequent examples often cited Clara Bow and John Gilbert really weren't lost in talkies completely because of their voices. Sure Bow had a thick New York accentbut her oddscreen antics she was the Lindsay Lohan of her day and fragile mental health really did a lot more to push her out of films. But Gilbert did some amazingly good talkies and his losing his career had a lot more to do with Louis B. Mayer hating himas well as Gilbert's heavy drinkingand nothing to do with his fine voice. But...back to the story.Jean Dujardin plays a huge silent film starone very similar to Douglas Fairbanks. Along the way he helps an aspiring actress Brnice Bejo and soon she too becomes a star. However when talking pictures come she becomes a megastar and Dujardin becomes a hasbeen. The plot is quite a bit like a reworking of A Star is Bornand is clever enough and new enough not to be repetitive.

	schema:reviewBody "Kudos to director Michel Hazanavicius. He had the audacious idea to make a blackandwhite silent film more than eighty years after movies had begun to talk. And then he executed that idea brilliantly. The film had the potential to be a cheap if interesting gimmick. It proved to be so much more than that. It proved to be a great film. The fact it was so unique only added to its allure. Helped by a terrific cast Hazanavicius produced true movie magic.There are so many ingenious things about The Artist but the smartest thing the film has going for it is its subject matter. It's a silent film about silent films. And that opens up so many delicious possibilities. The film's star Jean Dujardin in a truly mesmerizing performance is playing silent film star George Valentin. Valentin is on top of his game and on top of the world. The biggest star of his era adored by legions of fans. One of his biggest fans is a young woman Peppy Miller who audaciously sneaks in a kiss with him outside the premiere of Valentin's latest smash hit. Little do either of them know then that they are two ships passing in the night. The silent movie era is about to end. George Valentin is on the way to ruin. Peppy Miller is on the way to stardom.Peppy starts out as an anonymous extra on one of Valentin's films. From there her star slowly rises. Meanwhile his star burns out completely. The world forgets George Valentin. But Peppy does not. She remembers that man she once so admired. They had but a brief connection but it meant the world to a young woman just getting her start in the business. If anyone can save George Valentin it is Peppy. With a little help from George's wonderfully cute fourlegged friend Jack the dog.All of this is told so wonderfully and to modern eyes and ears so uniquely. Producing this particular story as a silent film was simply ingenious. It's both a love letter to oldtime Hollywood and a thoroughly modern film. The film has so many nods to that longgone era but still works so well for a modern audience. When characters in this film dismiss silent stars as just mugging for the camera it reinforces the point that this film's stars are not doing that. Yes it's a silent film but unlike any we have ever seen before. And yet with enough of those old silent movie touches to make it a worthy homage. A very delicate balance was required and Hazanavicius created that balance perfectly. Of course it never could have worked without the right cast. What a challenge these performers had doing something quite unlike anything they had done before. And they all nailed it. Dujardin was simply amazing. Brnice Bejo playing Peppy matched him stride for stride. What a delightful pair they prove to be. James Cromwell gives such a heartfelt performance as Valentin's loyal chauffeur. And as head of Valentin's film studio John Goodman manages to be a loud presence even in complete silence he's simply perfect for his role. Helped along all the way by a wonderful oldtime sounding silent movie score the film gives you comedy drama romance. And often does it in ways only a silent movie can Hazanavicius taking full advantage of his medium. Intertitles are used sparingly but to great effect most notably in the film's most dramatic moment which so cleverly becomes the film's funniest moment. That great silent movie moment serves as a reminder of what films can be with a little imagination. Hazanavicius had the imagination. And he had the talent to bring his vision to life. It all adds up to a wonderfully unique incredibly entertaining and supremely charming film.".

	schema:headline " A Brilliant And Imaginative Film";
	schema:reviewBody "It is absolutely impossible to watch this film without being astonished by how well made it was by director Michel Hazanavicius. When you think about it this was a risky project. In the second decade of the 21st century how many movie goers would actually be impressed by a silent movie? And I must admit that for the first few minutes I was tentative as I watched this wanting to be impressed but holding back on my admiration almost as if I wanted not to like it for some reason  but then succumbing and having to admit that it really is a brilliant piece of movie making. And Hazanavicius deserves great credit for that. He took this very old and worn style of movie making and made a very new and fresh style of movie out of it. Once you're hooked  which you are very quickly if not right away  you're hooked.This is a great story. If you know anything about movie history you know how true to life it is as well. How many silent actors just couldn't cope with the advent of the talkie? How many careers went down in flames almost literally overnight as the talkies took centre stage? In The Artist it's the fictional George Valentin who's facing this sudden upheaval. Valentin is a huge silent star for Kinograph Pictures when all of a sudden the studio simply tells him that it's over. Everything they have  all their resources  are now being put into talkies and George  as big a silent star as he was  just doesn't fit. As arrogant as he is in many ways you still feel so sorry for him. His life crumbles his marriage crumbles he loses everything except the love of his dog who stays loyally by his side through everything. He struggles to keep going. When Kinograph cuts him loose he tries directing and producing his own silent movie. I think the saddest scene in the entire film is the premiere of this effort as we see an almost empty theatre watching. He WAS a big star  but no one cares about him anymore. The movies have passed him by. It would be the equivalent of people suddenly losing interest  all interest almost overnight  in George Clooney or Brad Pitt. There's a rawness to that simple shot of the almost empty theatre it truly cuts at the viewer. And you wonder how many silent actors had this or something similar happen to them as the 20's suddenly became the 30's  and no one cared about them anymore. French actor Jean Dujardin was wonderful in this role. He silently captured Valentin's pain and bewilderment and sadness as the life he knew totally collapsed around him.And of course there was the other side of the coin  represented by Peppy Martin played by Berenice Bejo who reminded me very much of a young Joan Collins. Peppy was a fan of Valentin who managed to give the mega star a peck on the cheek which photographers captured. That earned her some work as an extra and finally a scene with Valentin in one of his movies. Then  the talkies that destroyed Valentin were perfectly suited to Martin. She rocketed to superstardom even as Valentin collapsed into obscurity. From time to time their paths would cross each time the different trajectories their lives and careers had taken becoming more noticeable. Bejo was also perfect in the role. She pulls off the hint of arrogance so natural for someone who's just become the hottest ticket in Hollywood pointing out to reporters as Valentin  unbeknownst to her listens that people are tired of silent movie actors and all their mugging. But she doesn't forget Valentin. She falls in love with him and rescues him finally using her currency as Kinograph's new megastar to insist on making a movie with him  or else. It can't be a talkie because Valentin doesn't do talkies. But it all leads up to an absolutely breathtaking dance routine between the two near the end of the movie.Brilliant. Just brilliant. The supporting cast were equally strong  from James Cromwell as Valentin's and later Miller's chauffeur to John Goodman as the head of Kinograph Pictures to even Uggie as Valentin's loyal little pooch. A great movie. I found it just a little hard to get into at first but I think that was my fault more than the movie's as I struggled slightly with the whole largely unfamiliar silent medium. 910".

	schema:headline " A classic piece of unforgettable filmmaking.";
	schema:reviewBody "In its Oscar year Shawshank Redemption written and directed by Frank Darabont after the novella Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption by Stephen King was nominated for seven Academy Awards and walked away with zero. Best Picture went to Forrest Gump while Shawshank and Pulp Fiction were just happy to be nominated. Of course hindsight is 2020 but while history looks back on Gump as a good film Pulp and Redemption are remembered as some of the alltime best. Pulp however was a success from the word go making a huge splash at Cannes and making its writerdirector an American master after only two films. For Andy Dufresne and Co. success didn't come easy. Fortunately failure wasn't a life sentence.After opening on 33 screens with take of 727327 the 25M film fell fast from theatres and finished with a mere 28.3M. The reasons for failure are many. Firstly the title is a clunker. While iconic to fans today in 1994 people knew not and cared not what a 'Shawshank' was. On the DVD Tim Robbins laughs recounting fans congratulating him on that 'Rickshaw' movie. Marketingwise the film's a nightmare as 'prison drama' is a tough sell to women and the story of love between two best friends doesn't spell winner to men. Worst of all the movie is slow as molasses. As Desson Thomson writes for the Washington Post it wanders down subplots at every opportunity and ignores an abundance of narrative exit points before settling on its finale. But it is these same weaknesses that make the film so strong.Firstly its setting. The opening aerial shots of the prison are a total eyeopener. This is an amazing piece of architecture strong and Gothic in design. Immediately the prison becomes a character. It casts its shadow over most of the film its tall stone walls stretching above every shot. It towers over the men it contains blotting out all memories of the outside world. Only Andy Robbins holds onto hope. It's in music it's in the sandy beaches of Zihuatanejo In here's where you need it most he says. You need it so you don't forget. Forget that there are places in the world that aren't made out of stone. That there's a  there's a  there's something inside that's yours that they can't touch. Red Morgan Freeman doesn't think much of Andy at first picking that tall glass o' milk with the silver spoon up his ass as the first new fish to crack. Andy says not a word and losing his bet Red resents him for it. But over time as the two get to know each other they quickly become the best of friends. This again is one of the film's major strengths. Many movies are about love many flicks have a sidekick to the hero but Shawshank is the only one I can think of that looks honestly at the love between two best friends. It seems odd that Hollywood would skip this relationship time and again when it's a feeling that weighs so much into everyone's day to day lives. Perhaps it's too sentimental to seem conventional but Shawshank's core friendship hits all the right notes and the film is much better for it.It's pacing is deliberate as well. As we spend the film watching the same actors it is easy to forget that the movie's timeline spans well over 20 years. Such a huge measure of time would pass slowly in reality and would only be amplified in prison. And it's not as if the film lacks interest in these moments. It still knows where it's going it merely intends on taking its sweet time getting there. It pays off as well as the tedium of prison life makes the climax that much more exhilarating. For anyone who sees it it is a moment never to be forgotten.With themes of faith and hope there is a definite religious subtext to be found here. Quiet selfless and carefree Andy is an obvious Christ figure. Warden Norton Bob Gunton is obviously modeled on Richard Nixon who in his day was as close to a personified Satan as they come. But if you aren't looking for subtexts the movie speaks to anyone in search of hope. It is a compelling drama and a very moving film perfectly written acted and shot. They just don't come much better than this.OVERALL SCORE 9.810  A The Shawshank Redemption served as a message of hope to Hollywood as well. More than any film in memory it proved there is life after box office. Besting Forrest and Fiction it ran solely on strong word of mouth and became the hottest rented film of 1995. It currently sits at 2 in the IMDb's Top 250 Films occasionally swapping spots with The Godfather as the top ranked film of all time  redemption indeed. If you haven't seen it yet what the hell are you waiting for? As Andy says It comes down a simple choice really. Either get busy living or get busy dying.".

This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built on from their and that foundation is hope.Other than just the message of this movie the acting was phenomenal. Tim Robbins gave one of the greatest performances ever. He was inspiring intelligent and most of all positive. His performance just made me smile. Robbins plays Andy Dufresne who was wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is gets to life sentences but yet never gives up hope. In he becomes friends with Ellis Boyd Red Redding played by Morgan Freeman. Freeman who gives the finest performance of his career has unlike Robbins lost hope. He is in deep regret of the crime that he committed. His way of deflecting the pain away is by trying to not feel anything at all. With his friendship with Andy he learns that without our hopes and dreams we have nothing. Andy also becomes friends with the rest of Red's group. James Whitmore also gave a great performance as Brooks Halten who gets out of prison parole but in the words of Red he has been institutionalized. The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. He kept this movie at a great steady pace along with the writing and great cinematography. He portrayed prison life in such a horrifying way but not in terms of the physical pain but the stress and pain that wares mentally on the inmates some of which deserve a second chance. Whatever you do don't listen to the people who say this movie is overrated because this is one of the most inspiring and greatest movies ever. It has everything you could possibly want.".

	schema:reviewBody "Can Hollywood usually creating things for entertainment purposes only create art?  To create something of this nature a director must approach it in a most meticulous manner due to the delicacy of the process.  Such a daunting task requires an extremely capable artist with an undeniable managerial capacity and an acutely developed awareness of each element of art in their films the most prominent music visuals script and acting. These elements each equally important must succeed independently yet still form a harmonious union because this mixture determines the fate of the artist's opus.  Though already well known amongst his colleagues for his notable skills at writing and directing Frank Darabont emerges with his feature film directorial debut The Shawshank Redemption.  Proving himself already a master of the craft Darabont managed to create one of the most recognizable independent releases in the history of Hollywood.  The Shawshank Redemption defines a genre defies the odds compels the emotions and brings an era of artistically influential films back to Hollywood.The story begins with the trial of a young banker Andy Dufrense victimized by circumstantial evidence resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover.  After a quick conviction Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison with no hope of parole.  He exists in this prison only in appearance keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him.  His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates but most of all from Ellis Redding.  Ellis commonly referred to as Red finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison.  Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself and the world around him.  Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.By creating the film's firm foundation the meticulously chiseled screenplay paved the way for this film's success.  Frank Darabont outdoes himself with the phenomenal adaptation of Stephen King's equally noteworthy novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption.  In this novella King demonstrates that he can break free from the genre he dominates and still create a marvelous piece of modern literature.  Though the film mirrors the novella in many ways Darabont illustrates a focused objective of improving upon the areas where the novella came up short resulting in one of the best book to film transitions ever.While maintaining some of the poetic and moving dialogue of the novella Darabont also proves that a film's score can generate a great deal of emotional response from its audience as dialogue does.  He employs the cunning Thomas Newman son of the legendary Hollywood composer Alfred Newman.  Darabont shows recognition for the film's needs by employing Newman who makes the gentle piano chords whisper softly to the viewer as if a part of the scripted dialogue.  Newman lends himself to individualism and tends to drive more towards the unique in the realm of score composition.  His effort in Shawshank did not go unnoticed as his score received an Oscar nomination in 1995.  While unique and independent Newman's score never once intrudes on your concentration or distracts from the film.With work from vast array of talented scene designers costume designers composers cinematographers and various other Hollywood artists the cast of The Shawshank Redemption had a strong foundation to work with.  The marvelous cast of this film will dazzle you with some of the most convincing performances you will witness in a film.  While both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman shine as Andy and Red respectively the true spectacle of acting lies within the plethora of amazing supporting actors who easily disappear into their roles.  Most noticeable of these the veteran film star James Whitmore who portrays the elderly Brooks Hatlen.  Brooks a man incarcerated for an unmentioned crime for so long that he finds himself attached to the Shawshank and the daily life he has lead.  Each of these actors show a true dedication to their art and a focused purpose in their motivations creating a convincing setting that never once caters to anything unbelievable.With all of the aesthetic touches and attention to cinematic detail the most beautiful part of the film lies within its thematic material such as its focus on the human desires for the most abstract concepts like hope and freedom.  These themes which concern things the human spirit undoubtedly yearns for seem so intricately woven into the plot that it easily draws its audience in to its story.  Though full of hardened criminals your heart will go out to these men as they display the most basic of human emotions and deliver some of the most quotable lines in a film to date.  Like a great novel this film manages to succeed at greater things than simply entertaining an audience.  Darabont tells his story most masterfully illustrating principles and inspiring his audience to think.  He leaves us a poignant film with a powerful message of hope and redemption something we all seek.This film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it long lost in a dark sea of clichs and predictability.  Darabont shows us that artists still work in the Hollywood studios and production facilities. These artists show their capability to produce art real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you.  The Shawshank Redemption delivers muchneeded breath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film.  It proves that masters of the craft still live on this earth and still bless us with timeless masterpieces that we will never forget.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm trying to save you money this is the last film title that you should consider borrowing. Renting Shawshank will cost you five bucks... just plunk down the 25 and own the title. You'll wind up going back to this gem time and time again. This is one of few movies that are truly timeless. And it's entertaining and moving no matter how many times you view it.Forget about what others including myself might suggest you'll discover in The Shawshank Redemption when you watch it you'll identify something very personal in your own life with a scene a character or a moment in this uncomplicated movie. When you need hope you'll look for Shawshank. When you want to believe in the will of overcoming even the greatest obstacles Shawshank will uplift you in ways that you can't find in movies today. Some liken the film to some kind of spiritual awakening. Of course some can go to a church or mosque to find enlightenment and Faith in humanity but most places of worship are open only certain days or times. But when you need affirmation of the lasting bond of friendships that prevail over the most dire circumstances Shawshank will give it to you. It makes grown men like me cry still. I wonder whether Shawshank was truly meant for viewing in the privacy of the home because it is a personal experience that really makes you look inward. Nominated for seven this is the best film that never one a single Oscar. How ironic that an innocent man winds up being surrounded by the corruption of the legal system. Shawshank itself is similar to the character of Andy Dufresne. Prejudging this classic film critics couldn't get past the title. The public followed suit initially dismissing Shawshank which failed in the box office just like It's a Wonderful Life and Citizen Kane. It could have just whithered away on the store shelves like Andy Dufresne could have in his own cell. But the characters prevailed because Andy  And Shawshank  stayed true. Now these movies are right up there as the most popular films of all time. Anyone who has yet to watch Shawshank may be so jaded of movies or the film's title or how a 212 hour movie set inside the walls of a prison can manage to tap the soul of such a wide range of people. Shawshank has not one explosion. I wonder if it even has a single special effect or digitally enhanced frame. But every aspect of Shawshank fit together. The acting from the top to the bit part. The musical score. The editing. The photography. The story from opening credits to final scene. All involved including the town of Mansfield Ohio where Shawshank was actually filmed played their roles perfectly. Shawshank is a must see must own title.".

I wonder whether Shawshank was truly meant for viewing in the privacy of the home because it is a personal experience that really makes you look inward. Nominated for seven this is the best film that never one a single Oscar. How ironic that an innocent man winds up being surrounded by the corruption of the legal system. Shawshank itself is similar to the character of Andy Dufresne. Prejudging this classic film critics couldn't get past the title. The public followed suit initially dismissing Shawshank which failed in the box office just like It's a Wonderful Life and Citizen Kane. It could have just whithered away on the store shelves like Andy Dufresne could have in his own cell. But the characters prevailed because Andy  And Shawshank  stayed true. Now these movies are right up there as the most popular films of all time. Anyone who has yet to watch Shawshank may be so jaded of movies or the film's title or how a 212 hour movie set inside the walls of a prison can manage to tap the soul of such a wide range of people. Shawshank has not one explosion. I wonder if it even has a single special effect or digitally enhanced frame. But every aspect of Shawshank fit together. The acting from the top to the bit part. The musical score. The editing. The photography. The story from opening credits to final scene. All involved including the town of Mansfield Ohio where Shawshank was actually filmed played their roles perfectly. Shawshank is a must see must own title.";

	schema:reviewBody "The Shawshank Redemption is written and directed by Frank Darabont. It is an adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman the film portrays the story of Andy Dufresne Robbins a banker who is sentenced to two life sentences at Shawshank State Prison for apparently murdering his wife and her lover. Andy finds it tough going but finds solace in the friendship he forms with fellow inmate Ellis Red Redding Freeman. While things start to pick up when the warden finds Andy a prison job more befitting his talents as a banker. However the arrival of another inmate is going to vastly change things for all of them.There was no fanfare or bunting put out for the release of the film back in 94 with a title that didn't give much inkling to anyone about what it was about and with Columbia Pictures unsure how to market it Shawshank Redemption barely registered at the box office. However come Academy Award time the film received several nominations and although it won none it stirred up interest in the film for its home entertainment release. The rest as they say is history. For the film finally found an audience that saw the film propelled to almost mythical proportions as an endearing modern day classic. Something that has delighted its fans whilst simultaneously baffling its detractors. One thing is for sure though is that which ever side of the Shawshank fence you sit on the film continues to gather new fans and simply will never go away.It's possibly the simplicity of it all that sends some haters of the film into cinematic spasms. The implausible plot and an apparent sentimental edge that makes a nonsense of prison life are but two chief complaints from those that dislike the film with a passion. But when characters are this richly drawn and so movingly performed it strikes me as churlish to do down a human drama that's dealing in hope friendship and faith. The sentimental aspect is indeed there but that acts as a counterpoint to the suffering degradation and shattering of the soul involving our protagonist. Cosy prison life you say? No chance. The need for human connection is never more needed than during incarceration surely? And given the quite terrific performances of Robbins never better  Freeman sublimely making it easy it's the easiest thing in the world to warm to Andy and Red.Those in support aren't faring too bad either. Bob Gunton is coiled spring smarm as Warden Norton James Whitmore is heart achingly great as the Birdman Of Shawshank Clancy Brown is menacing as antagonist Capt. Byron Hadley William Sadler amusing as Heywood  Mark Rolston is impressively vile as Bogs Diamond. Then there's Roger Deakins' lush cinematography as the camera gracefully glides in and out of the prison offering almost ethereal hope to our characters yes they are ours. The music pings in conjunction with the emotional flow of the movie too. Thomas Newman's score is mostly piano based dovetailing neatly with Andy's state of mind while the excellently selected soundtrack ranges from the likes of Hank Williams to the gorgeous Le Nozze di Figaro by Mozart.If you love Shawshank then it's a love that lasts a lifetime. Every viewing brings the same array of emotions  anger  revilement  happiness  sadness  inspiration and a warmth that can reduce the most hardened into misty eyed wonderment. Above all else though Shawshank offers hope  not just for characters in a movie but for a better life and a better world for all of us. 1010".

And James Whitmore's portrail of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film.

	schema:reviewBody "Misery and Stand By Me were the best adaptations up until this one now you can add Shawshank to that list.This is simply one of the best films ever made and I know I am not the first to say that and I certainly won't be the last. The standing on the IMDb is a true barometer of that. 3 as of this date and I'm sure it could be number 1. So I'll just skip all the normal praise of the film because we all know how great it is. But let me perhaps add that what I find so fascinating about Shawshank is that Stephen King wrote it.King is one of the best writers in the world. Books like IT and the Castle Rock series are some of the greatest stories ever told. But his best adaptations are always done by the best directors. The Shining was brilliantly interpreted by Kubrick and of course the aforementioned Misery and Stand By Me are both by Rob Reiner. Now Frank Darabont comes onto the scene and makes arguably the best King film ever. He seems to understand what King wants to say and he conveys that beautifully. What makes this film one of the best ever made is the message it conveys. It is one of eternal hope. Andy Dufresne played by Tim Robbins has been sent to prison for a crime he did not commit. But he never loses hope. He never gives up his quest to become a free man again. His years of tenacity patience and wits keep him not only sane but it gives his mind and a spirit a will to live. This film has a different feel to it. There has never been anything like it before and I don't know if there will again.I'm not going to say any more about this film it has already been said but just suffice to say that I am glad that Forrest Gump won best picture in 94. I would have been equally glad if Pulp Fiction or Shawshank would have won. It is that good of a movie and one that will be appreciated for years to come.".

In fact the main reason that me and my friends don't refer to it by title is because this movie is so great that we do not feel worthy enough to say it's name in vain! I still remember the first time I saw The Shawshank Redemption.  Some friends of mine and I went to see it at one of those Budget Theaters over the summer of 1995.  None of us really knew anything about the movie but we had heard that it was pretty good.  So not having any real expectations we saw it.  When the final credits rolled and the lights came on in the theater all of us just sat there with our jaws hanging down on the floor. I turned my head towards my friend Bob and said That was the greatest movie I have ever seen in my entire life! There's really no other way I can put it in words.  Every moment of this movie captivated me and inspired me to believe in the one true thing in life...... HOPE.  This movie is sad uplifting inspiring harsh cold funny at the right times jawdropping and heartwarming all at the same time.  I get chills every time I watch this film and this film contains the greatest ending which takes place over the last 30 minutes or soin movie history!  How it all just comes together is so incredible and uplifting. I should also mention the music in this movie is nearly flawless as well and the soundtrack is a must buy for any music fan. The only bad thing about this movie is the fact that I know I will never see a better movie no matter how many I may see.  I've seen many movies over the past few years many excellent films.  However every time I walk out of the theater I turn to my friend or family member that I saw it with and I say That was a great movie but it wasn't nearly as good as 'you know what'!  There have been many movies over the past few years that thought would really move me or that I might one day call my favorite of all time but they've all fallen far short of The Shawshank Redemption. So if you have yet to see this movie please run to the video store immediately.  You're guaranteed to find it in the employee picks section. And if it isn't in that section then you should tell the employees there that there is something seriously wrong with them.  If you have seen this movie go see it again.  If you haven't bought your own copy yet buy one. In fact buy two and put one in a fireproof safe just in case of an emergency. o So you want a 110 rating???  I give it a 13!!!!!!".

The plot is average but King did great things with it in his novella that are only furthered by the direction and the acting is so toprate it's almost scary.Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufrane wrongly imprisoned for 20 years for the murder of his wife. The story focuses on Andy's relationship with Red Redding Morgan Freeman in probably his best role and his attempts to escape from Shawshank. Bob Gunton is positively evil and frightening as Warden Norton and there are great performances and cameos all around the most prominent one being Gil Bellows late as Billy of Ally McBeal as Tommy a fellow inmate of Andy's who suffers under the iron will of Norton.If you haven't seen this movie GO AND RENT IT NOW.

	schema:reviewBody "I believe that this film is the best story ever told on film and I'm about to tell you why.Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufresne a city banker wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is sent to Shawshank Prison in 1947 and receives a double life sentence for the crime. Andy forms an unlikely friendship with Red Morgan Freeman the man who knows how to get things. Andy faces many trials in prison but forms an alliance with the wardens because he is able to use his banking experience to help the corrupt officials amass personal fortunes. The story unfolds....I was so impressed with how every single subplot was given a great deal of respect and attention from the director. The acting was worldclass. I have never seen Tim Robbins act as well since Morgan Freeman maybe e.g. Seven. The twists were unexpected an although this film had a familiar feel it wasn't even slightly pretentious or cliched it was original. The cinematography was grand and expressive. It gave a real impression of the sheer magnitude of this daunting prison.But the one thing which makes THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION stand above all other films is the attention given to the story. The film depends on the story and the way in which it unravels. It's a powerful poignant thoughtprovoking challenging film like no other. If Andy were to comment on this film I think he might say Get busy watching or get busy dying. Take his advice.Thoroughly recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "Yes there are SPOILERS hereThis film has had such an emotional impact on me I find it hard to write comments on it.  I've read a lot of the previous comments all those that gush and eulogise as well as those who think it's overrated or cliched. Most have got good points to make however the thing that I think everyone is struggling to both explain and come to terms with is just why this film is so loved.  Loved to the extent that for many it is an almost spiritual experience or for those of a more secular nature like myself loved as one of the most devastatingly uplifting things that can happen to you while watching a film.So I'm not going to review it I'm just going to struggle in my own way to explain this film.  It took me a few viewings to get why I connect with it so deeply but here goes.Many people in this world are unhappy.  Most people in this world don't want to be unhappy.  Lots of people wish pray and above all hope for that magic wand to wave and wash them of their fears losses angers and pains once and for all.  They see lots of other people seemingly in this magical state while they suffer.  To borrow the words of another film they're watching the bluebirds flying over the rainbow.Many unhappy people have learned that the magic wand doesn't exist. They're not destined to join the bluebirds and fairytales don't come true.  It's not that no one lives happily ever after it's just that they're not going to. They're busy dying.In this film or as some people have quite correctly said this fairytale magic wands exist.  And that magic wand is Andy Dufrense imitating Houdini. However this film is not about him.  Neither is it about the prison the governor the guard the plot the acting the cinematography the script the direction or the score.It's about Red.  He is the one who has become institutionally unhappy he's not only trapped in a prison not only has he given up on the idea of ever leaving not only does he have no hope he knows that if the miracle would ever happen to him he couldn't cope.  He's safe in his unhappiness and that security is what keeps him going.  Hope is as Red say dangerous.  The metaphor for a certain illness here is very clear to me and I know that a rather large number of people suffer from it.  A large proportion of those don't understand what's wrong but they certainly can recognise a fellow sufferer.  Those who are mercifully untouched by this illness definitely don't understand what's going on in those who do.  They're too busy living.The miracle in this film is not only that Red is redeemed but that the world outside the prison isn't all warm and sandy and sunny and with excellent fishing.  Some of it is rocky and uncertain.  Fairytales don't get this far. They'd end as Red left the gates of the prison and the credits would say 'and he lived happily ever after'.  This is the only film I can currently think of where they show how to get to the living happily ever after bit from your redemption via the rocky and uncertain ground of bagging groceries at the local store.  In other words they're not going to cheat you and tell you everything's going to be alright.This is crucial.  For two and half hours those of us who are quite content to mooch around our own personal prisons can see an escape route quite different to Andy's mapped out on the screen.  And it's a real way out. It's hard and upsetting but ultimately rewarding.  The high you get from finding out and knowing that is only comparable diamorphine.The trouble is if you're already busy living this film won't mean that much and you'll see it a little more clearly than those busy dying.  To those fortunate individuals watch this film and understand what the rest of us are going through.So yes this film is a cliched fairytale and maybe as a story it isn't realistic and at second on the IMDb all time list it is a bit overrated. However if you could have a chart of films listing the number of lives saved altered and improved the Shawshank Redemption would be way out in front at number one.".

	schema:headline " Great story wondrously told and acted";
	schema:reviewBody "At the heart of this extraordinary movie is a brilliant and indelible performance by Morgan Freeman as Red the man who knows how to get things the only guilty man at Shawshank prison. He was nominated by the Academy for Best Actor in 1995 but didn't win. Tom Hanks won for Forrest Gump. What Freeman does so beautifully is to slightly underplay the part so that the eternal boredom and cynicism of the lifer comes through and yet we can see how very much alive with the warmth of life the man is despite his confinement. Someday Morgan Freeman is going to win an Academy Award and it will be in belated recognition for this performance which I think was a little too subtle for some Academy members to fully appreciate at the time.But Freeman is not alone. Tim Robbins plays the hero of the story banker Andy Dufresne who has been falsely convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. Robbins has a unique quality as an actor in that he lends ever so slightly a bemused irony to the characters he plays. It is as though part of him is amused at what he is doing. I believe this is the best performance of his career but it might be compared with his work in The Player 1992 another excellent movie and in Mystic River 2003 for which he won an Oscar as Best Supporting Actor.It is said that every good story needs a villain and in the Biblequoting Biblethumping massively hypocritical sadistic Warden Samuel Norton played perfectly by Bob Gunton we have a doozy. I want to tell you that Norton is so evil that fundamentalist Christians actually hate this movie because of how precisely his vile character is revealed. They also hate the movie because of its depiction of violent predatory homosexual behavior which is the reason the movie is rated R. On the wall of his office hiding his safe with its illgotten contents and duplicitous accounts is a framed plaque of the words His judgment cometh and that right soon. The irony of these words as they apply to the men in the prison and ultimately to the warden himself is just perfect. You will take delight I promise.Here is some other information about the movie that may interest you. As most people know it was adapted from a novella by Stephen King entitled Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption. Rita Hayworth figures in the story because Red procures a poster of her for Andy that he pins up on the wall of his cell. The poster is a still from the film Gilda 1946 starring her and Glenn Ford. We see a clip from the black and white film as the prisoners watch cheering and hollering when Rita Hayworth appears. If you haven't seen her check out that old movie. She really is gorgeous and a forerunner of Marilyn Monroe who next appears on Andy's wall in a still from The Seven Year Itch 1955. It's the famous shot of her in which her skirt is blown up to reveal her shapely legs. Following her on Andy's wall and by the way these pinups figure prominently in the plot is Rachel Welsh from One Million Years B.C. 1966. In a simple and effective device these pinups show us graphically how long Andy and Red have been pining away.Frank Darabont's direction is full of similar devices that clearly and naturally tell the story. There is Brooks James Whitmore who gets out after fifty years but is so institutionalized that he can't cope with life on the outside and hangs himself. Playing off of this is Red's periodic appearance before the parole board where his parole is summarily REJECTED. Watch how this plays out at the end.The cinematography by Roger Deakins is excellent. The editing superb there's not a single dead spot in the whole movie. The difference between the good guys Red Andy Brooks etc. and the bad guys the warden the guards the sisters etc. is perhaps too starkly drawn and perhaps Andy is a bit too heroic and determined beyond what might be realistic and perhaps the redemption is a bit too miraculous in how beautifully it works out. But never mind. We love it.All in all this is a great story vividly told that will leave you with a true sense of redemption in your soul. It is not a chick flick and that is an understatement. It is a male bonding movie about friendship and the strength of character about going up against what is wrong and unfair and coming out on top through pure true grit and a little luck.Bottom line one of the best ever made currently rated 2 behind The Godfather at the IMDb. Don't miss it.Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote! Get it at Amazon!".

In Shawshank Redemption you start slowly after a while you get attached by the time you reach the middle of the movie you simply totally forget about anything outside the screen and feel a mixed stream of emotions going through you head before anything else! then comes a last 20 minutes of heart storming that is surely enough to raise the adrenaline to extreme levels even in diabetics! I felt warm strong happy and all other emotions one can think of I felt I was the one who won who got out of prison i was simply fully satisfied.This movie must be used as an Antidepression by therapists! this movie proves that Oscars are either money bought gifts! or that who ever in charge of them are so smart that they couldn't give any Oscar to The Shawshank Redemption knowing that the movie is on different  much higher rating scale than the Oscars.. it's simply over qualified!".

Andy Dufresne wrongly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover finds the strength not only to change himself but to bring hope to those around him in Shawshank Prison.  This inspiring story is interwoven with a soundtrack which invokes every emotion from haunting and chilling to stirring and beautiful. When you go to see a movie and it touches you with its poetry music and its atmosphere and leaves you with a sense of victorious satisfaction it is a triumph.  Field of Dreams was the first movie which invoked these emotions in me.  Shawshank Redemption is even more powerful for its simplicity.  It doesn't pretend to be clean nor could it be called a family movie.  It is brutal and violent at times horrifying and sickening at others. However the title says it all. Redemption is what this story is all about.  And it is not necessarily redemption for the actual crimes you might have committed but it is redemption for the way you have lived your life.  What emerges can only be called a maginificent piece of art.  This is what movies were meant to be.".

When I thought about it though it made more sensethis is a Rockytype feelgood movie that doesn't really make you think and reinforces what we would all like to believe about human nature. Don't get me wrongit's a fine film I gave it a solid 7 out of 10 it's just not in my view up there with Casablanca and The Graduate.I guess the main problem I have with Shawshank is the nature of the script and characters. Think about it is there a single person in the film who isn't a onedimensional cardboard cutout with very simple motivations or a Hollywood cliche or stereotype? We have in no particular order a corrupt bigoted prison warden who is a religious hypocrite for good measure a brutal prison guard a man who is wrongly accused of murder an old convict who knows all the ropes and can't live on the outside and a convict who is murdered by the brutal guards. Now where have we seen this stuff before? Only in a few dozen movies made from the 20s to the 90s. There's really nothing new here. Probably this comes from the fact that the story is from Stephen King who doesn't really do well with complex characters a problem I noted as far back as Carrie.If you want to see a good prison picture try Cool Hand Luke from which this movie borrows considerably. If you want an escape picture see either The Great Escape or Papillon both with Steve McQueen. Or if by some chance you want a crime and punishment movie that really makes you think go with the late great Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange.I couldn't stop thinking about the warden doesn't he have a family? How did they feel? What are they going to do now? I realize the story is inside the prison but I wish the movie had made better use of its characters than simply as simpleminded symbols of EVIL or VIRTUE.I'm not Mr. Cranky I did enjoy the movie but I enjoyed it the same way I do an Italian dinner at the Olive Gardena wellconstructed genre product with nothing special to commend it.".

The only exception was early in 2002 when FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING topped the chart for a couple of months then dropped down to number 2 for a couple of more months . Ill probably make myself very unpopular for saying this but I dont think SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION deserves to be so high !!!!!! SPOILERS !!!!!!What I dont like about it is the amount of cliches . New prisoner arrives and finds a maggot in his food  prison cliche 37 . New prisoner gives maggot to old prisoner to feed his pet bird  prison cliche 43 . Its revealed at the end that the prisoner who has spent so many years inside is innocent after all  prison cliche numero uno . Did anyone believe during any part of this movie that Andy Dufresne was guilty ? Neither did I . Maybe thats why I love the American prison series OZ because all the inmates there are totally guilty . Theres other things wrong with the movie . Its about half an hour overlong  and theres rather unrealistic bits like the warder having someone killed after finding out Dufresne is probably innocent. Oh and how many prison friendships has there been between a black man and a white man ? Maybe that last point shouldnt be taken as a criticism because the performances of Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are very good and make the movie . Neither of them give a flashy performance  Again not a criticism  but both are very subtle in their roles  can you imagine how different this movie would have been if wed had Tom Cruise and Denzil Washington as the stars ? Perhaps because Freemans character of Red does seem to have been written as a white character hes so good in the role . Am I alone in thinking Freeman has been the best black actor in Hollywood for the last decade because hes more interested in exploring the character instead of playing someone whos black ? Theres also some outstanding touches from director Frank Darabont . Witness the scene early in the film where Andy spends his first night in prison with the darkness falling upon the prisoners faces . Its almost like the artwork of Andy Dogg as the prisoners look out onto the landing as they search for fresh prey  and there is quite a touching sequence as Red leaves prison out into the harsh outside world to the strains of Thomas Newmans scoreI gave THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION eight out of ten . It is a classic feel good movie but unfortunately being a cynic I do think its slightly overrated by IMDB voters".

A lot of effort went into this production with good acting an interesting storyline time travel adventure and history. The chase to ave or kidnap the queen kept me glued to the screen. It was a thrilling roller coaster for about threequarters of the film. The last quarter gave mixed messages jumbled conclusions and added loose ends. Where was the director did he fall asleep? the whole story hinges on an underwater discovery of a sunken British ship. What ship? Who was on it? Who drowned? The last time we saw the rings they were in the hands of the two characters in 1778 in a forest in India. How did the rings get on a ship? Not by the dead character in the forest! The last quarter of the film simply sinks the movie.".

Josh Hartnett plays dual characters one as a diverarchaeologist type in the 21st Century and the second being a Scotsman working under the British colonials in the Indian subcontinent in the 17th Century. Tamsin Egerton plays his wife in the 21st Century and Bipasha Basu plays his love interest in 17th Century India. Having read an interview by director Roland Joff about the film I was expecting much more involvement of quantum physics to be present in the film. Not necessarily the entire film to be explaining the theory but at least more play on parallel universe and different realities. I was expecting more scifi along the lines of the Source Code or Interstellar. Instead what we got was Titanic crossed with Bollywood. If you are a scifi fan then you may be disappointed but if you are a romance fan then you may enjoy the film. Think Time Traveller's Wife The Age of Adaline and other paranormal romances.".

	schema:reviewBody "First of all this film was beautifully done it deserves the stars given. The music the cinematography and the acting were all done well aside from a few minor and unnecessary scenes by supporting roles.The main disappointment with the story was the past and present coming together in a more fluid and fulfilling fashion. This is where the entire film seems to fault and lose a good deal of satisfaction. The story involves lovers in the past and lovers in the future. In the past the lovers only share a brief time together amidst much conflict. Their fate seems to be sealed from the beginning by visions of betrayal death and a unique set of rings that intertwine into one ring. Many issues with the story arise in the transition of past to present and the meaning of the rings. Some questions seem to go unanswered if not viewed carefully. Having read some reviews it seems viewers overlook important details due to rapid scene changes and a constant search for significance. For example it's easy to completely miss the explanation of how one half of the ring comes to rest at the bottom of the ocean in a metal snap purse with the initials D.E. engraved on it. The answer is actually mid story. The character named Dolly played by Alice Englert actually holds the purse in her hands while the camera quickly closes in for a brief closeup. There are the initials and the one hint that gets sadly overlooked because it seems unimportant at the time. But this hint is crucial for understanding how half of the ring is discovered in the future. There is also a bit of confusion regarding the rings. Initially they seem to relate to love that cannot be fulfilled due to the cursed nature of the visions shared by Tulaja the lover from the past who is played by Bipasha Basu. At first the rings seem to betray the lovers. Later in the story the combined rings seem to bring good fortune due to their mystical powers which are never clearly explained. Granted in the end it seems the rings symbolize the complexity of love at times difficult binding and powerful. But the problem for most viewers may not be in the rings themselves or their meaning. The greatest conflict within the story seems to surround the fact that the characters played by Josh Hartnett both in the past and future don't end up loving the same woman. If the lovers were the same people throughout the entire time line the film may have received a better reception. As another reviewer mentioned The Fountain starring Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz also explored a love across time. This story had a sense of closure and satisfaction because the lovers were the same in the past present and future. The characters in that film came full circle. In The Lovers they sadly do not reunite the way most wish them to. The female lover from the past appears in the distant future in a recognizable form only to give the other half of the ring to another woman who is in love with the possibly reincarnated version of her past lover. This creates a considerable amount of conflict. It leaves one wondering why one lover finds happiness and the other can't. Will he one day bring half of a ring to her future reincarnation to allow her the same happiness with another? One will never know. It's a very unselfish interpretation of love which is why most people won't enjoy that outcome. Everyone wants the two lovers from the past to find each other in the end. That apparently wasn't the point. It's not hard to imagine that the writer's intention was to express that love which can transcend time will wait its turn. It's just not as satisfying for the general public who are used to two hour films with happy endings. This story bends the rules but it's done lovingly. Although I was left wanting closure I appreciated the attention to quality and wouldn't regard it a bad film because it didn't end the way I wanted it to. It was also nice to see Harnett again.".

Don't get me started on that 300 year old witch or ghost that had the second ring. The premise behind the rings should have had a different outcome whereas the soul of a present day living Tulaja should be his soul mate not some dumb treasure chaser that acted like Gollum from Lord of the rings. I'm no playwright but this should never have been produced are we that hard up for a good script that just about anything can get greenlighted. I am a fan of Josh's...or rather I was. He's been away for quite a while he should have picked a better project for his second coming. I'll give him a second chance only because of his prior work. If the next one sucks too he'll hear it from me. Next time IFC Films wants to throw away 35 million dollars I'll play catch with them.".

The Lovers is Roland Joff's newest work and I have to say I really enjoyed his Killing Fields and you may also have heard of or seen his film The Mission. It's his first film in 4 years but he turns 70 this year so no surprise he's a bit on the slow side now especially as he also wrote the script for The Lovers and it is only the third time in his long career that he has done so.The central character is played by Josh Hartnett once a big rising star but by now disappeared a bit. Here he returns to the big screen and I saw he is also currently playing in the successful television series Penny Dreadful. I've never been too big on him in the past but here he is okay and his performance is certainly not one of the major flaws of this movie. Tamsin Egerton is one of Britain's rising stars but this film will probably not propel her career any higher right now. It's basically a film about the clash of two worlds on the one side we have marine scientists today and on the other we have ancient India. The cinematography and costumes are fine but storywise I never felt a really welldone significant connection between these two at any point during these 110 minutes. That's why I cannot recommend this film. If you are interested in the topic I suggest taking a look at Ben Kingsley's The Physician from 2013. It's Persia ad not India but I thought this was very well done.".

I guess it also deals with the eternal nature of true love even though we never see how such love grows...rather shallow here. The premise of one love through time is not executed well.It jumps back and forth in time but mainly is rooted in India where Josh Hartnett is a Scots officer in the British Army who keeps slipping in and out of his accent.The film tries to implant a mystical air to the past and future characters who somehow will be linked through time Cloud Atlas style. For me the weak point was Hartnett's character a seasoned and intelligent officer hypnotically walking off into the night alone right into enemy territory. That was the absurd part. Also we never learn how and why the rings were found at the bottom of the ocean. But I can't say film wasn't entertaining. It was...yet not very fulfilling.".

From there the story gets a perfect beginning later moves back to India.I don't understand what's with the Chinese music where the actual story take place in the 18th century India. It was so good and blends well but that does define India or Indian culture while narrating its story. If you are not familiar with both Chinese and Indian musics then it's not an issue at all. But that does not it the names are Hindu and Indian soldiers with the Persian costumes swords and other gadgets.How the name 'Dragon's Throat' came to Indian geographical area and surname for the Indian characters in a wrong princely state. Like that many stuffs make no sense especially if you are from that part of the Earth. I think the research was very poor for making this movie. They should have hired an Indian musician and costume designer with an historian.Love has many faces and one of them is jealousy.The quality was top notch the cast and their performances were excellent. But I could not stand for Bipasha Basu's facial expressions. She was always been in a sad face look so depressing. That is the way her character was developed so nothing wrong in her display. It was her international debut flick as well and the launch was so disappointing. Because the story was very weak maybe very silly. I have never seen the narration set in the ancient India other than in the Indian films. Quite amazing locations and convinced with the visuals that how the 1700s' subcontinent would have looked like.The major problem with this flick is that people can't get ending. How the time barrier was broken to pass through another timeline was never explained. The Hindu priestsaintsadhu who blabbers about the space and time was a ridiculous than intellectual briefing. So this film owes lots of explanation to the viewers than entertaining them. I want to favour it but I also want to be honest. The film was not like I was hoping for very excited for the merge of historical subject with scifi but did not stand tall. Thankfully either it was not a bad movie of the year I've seen even worse that I felt not to review. I won't recommend it but there's a slim chance that you might like it so choose it carefully.510".

So this film owes lots of explanation to the viewers than entertaining them. I want to favour it but I also want to be honest. The film was not like I was hoping for very excited for the merge of historical subject with scifi but did not stand tall. Thankfully either it was not a bad movie of the year I've seen even worse that I felt not to review. I won't recommend it but there's a slim chance that you might like it so choose it carefully.510";

Hartnett and Basu had negligible chemistry together but the writing was hollow throughout the film so the shortcomings of the film cannot be blamed entirely on them. I felt Hartnett was the better actor by far. Basu and more the director perhaps try to evoke emotion through her by having her stare out into space over long periods of time that were almost excruciating to watch.I don't believe I've ever watched a film in which a major character died when I felt zero reaction beyond some disgust at the means of death. I suspect that is because I felt the character deserved to die at that point as they were so awfully written. The lines uttered by the Indian guru at the end were cheesy. The relationship between Hartnett's American lover and him was never established so it was impossible to connect with all the crying on her part. The movie was a mishmash of British colonialism which was extremely boring by the way and the two relationships of a British soldiersea explorer both lacking real connection. This movie is a masterpiece of boredom. I've seen much better Hallmark movies. This film should be watched only if you are already in severe pain which can only be alleviated through distraction. Although it's not very distracting come to think of it. It could ease your pain by putting you to sleep though through a combination of mental and emotional boredom beautiful scenery and mournful music . ".

I think a straightup historical story would have worked a lot better. As usual the film suffers from heavyhanded scripting presenting stereotypical British soldiers plundering their way through the Indian subcontinent and asking us to believe in a fierce warriorwoman who's more than a match for her male counterparts yeah right.

A little bit into the movie after the main character ended up in a coma I realized he wasn't traveling in time but may have been dreaming the past uncertain the connection between the two times is never fully established. Is it a past life? The rings are supposed to reunite lovers but don't quite seem to live up to the challenge. Most of the movie is immersed in the past time line and though there is a lot of cutting back and forth near the end of the film the future hardly gets any screen time and the only connections between the past and the present are the rings and the main character or his soul? assuming he doesn't just magically look just like the other guy. I kept watching it waiting for the connection to click and it just doesn't get there. A lot of people commented in their reviews about not finding out who D.E. was but I figured it was pretty obvious that it was Dolly Egerton and her shiny metal purse but there is no explanation as to how she ended up with the rings and it looks like she never made it to America. I finished the film kind of wondering what happened at the end. Did the ring magically restore the past version of his soul or pull him back to himself or what? How did Tulaja get it there? Why didn't it reunite her with him? It seems like he didn't need to be in the past for it to work or for Tulaja to be there. The movie was interesting but the end was all jumbled up an nonsensical. Also I was a little disappointed in Tulaja's warrior skills. She started off the movie strong but then she got drugged. And she spends a lot of time away from her queen while traveling. And she was ambushed in the swamp and screams and flees and gets stabbed. And they tossed her stuff while she was escaping and she didn't notice. And they stole her ring while she was sleeping. And she didn't catch them in time. She went from prancing down the face of a building and trying to fight with an arrow in her shoulder to crashing into a bush during her stealthy sneak attack assuming stealth must have been the reason she ditched the horse and followed them on foot. She seemed much more capable at the beginning.".

	schema:reviewBody "Writerdirector Roland Joffe recreates two entirely different and breathtaking worlds an underwater world with a shipwreck and the British Raj. Yet despite the elegant cinematography The Lovers was a terrible bore. The problem with this movie is not that the plot amounts to a preposterous love story with the moral being that uniting two rings together will reunite two lovers. Rather the chemistry between Jay Fennel Josh Hartnett and Laura Fennel Tamsin Egerton and James Stewart Josh Hartnett and Tulaia Naik Bipasha Basu was not believable at any level. As a result I could not get involved in the lives of any of the film's characters. Roland Joffe has made great films in the past such as The Killing Fields 1984 but he has lost his way as a filmmaker since then. The Lovers sadly exemplifies the continued decline of this once greater director. Aside from the absence of compelling human stories Joffe makes a number of other mistakes. There are intricate subplots about Indian princely rivalries and the British East India Company's political intrigues without any explanation as to why they are important to this movie. Instead these subplots become loose ends which proves that Joffe and the film editors are unable to organize the film's subject matter into a coherent and involving story. This movie also has more than a few action sequences but they fail to generate any excitement or suspense because the characters who were in danger did not inspire much sympathy. The same holds true for many of the movie's smaller details including Dolly's whisky drinking which seems strangely out of place. Apparently there were significant delays over this movie's release because of editing difficulties. Yet having watching the final product I think The Lovers is one of those movies that should not be released at all.".

Going in I was excited as a lifelong Disney fan but also expecting a somewhat cheesy goodvsevil type of movie based on what I had seen in the trailer. I couldn't have been more wrong! Angelina Jolie delivers an amazing performance and makes a wellknown previously rather one dimensional Disney villain relateable and more sympathetic while also managing to look like a convincing gorgeous magical creature.The CGI is a tad heavy and a little freaky at times such as the three coloured pixiesAunts but was used in combination with some amazing sets to create a fantastic world and creatures which were reminiscent of the beautiful and imaginative work in movies such as Hellboy 2 and Pan's Labyrinth. The effort by the art team here really helps to draw you into Maleficent's world at the beginning of the movie and makes you wish you were a kid growing up with this movie as fodder for your imagination.Although Maleficent's character has been humanised in this retelling the story really emphasises that she isn't human at all and explores the ins and outs of her life and how she relates to the humans she encounters.The plot for this movie really fits into the current trend of exploring the antihero Breaking Bad Hannibal... and shows that Disney is trying to break with its past depiction of characters being black and white good or evil etc.I feel like I am gushing over this film but as a Disney classic lover I have been truly impressed by what is sure to be a new favourite with kids and adults equally. I do expect some controversy over parts of the film but I won't discuss those here.".

It's about how to survive that type of horrific evil without becoming evil yourself.

But real life is a lot messier than that.It's actually evidence of how rare it is to see women's unfiltered subjective emotional landscape portrayed on film that it seems many of the critics cannot even wrap their brains around it! No matter. This film is so sensually visually stunning and viscerally emotionally cathartic that sheer word of mouth enthusiasm is going to make this a blockbuster no matter what the critics say.And it's equally rare to see a protagonist whose inner landscape is more complex than simply extracting revenge destroying their enemies and...roll credits. People are more complicated than THAT fairy tale we are sold in every other action and adventure film that only serves to reinforce the psychopathic values of revenge and bravado.Sometimes a film is so ahead of its time that the critics are behind and so philosophically deep that it's message is incomprehensible to the more superficial among us.

But I'm glad I was wrong for I'm sure only by watching the whole movie can we truly appreciate and understand the very convincing back story and development the character was subject to. Of course with very liberal changes to the original plot the key elements that you'd look for are intact. Need I mention the perfect casting of Angelina Jolie Maleficent truly comes to life in full form by Angelina's stunning skills and presence. A twist that's not clich sentiments that are deep humor that's ever so natural and action that always keeps you at the edge of your seat! Maleficent in this movie is not exactly as we know of her from the few minutes we got to see her in the original movie but let me tell you she's every bit deliciously evil. It was amusing to see Angelina play a role that requires a lot of nuances to pull of this character with a lot of depth as opposed to the onedimensional character from the movie. Never letting off the grip she carried the movie on her shoulders. Nothing to take away from the beauty of the rest of the movie which takes breath with excellent direction and visual effects that will truly transport you to another world and the amazing work by all the 'supporting' actors. Yes the other characters weren't as fleshed out as Maleficent but I see that as good thing given the title and theme. A spectacular balance. I'd also like to bring light on the enchanting score thanks to James Newton Howard this maestro is underrated.A comprehensive movie there's a little something for audiences of all ages truly a masterpiece.".

	schema:headline " Sadly Disappointed";
	schema:reviewBody "With the release of movie adaptations of classics like Snow White and Jack and the beanstalk both of which I was highly entertained and thought it was simply amazing this movie was a sad let down. Pros Visually stunning. Angelina Jolie's performance was spot on with the most evil of classical villains we always knew. Cons The most beautiful princess Aurora looks like the girl next door. Why does Hollywood try to do that is beyond me. Mary Jane Watson Spidermans love interest is supposed to be a beautiful actress and a model. But again the movie portrays a girl next door look in ultimate Spiderman. Elle Fannig's acting was not strong and in the end not memorable in the least. It felt like she was there for the sake of being there.Sharlto Copley acting left a lot to be desired. Was he supposed to portray a loving farther and husband driven mad or a power hungry king driven insane by his overwhelming need to destroy the one creature that he could not bring himself to kill when he had the chance? If he was supposed to potray caring scenes it never really showed.  The King is portrayed as an evil man who begged for his daughters life and could have easily returned maleficent's wings but instead chose not to for reasons which are beyond anyones understanding. This is the start of where the movie just becomes a drag. Maleficent curses the child to die in the original storyline and this is the most important part in the story because of which the 3rd fairy who did not bestow a gift alters the curse by making them sleep instead of death. This part is totally lost in the movie. Watching a bunch of incompetent fairies nearly almost kill a child before the curse can take effect is as much a mystery as why maleficent would watch over the child and save it. Why the king would entrust his child to faeries whom he dislikes is also as much a mystery as why he would not send a nurse maid to care for his only child. The worst part of the movie is being subjected to watch the Princess grow to 16 years old and marvel at the beautiful fairies it feels like pointless fillers. Also when the princess realizes whats going on one day before her birthday the 3 incompetent fairies again forget to mention about what happened to Maleficents wings. The good fairies were not incompetent just funny in the original story and smart enough to hide away the princess for 16 years. Why they made them look so incompetent and negligent is beyond me.Once you get over the visuals you will realize its nothing more than a chick flick geared at young children visuals and adults who are romantically inclined. The most evil Disney villain for over 50 years reduced to nothing more than a scorned women out to seek revenge for the betrayal. A loving father reduced to nothing more than a mad evil greed driven man who plunges himself into insanity with a overwhelming urge to kill maleficent despite his daughter being returned safe and well. Many times during the movie I found myself thinking about what work I have the next day or what needs to be done. This is something I have never experienced when sitting and watching a movie on big screen completely immersed in the plot. This is a far cry from Snow White and the Huntsman which was really good barring Kristen Stewart's emo acting emotionless drawn from twilight.".

It felt like she was there for the sake of being there.Sharlto Copley acting left a lot to be desired. Was he supposed to portray a loving farther and husband driven mad or a power hungry king driven insane by his overwhelming need to destroy the one creature that he could not bring himself to kill when he had the chance? If he was supposed to potray caring scenes it never really showed.  The King is portrayed as an evil man who begged for his daughters life and could have easily returned maleficent's wings but instead chose not to for reasons which are beyond anyones understanding. This is the start of where the movie just becomes a drag. Maleficent curses the child to die in the original storyline and this is the most important part in the story because of which the 3rd fairy who did not bestow a gift alters the curse by making them sleep instead of death. This part is totally lost in the movie. Watching a bunch of incompetent fairies nearly almost kill a child before the curse can take effect is as much a mystery as why maleficent would watch over the child and save it. Why the king would entrust his child to faeries whom he dislikes is also as much a mystery as why he would not send a nurse maid to care for his only child. The worst part of the movie is being subjected to watch the Princess grow to 16 years old and marvel at the beautiful fairies it feels like pointless fillers. Also when the princess realizes whats going on one day before her birthday the 3 incompetent fairies again forget to mention about what happened to Maleficents wings. The good fairies were not incompetent just funny in the original story and smart enough to hide away the princess for 16 years. Why they made them look so incompetent and negligent is beyond me.Once you get over the visuals you will realize its nothing more than a chick flick geared at young children visuals and adults who are romantically inclined. The most evil Disney villain for over 50 years reduced to nothing more than a scorned women out to seek revenge for the betrayal. A loving father reduced to nothing more than a mad evil greed driven man who plunges himself into insanity with a overwhelming urge to kill maleficent despite his daughter being returned safe and well. Many times during the movie I found myself thinking about what work I have the next day or what needs to be done. This is something I have never experienced when sitting and watching a movie on big screen completely immersed in the plot. This is a far cry from Snow White and the Huntsman which was really good barring Kristen Stewart's emo acting emotionless drawn from twilight.";

	schema:headline " This is NOT Maleficent";
	schema:reviewBody "I was genuinely excited to hear that Disney was going to make a film about Maleficent my favorite Disney villain of all time. I was interested in knowing the 'why' behind her actions in Sleeping Beauty since we never really got to see that. I will say that the cinematography is amazing. I will also say that while Angelina Jolie was not my first choice she had the look her costume was spoton and there are moments where you can see where she is at least trying to play this role correctly and really who could replace Eleanor Audley?. But one thing I've noticed over the past 1015 years is that animation and design seem to be their main focus rather than story or character development. In the movie Maleficent's back story was incredibly rushed. So much for going into depth on why Maleficent is the way she is.This movie does not explain why Maleficent is the way she is. Disney is showing us a completely different character while giving her the same name as Disney's most iconic villain. Now they're trying to say that Maleficent is a misunderstood character who becomes evil. But that never happens. She becomes angry and bitter but not evil. Maleficent in this movie is not even a misunderstood sympathetic character. She is a total victim who never becomes evil at all.Oh she does do one evil thing she does still curse King Stefan's baby out of revenge. And she has second thoughts about it two seconds afterward. See? Not evil at all. And while I'm at it I should mention my distaste for the way she cursed Aurora Disney completely lowered the stakes by having Maleficent utter the words sleeplike death and be the one to offer the cure of True Love's kiss. No! It's MERRYWEATHER that counters the DEATH curse in order to save Aurora's life! Oh Maleficent may say later that she doesn't believe True Love exists but that's a matter of opinion isn't it? Again LOWERS THE STAKES.And what was Linda Woolverton thinking when she took King Stefan and the three fairies completely out of character and gives them a complete 180 in order to make Maleficent look good? If you're going to show us the point of view of a famous villain it's okay to give them layers and gray areas in order to make them more interesting and multi dimensional even to show they weren't always evil. But NOT to say they were never evil at all that just completely defeats the point of the character! Same with the good guys they may have their own flaws show that they have their own prejudices or that everything they did wasn't perfect. But NOT to say the good guys were really EVIL OR STUPID!The fairies Flora Fauna and Merryweather I refuse to call them by their new names are NOTHING like they were in Sleeping Beauty and this is a big deal. In Sleeping Beauty say what you will about their flaws but their ultimate motivation was keeping Aurora SAFE. At least they tried even if they failed! Maleficent 2014 portrays them as nothing more than stupid buffoons who only care about saving their own skins. Aurora was just a means to an end for them they have no relationship with her like they do in the original. The movie also took away their own personalities so they are no different from each other. I can't even keep track of which fairy has which name! Watching them on screen with everything they say or do was as cringe worthy as I expected it to be. King Stefan has to be one of worst written villains I have seen in a while. He has no real motivation for what he does we see him as having nothing in the beginning and then the movie glosses over his relationship with Maleficent in order to get to the good part where he steals her wings in order to be king. After that he wages war on Maleficent for cursing his daughter and yet he only looks at Aurora as afterthought property. Why is he even after Maleficent then? What else has she done to him other than cursing his daughter?Elle Fanning as Aurora was very impressive. I do think she gave the character more of a personality that was lacking in the original and she stole the film in every scene she was in. Unfortunately that wasn't enough to save the movie nor were Maleficent's interactions with Diaval as enjoyable as they were. And of course Maleficent does not turn into a dragon in this movie. I have to ask why Disney? You knew how loved of a villain Maleficent is and her being a dragon is one of the many reasons why. Also we live in an age where technology and special effects are abundant you didn't use the opportunity to see how your most iconic villain looks as a dragon when done with liveaction CGI? Why would you waste a perfectly good opportunity like that? Besides the fact that Maleficent is not evil in this film she also is very wimpy and pathetic. She can't do ANYTHING. When we see her fight an army at the beginning all she does is fly around and slap a few soldiers with her wings. The tree monsters did most of her fighting for her. In Sleeping Beauty she could transport herself to another place in a matter of seconds she could shoot lightning from her staff and she could transform into another form other than her own. She didn't do any of that in this movie. Just like with Alice in Wonderland Disney wasted a perfectly good opportunity to effectively adapt their animated work to the liveaction screen. Maleficent may not be the absolute worst movie I've seen but it's definitely in my bottom list now.".

Although the storyline is based around Sleeping Beauty I found it quite dark with some adult content. The CGI throughout the movie looked impressive and Angelina Jolie played her part extremely well. After being betrayed by her loved one she turns quite evil and full of hate but once Aurora comes into the picture you get to see an inner sweetness which made her character entertaining and a joy to watch. Pieced together with Sharlto Copley playing the villain this movie really did have every aspect covered and I'm not surprised that it made so much money at the box office. A Great Watch!RoundUp Angelina Jolie really doesn't make that many movies anymore but when she comes out of the woodwork she really does come out with some good movies. From Changeling to the action packed Wanted she really does have a versatile acting ethic and with all of her charitable work and her hectic family life I'm not surprised that making movies is low down on her priority list. I liked the chemistry between her character and Sam Riley who played the crow and the action scenes were very well thought out by the director. Personally I don't think that it's a movie for the young ones because there are some scenes that will give them nightmares but there are some scenes they will enjoy like her magical land and the amazing creatures. In all I'm surprised that I enjoyed the movie because I really wasn't expecting something so dark.Budget 180million Worldwide Gross 757million WOW!I recommend this movie to people who are into there Disney movies which are based on the concept of Cinderella. 710".

	schema:headline " No longer surprised as Disney continues to disappoint.";
	schema:reviewBody "Last year I made the horrible mistake of paying and wasting my time to watch Frozen in theaters because I thought it would be a great Disney classic like Tangled. Finally I can say that something good has come out of watching the overrated trash that is also known as Frozen. Thanks to my terrible experience with Disney's Frozen I read the entire plot for this movie before watching it. Thankfully I ended up saving a few bucks as it was evident that this movie like Frozen was not worth paying to watch. Maleficent was basically a nonanimated nonmusical version of Frozen. Apparently Disney ran out of ideas and decided to regurgitate the ideas from Frozen with different characters! WONDERFUL. As expected the main point was a rehash of Frozen's true love between women is better than true love between a man and woman because it sells well. After this movie I can officially say that Disney has completely lost its magic. We are now to believe that dream guys don't exist. In fact all men are either extremely evil or just stupid. What happened to the brave Prince Charming in classic Disney stories? Disney has deserted them and has decided to start making more 'realistic' movies nowadays and by 'realistic' I mean movies with strong independent females who are clearly superior to the men. Disney's recent movies make me question whether they are even supporting the concept of 'true love' or dreams anymore. I grew up in a time where little girls could dream of finding their kind and classy Prince Charming. BUT WAIT. The people at Disney had an epiphany having high expectations for guys is BAD. Instead let's encourage little girls to dream of being BFFs with a sister who ignores her for years or becoming her father's worst enemy's goddaughter instead! I'm just thankful I don't have to grow up watching these lame Disney movies.I truly find Disney's efforts in reversing its reputation of true love's kiss just pathetic. Hmm... cynicism in fairy tales? Just what we need. As a classic Disney lover count me out!Just a few comments1 Prince Phillip used to be my FAVORITE Disney prince but here I guess he's just another tool used by feminists to shove their message down our throats.2 Maleficent DOESN'T turn into a dragon. Yup you heard me. What's the point of the movie then you ask? I have no idea. Also as you have probably already guessed there's no intense battle between Prince Phillip and Maleficentasadragon either. Just splendid.3 WHY ON EARTH IS KING STEFAN THE VILLAIN? He was infatuated with Maleficent and only married Queen Leila to take over the kingdom?! What on earth has Disney come to?!?!?! This movie is an insult to Disney's Sleeping Beauty. StefanMaleficent. TeamStefanforlife4 Last but definitely not least what's up with trying to blur the line between good and evil? Yes Frozen I'm also looking at you. This is by far my biggest issue with recent Disney movies. I'm sure Walt Disney is rolling in his grave. Actually since he was cremated perhaps I should say that his ashes are turning in his burial plot? Either way you get the idea.Of all the stirring legends of the triumph of good over evil none has ever been so inspirational to me as Sleeping Beauty.  Walt DisneyI hate to say it but Disney is dead. Walt Disney however will forever live on in our hearts.".

	schema:reviewBody "Let me start by saying that Maleficent has been a personal favorite of mine when it comes to Disney villains. Throughout her many interpretations she has simply been Evil yes with a capital E. So forgive me if this review is a bit of a rant.In this adaptation she is reinterpreted as a good fairy because she's apparently not a human sorceress anymore? that simply has a hissyfit. She is certainly not evil  just angry for a little while. She even ends up becoming a Godmother??Even King Stephen's character is butchered. Why does he go insane over her? If he were really the bad guy why wouldn't he have killed Maleficent when he had the chance? What possible reason does he have for being indifferent about the welfare of his daughter?Speaking of Aurora it's worth mentioning that she is relatively alright but still not too close to her original character. A petty aesthetic thing about her is that her hair and eyebrows are not the same color which is really distracting. Additionally they rehash the concept from Frozen which is that 'True Love' doesn't have to be from some man. If this trend continues from Disney all we'll see is sisterlyGodmotherlyfamily love movies where Romance is thrown out the window because it apparently doesn't end with a happily ever after anymore.Overall this film was simply horrible if you respected Maleficent as a villain. If you did like Maleficent as she was I don't recommend seeing this movie. Even if you like the idea of there being no such thing as Evil I urge you not to see this movie. Don't support the people who made it.".

	schema:headline " The trailers lied...Disney should be sued for false advertising!";
	schema:reviewBody "Spoliers may be listed belowMaleficent is a an iconic villainous role. She is one of Disney's best characters cast from the dark side and when I saw the trailer I succumbed to the beauty they inlaid using Jolie as the sinister evil fairy. I was seduced to believing that I would be lured into a world of evil and treachery. I wanted to see how evil was born and vengeance would be enacted. I wanted to be able to bond with this evil force and be drawn deep into darkness rooting for the bad girl. I knew it would be filled with beautiful scenes and Disney magic but what I did not anticipate that the greatest treachery would be the film itself. Jolie can most definitely embrace evil and the moments when she is allowed to succumb to the full force of Maleficent it is beautiful. Once you add in Goldie Locks however you get a recipe for disaster. Suddenly I might as well be in a world of pink pixie dust leprechauns and unicorns because this beautiful villain is disgraced into playing a role of a misunderstood black hearted fairy who really loved the doe eyed giggling Aurora. Hell hath no fury than a woman scorned this should have been the driving force behind the film. The beginning scenes of a youthful Maleficent should have been nixed to allow more time to build a love story that was even remotely believable. To fall from grace the betrayal has to be tangible and dripping with poison. It must be something more than just a monologue infatuation and stolen wings. They said years passed and yet I felt nothing of a bond or great love that would give birth to Maleficent's destiny.In Disney's Rapunzel the mother figure who raised Rapunzel from a baby never fell in love with the child as a daughter. She was still greedy evil and dedicated to her path. So why must the world's most wonderful villain turn to a soft hearted Godmother of a vapid child. I know Disney is trending this don't bet on the prince idea and that's fine I support that but really...they thought this was no truer love. If they think the king suffered by simply being tortured with the countdown till his child's demise then they are sadly mistaken. That was child's play. A woman changed by betrayal to the dark side has more ideas in her playbook that can make a man suffer. Madness would have been the king knowing that Maleficent knew the entire time where Aurora was hiding. Maleficent should have been sending him snippets of hair or visions of his daughter with the raven peering down at him while he slept. He should have been physically and mentally destroyed a raving lunatic. I would have rather liked to see a double treachery in the story. That only the raven knew all along where Aurora was and hid it from his mistress. We could watch the anger burn and grow within Maleficent because she wasn't able to find the child for 16 years. That in the interim the raven would randomly turn into human form and it would have been those two that fell in love and the tragic day that Maleficent discovers her location through some fool's errand played by the three dopey fairies guarding her absconds with the child and let's the curse play out its course. Then I would have a mega battle scene at the edge of the forest against the king let her have her righteous moment when she takes his life all the while the king knowing his daughter is stuck in endless slumber with no hope of her being saved. Then during the battle the raven after escaping the battlefield leaves Maleficent's side to try and wake Aurora. When Maleficent discovers her minion's treachery the pain and anger at being betrayed for a second time by her own kind would fill her from the pit of her stomach up through her spine and a black fire filling her eyes transforming to the great dragon and an epic battle of good and evil which will lead to her glorious death! That would have at least been something!Then they could have there happier ever after. Then all those still shots of Maleficent looking like a falling angel in the glimmering sunlight would have been more picturesque more visually twisted. Overall I feel I paid 15 dollars for another movie funded by the Prozac and Xanax manufacturers that spread fallacies that evil fairies are really good vampires are not evil blood suckers and werewolves make great best friends. It's a snooze and a travesty. If you love the traditional iconic role of Maleficent remain in darkness and forget the lies the trailer told you for the glorious black dragon is covered in daffodils and pink tutus in this film.".

The trailers for the film really give the film a dark tone however the actual film has many light Disney moments. I highly recommend this film and the 3d is worth paying a bit extra!".

	schema:headline " Nothing new to see here folks.";
	schema:reviewBody "Maleficent is the very first movie in my long list of movies that I have seen that I wanted to walk out of.Lets start with the positives. Angelina Jolie was incredible. She was beautiful she was strong and she executed Maleficent beautifully. Her relationship with Aurora was refreshing and.... Nice. The magical world was something that has been seen on movies like bridge to terabithia but it was still beautiful and engaging.But all of this does not save the movie. I expected to walk in and see a movie similar to wicked where we get a better understanding of the bad guy. Yes us understanding the bad guy does not excuse what they have done but we can see where they come from. In the musical Wicked and even in the movie great and powerful Oz we have sympathy for the character we previously viewed as the bad guy. We could see where she was coming from. In those adaptations nobody truly ended up becoming the bad guy. Most were victims of circumstances. In Maleficent? It was ferngullyAvatar all over again. Magical people good! Man BAAAAAAD! Instead of giving depth to all the characters that previously were left rather flat and on the background on the original sleeping beauty suddenly the king has been reduced to this one dimensional villain that created the evil Maleficent and later on becomes obsessed with killing her! He was given NO aspects that would make us have even the tiniest bit of sympathy not the smallest bit of understanding. He was just a vile man that broke Maleficents heart mutilated her and cared only for power. Even when he tried to protect his daughter it was made appear more like he was protecting his property rather than a person he loved. Yes he graveled for her for a bit begging Maleficent not to curse her but that was it. The movie left all traces of the good of the humanity from it. OK it had some of the good of humanity but the only human that was portrayed as good was Aurora.The movie tried to portray the three fairies as the comic relief but ended up just portraying them as idiots incompetent selfish creatures. The fairies in the original Disney movie were clumsy and unused to taking care of a child but they were like that because for the first time in their lives they could not rely on their magic to achieve things in life. If were as modern people were thrown in to the middle of the woods and had to do everything by hand then yes we would be as lost as they were. But they were given 16 years to evolve to learn and to grow. But no. The fairies were not given even the smallest of story arc in this movie. They were creatures that switched sides when ever it benefited the movie.I mentioned before that I liked the relationship that Maleficent and Aurora had in the movie but even that was shattered later on in the movie. The solution to the problem was not a surprise at all. It was taken straight out of Frozen. It was refreshing and incredible when Frozen did it because it was the first time Disney did not use the age old solution of a man being the one delivering the kiss of true love but when the same solution the same realization is done in a movie that came out within year of each other? It is boring and in no way exiting it is in no way entertaining. We have learned NOTHING new. Is this Disney's new approach in relationship? Love between man and a woman is obsolete but the love between girl family kind of love not lesbian kids apparently can't handle that and also family excludes male family members at this moment as well only women can feel true love!is the strongest of all the loves in this world.In the end the movie basically told the audience yeah the moviestory that has been told for decades is actually a propaganda and I should know because I am Queen Aurora and I was there all along! The original Sleeping Beauty was rather black and white good VS.. Evil. When I walked in to the theatre I expected the lines to be blurred to be thought all stories have two sides not all of our actions are blatantly good OR evil but instead the writers and directors and what nots decided to make the line between good and evil even more visible. The good creatures are good no matter what they do and the bad humans are bad and rotten all the way.In conclusion The movie might have given some depth to a villain that previously had been left as a rather one dimensional character but in exchange they created a new one dimensional villain just switching the genders around. The worlds was beautiful and the lead actress was amazing but even she could not save this rehash of a movie in the end.".

	schema:headline " A superb fantasy film which I recommend to all.";
	schema:reviewBody "As a man who prefers science fiction to fantasy I was pleasantly surprised by this superb film. It is a reimagining of the classic fairy tale 'sleeping beauty' at least I think so as I have never read the original tale in the original language and it may be that the Disney version with which we are all familiar is in fact a reimagining. The film is superbly directed finely scripted well acted and is a joy to watch. The special effects are excellent but are not overused. They are there when needed and are spectacular creating a magical world we can all appreciate. However the thrust of the film is the changing relationships between the main characters which are sometimes surprising and key to the story. Preconceptions from the accepted version of this story are overturned and the altered relationships between the core characters provide a satisfying basis for a reappraisal of the whole concept of the story. This is a film that everyone should see because I believe that almost everyone will enjoy it. I have no hesitation in recommending this to all viewers of all ages.".

It is a reimagining of the classic fairy tale 'sleeping beauty' at least I think so as I have never read the original tale in the original language and it may be that the Disney version with which we are all familiar is in fact a reimagining. The film is superbly directed finely scripted well acted and is a joy to watch. The special effects are excellent but are not overused. They are there when needed and are spectacular creating a magical world we can all appreciate.

First why is King Stefan evil? why did he send Aurora to live with the three fairies until she is 16? is he crazy? the curse stated that she will go into a sleep like death when she is 16 so why the hell will he send his daughter away all those years and never even visit her? he could have made her live with them until she is 16 and protected her in the castle or told the fairies to come and protect her on that day.and coming to the fairies they portray them as idiots! the good fairies are idiots? and Prince Philip is not the true love of Aurora? what nonsense! finally the motherly kiss of Maleficent lifts the curse? she put it on in the first place!and finally Maleficent kills Stefan Aurora's father and Aurora is happy about that? what the hell?Really a silly movie I gave it 210 just because of the CGI which Hollywood seem to think that this will save all movies not good writing and casting!".

Recently Disney has been releasing films that whether the public chooses to acknowledge it or not have been paintbynumbers at best. Films like The Lone Ranger Thor The Dark World and Frozen. Yes Frozen. It's the same Disney crap you've seen over and over people. Don't get me wrong I LOVE Disney. But not THIS Disney... one that would butcher one of its own beloved fairy tales to make a quick buck. Yes you heard right. Disney did stoop that low. I should have known that this film would be garbage from the getgo when they hired Alice in Wonderland writer Melissa Woolverton to pen the screenplay and Alice in Wonderland production designer Robert Stromberg to direct Are you sensing a pattern here? Let's touch on that for a moment The Mouse House in its infinite wisdom got a PRODUCTION DESIGNERVFX SUPERVISOR WHO HAD NEVER DIRECTED ANYTHING TO DIRECT THEIR 200 MILLION BLOCKBUSTER. As a result Maleficent's beautiful visuals carry no weight and the actors for the most part seem utterly lost. Because what the hell would a set designer know about directing actors? Even Angelina Jolie can't pull off her real emotional scenes because she is left to direct herself. What really sank this movie for me was Disney blatantly ripping themselves off and using the true love twist from Frozen. Literally THE EXACT SAME TWIST. I have no problem with Disney creating a strong independent heroine... but if you're going to do that Don't have your heroine wear a skintight leather black cat suit in the climax of your movie! In short Disney has definitely lost its magic and it's going to be tough to get it back. Don't listen to the positive reviews. Remember how glowing Alice in Wonderland's were when it first came out? You have been warned.".

It ends up looking like a beloved Disney film that has been changed for the sake of young girls who is only a little part of the audience avoiding simple but effective scares and risks basically throwing out what many Disney fans remember about Sleeping Beauty. Parts of the film echoes parts of Wicked and Frozen. Of course most people don't rush into romantic relationships but seeing Disney seemingly apologise for making traditional relationships in past films happen even though this is what happened in the era the film is set is just horrid. I mean no offence to Frozen at all since it is one of my most favourite Disney films of all time. But stealing the concept of real true love from Frozen is pathetic.

	schema:headline " This movie is an embarrassment for Disney.";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie fails to show why a remake was necessary. It fails to bring the morals of the old movie into the modern world and it fails to develop the characters overall. It also shows a disappointing amount of visual inconsistency just to promote one Hollywood Star. The femalefemalerelationship as central point rather than the male femalerelationship is nothing new since Frozen. In fact Prince Philip who is even more onedimensional than his cartoonversion is still there at the end to be the one and only. Considering how easy this film avoids any conversational aspects between Aurora's real parents and adoptive parents just shows that plot development and modern problems were not what the writers thought about. Aurora's mother dies offscreen and nobody not her husband not her daughter ever seem to take any notice. Just to avoid any problems between the two mother figures in this movie.Not only the Queen and the young Prince are loosing screentime and depth the three good fairies in the Original had personalities while they are now only a bunch of annoying and incompetent additions for the sake of obvious humor. The third fairy never actually was able to give her wish. The movie never explains this plot whole. Maleficent is a movie starring a cartoonist version of Angelina Jolie in a movie about Angelina Jolie. No character apart from her has been developed with any love or thought. They are all background for more Angelina Jolie. Overall I am deeply disappointed. If you compare the old Sleeping Beauty with the new movie you can see the Disney tendency to go from timeless movies to something that looks great but communicates nothing. Don't watch it with your children they will not learn more than what they can get from the old movies. Don't watch it for the sake of nostalgia because it's unable to provide the same quality it used to before 3D was able to overcome any plot wholes. And don't watch it for the sake of crafty 3D. The same expected shots of flying sunsets and growing plants are used over and over again. You will get tired of seeing the same overly perfect shot repetitively.".

It's nice to see a maternal relationship between Maleficent and Aurora but it makes no sense compared to the original storyline.2. The few minutes of screen time we have for the 3 fairy godmothers are enjoyable.3. The relationship between Maleficent and her ravenlike servant is entertaining at times.4. It's nice to see that Prince Philip as poorly as he is casted doesn't just get to have the princess at the end of the story. Again though this makes no sense compared to the original.Now the bad...1. The backstory of how Maleficent becomes evil and vengeful before Aurora's coronation misleads the audience into thinking that the Aurora part of the story will have some kind of connected flow to the original. It clearly doesn't.a. In the original a major conflict is Maleficent's inability to locate Aurora's sanctuary in the forest. In this adaptation Maleficent finds her right away. So much for the 16thbirthday suspense in the original.b. King Stephan quickly but very inexplicably devolves from a father to a tyrant in the new movie. If his longlost daughter returns to him after 16 years of exile wouldn't he be a little happier to see her and not just lock her away a la Rapunzel in a castle room?c. The forestmeeting between Prince Phillip and Aurora makes much more sense in the original. He was at her coronation and knows once upon a dream that they will be together. In this newer adaption he just finds her by getting lost in the forest. How can he do that when Maleficinet has placed an impenetrable thornbushwall around the entire Moorsland which even the king's best guards can't enter?d. Maleficent's magic can put anyone to sleep on a moment's notice. Why then when she is freed from the iron net in the castlebattle does she not place a quick spell upon the king and guards once she arises by replaced wings to escape them more easily?e. She also has a perfect opportunity to create her goblinlike guards from the original from the soldiers who try to burn down her thornbushwall but that would then of course require her to actually use them to help her find Aurora as in the original. These guards work well on a comicrelief level in the original but no need for them here?2. Teenage Aurora arguably looks and sings much more like an adult in the original but the new casting choice for Aurora looks and sounds much more juvenile than that. If the Once Upon a Dream song and dance is such an iconic part of the original Disney really misses that opportunity by poor casting here. The girl doesn't sing nor dance.3. Again very minimal screen time is given to the 3 fairy godmothers. If they are the protectors of Aurora in the original and are the most entertaining ones in the story remember the pink blue battles? why on earth do they get such little inclusion here? It just becomes a dramatic convenience for Aurora to feel closer to Maleficent as her actual fairy godmother I guess. Cute idea but too far from the original.4. I should leave a Disney movie or at least a Disney adaptation feeling nostalgic for and still connected to the original not disappointed that the adaptation is so far removed from the original storyline. Maybe the filmmakers are hoping for an audience who hasn't seen the original Sleeping Beauty and who will therefore be too naive to notice the difference. However they could have done a much better job with the storyline's logic the casting choices and the overall connectedness to make the audience feel that investing in or looking back at the original would be a happy and fun thing to do not a personal mission to prove to themselves why you still can't beat the original.".

	schema:headline " A story with a serious identity crisis";
	schema:reviewBody "Sleeping Beauty is indeed a very old story one that was originally created by the Brothers Grimm. This story on the other hand is one that tries to give a new take on the traditional telling of Sleeping Beauty. Does it succeed? You can decide...I on the other hand was left very confused on what this story was trying to accomplish. I completely understand the angle of not needing to have the young prince coming in and saving the day but to have the villain or a least the villain from the Disney classic version of the filmbe the hero seems kind of odd to me. If she isn't at all bad which is what this film is trying to say then what is she. In this fairy tale world what is her purpose then? This very quickly came off as a female empowerment film in practically every aspect of the story. She doesn't need a man to save her at the end. Maleficent doesn't need the love a man to raise Aurora this motherless child. All Aurora really needed was the unconditional love of another women like Maleficent. Men are the real bad guys right? That's why they're called Bad guys not Bad Women. Anyway I digress so is this story trying dismiss the original story of Sleeping Beauty? Was there something wrong with the original story that this new telling needed to correct? Is this the new direction Disney wants to go down? The Wicked Stepmother was really just a product of her husband and she has learned that from seeing Cinderella grow up to become a great. Let's see the perspective of the hunters from Bambi to show the family that they were planning on feeding with the deers.What I'm trying to say is that I don't know what this story is trying to accomplish by being retold in this manner. The only reason I can figure out is that Disney is doing everything humanly possible to make sure their image is as squeaky clean as possible. By human two POV's of their stories there is no way that they can be described as dark in any way. This is very problematic to me in a very important way. A film like this makes it seem like all evil needs to be given a chance explain itself. This is confusing. Their needs to be an evil in the story especially for a fairy tale such as this one. Evil must exist to realize there is a battle between good and evil. the point is completely taken away when you show that the side that was evil wasn't actually evil at all. I mean she did one evil thing in the movie and immediately regretted it. In this sense we could say that every villain can be redone as long as they felt really bad about it afterwords.You might notice that I didn't mention the acting or the visual effects. That's because the story seemed so overwhelmingly problematic that it felt wasted on such an awful story. I'm sure I'll get flack for having these feelings towards the film but whatever. If you enjoyed it then congratulations you did something I couldn't do.".

	onyx:emotionText "Sleeping Beauty is indeed a very old story one that was originally created by the Brothers Grimm. This story on the other hand is one that tries to give a new take on the traditional telling of Sleeping Beauty. Does it succeed? You can decide...I on the other hand was left very confused on what this story was trying to accomplish. I completely understand the angle of not needing to have the young prince coming in and saving the day but to have the villain or a least the villain from the Disney classic version of the filmbe the hero seems kind of odd to me. If she isn't at all bad which is what this film is trying to say then what is she. In this fairy tale world what is her purpose then? This very quickly came off as a female empowerment film in practically every aspect of the story. She doesn't need a man to save her at the end. Maleficent doesn't need the love a man to raise Aurora this motherless child. All Aurora really needed was the unconditional love of another women like Maleficent. Men are the real bad guys right? That's why they're called Bad guys not Bad Women. Anyway I digress so is this story trying dismiss the original story of Sleeping Beauty? Was there something wrong with the original story that this new telling needed to correct? Is this the new direction Disney wants to go down? The Wicked Stepmother was really just a product of her husband and she has learned that from seeing Cinderella grow up to become a great.

	schema:reviewBody "I am a Disney fan. A pure Disney fan. Currently I have taken it upon myself to watch every animated feature Disney produced in preparation for going to Disney World in August. I know information about nearly every film flaws mistakes how they did certain things who voiced what parts etc. I love Disney.I love Sleeping Beauty the most of all this Disney films for one reason  the art style. It is beautiful. Eyvind Earle was phenomenal as the art director and I believe Walt's decision to create a moving tapestry as it was described created some of the most underappreciated sequences in the movie ie the opening sequence was originally going to be much more like the Belle in the opening of Beauty and the Beast and the cake baking scene with the three fairies was originally going to end in an explosion Regardless this movie touched a part of my artistic mind I'm an illustrator and opened the door for me as an artist to view the Disney films in a different light.When I heard that they were making a liveaction retelling of it from Maleficent's perspective I was elated. Learning that this was likely due to the popularity of Wicked I was even more elated. I had read the book NOT the play and had loved the treatment Elphaba received. I was only concerned at the time about one thing  how were they going to recreate the iconic artstyle in aliveaction retelling?That was the least of my concerns when exiting the theater.This retelling was not a retelling a la Wicked or even Snow White and the Huntsman it was through and through a love story akin to Frozen. In fact it WAS Frozen again  with the same twist ending that already feels clich because Disney did it in two films back to back. What's the problem? Maleficent is not Maleficent the fairies are not the fairies Phillip is shoehorned in and Stefan is the villain because despite trying to give the original villain dimension we still need a onedimensional villain. This is a lover scorned story. Maleficent is mad a Stefan so she curses his child. I put curses in quotes because she softens it so much it may as well be a bedtime story. That's right in this version SHE makes it a deathlike sleep so the fairies do nothing. Strike one. The fairies? They must have gotten the lobotomized versions of the fairies for this film who have no plan no knowledge despite being selfdescribed as good with children and no understanding of what they need to do as guardians of a child. Strike two. The movie shoehorns in Prince Phillip as a pretty boy cameo with no real purpose.Maleficent in the end turns her RAVEN into a dragon because... why? Strike three After this she is a horned catwoman in latex fighting the real villain Stefan to his death and the entire story is stupid botched and boring. Out of strikes you should die nowWhy anyone likes this movie or thinks it is not clich is beyond me. It is the epitome of clich as it is a replicated storyline from Frozen. Familial love is true love here again. What this fails to understand is what made Wicked actually INTERESTING was not the complete change of the character of the Wicked Witch but the explanation behind it. Elphaba still does all the things she ever DID do in the canon of the stories and the movie. She is angry at Dorothy for killing her sister and taking the shoes. Without context and from Doroty's perspective she seems evil. From HER perspective and WITH context it's not less WRONG that she's mad at Dorothy but you understand why she IS. At the core you must not change the actions the character makes in explaining how the character was not so evil without completely changing the reasons WHY the character was then called evil negating the reason for the original story or the retelling altogether.".

	schema:headline " Large scale historical political thriller";
	schema:reviewBody "The Piazza Fontana  The Italian Conspiracy Italy has always been a turbulent country politically. After all this is the country that gave us Machiavelli wrote the textbook for manipulating power and for scheming in politics. It is also a country which has had its fair share of extraparliamentary and street politics. All this forms the backdrop to director Marco Tullio Giordana's highly accomplished political thriller the Piazza Fontana. The film is set in the period at the very end of the 1960's. This is the time of the Marxist and anarchist revolutionary Red Brigades who are busy blowing up banks and official residences in an attempt to bring down the state. They are matched on the other end of the political spectrum by right wingers who want to resurrect the Fascism of the Mussolini era and who add to the confusion by infiltrating the left wing cells. What should be managing all this is the liberal state but it is weak in the era and it is afraid that the centre cannot hold. Giordana brings these large abstract forces into human focus by skillful use of strong central characters and by keeping the balance between action scenes there is a brilliantlyfilmed opening riot sequence and political ruminations. We follow the lives of all the players in the situation from the trouble investigator through the Anarchist cells and the politicians in their grand offices. Some of the parts are characters created for the drama but historical figures are also portrayed such as Aldo Moro Fabrizio Gifuni who of course came to a sticky end at the hands of the terrorists a few years after the period covered in this film. That is one of the problems of covering real events and over such a long span. The film has to rely on lots of captions to resolve the narrative which feels unsatisfactory compared to dramatizing it. Nevertheless this is much more than just a history lesson. It is full of well acted tense dialogueheavy scenes that draw us in. In that sense it has a passing resemblance to the recent Tinker Tailor Solider Spy. This film even adopts a slightly similar lighting scheme and palette with its steely blues and greys and its claustrophobic scenes in darkened rooms. The subject matter is fascinating but even if you don't know or care about Italian politics this is a gripping and very well made film.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie changed my life. It changed it in the sense that after seeing it I developed a lifelong passion for Italian films after first seeing it in 1955 when it appeared at a local movie theatre in a revival five years or so after its original appearance. I was only 13 at the time and somewhat of a precocious chooser of what films to go see. I have seen THE BICYCLE THIEF Bicycle Thieves in England and plural as well in its original Italian title hundreds of times since and never tire of it. The fact that the film has almost never been out of circulation since its making and is constantly shown in revivals festivals and film classes attests to its endurance. Martin Scorsese does a glorious appreciation of it in his documentary on the Italian cinema IL MIO VIAGGIO IN ITALIA. What makes it so enduring? What is so damn great about the movie? It is not its trenchant portrayal of postwar Italian poverty and misery. Lots of films did that even better. It is not in any sense of real drama which is very schematic. Nor even the unforgettably truthful acting that iconic face of pintsized Enzo Staiola. We get truthful acting and iconic faces all over the place. It is I believe its sense of compassion its sense of poetry. Those are rarer qualities. The movie is compassionate poetry. I don't know if writer Cesare Zavattini or director Vittorio De Sica would have appreciated that phrase. I feel they might have. I feel it is exactly the truth they were after. To be sure the film is a story of father and littleboy in search of what is lost a necessity yes but also a lost dream. The endangered hope for a better life to come challenges this paternalfilial relationship. In that sense this is a filmpoem God help me about Everyfather and Everylittleboy. The most chilling moment in the poem occurs when little Bruno sees his father steal and a tearful horror glazes his face as a god seems to collapse. The most redemptive moment comes shortly thereafter when the boy slips his hand into his father's. That forgiveness is not cheap or facile. It is unassailable and allcomforting. It is a forgiving embrace of Virgilian dignity. For a magnificent instant the father Antonio has become the son Bruno the son has become the father. At the end when they walk off into the Roman crowd they are as one. I have written many thoughts about this film over the years including an extended exegesis for a local newspaper. I have programmed it in film series shown it to film classes Italian classes. I know the movie. Friends the movie is not about stolen bicycles indifferent police bicycle chopshop gargoyles mouthfoaming lowlife desperate actions by the desperate or mere journalistic human interest that is gone with tomorrow's edition. Its worth resides in its lyric portrayal of the eternal curative power of love. No small thing.Two addenda the song being rehearsed at the workers' club Antonio visits to see his friend is called Ciccio Formaggio. The song being sung and played by the restaurant musicians when Antonio and his son eat together is Tummuriata nera about the mulatto offspring of an Italian woman and a black soldier. The lyrics for both songs in Neapolitan dialect can be found by Googling the titles. Recordings by Roberto Murolo of both songs are available.".

It follows one economically distraught man Lamberto Maggiorani who is heading down a desperate path fast. Things look up when he gets a job putting posters on walls in town but he must sell what few meager possessions he and his family have to buy a bicycle to uphold his end of the business bargain. Naturally tragedy strikes immediately as the title character shows up the very first day Maggiorani is on the job. The police are little help believing the bicycle is not as important as it really is. Thus Maggiorani and young son Enzo Staiola take it upon themselves to look all over town to try and find the bicycle and bring the thief to justice. The Bicycle Thief was originally released in 1948 and won an Honorary Academy Award for Best Foreign Language film the following year the movie was not released in the U.S. until 1949. It is still a production that strikes deep even today. The lengths and desperate measures that some go through is very evident here. Director Vittorio De Sica crafts a film that is much deeper than it appears on the surface. It examines the human condition and questions society family law enforcement alliances and mental anguish perfectly. The Bicycle Thief is an excellent production that has aged well and allows the viewer to think about many subjects that go beyond ordinary cinematic depths. 5 stars out of 5.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Italian neorealist film movement began around the end of WWII with Roberto Rossellini's OPEN CITY in 1946.  It is defined and encapsulated by this striking film directed by Vittorio De Sica.  THE BICYCLE THIEF is the best of a group of films that depicted the hardship and despair that Europeans specifically Italians went through after the death and destruction of the war.  The economy was horrible and the towns and cities were halfdestroyed and decaying.  Rome is the location for THE BICYCLE THIEF and De Sica shoots the city in grainy black and white with nonprofessional actors to get a simple yet unbearingly emotional point across.  A simple thing such as a bike can be someone's entire world at that time and losing it means doing something irrational or perhaps necessary.The lead in the film is played by Lamberto Maggiorani who seems to be a very good actor.  He is not an actor however and maybe this is why the film hits its mark so well and comes across so realistically.  Maggiorani is of this difficult world and his brooding face is a clear indication of this. His job is to plaster film posters up on the walls of buildings all over Rome.  He even hangs a picture that symbolizes the absolute opposite of the misery surrounding him.  Rita Hayworth from GILDA is on the walls all over the city a sign of joy to some a representation of their own lowly status to others.When the bicycle is actually stolen the title character is sought after by Maggiorani and his young son Enzo Staiola a little kid with so much acting ability you swear this must be a documentary.  A grueling search throughout Rome has the essential parts of the movie because we see up close the actual people and places the neorealist film movement came to represent.  It is a small sad world they live in and the bike has to be found so that they can live.  The father is put to the ultimate test in front of his son.  Will he do the honorable thing or will he do what his mind and heart know is only possible? These are the tense moments of the film's climax.There is a lot of THE BICYCLE THIEF in Benigni's LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL and some obvious comparisons have been drawn because of the fatherson relationship. They are worthy of comparison and have equal artistic prowess.  What is different about THIEF is the level of intensity maintained throughout.  I felt the key element was the music by Alessandro Cicognini a simple horn that plays so tragically that it is a main character in the picture.  What De Sica does here as well as other neorealist directors Rossellini Fellini is create for American audiences a powerful counterpoint to what we are used to.  An honest noncorporate portrait of the struggle for life and selfrespect.  THE BICYCLE THIEF is one of the finest films ever made.RATING 10 of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "Some films try to explain multiple aspects of a story or a character by showing several episodes from the character's life. Vittorio De Sica's masterful The Bicycle Thief relies on the power of simplicity to drive home its point. It is a very simple film relying on film making at its basics. There are no professional actors for us to identify with but there are plot lines emotions and thoughts that no one can help but relate to. Antonio Ricci Lamberto Maggiorani has been waiting for a job but when one finally arrives he must obtain a bicycle in order to be able to accept the position. His loving and caring wife Maria Lianella Carell hocks the bed sheets in order to be able to afford a bicycle for Antonio. He reports to work as a poster hanger but while on the job for only a short time the bike is stolen by a young thief Vittorio Antonucci. Desperate to get the vehicle back Antonio seeks the aid of his friend Baiocco Gino Saltamerenda and also receives the help of his devoted son Bruno Enzo Staiola. Bruno stays by Antonio's side no matter what determined to help his father get back the stolen property. It is a frustrating journey for the father and son as they receive no help except that of Baiocco. It seems that no matter what they do Antonio is left with a fateful decision shown in one of the most brutally honest scenes in any movie I've ever seen. He must ask himself just how far would he go to put food on the table for his family that he loves so much? There has been controversy over the ending of the film which I am not going to go into because it would be cheating you out of a brilliant ending to an extraordinary picture. However I will say this much  When viewing The Bicycle Thief ask yourself what you would do in Antonio's situation. What choices would you make? Some of the questions that rise from this film are some of the questions that help us to define ourselves as people and the fact that this film provides such a clear and honest representation of so many facts of life is what makes it an undeniable masterpiece! This is a film to be cherished!".

Antonio Ricci Lamberto Maggiorani has been waiting for a job but when one finally arrives he must obtain a bicycle in order to be able to accept the position. His loving and caring wife Maria Lianella Carell hocks the bed sheets in order to be able to afford a bicycle for Antonio. He reports to work as a poster hanger but while on the job for only a short time the bike is stolen by a young thief Vittorio Antonucci. Desperate to get the vehicle back Antonio seeks the aid of his friend Baiocco Gino Saltamerenda and also receives the help of his devoted son Bruno Enzo Staiola. Bruno stays by Antonio's side no matter what determined to help his father get back the stolen property. It is a frustrating journey for the father and son as they receive no help except that of Baiocco. It seems that no matter what they do Antonio is left with a fateful decision shown in one of the most brutally honest scenes in any movie I've ever seen. He must ask himself just how far would he go to put food on the table for his family that he loves so much? There has been controversy over the ending of the film which I am not going to go into because it would be cheating you out of a brilliant ending to an extraordinary picture. However I will say this much  When viewing The Bicycle Thief ask yourself what you would do in Antonio's situation. What choices would you make? Some of the questions that rise from this film are some of the questions that help us to define ourselves as people and the fact that this film provides such a clear and honest representation of so many facts of life is what makes it an undeniable masterpiece! This is a film to be cherished!";

It has been hailed as a masterpiece for just short of sixty years and has been routinely studied in film classes everywhere. In a sense it is one of the recognized masterpieces of cinema. And yet this is not a film in which to pick up obviously great shots like the 360 degree shot in the hotel room in Vertigo or cuts as good as the jump cut in 2001 A Space Odyssey with which Kubrick transports you from prehistoric ages to an age in which space travel is common in barely a second. This is a subtle realistic film and though it looks terrific it is not flashy. It exists not to excel technically or tell the story of humanity but simply to tell a story. A simple story which may say more about human nature than any other film in existence.Bicycle Thieves is about a man in economically depressed postWorld War II Italy who is lucky enough to find a job which requires him to use a bicycle as transportation while putting up posters around the city. It's relatively wellpaying and almost too good to believe for his family. While on the job his bicycle is stolen and the rest of the movie tells the story of him and his son attempting to recover the bicycle. In the magnificent final scene Antonio Ricci the lead character finds himself tempted to steal a bicycle in order to be able to perform his job. Here we have our 'hero' thinking about doing to someone else what was done to him. There is no black and white in the world no good and evil. This film does a great job of stating that fact without moralizing and preaching like so many modern films do. This film does not insult your intelligence and I pity those who wanted a third act or those who wanted more explanation. This film is beautiful and brilliant because it is completely understated. It's realistic. We feel Ricci's desperation and are transported into 1940's Rome as he makes his way through the city's crowded streets alleyways churches and brothels.I have no idea how much this film cost to make but I would be surprised if it was made on a low budget. The location shooting throughout the city is impressive as is the again understated cinematography. De Sica cast nonactors in the lead roles and I find their performances to be among the most realistic and effective I've ever seen. Alessandro Cigognini's score is a highlight of the film and I consider the melancholy main theme one of the greatest musical cues I've heard in any film.I enjoy theatricality as much as anyone and I certainly don't dislike Hollywood gloss but Bicycle Thieves serves as a jarring reminder of how great a medium film can be. The jarring effect the film had on audiences upon its release in particular American audiences is easy to understand viewing the film in 2007 and it escapes my comprehension how anyone can't be completely captivated and enthralled by this masterwork.4".

	schema:reviewBody "There's not much that can be said about The Bicycle Thief that hasn't already been expressed. It is considered a great work of the Italian cinema and looking at it in its 1999 release version one can see why.Structurally it's a theme and variations with such a simple clearly stated main motif that one can identify and follow its mutations with no effort.  DeSica is clearly the fine craftsman here directing every scene with a beautiful sense of control and balance. His work with young Enzo Staiola as Bruno is especially commendable and he allows then nonprofessionals Lamberto Maggiorani as Antonio and Lianella Carell as Marie to act in a model of naturalism. Carlo Montuori's photography is brilliant and Antonio Traverso's production design is pungent and atmospheric. Like most masterpieces a filmclassic score provides emotional depth in a subliminal way here it's a romantic Italianesque original composition by Aessandro Cicognini wraps up the entire production.DeSica's career is most impressive being involved in nealy 200 films 165 of them as an actor. This film remains one of his greatest achievements.  It seems to be standing the test of time very nicely too.  It's been criticized sometimes quite severely and just continues to bounce back winning new admirers with each reissue.  The public just won't let The Bicycle Thief fade away. That alone tends to override any negative factors. It looks like this film is going to be around for quite a while. ".

	schema:reviewBody "Don't get me wrong I have nothing against Lord of the Rings and I respect people's right to obsess over whatever they wish. Nonetheless it does often irritate the cynic in me that we're teaching a generation of kids that there is a distinct borderline between 'good' and 'evil' between 'justice' and 'injustice' that there exists such a thing as a 'hero' when in reality there is actually nothing of the sort.Ladri di Biciclette is a shining example of a film that demonstrates this fact. There is no distinction between the 'good guys' and the 'bad guys'. At times we support one character or the others. But there is never a line drawn between one side or the other because in reality the only people we see here are simply human  flawed corruptible and in this case all suffering the same tragic fate. Our central character Antonio is obviously the protagonist and he is obviously portrayed in such a way that our sympathies lie with him but he is far from being a hero. He is simply used as the representation of the tragic misfortune that can befall mankind. This misfortune also is not depicted in any blackandwhite sense. Antonio and his family's plight is not the only or even necessarily the most desperate in this film. In fact with the exception of the family in the restaurant scene practically every single character major or minor is portrayed as suffering in some way at the hands of capitalism.Therefore as obviously tragic as Antonio's story is the only real reason we side with him is because his particular tragedy is centrally focused. But as has been discussed so often previously he is an Everyman character. The bicycle in the film is simply used as an analogy for the loss or lack of any essential element of life that leads to poverty and suffering. In very simple terms the film's message is essentially that at some stage in life we are all shouting Give me back my bicycle! But I digress. This simplistic and amateurish film is far more real and far more truetolife than practically anything that Hollywood has churned out in the past fifty years. For that reason the realist in me believes that all those dreamers people who believe in a happy ending or ideal status quo could do with the sort of downtoearth lesson that this film represents.Yes it's a distressing and bleak vision. But nevertheless an utterly profound one.".

	schema:reviewBody "Semantically speaking selfrealization is a probable prelude to catharsis but at a much higher echelon of cognition the two become virtually inseparable as attaining the former would automatically yield the latter. At this threshold of enlightenment human spirit attains a sense of ephemeral divinity that would either drive the human crazy or would lead him to salvation. This enlightenment can seldom be attained through vicarious means. Even cinema with its unparalleled potential to stimulate and satiate mostly falls short of being cathartic and only in the rarest of the rare cases does it manage to accomplish the incredible and the extraordinary. Undoubtedly Bicycle Thieves is one such rare moment of triumph wherein cinema becomes not only the tool but also the medium for the viewer to attain eternal salvation. Bicycle Thieves is an Italian neorealist film by Vittorio De Sica. Neo realism a naturalistic movement in Italian cinema of the 1940s aimed at giving cinema a new degree of realism which promoted the use of an amateur cast visvis a professionally trained one and advocated shooting at real locations instead of the custombuilt sets  studios. Keeping up with the spirit of the movement Vittorio De Sica chose a factory fitter who had brought his son along for an audition as his male lead. His lead actress was a journalist who had approached him for an interview while the young boy was filled by a child spotted in the crowd watching the filming. Bicycle Thieves tells the story of a poor worker searching the streets of Rome for his stolen bicycle which he needs to keep his job intact. The movie is an amalgam of contrasting human feelings of hope  despair sacrifice  gratification euphoria  melancholy love  detestation and malice  benevolence. Bicycle Thieves performs the central function of art which is to discover the meaning of life. The movie brilliantly handles with utmost care and precision the tender and often painful relationship that universally exists between a father and a son. The later half of the movie presents cinema at its most vivid vituperative and volatile culminating in one of the most impactful melancholic and brutally humanistic finales ever filmed in cinematic history the agony of which would keep the viewer contemplating for weeks months or even years. The screenplay is simplistic thoughtprovoking and at times nakedly brutal while the cinematography is so effortless and magnificently beautiful that it appears as though a soul of a man has been filmed and its true essence has been captured and preserved. The poignancy of the background score casts such a sustained spell that the movie experience is enhanced beyond imagination. American playwright Arthur Miller called it a lyrical masterpiece as it examines openly the destructive and draconian world man has made for himself. Marlon Brando once said Bicycle Thieves is the perfect example of what can be done in front of the motion picture camera and is so rarely done. Academy winner Henry Fonda was so moved by the movie that he was tempted to write Vittorio De Sica a fan letter. The film is frequently on critics' and directors' lists of the best films ever made. It has captured every honor that the world of film can bestow including an Academy Honorary Award in 1950.All these accolades and the ubiquitous acclaim cannot describe the actual experience of seeing this film and becoming a part of its emotional impact. It makes the viewer laugh cry and experience a rainbow of emotions. Bicycle Thieves has withstood the test of time for over six decades and is a film for anyone and everyone.PS. It is a cinematic magnum opus which accentuates the true might of cinema and is a must for everyone irrespective of cast color creed or gender. It's an ageless cinema for people of all age groups. 1010httpwww.apotpourriofvestiges.com".

	schema:reviewBody "In the postwar Rome after more than twoyear unemployment the family man Antonio Ricci Lamberto Maggiorani finally finds a disputed job position putting up posters that requires having a bicycle. However he needs to retrieve his bicycle in the pawn shop but he does not have money. His wife Maria Lianella Carell pawns their bed sheets and uses the money to recover the precious bicycle. Antonio envisions a better life for his family with his salary overtime and benefits. Unfortunately his bicycle is stolen on the first working day. Antonio and his son Bruno Enzo Staiola spend the Sunday chasing the bicycle and the thief on the streets of Rome.Ladri di Biciclette is a heartbreaking masterpiece of the Italian Neo Realism and one of the best movies of cinema history ever. This is the third time that I watch this unforgettable film that makes me sad with the desperation of Antonio and his lack of perspective in the end. There are memorable touching scenes like Bruno eating pizza in the restaurant wearing a torn coat and contrasting with the wealthy family or the happiness of the clumsy Antonio putting up the poster of Rita Hayworth in Gilda or the indecision of Bruno between a dish of soup in the church or chasing the old man with his father or the shame of Antonio in the end. The DVD released in Brazil by Spectra Nova has good quality of image subtitles in yellow but no Extras. The DVD released by Verstil uses the same matrix of Spectra Nova but with subtitles in white and it is difficult the reading by the viewer. However there are many Extras. My vote is ten.Title Brazil Ladres de Bicicleta Thieves of Bicycle".

But while I was watching the movieLadri di Biciclette the true sensibility of the characters and of the shooting technique astonished me! The plot is simple but touching the actors react naturally. Although the times they are living are awful Antonio and Bruno lift themselves over the daily cares they do have strong characters and the father and son relationship is more than believable!!! I've never seen actors understanding each other better and I don't mean it on a stage level! The looks on their faces when they should cry but they don't the famous take when father and son are standing on the sidewalk one thinking about the other and what is left to be done! But what is most touching is the scene from the end when Bruno's look actually saves his father from prison. The man who's bike was stolen shows that some people are human even in the darkest of times.This is movie to be seen a movie that will make you wonder about the boundaries of humanity the power of a character and even dare you to think of the mistakes that society makes you commit in order to survive!!!".

	schema:headline " Poignant film";
	schema:reviewBody "Possible Spoilers One of the simplest movies ever made yet one of the most poignant. Of particular note is the title of the film which serves in retrospect to illustrate deSicca's main point. In English the singular title The Bicylce Thief causes the viewer to question who really is the bicycle thief in the movie? It is logical to conclude that the title refers to the main character whom the film closely chronicles. But to call the hopeless dejected character with whom the viewer has empathized for the entire movie a thief would be ludicrous unless by calling such a man a thief deSicca is making a more powerful commentary on an inability to define a person or his actions as absolutely good or absolutely evil the two terms are not mutually exclusive as there is a blurring between the two that occurs when other factors are considered. The title serves as a reminder that not all criminals are evil some have been motivated out of good intentions and desperation. In the end the viewer is forced to make a jarring comparison between the thief who stole the main char's bicycle and the main char himself. The irony of the situation causes the viewer to realize his own hypocrisy. Though we formerly considered the first thief to be petty and evil for ruining the main char's life we can no longer hold such a judgment of him after witnessing the main char do the same an act which the viewer considers sympathetically. The change in judgment toward the first thief which the viewer is forced to make at the film's conclusion is a reminder to the viewer that one's awareness of the circumstances governing a situation can dramatically change one's assessment of the situation. The Italian plural title Ladri di Biciclette serves to generalize the crime desperation degradation to everyman in postwar Italy. I also loved this movie for the portrayed fatherson relationship. The little boy did an excellent job in portraying a boy who attempts to act like a grown up in order to help and therefore gain the approval of his father.However by the end of the movie we are reminded that the boy is just a boy which the father seems to forget at intervals but realizes when he offers to take him for pizza etc.. The father also has a dilemma and not just that he bears the burden of providing for his family monetarily but that he must provide moral teaching and an example as well. Moreover the filial relationship serves to better illustrate the theme of blurred definitions of good and evil. The boy's blackandwhite ideas on good and evil is juxtaposed with the reality of postwar Italy in which there can not be such a clear distinction between the two termsgood people are forced to do bad acts in order to survive. The two different moral characterizations are forced to converge in the young boy himself when he witnesses his own father commit a crime. The boy is forced to grow up too soon i.e. to abandon his absolute views on good and evil in favor of the grey reality in order to grant his father forgiveness. The ending of the film illustrates that though a child may constantly seek approval and confirmation from his father the approval which a father must seek from his son though far more subtle and less obvious plays an equally important and intrinsic role in filial relationships.".

Perhaps the best film ever made. Thank God for TCM and Robert Osbourn. Together they have brought obscure masterpieces right into our living rooms so that we can discover the global genius that is film making around the world. The Bicycle Thief is about desperation in post WWII Italy. After a man wins the job lottery putting up posters of Rita Hayworth around Rome on his first day at work his only essential tool of trade his bicycle is stolen. What ensues to the end of the movie is a desperate tension filled search for the thief who stole it and ultimately the recovery of his bicycle. He is accompanied on his search by his 7 year old son. The two actors who play these roles are not professional actors and yet they turn in performances of the century. The plot points direction writing and cinematography of this masterpiece are without equal. The portrayal of the misery and desperation of those who survived WWII leaves a pit in your stomach. Most profound is the relationship between the father and son and their journey together to find his stolen bicycle so that he can make money and feed his family again. This is a movie without a climax. And that's a big part of what makes it great. The ending is something you could never imagine and will never forget once you've experienced it. I will only say one more thing about it's conclusion. There are some things more heartbreaking than the tragic loss of life. In this movie that something more heartbreaking than the tragic loss of life is the tragedy of continuing to live after you've lost everything. This is the saddest film I have ever seen and that includes Old Yeller and Where the Red Fern Grows. But it is a magnificent film and should be seen by everyone. It has left a mark on me that will never go away. And in every respect it very well could be one of the greatest film ever made.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of the best films made in Italy. While not the best movie ever it is one of the alltime greats.'Ladri di biciclette' is more than just a movie it's a way of life and what it contains is forever significant. I'm taking about its solid tragic and realistic story. Yes it's a fairly basic plot which could never be described as exciting or feelgood but that isn't and it never was a priority. No its priority is the heart and soul that was put into it.What we got here is a strongly sentimental movie and one that is very pessimistic and brings back the intense feeling of bad luck and failure.Cinematography is generally pleasant capturing a decent amount of Rome's streets and areas. To me the scenario is one of the most important things in a movie.Amazingly the cast consists in unprofessional actors but you can never tell that in the movie. If I didn't know I could easily think they were real actors. They are so authentic and dedicated that it's fairly natural to see them as normalprofessional artists.Lamberto Maggiorani's performance as Antonio Ricci is superb a prodigy nonprofessional actor.Enzo Staiola is just as splendid as Ricci's cute son Bruno. He is so expressive and genuine. The character Bruno is a loving kid who follows his daddy wherever he goes and does whatever daddy says without saying a word but that doesn't prevent him from looking tenderly at his father.The guy in the film is literally out of luck. After having been predictably unemployed for a long time he finally gets himself a job only to have his bicycle robbed in his new job's 1st day. When his bike is robbed nobody helps him or gives a damn about him aside a friend of his and Bruno. But when he is the one robbing a bike he is not only chased but caught slapped threatened and humiliated in public by an angry crowd. His one and only savinggrace in this situation is the fact that the bike's owner feels compassion on poor Bruno when he sobs.That ending is easily one of the most memorable in a film ever it's just so heartwrenching and profound.Title in Portugal 'Ladres de Bicicletas'.".

No its priority is the heart and soul that was put into it.What we got here is a strongly sentimental movie and one that is very pessimistic and brings back the intense feeling of bad luck and failure.Cinematography is generally pleasant capturing a decent amount of Rome's streets and areas. To me the scenario is one of the most important things in a movie.Amazingly the cast consists in unprofessional actors but you can never tell that in the movie. If I didn't know I could easily think they were real actors. They are so authentic and dedicated that it's fairly natural to see them as normalprofessional artists.Lamberto Maggiorani's performance as Antonio Ricci is superb a prodigy nonprofessional actor.Enzo Staiola is just as splendid as Ricci's cute son Bruno. He is so expressive and genuine. The character Bruno is a loving kid who follows his daddy wherever he goes and does whatever daddy says without saying a word but that doesn't prevent him from looking tenderly at his father.The guy in the film is literally out of luck. After having been predictably unemployed for a long time he finally gets himself a job only to have his bicycle robbed in his new job's 1st day. When his bike is robbed nobody helps him or gives a damn about him aside a friend of his and Bruno. But when he is the one robbing a bike he is not only chased but caught slapped threatened and humiliated in public by an angry crowd. His one and only savinggrace in this situation is the fact that the bike's owner feels compassion on poor Bruno when he sobs.That ending is easily one of the most memorable in a film ever it's just so heartwrenching and profound.Title in Portugal 'Ladres de Bicicletas'.";

Post WWII Italy seen from the view of the have nots where everyone struggles and there are few laughs. A family man at last is offered a job but to keep it he must show up for work with a bicycle. He had pawned his bicycle but by giving up the family linens he gets it back only to have it stolen on the first day at work. He his son and several friends go to great lengths to help the man find his stolen bicycle without results. Eventually the man resorts to becoming a bicycle thief himself.I have never seen anyone so ashamed as this man was when his son witnesses the humiliation of seeing his father caught stealing and mobbed for his offense. I was also stunned by seeing the size of the pawnshop it looked like an Amazon warehouse! as well as a bicycle fence yard that was enormous. During poor economic times pawnshops and fences seem to be the only ones flourishing.This is a stunning motion picture achievement. The poor film quality suffering considerably after some 50 years only adds to the authenticity. The Bicycle Thief is one of the finest films I have viewed. It rivals La Strada for my favorite foreign film. This film receives my highest recommendation.".

My father grew up in Boston and when we walked out of the theater he couldn't stop talking about how authentic the environment and attitude was. Then there's the acting in which the lead actors Nicholson DiCaprio Damon not only give stunningly entertaining performances but you become engulfed in each one's perspective and dilemmas. The smaller roles that of Baldwin Walberg Sheen are supporting roles that remind me of Jesus Quintana from 'The Big Lebowski' by this I mean that their screen time is limited but they make lasting impressions that you cherish each and every scene they are in Alec Baldwin especially. The story itself starts off with the basic intro of the players and the setting but you'll find yourself slowing following each and every plot twist and rooting back and forth for the good guys and for the bad guys. If you're a Scorsese fan which I am I think you will appreciate this film. You can clearly see the Scorsese touch ranging from the cinematography and of course the music it's great to hear Gimme Shelter again but Comfortably Numb played in so well. It's another gangster flick from Scorsese yet this one stands alone because feels so fresh and most would agree Scorsese does gangster films the best so why not let him. Oscar worthy the acting I certainly hope this is DiCaprio's best role since 'The Aviator' which was his best role since 'Gangs of New York' am I seeing a pattern here. But my lasting impression wasn't concerned with the politics of the golden statue my lasting impression was that I had sat through 2 and half hours of brilliant and especially entertaining storytelling. Thank you Mr. Scorsese.".

I personally prefer The Departed and I think because of one thing Martin Scorsese. This is the master behind such greats as Taxi Diver Raging Bull Goodfellas and he's at it again. The film has an all star cast with Leonardo DiCaprio Matt Damon Jack Nicholson Mark Wahlberg Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin.The Direction was amazing. maybe one of the reasons why he won the Oscar for it I loved how some of the scenes were shot and set up. Especially regarding the Chinatown and police interrogation scenes among many others. The film is perfectly set up with intense suspense scenes while adding in amounts humor at times. It works really well. The script is top notch. Also Oscar winning Realistic strong dialogue from scene to scene.Another thing I liked more in The Departed as opposed to Infernal Affairs was the acting. DiCaprio really seemed to earn a lot of respect from this role. Here he takes on the tough guy persona so well. Sure it was known he was a good actor from his Oscar nominated performances in What's Eating Gilbert Grape and The Aviator but he really takes it to another level here. I can't see anyone else as the character he fits so perfectly with it. Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg being Massachusetts natives also give solid performances with their natural accents. Nicholson works well in his role as well. Everyone was extremely solid and everything seemed so real.Set in Boston The Departed takes in all the Boston like atmosphere. Beautifully shot scenes of the Massachusetts Golden Dome State Capital building is just one part of the landscape. The Dropkick Murphys song I'm Shipping up to Boston really fits great use of songs. Scorsese usually works music into his films really well.Cops or Criminals. When you're facing a loaded gun what's the difference? This quote really represents the film. Matt Damon plays a state officer in the Police working for the crime boss of the area Frank Costello Nicholson. While Damon's character can be described as a bad guy he is really misunderstood. As a kid he is sort of mentored into crime business by Costello while Costello becomes the father figure Damon's character never had. Leonardo DiCaprio plays a young guy coming from a bad crime ridden family. He's decides to become a police officer to get away from the crime life he's been surrounded by. Taking all this into account Captain Queenen Sheen and Seargent Dignam Wahlberg decide to send DiCaprio's character undercover to find out more about the criminal underworld and Costello. With his family's crime record he fit's perfectly into the situation. Now you have a highly ranked officer working for bad guy and an undercover cop in the criminal underworld working for the State Police. From here it's an all out suspenseful thrill ride. Who's who? Who's working for who? Who can you trust? Paranoia threatens everyone. Lies. Betrayal. Sacrifice. How far will you take it? At the heart of this film is character development. We really feel for the characters. We feel like we know them. It's really amazing part of this story and film. Tremendous story telling here.This is one of the most entertaining and suspenseful crimedrama's I have seen in a while. While Infernal Affairs came first I think The Departed expands on it in so many ways. Really solid crimedrama. Check both out when you get a chance. It's really worth it. 910".

Not only is it the best film of the year so far it marks a return to form for Martin Scorsese and ranks with the likes of GOODFELLAS as being one of the best in his canon of films.I'm a fan of the Hong Kong film INFERNAL AFFAIRS upon which this is based. While THE DEPARTED keeps the basic structure of the original it is very much its own movie so much so that the screenwriter William Monahan didn't even watch the original film while adapting its screenplay thus enabling him to infuse the script with his and Scorsese's respective visions.All the actors are firstrate yes even Leo for all you DiCaprio bashers out there and turn in some of their best performances to date. THE DEPARTED is sure to garner a host of Oscar nods if not wins including hopefully Scorsese's longoverdue statuette for Best Director. Plus with actors like Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin playing supporting roles that says a lot about the quality of the film they signed up for! THE DEPARTED is tough stuff not for the faintofheart. That said it is a mustsee for adult viewers who long for intelligent gritty stories to grace our movie screens once again.".

	schema:headline " Good but not as good as the original";
	schema:reviewBody "Just came back from watching the movie so it's still fresh in my mind. Overall the movie was good but it could have been shorter. Good movie but nothing extraordinary not a masterpiece not a classic. In this period filled with really bad movies it's a movie you have to watch.Some things are better than in the original Infernal Affairs like character development. It is especially true for DiCaprio's character not really for other character. However the scene when Wahlberg cites all of DiCaprio's family connection to the mob takes too much time. They take a long time establishing how DiCaprio sells drugs with his cousin and finally get into Nicholson's gang. However after that it doesn't take long for Nicholson to give his total trust in one year and a half to two years which bothered me. This takes the first hour of the movie and i think it could have been cut by at least 20min.Some scenes have a lot more impact in Infernal Affairs than in The Departed. I'm gonna cite 3 scenes which are some of the most important in the story in my opinion The death of WongQueenan in IA Wong falls suddenly lands on a taxi cab taking Yan by surprise. When Yan realizes Wong is dead you can feel the suffering Yan goes through by the loss of the only person who knows he's a cop but alsomainly by the loss of his friend. In The Departed we see Sheen falls in slowmo until he hits the ground in a splash of blood. There's absolutely no connection no friendship between DiCaprio and Sheen. We see DiCaprio almost on the verge of crying. But Why ? He's not his friend and there's still Wahlberg to prove he's a cop.The death of SamCostello In IA Ming seems to show a desire to redeem himself and become a good man for his girlfriend. When he confronts Sam in the parking lot during the raid he kills Sam to remove any evidence he's a mole and restart on a blank slate.In The Departed although Damon slightly mentions starting anew in another city when he kills Costello he does it just to cover his ass. Never after he seems like he might become good.The elevator and final scene In IA the meeting on the rooftop is between two men on each side of the law but sharing so much in common. You can even sense that Ming has some respect for Yan. There's no violence until what happens in the elevator. When Yan dies you can see Ming didn't want this to end like that. Yan's death is really emotional all sounds are drawn off and only an opera piece is playing. When the second mole gets killed by Ming you only hear gunshots.In The Departed The final scenes are a mess. Damon and DiCaprio just hate each other's gut the token black guy shows up the 2nd mole shows up and everybody executes everybody. They just stand there to get shot. The scene seems really rushed.And when Damon open his door at the end of the movie to see Wahlberg waiting for him it was the cherry on top of the cake. Everybody was cracking up. How many shots to the head do we need to see ? Was it really necessary to kill Damon and provide the audience with a happy ending ? Although The Departed is a good movie I felt a lot more satisfied with Infernal Affairs. They have very different feel to them. One is overthetop street violence while the other one is more subdued concise and nuanced.For those who says that The Departed is way more psychological than IA I would have to disagree. Infernal Affairs shows how two men struggle to know what defines if they're good or bad. Is it their actions or their allegiance to one side or the other of the law? In the end they're really similar. Yan tells the Psy he's a cop and lift that weight off his shoulder even if it's for just a second. Ming wants to redeem himself and prove his girlfriend but also himself that he's not that bad. Others before me have also commented on the buddhist notion of eternal hell so I won't talk about it  The Departed lacked in that department. There's no connection between the two main characters except for the fact they are moles. They're almost portrayed as black and white. Especially Damon who doesn't seem to have any nuance. He's just bad till the end.The Departed 810 Infernal Affairs 910".

	schema:headline " Jack is great but the Original is MUCH BETTER";
	schema:reviewBody "Just watched it last night and can't help but think how much better the original Infernal Affairs was compare to The Departed. The Departed had wasted its cast power failed to fully develop the characters failed to focus on the inner conflict for the two undercover didn't make enough of a point in betrayal and tried but failed to made up with Scorsess' trade mark violence and sex.I didn't feel the inner conflict of Matt Damon the same as Andy Lau. I couldn't help but feel for Jack when Matt betrayed him while I could understand Andy's inevitable turn and his trying to be a better person than he was.I couldn't feel for Leonardo. He was crying and breaking up after what? SIX MONTHs? Damn! Tony Leung was a undercover for nine years and he didn't sign up because he chose to he signed up because that was the only way he could be a cop! Martin Sheen got shafted in his role. There was no time for his character to develop a believable relationship with Leonardo. His screen time was wasted. When he got pushed off the roof Leonardo wasn't feeling the loss of his only lifeline to the world there was still Mark he wasn't feeling the loss of a trusted friend there was no friendship he wasn't feeling the loss of a fatherly figure and the only emotion he could have was the shock from the brutality of the murder.Mark Walhberg and Alec Baldwin got shafted too. Mark Walhberg was reduced to a foul mouth asshole turned plot device. What do we need him for other than showing up at the end to put Matt out? Alec Baldwin? His whole highlight was to make that stupid speech about marriage at the golf course? COME ON! The only bright spot in this movie is Jack Nicholson. But even his talent is wasted because he had no one but Mr. French to play off his evilness. The classic scene of the original Infernal Affair had Jack's character to confront his counter part in the police station with some of the most memorable moment of the film. Jack has no counter part in The Departed and his brilliance was wasted. The dock encounter was lousy with Martin Sheen making empty threats and Mark Walhberg just running his mouth off. Matt Damon and Leonardo Dicaprio made lousy under covers nowhere up to the professionalism showed in the original. Even the confrontation at the end lack the power of the original with the surprise. More dead bodies and more punches and elbows actually subtracted the suspense and the confrontation. There was nothing like the psychological confrontation with the calm manner in the original. Instead we had elbows flying and a character cracking up crying. Mark Walhberg's existence actually ruined the helplessness of Leonardo. Unlike the original logically he didn't have to do it alone.The Departed is a good movie if only it wasn't a remake. There is a reason it is not doing well in Hong Kong. The original is much much better plot wise and character wise. The acting was superb in both movie but the script and the direction was the difference. Even though the plot was essentially the same Infernal Affair was a much better movie.Watch the original if you haven't seen it and see the difference in camera work and characters.".

	schema:headline " Abject failure of a remake of Infernal Affairs SPOILERS";
	schema:reviewBody "Caught The Departed last night and I have to say its one abject failure of a remake. I was expecting it to be good and truth be told I wanted it to be good because it is based on Hongkong's Infernal Affairs quite possibly one of the best gang flicks of all time. It is one of my personal favorites due to its brilliantly conceived plot of gang versus police replete with paranoia and deceit. It is also quite possibly one of the most intelligent films I have ever seen second to Memento.Where do I even begin? There are just so many things to criticize about. Firstly the utterly realistic characters in Infernal Affairs have been reduced to one dimensional vectors that merely carry the plot forward. Matt Damon's character was reduced to a bad ass villain and was almost gleefully ridding anyone who knew of his identity with no hint of remorse even till the very end. In Infernal Affairs however at the end of the film Andy Lau truly wanted to be a good guy but obviously circumstances did not allow him to and therefore he was forced to kill the gang boss to protect his identity. He subsequently went crazy over the guilt of killing the police informant Tony Leung or Leornado in Departed. Infernal Affairs ended brilliantly because Andy Lau's character survived it all with no one knowing his true identity. He could therefore assume his role of a highranking police officer but was ridden with guilt and constantly reminded of the people who died because of him. It was really tragic and you could almost sympathize with his character. And what's with the ending of The Departed?!! Do all Hollywood films have to have perfect fairy tale endings where the bad guy has to die? And even if he has to die does it have to conclude with an abrupt scene that lasts 30secs and not to mention totally cheesy and lame. It seems like a quick way out to conclude the story. The climax at the lift in the abandoned building was also unintentionally funny as body counts skyrocketed as people just started dying ridiculously. The reaction that people had in that scene in Infernal Affairs was true shock'Oh my god!'. The reaction in Departed was quite the opposite  people started laughing.Also the strange and awkward friendship between the police informant's boss and the gang boss was completely removed in the Departed. It was so enjoyable watching how the 2 former friends who are currently on opposite ends of the law try to outplay each other in a fullfledged war of wits and power but with grace as a result of their friendship in the past. This was COMPLETELY omitted in the Hollywood version. And also there was a lack of tension between the police force and the gangs. Martin Sheen seems almost weak and hapless against Jack Nicholson and Nicholson himself appears barely sinister and intelligent. Another stupid omission was the friendship between the police informant and his boss which was meticulously staged in Infernal Affairs and culminated in a tragic climax when the boss fell off the building and landed right in front of the informant. This scene was attempted in Departed but failed miserably when Leornado tried to look sad when his boss died. There was no friendship to speak of between these 2 characters in Departed!!!The movie also tries way too hard to entertain. The crazy antics of Jack Nicholson is reminiscent of his character in Anger Management. Yes Anger management that rubbish of a comedy. And I do not understand why there are so much sexual references in the movie. There is sex women and porno everywhere in the movie and is completely unnecessary and downright insulting. Gritty realism is not achieved by dumping sex scenes in the movie.I can go on and on and criticizing about almost every single aspect in the movie like how unnecessary the role of the psychiatrist in the Departed was but completely pivotal in Infernal Affairs etc. and might as well write a thesis on this movie. To conclude there was not a single scene of tension nor was it ever moving or exciting. In fact i found it more funny than anything else. The acting was not particularly great as well despite a rather stellar cast. Infernal Affairs was an intricate and convoluted plot of deceit lies friendship paranoia and love at the hands of skillful directors who carefully stage memorable scenes and powerful climaxes  almost everything that Departed was not despite an almost identical script. The critics are REALLY WRONG on this one. It is a complete failure of a remake and even without comparison to the original Hongkong version it is still a ridicule of an otherwise excellent plot. The editing was also fragmented and confusing and coupled with horrendous pacing the film gets progressively frustrating. Martin Scorsese has effectively removed everything that was so good about the original. Trust me save your money and time and watch Infernal Affairs even if you have watched it already.".

Mean Streets Goodfellas and Casino and to some degree Taxi Driver are proof of that. It doesn't seem strange then that his finest film in over a decade Goodfellas was released in 1990 sees him return to that familiar ground. With a few changes.The Departed based on Hong Kong thriller Infernal Affairs 2002 is Scorsese's first gangster film not to feature ItalianAmerican criminals. In fact this film is set in Boston where the Irish rule. One of these godfathers is Frank Costello Jack Nicholson the man the State Police want the most. After years of investigation they're finally getting close thanks to undercover agent Billy Costigan Leonardo Di Caprio. Because of his family all Irish all bad becoming a member of Costello's crew isn't that difficult. Now all Costigan has to do is report to his superiors Queenan Martin Sheen and Dignam Mark Wahlberg who will pass on the information to Ellerby's Alec Baldwin Special Investigations Unit. What they don't know is that Colin Sullivan Matt Damon the most promising element of said unit has been on Costello's payroll since he was 12. Soon enough both cops and crooks become aware of the situation beginning a manhunt that's gonna make the already fragile Billy even more nervous and Costello increasingly crazier.By moving from Hong Kong to Boston Scorsese and screenwriter William Monahan have made the first step in ensuring this film will be quite different from its Chinese inspiration. Another significant factor is the running time a mere 97 minutes for Infernal Affairs 150 for The Departed. This is due to new characters Dignam and Costello's henchman Mr French played by Ray Winstone were missing in the original and subplots such as the one concerning Madolyn Vera Farmiga a psychiatrist who gets emotionally involved with both of the moles. But the most crucial difference is in the depiction of the underworld whereas IA was stylish without being excessive Scorsese's vision comprises very colorful language some insults are so creative one might expect Joe Pesci to show up and of course buckets of blood the last part of the movie proving to be particularly shocking. None of the scenes ever reach the grossout level of Casino's headinthevice scene but in pure Scorsese tradition it remains unflinchingly violent also notable is the music perfectly setting the mood scene after scene alongside Thelma Schoonmaker's impeccable editing.Amidst these brutal surroundings the director handles a spoton cast Baldwin Sheen and Wahlberg the latter finally back on form make good use of their little screen time Damon finetunes the edgier side he showed in The Talented Mr Ripley and the Bourne movies and Nicholson playing the villain again at last delivers another OTT but classy turn original choice Robert De Niro would probably have played the part with more calm and subtlety. A special mention is needed for Di Caprio working with Scorsese for the third consecutive time he has finally found a way to shake off his Titanic image thanks to a vulnerable gripping and arguably careerbest performance.With its clever plot excellent acting and expert direction The Departed is without doubt the year's best film so far. If this really is going to be his last gangster film he has said so as well as his last studioendorsed picture Scorsese can be proud given the masterpiece he has given us. If only they gave him the Oscar in return...".

Today he should be making intelligent independent movies elder statesmanly flourishes of wit and humanity inspiring a younger generation. Instead he's humiliating himself with overblown junk. His love affair with hoodlums is tiresome his critique of Catholicism is ignorant and stupid  I mean I dislike Catholicism as an institution and God knows it doesn't need me to defend it  but any sociological or spiritual phenomenon with the history and complexity of Catholicism deserves better treatment than the headkickings Scorsese metes out. And ironically Scorsese has made his own Faustian pact with the Devil  he had his years in the Hollywood wilderness and feels he won't get anything thoughtful financed  so it's better to team up with a bankable but untalented actor and produce these lumbering brainless subepics.Many people in their comments here have struggled to express quite how deeply bad this film is. I too am at a loss. It's intriguing for a while then downhill races into one of the worst supposedly classy films EVER MADE. Jack does his Jack Show because he is vain and because no one has the guts to tell him that it was already selfparody 20 years ago. Supposed hard man Leonardo looks as enraged as a poodle when the canine beautician has gone a bit to close to his ear with the electric clippers. Matt is actually OK in the light comedy bits which makes one wonder why he has become Hollywood's current Brooding One. Wahlburg  rubbish. Sheen looks like he's focusing all his energies on trying to deliver his lines without spitting out his dentures. By the way I reckon the script originally developed the sexual thing a bit more  as it implies that Damon is not as groovy between the sheets as Leo and his homophobia and other things seem to hint at his being a gay in denial  but they decided that audiences wouldn't buy a gay hero or it scared Damon or God knows what  just another loose end in this spaghettiplate of a movie.Overall hardly anyone in this movie Winstone is an exception actually ACTS. They are all oh so boringly themselves. Consider Olivier in Marathon Man how his characterisation of an ageing Nazi suggested all sorts of undercurrents of twisted psychotic nastiness  and then look at Nicholson's leering overthetop gurning. Chortling as you pull the trigger on someone is not really quite enough to convince us we are witnessing evil Jackie baby.By the way the film shows cuttingedge developments in cinematic bloodsquirting technology. Instead of the wounds exploding using charges that produce a small cloud of smoke they sort of vaporize  it looks like it's done with compressed air. A great advance Scorsese can be proud of. This film has been larded with praise  by gaga members of the Hollywood money machine. Every year people say Scorsese deserves an Oscar and it's usually because we remember his early films. Well they have Lifetime Achievement Oscars if we want to reward a body of work. Now he has to go to his grave knowing he got the Oscar for a Turkey. Only he probably doesn't know. And do any of the egos involved in this mess care? Hollywood cynicism parodied in Scorsese's last film The Aviator! What a joke.Right  my last word if you're still reading. We are currently being told by our masters to hate Iran. It has one of the few cinemas in the world that sometimes try to show something true about the human condition. Whereas our civilization produces as one of the topbilling cultural manifestations of the year expensive to make heaped with praise and awards exported around the world and seen by multiple millionssomething about as edifying as watching lions tortured or Christians having limbs lopped off at the Roman Colisseum two millennia ago. What does this say about us?".

	schema:headline " Awful... Really awful.";
	schema:reviewBody "Ever since I have seen Infernal Affairs IA I said to myself that Hollywood would not pass up on a story like this. And true enough I heard Brad Pitt bought the rights to the show and that he and Tom Cruise are slated to act in it. When I heard that the whole ensemble changed I still was looking forward to the film. IA with a much smaller budget looks more expensive than The Departed TD.Character development IA is all about heart. It is about how the mole in the police Ming is torn between his identity as a mole and his conscience and the mole in the mafiagangland Yan is torn between doing right for the police and his own dilemma about his identity. Ming is not bad nor is Yan good. TD like all other Hollywood cop movies is about black and white. Costigan is wholesomely good and Sullivan is utterly bad. Their characters are so onedimensional it's almost like the screenwriter doesn't trust his audience to be intelligent enough to know that good and evil are degrees of grey.Timeframe  The time frame is just ridiculous in TD. Are we expected to believe that in the short span of 4 months Costigan is able to infiltrate the mafia and become Costello's left hand man given that everyone so 'cleverly' explained by Queenan knows that he was a cop and that Costello doesn't trust people easily? Are we also to believe that Sullivan can rise through the ranks of the police force so fast considering that also 'cleverly' explained by Ellerby they don't trust people with perfect records? In IA it is a convincing many years. Both characters are allowed to grow into their environment enough to be torn. TD just throws it in our face.Acting  How can people say that the acting is superb? Matt Damon doesn't emote at all. Leo Dicarprio is so whiny if he isn't whining to Queenan he is whining to the shrink or Costello and Mr. French. Martin Sheen is like a vase so weak and wimpy he doesn't have the air befitting of a Captain. Mark Wahlberg's character sarcastic as hell for what? It's a wonder that he is even there he has no role to play at all. An omission of his character wouldn't have made the movie any less. The shrink sleeps with both Costigan and Sullivan and we are expected to feel sorry for her? And Jack Nicholson so painful to watch. Even the extras are so miscasted. The Mainland Chinese characters are so obviously 3rd generation Cantonese speakers with the American accents I am not a native Cantonese speaker and even I know it's all wrong.Screenplay  This has to be one of the worst screenplays ever.a. Costello if he is a big time gangland boss and that he is dealing with international crime lords why is he and his right hand man still going round the hood to collect protection money? The writers cannot decide if he is a bigtime crime lord or a smalltime mafia boss.b. the timeline.c. Costigan sends the tape to Madolyn gets Sullivan to meet him at the building Queenan died and expects to do what? It is just a cheap shot at trying to mirror IA's intelligent rooftop scene.d. The fact that the cast says F every other second makes the movie cheap and crude instead of realistic.e. the subplots are so unnecessary and so poorly intertwined. The double crossing of the mainland Chinese the FBI informer subplot the letter that was never heard of again the love triangle between moles  shrink the time in cadet school. All these subplots should be omitted then maybe the director can concentrate on the real story.f. What's up with the ending? First Costigan is shot Which is a ripped off from the original and then everyone else gets shot in the head except Sullivan. Is there a need for all that gore? Or is it just cheap thrill?

There are even scenes that he took from the original shot by shot making it seem like he cannot make his own out of the material.Over all I am very MAD. MAD at the people who say this movie is brilliant. It is brilliant only because the original is brilliant and they had taken almost every element of it. I am MAD because of the disregard of respect on the part of Scorsese's team not giving the credits when credits are due. Is he going to get an academy award for something that is not his? Something that he so blatantly took from someone else and did not even bother to credit? That would say a lot about Hollywood and their disregard for anyone else. I am MAD at the way the movie ended and I am just disappointed that the audiences are treated like idiots and they don't know it.".

	onyx:emotionText "Ever since I have seen Infernal Affairs IA I said to myself that Hollywood would not pass up on a story like this. And true enough I heard Brad Pitt bought the rights to the show and that he and Tom Cruise are slated to act in it. When I heard that the whole ensemble changed I still was looking forward to the film. IA with a much smaller budget looks more expensive than The Departed TD.Character development IA is all about heart. It is about how the mole in the police Ming is torn between his identity as a mole and his conscience and the mole in the mafiagangland Yan is torn between doing right for the police and his own dilemma about his identity. Ming is not bad nor is Yan good. TD like all other Hollywood cop movies is about black and white. Costigan is wholesomely good and Sullivan is utterly bad. Their characters are so onedimensional it's almost like the screenwriter doesn't trust his audience to be intelligent enough to know that good and evil are degrees of grey.Timeframe  The time frame is just ridiculous in TD. Are we expected to believe that in the short span of 4 months Costigan is able to infiltrate the mafia and become Costello's left hand man given that everyone so 'cleverly' explained by Queenan knows that he was a cop and that Costello doesn't trust people easily? Are we also to believe that Sullivan can rise through the ranks of the police force so fast considering that also 'cleverly' explained by Ellerby they don't trust people with perfect records? In IA it is a convincing many years. Both characters are allowed to grow into their environment enough to be torn. TD just throws it in our face.Acting  How can people say that the acting is superb? Matt Damon doesn't emote at all. Leo Dicarprio is so whiny if he isn't whining to Queenan he is whining to the shrink or Costello and Mr. French. Martin Sheen is like a vase so weak and wimpy he doesn't have the air befitting of a Captain. Mark Wahlberg's character sarcastic as hell for what? It's a wonder that he is even there he has no role to play at all. An omission of his character wouldn't have made the movie any less. The shrink sleeps with both Costigan and Sullivan and we are expected to feel sorry for her? And Jack Nicholson so painful to watch. Even the extras are so miscasted. The Mainland Chinese characters are so obviously 3rd generation Cantonese speakers with the American accents I am not a native Cantonese speaker and even I know it's all wrong.Screenplay  This has to be one of the worst screenplays ever.a. Costello if he is a big time gangland boss and that he is dealing with international crime lords why is he and his right hand man still going round the hood to collect protection money? The writers cannot decide if he is a bigtime crime lord or a smalltime mafia boss.b. the timeline.c. Costigan sends the tape to Madolyn gets Sullivan to meet him at the building Queenan died and expects to do what? It is just a cheap shot at trying to mirror IA's intelligent rooftop scene.d. The fact that the cast says F every other second makes the movie cheap and crude instead of realistic.e. the subplots are so unnecessary and so poorly intertwined. The double crossing of the mainland Chinese the FBI informer subplot the letter that was never heard of again the love triangle between moles  shrink the time in cadet school. All these subplots should be omitted then maybe the director can concentrate on the real story.f. What's up with the ending? First Costigan is shot Which is a ripped off from the original and then everyone else gets shot in the head except Sullivan. Is there a need for all that gore? Or is it just cheap thrill? And then Dignam kills Sullivan. Does Dignam have a great enough agenda to do what he did? g. Did I mention that a lot of scenes of the movie are ripped off from the original?

	schema:reviewBody "I have loved the original Infernal Affairs from the first time it enthralled and enticed me into its engrossing story and I have watched it so many times without ever losing a moments interest. When I found out it would be remade I was annoyed at Hollywood for meddling with masterpieces but then I heard it would be Marty at the helm. His films have always impressed me and he deserves an Oscar for his efforts yet his recent offerings have left me feeling a bit underwhelmed. Take Gangs of New York it was entertaining it had all the right elements to make it a great film but after watching it I felt a bit robbed. Undoubtedably the best thing was Daniel Day Lewis' 'Butcher' character along with the fight scenes and the setting yet none of it really ever gelled together to make that masterpiece Scorsese always craves.This brings me onto 'The Departed'. I went in thinking this should be OK Scorsese has taken an amazing concept and is trying to make it his own with a stellar cast that with such material really shouldn't go wrong. I was right to an extent but I was left with a feeling of dissatisfaction.Having read in reviews that Jack Nicholson stole the show to be honest he didn't really do much for me in the film just his usual on screen persona feisty scary loud. He fits the bill though he took up the screen and he owned the scenes he was in. However if you look at the original and compare it to Sam you'll notice that Sam seemed more menacing because you really didn't know what he was going to do or say next.Martin Sheens 'Quinan' was probably one of the weakest characters his role in comparison to the original does not give a real mentor bonding with Billy Costigan Leo Di Caprio and defeats the idea of the closeness of the two main good characters. His sidekick however Mark Wahlbergs 'Dignam' I think was the best thing in the movie. It allowed for a bit of banter and sparked off a few laughs in the cinema. He was more developed in this version however he got in the way of Quinan making any impact on the story.The two leads were well cast Leonardo Di Caprio does well with his role and looks frail but tough and caught in the middle of things. Matt Damon had probably less to do in acting terms however he manages well with what he had. Having said this neither of them match up to Tony Leung or Andy Lau from the original.The one thing I did like about The Departed was the new idea that they both fall for the same woman. It added a bit more to the back story and suspense towards the end. Overall I gave this a 7 because it is a movie in its own right and being that it is a pretty good offering by Scorsese. The problem is for me the original is far better. The whole concept suspense and acting from Infernal Affairs is so much more believable and flowing. I think one important point to note is the environment the Hong Kong police force and triads are much better suited for this plot as well as the language. Scorsese did well with transferring the idea over to the S. Boston Irish 'mafia' but he failed in trying to translate a lot of the dialogue over from Cantonese eg. the wrong way of writing the word 'bodyguard' on the envelope changes to the misspelling of the word 'citizen'.To conclude if I was to take into account the original I would have given this a 3.510 which may seem harsh but I believe its nowhere near as good. If you haven't seen Infernal Affairs and were intending on seeing The Departed I would advise you to see the latter first so you will know what I mean about feeling unsatisfied. I think the rating of 8.7 at the time of writing for The Departed does not do the original justice. I leave it for you to decide.".

	schema:reviewBody "Excellent. A great great movie. I saw it last night at a special screening and must say it was a tour de force. Even though Boston is not really a gritty town Scorsese was able to capture a darker side of the city. Coming from that area I am always concerned when actors put on the local accent as it tends to be distracting rather than supportive. However with local pros like Damon and Wahlberg they were able to really grab hold of it and not go overboard... most of the time. The true stand out performance has to go to DiCaprio. He has really come into his since hooking up with Scorsese having scored a number of original performances all of which have expanded his range. He really snagged onto a deep and tragic character and created something that will hopefully be recognized come awards season. One of my favorite aspects was the friendly hostility the characters had for each other. It is a specific trademark that I have never noticed in any other city. In Boston when you are really close with someone or not really it is more or less a requirement to bust their balls and shoot cruel insults back and forth in rhythmic banter. That detail was extensively realized in THE DEPARTED and I doubt anybody who was raised outside of the metro Boston area or at least visited at some point would find it nearly as hilarious as those who were. As for Scorsese's direction I think he scored big with this one. While many have criticized that his movies have become more commercial I believe that he has just evolved. There were some classic Scorsese moments here my favorite being a scene where DiCaprio is alone and packing his things in his apartment. Beautifully cut and stylistically directed. Is it his best effort? No. But it still is truly mesmerizing. He has created something truly special from a city that is highly underrated.".

After reading some of the comments here I will pick up internal affairs and watch it. Having discovered the film is a remake of a superior foreign film this explains a lot though probably not all of what makes this such a bad film.But I am happy to take the film stand alone on its own merits of which there are few. For Scorsese to stoop to this debacle after masterpieces like Mean Streets and Goodfellas is shocking. The fact that this won so many awards is beyond me.Let's review the completely unbelievable plot points  Gangster Nicholson allows former cop who he knows is a former cop DiCaprio become his right hand man seemingly moments after joining his gang.Nicholson discovers there is a mole in the organization. And can't work out that it's DiCaprio his latest recruit. Ludicrous. This appears to be a gang of less than ten people. Give me a break.The whole film falls apart right there  if you can't believe the main premise then it's failed. But let's go on.DiCaprio is the only gangster not to give his ID number to his boss but he is still above suspicion.Rotten Cop Damon gets away with blasting his boss Nicholson  and there is no investigation? Nobody ever subpoenas cell phone records a very easy thing to do Damon and DiCaprio just happen to be dating the same girl.Said girl is given incriminating tape of Damon by DiCaprio. Nothing is ever done with this tape though. Was this cut out to trim the film under three hours? Said girl agrees to go for a coffee with her patient DiCaprio. This doesn't happen in real life. Psychiatrists do not date their patients. Not even Frasier did that and that was supposed to be comedy.Police records are completely erasable by one person with no backup and no trace remaining. Nonsense.The final scenes at the building are ludicrous. Characters only briefly touched upon at the beginning of the film are suddenly players in the big game to the point where they will commit cop murders. I'm not sure I understood why it needed to be on the roof anyway. From what I understand this was in the original film but there was a reason for it. Poorly executed.Jack Nicholson is Boston Irish. Maybe he is of Irish descent in reality  but he sure can't play it well.Err the State Police in central Boston? No  that's BPD's turf. They at least have to work with BPD.Gangsters throw a captain of the State Police off a building and there are no fingerprints or other evidence available later.And now for the pointless time wasters Obviously Scorsese is big enough and powerful enough that he can dictate cuts or lack thereof to the studio at this point. Unfortunately this leads to a self indulgent two and a half hour felt like four hours film and convoluted story telling The whole plot with the girl psychiatrist. What is this for? It serves absolutely no purpose in the film other than to make it longer and less believable. Even her pregnancy is left hanging. I really get the feeling they filmed a lot more but had to quickly cut to get the length down. This is why studios have editors. Let them do their jobs and cut the drivel from films and make them entertaining.The whole setup in police academy. That's half an hour right there that should have been cut out of the film.The stupid pornohooker stuff with Nicholson. Pointless plot irrelevant and simply unnecessary. Goodfellas managed to be a great film without that. Although there was one light moment when Jack implied he can't raise the titanic any more. Art imitates life I guess.The OTT language. I'll believe it from gangsters but special investigators tend to be a bit more pro.The sex scene was just sillyNow let's throw in some bad castingbad directing decisions  Having Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio play the leading roles both cops with crew cuts. They are both good actors but something should have been done to differentiate between the two in terms of physical appearance. These guys look too much alike in the opening sequences  waaay to confusing. This is solved later when DiCaprio starts to look more ragged.Whatever happened to the FBI angle? Why bother with it if it is unused? Too many stars. They all demand face time which makes the film drag. It would have been better with some unknowns.The whole secret cell phone deal was used how many times? Repetition plagued this film all the way through.OK  so you get it. The film has a plot full of holes and drags on for hours. It promises so much and delivers so little which is why it deserves so few marks from me.The one star if I must give one is for Alec Baldwin who is hilarious as one of the senior cops and steals every scene he is in. In a cast of stars that's a pretty neat trick.".

It's intense funny exciting suspenseful superbly acted violent has great characters and has one of the most shocking scenes I've ever seen.

Setting the scene is great and time taken to achieve this is well spent but for me the film started to drag with expectation and patience well run out by the time the plot strands began coming together. Yes Jack Nicholson is a great actor but no he didn't convince me in the role even though most of the good lines and deliveries were his. But Boston Irish ? Everyone including the deliverer of the line I'm Irish  can live with something wrong the rest of my life.... failed to convince me of Irish lineage. The accents the faces the attitudes were all wrong for souls in torment over doing what they believe they have to do a basic for IrishCatholic guilt and angst. The film would have been much stronger with unknowns in several key positions and for me once the disparate strands were established the rest of the film was very predictable and I wasn't kept guessing  crucial if we are to suspend disbelief and have pressure and tension build in the viewer.DeCaprio fails to convince as a tough guy despite the convincing scars. He stills comes across as an adolescent fuming after his pocket money's been withheld. Matt Damon looks like an awkward schoolboy and was even less convincing than DeCaprio about being a cop. Mark Wahlberg sounded like he'd been taught to swear the week before Martin Sheen was as hard bitten as a kitten and there were so many operational goofs the film became a comedy. A Federal agent running a State operation against his own informer? What a waste of time and budget monies. Only two people knowing about an undercover operation? BULL! Keep sending an undercover back after his nerve's gone ? Garbage ! Permanently deleting a full record on a State Police computer no less! without possibility of recovery ? Unbelievable  even children know data can be restored and the system will keep a record of who deleted the information. For me the film became a joke and I couldn't wait for the end to arrive so I could leave. By the time the end plays arrived and new players were falling like flies the audience was laughing out loud at the inanity. Once again Hollywood takes a good story and ruins it with poor crafting no matter how well filmed. Very bad casting a rushed and unfulfilling ending far too much gore not enough character substance one dimensional players and an insult to the viewers intelligence.".

He gets to deliver some of the best lines and with every scene he leaves the audience wanting more and anticipating his next scene.Since The Academy has had its collective heads stuck  for so long mentioning a Scorsese picture and Oscar in the same sentence seems to be a waste of time. That being said I can not say if he will finally win the Oscar that he has deserved for so long as his major competition Flags of our Fathers has yet to be released I will say that I expect to see Wahlberg nominated for best supporting and Leo and Damon will be pitted against one another once more this time for best actor Monahan will be nominated for writing and of course Scorsese will be nominated for director. Also it goes without saying a best picture nomination will be in order for The Departed.That was the long version the short version is if you like a movie with incredible performances direction music and visuals.

Now with a refreshed mind here it goesIf one never saw the original Infernal Affairs you would fall in love with The Departed right away after all it has an excellent plot. And with the legendary Gangs like Nicolson and Scorsese we have every reason to have a high expectation. Unfortunately this is not the case!The Bad If I want to sum it up I would say that was because of Scorsese's passion over brutal violence it prevents him to reveal the true essence as human beings of the movie.1. I really feel sorry for Martin Sheen his character in the movie is so pale he does not show the deep and close relationship as in the Infernal Affairs between Tony Leung and Anthony Wong nor there was any sign shows he was even a capable cop. So unfortunately I found myself hardly could feel sorry for what happened to him. Having said thatInfernal Affair's Anthony Wong did a superb job to catch the essence of his character. 2. OK how about Mark Wahlberg's role? The obviously increased lines for him did not charm him a bit. With his boss being killed and him as the only one knows about DiCaprio's true identity he actually took a paid leave?! What's up with that? Does it even make a logically reasonable sense?! All right he took his action in the end but3. Does it have to be a two and half hours movie? There are so many unnecessary scenes to my opinion. Just name a simple one here when Matt Damon went in talking to the bad guy pretending he is the lawyer. PLEASE! We audience are no fool you don't need to show everything to us all you need to do is send Damon to the room and start talking. We would figure out the guy's lawyer did not show up. Well there are so many in the movie what I am trying to say is if Scorsese wants us to keep thinking about what happens and what will happen next you ought to do a consistent job!4. The most of all this movie pretty much follows what the Infernal Affairs had to offer the biggest shock? The ENDING! I have to say I was confused right after I saw the movie I thought maybe I was too dumb to figure out what it meant. BUT the more I think about it the more I got disappointed. The ending was so bad it can literally take all the credits it gets. Let's set Mr. Scorsese's beloved violence scenes aside for me I think the essence for the movie is the good and the bad does not really have a clear line in between to judge from. Just like Nicolson said When I was your age they would say you could become cops or criminals. What I'm saying is this When you're facing a loaded gun what's the difference? For that reason I gave two thumbs up for Infernal Affairs' ending sorry Scorsese yours is just too lame!Also I am not buying the cell phone communication throughout the movie personally I think the Morse code is a much better way!The Good 1. Nicolson! To be honest he is a perfect fit for this character. The only other possible candidate I can think of is Robert De Niro. Nicolson actually did a great job as Frank Costello. My only problem is I could hardly see Costello's foxy side. 2. The Shrink! OK I have to say that is one shining point of the movie! Not like the original one assigned two female roles to the two leading actors The Departed combines as one which not only makes the character more standing out but also adds another interesting twist to the story.".

	schema:headline " Enjoyable thriller but there are failings and missed targets across the running time";
	schema:reviewBody "The war between the police and the organised crime in Boston has reached new heights. Both Oliver Queenan and target 1 Frank Costello have placed a mole into each other's organisations. Billy Costigan is selected to infiltrate Costello's ranks thanks to a family background of criminals and working men meanwhile Colin Sullivan has been groomed since youth to come up inside the ranks of the BPD. As Costigan makes progress it becomes clear to his police superiors that they too have a rat feeding information outwards. With only Frank knowing Sullivan's identity and Queenan and Dignam knowing Costigan's a race begins with the first one to expose the other winning.Having enjoyed the original film I was quite looking forward to this film and not really worried that Hollywood would mess it up. In a way it does deliver but it is hard to ignore the problems and failings in the film and if I didn't realise how IMDb put together their top 250 list I would be amazed that the film is running so high up it. The original was a tight cop thriller which I remember thinking owed much to American cinema in style and tone so surely America can only do it better? Well if not better then this is certainly bigger with stars oozing out of every pore a big director and a long running time. In regards the latter the film should be commended for moving slickly through the 150 minutes and not feeling as long as it is. The fact that it is cool engaging and quite exciting will be enough for most audiences and indeed the sheer volume of positive votes on this site shows it has struck something of a chord but this is not to say it is a classic and those putting it alongside Goodfellas are simply out of their trees.The script here tries to give more room for growth to the characters to explore their feelings outside of the tension and fear of their situation. Unfortunately this produces many scenes that are a bit dull and unconvincing as they attempt to deepen the material. Specifically I am talking about the thread involving the girlfriend her scenes add little and the dialogue in the session scenes is obvious and as a Sopranos viewer I was surprised by this. A secondary downside of this although not totally to blame is that it is not as gripping and claustrophobic as I would have liked. Yes it is thrilling at times but I wanted it to be consistent like a real cat'n'mouse game with the noose tightening palatably around each character's neck as they raced to hang the other first. The ending is also a little less effective than it should be because added to the original's strong ending is an extra scene that doesn't have a strong foundation and is not as good as it should have been.Ironically for such a starry affair some of the performances are a bit weak and I'm thinking specifically of Damon. He never seems like the flipped version of Costigan and I never really got the feeling of him being trapped panicked and hunted in the same way as his opposite number was. Conversely then DiCaprio is pretty strong and is convincing as he loses himself into Costello's gang of murderers. He works well alongside a scenestealing Nicholson. At times he threatens to completely tip over into ham but for the most part he is just larger than life and provides a lot of energy to the film. This energy is harnessed well by director Scorsese who directs with this usual eye for a setup and also an enjoyable soundtrack. The use of sudden stops in the music and quick cuts is perhaps a bit much to get used to but it is strangely effective. The support cast is impressive in depth but they are not all that well used. Walhberg has all the best lines but it seems like he has wandered in from another movie at times and funny as he was he is never the developed and involved character that he needed to be for the way the narrative required. Baldwin is the same although he is more restrained and fits better while Sheen is a nice touch of class. The woman playing the girlfriend is as weak as her material and although she did have an important part in the story she adds very little beyond the writing on the page.Overall though this is a strong and professional film and it is a shame that it isn't as good as I wanted.

	onyx:emotionText "The war between the police and the organised crime in Boston has reached new heights. Both Oliver Queenan and target 1 Frank Costello have placed a mole into each other's organisations. Billy Costigan is selected to infiltrate Costello's ranks thanks to a family background of criminals and working men meanwhile Colin Sullivan has been groomed since youth to come up inside the ranks of the BPD. As Costigan makes progress it becomes clear to his police superiors that they too have a rat feeding information outwards. With only Frank knowing Sullivan's identity and Queenan and Dignam knowing Costigan's a race begins with the first one to expose the other winning.Having enjoyed the original film I was quite looking forward to this film and not really worried that Hollywood would mess it up. In a way it does deliver but it is hard to ignore the problems and failings in the film and if I didn't realise how IMDb put together their top 250 list I would be amazed that the film is running so high up it. The original was a tight cop thriller which I remember thinking owed much to American cinema in style and tone so surely America can only do it better? Well if not better then this is certainly bigger with stars oozing out of every pore a big director and a long running time. In regards the latter the film should be commended for moving slickly through the 150 minutes and not feeling as long as it is. The fact that it is cool engaging and quite exciting will be enough for most audiences and indeed the sheer volume of positive votes on this site shows it has struck something of a chord but this is not to say it is a classic and those putting it alongside Goodfellas are simply out of their trees.The script here tries to give more room for growth to the characters to explore their feelings outside of the tension and fear of their situation. Unfortunately this produces many scenes that are a bit dull and unconvincing as they attempt to deepen the material. Specifically I am talking about the thread involving the girlfriend her scenes add little and the dialogue in the session scenes is obvious and as a Sopranos viewer I was surprised by this. A secondary downside of this although not totally to blame is that it is not as gripping and claustrophobic as I would have liked. Yes it is thrilling at times but I wanted it to be consistent like a real cat'n'mouse game with the noose tightening palatably around each character's neck as they raced to hang the other first. The ending is also a little less effective than it should be because added to the original's strong ending is an extra scene that doesn't have a strong foundation and is not as good as it should have been.Ironically for such a starry affair some of the performances are a bit weak and I'm thinking specifically of Damon. He never seems like the flipped version of Costigan and I never really got the feeling of him being trapped panicked and hunted in the same way as his opposite number was. Conversely then DiCaprio is pretty strong and is convincing as he loses himself into Costello's gang of murderers. He works well alongside a scenestealing Nicholson. At times he threatens to completely tip over into ham but for the most part he is just larger than life and provides a lot of energy to the film. This energy is harnessed well by director Scorsese who directs with this usual eye for a setup and also an enjoyable soundtrack. The use of sudden stops in the music and quick cuts is perhaps a bit much to get used to but it is strangely effective. The support cast is impressive in depth but they are not all that well used. Walhberg has all the best lines but it seems like he has wandered in from another movie at times and funny as he was he is never the developed and involved character that he needed to be for the way the narrative required. Baldwin is the same although he is more restrained and fits better while Sheen is a nice touch of class. The woman playing the girlfriend is as weak as her material and although she did have an important part in the story she adds very little beyond the writing on the page.Overall though this is a strong and professional film and it is a shame that it isn't as good as I wanted. The attempts to paint detailed and complex characters makes it interesting but not as convincing as it needed to be  with Damon in particular left out there with little to work with in comparison to DiCaprio. The moments of slick tension and action are very good though and the only downside was that it made me wish for more of the same and that Scorsese had focused on keeping it tight and taut in the same way that the superior original had.";

	schema:reviewBody "Sunshine' is a forceful and wonderful film that follows four generations of a Jewish Hungarian family through seventy tumultuous years of Hungarian history.  The story is extremely well done with rich finely etched characters.  The screenplay is better suited for a miniseries than a three hour film simply because there is so much material to cover.  Three hours is both too long and too short the story is emotionally exhausting making it too long for one sitting yet the total length is not long enough to do the subject matter justice.Hungarian WriterDirector Istvan Szabo captures Hungary's turbulent transition from empire to fascist state to soviet satellite weaving the history of the times into the lives of this extraordinary family.  He puts a human face on the historical facts giving us a disturbingly real look at what it might have been like to live through it especially from the Jewish perspective.Despite a whirlwind pace that requires years to be spanned in minutes Szabo manages to conjure deep and insightful character studies of the members of each generation.  His period renderings are exquisite from costumes to props to locations.  This is a wonderfully textured presentation with history layered over the human stories addressing the many indignities suffered by Jews in Hungary during the period and the many concessions made to merely stay alive.  It is a story that contains both triumph and tragedy presented with amazing candor.Ralph Fiennes gives three incredible performances as the grandfather father and son of the patriarchy.  Szabo has endured criticism for casting the same actor in three roles but in this case it is an excellent choice.  Fiennes is a versatile artist and personalizes three radically different characters slipping on their personalities like a glove.  He loses himself in each rendering them all passionately but appropriately based on the motivations established in Szabo's careful character development.  With Szabo's guidance it is clear that Fiennes has an inherent understanding of the psyche of his three characters and plays them with believable nuance.Two different actresses play Valerie and each is splendid.  Jennifer Ehle plays the young Valerie and endows her with ardor and vivacity.  She establishes Valerie as the strongest continuing character in the film providing linkage between the past and the present.  In another stroke of casting brilliance Szabo selects Ehle's real life mother Rosemary Harris as the elder Valerie.  The clear resemblance linked with Harris' magnetic performance adds fullness to Valerie's later years.  William Hurt and James Frain lead an ensemble of strong supporting actors that give the film great intensity and depth of talent.This thoughtful and emotionally provocative character study is engrossing and compelling.  I rated it a 910 only because I wish Szabo would have gone deeper and divided it into two or three installments.  On a dramatic and artistic level this film is first rate.".

Ralph Fiennes is extraordinary as all three characters that he plays in this film.  Characters who are completely different from one another with different ideals and different beliefs. His dialogue delivery his expressions everything is marvellous.  His eyes say it all.  This role should've given him an Oscar nomination. When he smiles you smile when he cries you cry.    He is just a brilliant brilliant actor.   The movie was very interesting though very depressing at times.  It gave some interesting views on the treatment of the Jews during World War II and the progression of Fienne's character from one generation to the next and how the current situation of the world in each character's time contributed to his thinking and views of the world.

	schema:reviewBody "Schindler's List was apparently enough for most film goers. Sunshine superior to Schindler in many respects got fewer accolades and much less attention. Why do I think Sunshine is superior to Schindler? Primarily because it tells the story of the Holocaust through the lens of a single family whose preHolocaust history gives a dimension and depth to the tragedy of that family that Schlinder is incapable of providing because of its quite different narrative strategy and focus. To be sure Schindler's narrative sweep affords a greater sense than Sunshine of the scope of the slaughter. But Sunshine stands in relation to Schindler as a novel stands to a work of history. One brings the insights offered by individual tragedies the other brings more of a societal perspective. The best Holocaust film however remains in this viewer's opinion The Pawnbroker with Rod Stieger which had an even narrower focus than Sunshine and brought the horror of the Holocaust to life by exploring the emotional desolationdeath suffered by a single survivor. A truly great film.".

Primarily because it tells the story of the Holocaust through the lens of a single family whose preHolocaust history gives a dimension and depth to the tragedy of that family that Schlinder is incapable of providing because of its quite different narrative strategy and focus. To be sure Schindler's narrative sweep affords a greater sense than Sunshine of the scope of the slaughter. But Sunshine stands in relation to Schindler as a novel stands to a work of history. One brings the insights offered by individual tragedies the other brings more of a societal perspective. The best Holocaust film however remains in this viewer's opinion The Pawnbroker with Rod Stieger which had an even narrower focus than Sunshine and brought the horror of the Holocaust to life by exploring the emotional desolationdeath suffered by a single survivor. A truly great film.";

	schema:reviewBody "The great elements of Sunshine for me far outweighed the negative ones. I admit a few things I would like to have seen the ending be Sors III's speech at Knorr's funeral and the f you against the officer then the scene of him walking down the alley with that final monologue.  That would have left a far more memorabel mark but the way the ending was done was too far extended.  The first forty minutes also seem such weak costume drama compared to the intensity of the next two hours that they should have been vigorously cut.  Third the sex scenes why so repetitive and abrupt?  I love seeing Rachel Weisz The Mummy and Deborah Kara Unger Crash in ecstasy as much as anyone but it got to be almost boring.  Fourth the music and cinematography seemed rather dull.     However once we get past these flaws Sunshine is a great powerful work about dignity and how we value ourselves within a society that rejects us.  I am an American Irish Catholic so I have not felt the oppression of minorities thankfully nor have the last few generations of my family.         I thank Mr. Fiennes and Szabo for showing how each one of the Sonnenschein men struggle for dignity and purpose within the system yet they fail each time to give joy primacy in their lives.  Every time the system they so revere would put people second and ideology first read review of Michael Collins.  Valery knew the value of seeking joy and thankfully she passes that on to her grandson who survived the utter misery of the Stalinist regime.     This film shows such brutality at one moment that I cracked open in the theater those who have seen the film know the moment I refer to.  However I did not find it excessive rather it was absolutely essential to showing the depths of the personal horror that the Sors went through in the Holocaust.  As Knorr says Surviving Aushwitz does not make you a bigger or a greater man.  It only gets burned into your brain. The film does not expertly reveal relationships between men and women besides Valery and Ignatz's tryst but I felt it detailed the faults and promises of each political regime very well based on what I've read.     Fiennes should get another Oscar nod for this as should Rosemary Harris for best supporting actress.  What infuriates me is that Sunshine will never get to the major theatres the way we're now measuring films like they were race horses instead of creative efforts.  I don't know why it is we now feel only the most simple light corny and actioncrammed films can go into the multiplexes albeit many of those films good ones.  This is great provocative entertainment worth spreading around.  Like American History X Sunshine certainly has its faults but its messages about tolerance humanity and redemption are glorious.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sunshine is one of those films I was predisposed towards liking before I'd even seen it. I liked the idea of a film dealing with three generations of a family one that goes through war and revolution and I liked the idea of Ralph Fiennes playing multiple roles. Consequently I was pleased that the film lived up to my expectations.Ralph Fiennes is unquestionably the main reason why the film works so well. Each character he plays the narrator and the narrator's father and grandfather is distinctive and separate from the rest while also having the traits of previous generations. For instance each character is passionate and stubborn and each is caught up in twisted love affairs and has to fight antiSemitism but while Ignatz is a free spirit who gradually becomes more and more bitter Adam is a confident ladykiller and Ivan is a sullen bureaucrat who slowly comes to life towards the end. It's a subtle unflashy performance and one that works superbly.It also transcends gimmickry. But while Fiennes deserves credit for making his performance work the writing and direction are also excellent. I especially like the way that certain themes resonate through the different generations  each character has to fight against prejudice is burned by people in power and has unsuccessful relationships. Times may change but people don't.This sentiment is proved true by the various regimes that inhabit the film. The Hungarian monarchy the fascist military and the communists may all be different in terms of aesthetics but at heart they're all the same. They're all power hungry and they have no loyalty towards their citizens they may preach freedom but all they want is control and the perks of authority. And through the film those in power betray each successive generation of the Sonnenschein family and in each case antiSemitism is at the root of the problem. Not that the family doesn't try its hardest to fit in. Ignatz changes the Jewish surname Sonnenschein to the more neutral Sors so that he can become an important judge. And for a while he prospers but then the monarchy starts to talk of Jewish conspiracies. However Ignatz stays loyal and he refuses to join the communists when they briefly take over leading him to become incredibly bitter and to die a miserable death.But the family doesn't learn. Adam Ignatz's son becomes close to the military regime that takes over from the communists by becoming part of the Officer's Club fencing team. But like his father he isn't allowed to becoming part of the club straight away. He's only allowed to join the elite fencing team after he's converted to Catholicism. The family's identity is being eroded even further. But he's driven to this decision by an inferiority complex. There's a scene where he's bullied by a gang of older boys as a child who mock the fact that he's Jewish. They hold a sword to his throat. They make him apologise for being Jewish and for polluting the air. This drives him towards fencing and he eventually becomes an Olympic champion. But the childhood scene is chillingly echoed in the scene where Adam is taken to a labour camp during the outbreak of the Second World War. The soldiers ask him what he is and he refuses to say that he's a Jew. Instead he says that he's an Olympic gold medallist. He's trying to assert his true identity rather than the technicalities of birth and heritage. But the soldiers wont have it and in the most powerful scene in the film they strip and beat him while continually asking him the same question. He refuses to beg like he did as a child and to apologise for what he is and as a result he's strung up on a tree and in the dead of winter is hosed down. The water freezes on him and he dies with his son watching on.But despite watching this atrocity Ivan Adam's son fails to learn the lesson it should teach him. It should teach him never to repeat these sorts of things. But instead consumed by a desire for revenge and by naive idealism his championing of Stalin is rather hard to stomach he joins the communist party that takes over the country after the war. First he's asked to capture the fascists but then as the communist party proves itself no better than anyone else he's asked to betray friends based on trumped up charges. He even becomes like the guards who killed his father when he's asked to continue torturing his friend who refuses to confess to being part of a conspiracy. And on top of that he even has to endure more antiSemitism  the Jews make an easy scapegoat when you're incompetent like the monarchy the communists fear that the Jews are conspiring to take over the country. But unlike Ignatz and Adam Ivan gets a second chance. He sees through the crap and leaves the party. And in the end he even changes the family name back from Sors to Sonnenschein. It's an excellent ending. It shows that you can't hide what you are and that it's better to stand up and be counted. Why feel shame for something there's nothing to be ashamed of? However I do have a couple of minor gripes. First the setup is extraordinarily brief. I know the film is fighting for time but the opening few minutes are a bit of a whirlwind. And secondly Rachel Weisz's character is incredibly annoying. I didn't enjoy her performance at all. But those problems are nothing really. They certainly didn't prevent me from enjoying the film.".

	schema:reviewBody "During the almost 3 hours of Sunshine I had plenty of time to think about how Ralph Fiennes seems to be made to make period pictures unlike say Harvey Keitel and Kevin Costner who were wincible in theirs. Fiennes bares all for penance for his Schindler's List character in this lavish look at 3 generations of a Jewish family in Hungary as they try to assimilate vs. neverending antiSemitism. Fiennes plays all 3 generations of males in the family as they accommodate with imperialism fascism and communism and gee not once does anyone say You look so much like your father! though the all senior citizen audience guffawed by his 3rd appearance. But then they also guffawed that all the repetitive sex is the same through the century lustful attacks on the sly with much frantic clothes removal and unflattering camera angles up the nose. Tonynommed mother and daughter team Jennifer Ehle and Rosemary Harris breathe tremendous life into the movie as the younger and older self of a fulcrum character which Fiennes did less often because his characters were so repressed. I'm not sure if it was intentional that each of the 3 generations had the same personality so that the viewer tells them apart by their facial hair and costumes well when he's wearing clothes.In more ways than one this reminded me of The Marriage of Maria Braun a bitingly satirical German film that made similar points with humor on the same theme as Meet the New Boss same as the Old Boss. The script cowritten by the director and Israel Horowitz I assume the playwright is too didactic in making its points but the philosophical decision points it focuses on in history are interesting trying to identify when and about what people should take a stand or go along.The look is even beyond MerchantIvory retro feasts absolutely beautiful settings costumes a visual feast. For example a scene from the 1936 Olympics mingles newsreel film with ersatz recreated newsreel film and new color scenes as the camera follows the crowds in Nazi uniforms. I stayed through all the credits but the locations weren't identified  where is that sumptuous Ministry of Justice? originally written 6252000".

	schema:reviewBody "This superb film by Istvan Szabo is everything one could have hoped for from him. He and Marta Meszaros have been the leading Hungarian film directors for decades. This is his masterpiece. Nearly three hours long although eight minutes have been cut from the released version for the DVD version it still seems incomplete as if it should have been a sixhour television series. It is in the great tradition of German and Central European 'family saga' stories of which the most famous is the novel 'Buddenbrooks' by Thomas Mann. Although the family in this film is Jewish named Sonnenschein 'sunshine' this is absolutely not a holocaust film. There are no scenes in concentration camps but one extremely harrowing scene at a roundup point for Jews bound for one. If the Jewish theme is anything it is that of the futility of attempts at assimilation. The Sonnenscheins of Hungary do everything they can to assimilate changing their name to Sors a Hungarian name and even converting to Roman Catholicism. But it is all to no avail. The antiSemitism is so ubiquitous so relentless so maniacal that all efforts are dashed. However the Nazi era is just one era in this family saga. We are taken through the Imperial era and later the Communist Era both pre1956 and post1956 up to 'the present'. Ralph Fiennes accomplishes one of the greatest feats possible of playing three successive generations of men of the same family! He does this with total success and thereby proves himself a true acting genius. Valerie SonnenscheinSors is played when young by Jennifer Ehle and when old by her reallife mother Rosemary Harris. It is hard to remember a finer performance by either. Szabo must be a truly inspiring director for his actors. This film was very personal to him and the huge flat where the SonnescheinSors family live is the one where Szabo himself grew up as a child. Bill Paterson delivers a wonderful performance and as someone who is so quintessentially British to appear successfully as a Hungarian was an astonishing feat. Rachel Weisz gives an intense and passionate performance as one would expect from her. The story is original from Szabo who did the first version of the script but the final screenplay was evidently by that friend of my youth Israel Artie' Horovitz. I still have the handmimeographed copy he gave me of what I believe was his first oneact play 'The Hanging of Emmanuel' asking for my opinion at the time. I can give him one of this film now if he had done nothing else in his lifetime but write this magnificent screenplay he could walk tall and proud through all of his days. If only this film could be shown in schools to educate the ignorant young who now know nothing about what happened more than five minutes ago! This film is a testament and testaments are what we need above all today when he have a failure of collective memory in society and when people live only in a present of a few minutes' duration oblivious of both past and future as if they were dumb beasts or even insensate plants.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sazbo's film Sunshine is an old fashioned family epic telling the story of five generations of middleclass physically attractive Hungarian Jews from the last days of empire up until the present.  The men of the family three of them played by Ralph Feinnes! are invariably emotionally repressed the women both sensual and strong.  The same dilemmas repeat themselves over and over to what extent to assimilate and compromise whether to conform or revolt. The grand historical sweep helps maintain interest but inevitably leads to an absence of tautness in the plot which unfolds linearly for over three hours.The film has other problems too.  A largely Anglophile cast struggles to convince as central Europeans the dialogue is wooden and didactic while potentially mighty tales are clumsily reduced to a few sequential scenes presenting merely a schematic outline often in a heavyhanded and obvious manner.  In some ways this is history as written in the textbooks slightly impersonal with emblematic characters chosen to accentuate each lesson. It's thus powerful as a reminder of the truth less so if viewed as fiction.I liked the understated use of Schubert in the soundtrack.  But a film this long needs more coherence and passion.  File under worthy but dull.".

The men of the family three of them played by Ralph Feinnes! are invariably emotionally repressed the women both sensual and strong.  The same dilemmas repeat themselves over and over to what extent to assimilate and compromise whether to conform or revolt. The grand historical sweep helps maintain interest but inevitably leads to an absence of tautness in the plot which unfolds linearly for over three hours.The film has other problems too.  A largely Anglophile cast struggles to convince as central Europeans the dialogue is wooden and didactic while potentially mighty tales are clumsily reduced to a few sequential scenes presenting merely a schematic outline often in a heavyhanded and obvious manner.  In some ways this is history as written in the textbooks slightly impersonal with emblematic characters chosen to accentuate each lesson. It's thus powerful as a reminder of the truth less so if viewed as fiction.I liked the understated use of Schubert in the soundtrack.  But a film this long needs more coherence and passion.  File under worthy but dull.";

Almost perfect  reconstruction in images of a time full of prejudice hate and  misunderstandings which made the Europe known for some historians as the  Dark Continent. Svabo manages to give a superb and passionate  direction and all the cast is terrific especially Fiennes and Harris.  A bit too overlong maybe but extremely rewarding. I give this a 8  eight.".

As Djanjo pulls off his vengeance by means of a cruel manner . He is relentless in his vendetta  deadly in his violence . The conflict is simple  one between avenger Djanjo  helped by Sartana against relentless murderers and never hesitating to kill. It's an exciting Vengeance western with breathtaking showdown between the protagonists Tony KendallArdisson against the ominous enemies  . Both of them are fine they ravage the screen  kill  betray  hit and run  and they execute massacre and atrocity  they proceed a singlehandedly revenge  and kills each enemy involved on their way  and ultimately takes places the final showdown . This thrilling western contains a story full of violence  good dramatic pace and slick direction though packs some flaws . Enjoyable Spaghetti Western  it follows the Sergio Leone wake  including closeup  zooms  choreographic duels and no being proceeded in American style . The film packs action  shootouts  drama  high bodycount and it's fast moving and quite entertaining . It's a moving western with attractive outdoors and breathtaking confrontation among heartless protagonists  and their nasty nemesis and slimy  menacing underlings . Decent action sequences with rousing crossfire and spectacularly bloody shootouts at the end . Charismatic performance for the whole casting . The notorious Spaghetti actors  Tony Kendall and Giorgio Ardisson  are good in their usual tough as well as silent roles .

Things pick up in the final third of the movie though not nearly enough for a recommendation.If you ask me Django doesn't get nearly enough revenge here. He should have made like Clint Eastwood in Hang 'Em High and High Plains Drifter by violently killing the lynch mob and burning the whole crummy town to the ground!".

Actually the Sartana character in this movie does have some resemblance to the original Sartana character though the Django character does not no machine gun among other things. But I didn't care if the movie was a ripoff or not I just wanted it to be entertaining. The movie does get to a slow start with the plot not starting until a quarter of the running time has passed. But when the plot kicks in the movie does manage to keep some interest in the viewer with some action and various plot twists. I'm not saying this is a GREAT spaghetti western but fans of the genre will probably find it decent enough. And it's the closest we'll ever get to uniting Django and Sartana in the same film!".

A good spaghetti western is weird hard brutal and at the same time stylishly overblown and decadent  in a word 'operatic'. This is not an operatic movie. It is choppy and incoherent. All the ingredients are there but so badly mixed and slopped about with little regard to any continuity never a strong point in Italian cinema to start with it is hard to understand what is going on at times. How for instance did the two Mexicanish guys fighting with knives in the final sequence get from the top of the building to the grassy ground outside? And it was only after the movie had finished that I realised that our bad girl was supposed to have been trampled by the horses in the stables. I had no idea what was going on. She just falls over and screams and thrashes about for no apparent reason  watch out for good girl's acting when she sees the body. It is a classic piece of hold the side of your head and scream direction. I suspect they glued headphones onto her under all that hair and played crap music at her to get her to hold her head like that.Most of the screen time seems to consist of shots of utmost pointlessness that are pale copies of people like Sergio Leone. When Leone held a shot forever you watched it. It was important. It heightened the action. Increased the tension. whatever the situation it did it's job. It was significant. In this movie it is easy to get the impression that the sustained shots are there merely to pad out the movie to an acceptable length.".

	schema:reviewBody "A Foreign Affair is not one of the films directed by Billy Wilder that are constantly seen on cable. We saw the movie a few years ago as part as a tribute to the master. A Foreign Affair shows a Billy Wilder at one of his best moments of his Hollywood career. In going back to a destroyed Berlin a city in which he lived Mr. Wilder and his collaborators presents us with a film that must have been close to his heart.We are shown a Berlin in ruins right after the war as the US Congressional delegation comes to investigate the morale of the American men deployed in the divided city. It was still a time where some Nazis are still hiding from justice as the Allied forces are looking for them. One of the members of the commission that arrives in Berlin Congresswoman Phoebe Frost is carrying a birthday cake for one of her Iowa constituents sent by his girlfriend.Berlin in those days was a place where things were hard to obtain. A lot of everyday goods as well as all types of items were bought sold or bartered in the streets. We get a glimpse of it as Capt. John Pringle exchanges his own birthday cake for a mattress that he intends to present to his current love the exotic Erika who entertains in the Lorelei the cabaret that attracts a mixed crowd. Things get complicated as Phoebe Frost who is a sticker for detail catches Pringle at the night club. Phoebe Pringle and Erika will be involved in a web of deception intrigue and love. The nononsense Congresswoman falls in love against her better judgment with the handsome Pringle.There are delicious moments in the film that only someone with Mr. Wilder's eye for detail could get from his players. Phoebe Frost is taken for a ride with two GIs who think she is a local. The Congresswoman also plays a number in the Lorelei a song with the appropriate title of Iowa Corn Song one of the highlights of the movie. Also Erika sings a couple of numbers Illusions and Ruins of Berlin that will stay with the viewer because of the way Ms. Dietrich could only interpret them. Another sequence involves Pringle and Phoebe inside a file room in which drawers are opened and shut with an amazing pace.Jean Arthur is the best thing in the film. She was an actress who showed every emotion so well in her expressive face. Phoebe Frost has to be one of the best roles she ever played on the screen. Marlene Dietrich is another asset in the movie. Her Erika was a survivor as she clearly shows. John Lund makes a wonderful Pringle the man who ends falling in love with Phoebe. Millard Mitchell is seen as Col. Plummer.The only thing with the copy shown on TCM it was so dark that at times is hard to see what's going on. The photography by Charles Lang shows the devastation and the condition that Berlin looked like right after being repeatedly bombed by the Allies during WWII. At one point in the film Erika tells Phoebe to accompany her home It's the next ruin she explains.A Foreign Affair is one of Mr. Wilder's best achievements as he gives us an account of the city he knew well.".

The movie has an intrinsic historical interest since it was filmed in 1948 Berlin completely destroyed by bombs. As usual in Wilder's works the plot is beautifully constructed the dialogue is witty and funny irony sarcasm and antirhetoric are spread along the movie. In the opening scenes we see army captain John Lund at the blackmarket selling a cake handmade by his American sweetheart and coming from the States to buy a gift for his Berliner lover Marlene Dietrich. By the way Dietrich and most Berliner women seem to be on the verge of prostitution just to get primary goods to survive in postwar disaster. Lund meets Jean Arthur a US congresswoman committed in hunting nazi war criminals. As a matter of fact we follow Lund's attempts to destroy evidence of Dietrich's nazi past a behavior by the captain not exactly patriotic nor ethic.  The finale is deeper than it appears at a first sight brutal tyranny based on terror and slaughter is doomed to be annihilated buried under the rubble pretty girls remain helping us to spend our life on this unhappy earth.".

It all paid off quite nicely and you can bet the footage found it's way into films not half as good. It looks far better than the standard newsreel films that are often used as background for foreign locations.Marlene Dietrich plays the girlfriend of former Nazi bigwig Peter Von Zerneck who is presumed dead by the public at large but the army knows is very much alive. How to smoke him out is the problem that Colonel Millard Mitchell of the occupying forces has. He decides to use the growing relationship that Captain John Lund has with Dietrich as Von Zerneck is the jealous type.But into the picture comes Jean Arthur part of a group of visiting members of Congress touring occupied Berlin. Arthur departs from the group and starts conducting her own investigations and in the way Joseph Cotten was doing in occupied Vienna in The Third Man blundering his way into an investigation in the British sector there Arthur threatens to blow up all of Mitchell's plans. Especially since Lund is starting to switch gears and drop Marlene for Jean. Dietrich comes out best in this film. Not only was she German but she was born and grew up in Berlin. Marlene may have invested more of herself in her character of Erika Von Schluetow than in any other film she did. She gets three great original songs by Frederick Hollander Black Market Illusions and The Ruins Of Berlin that speak not to just her character but to the sullen character of a beaten people. By the way that's composer Hollander himself accompanying her at the piano.Dietrich and Wilder got along just great both being refugees from Nazism. They got along so good that Arthur felt she was being frozen out and Wilder was favoring Dietrich.Both Frank Capra and Cecil B. DeMille spoke of the difficulties in working with Jean Arthur and Billy Wilder also echoes what his colleagues said in their memoirs. Arthur was a terribly insecure person and it took a lot of patience to work with her. The results were usually worth it to the movie going public but for her fellow workers on the film it could be painful. A Foreign Affair may have been good training for Wilder when he later had to get performances out of another diva Marilyn Monroe. Wilder came in for a lot of criticism showing our occupying forces in a less than perfect light and also making fun of a member of Congress and a Republican at that as Jean was in the film most definitely not in real life. Millard Mitchell's a smart and tough professional soldier but he's a bit of fathead as well as extols the virtue of teaching German youth baseball as a method of deNazification. As if it were that simple. But A Foreign Affair has held up very well over 60 years now and is Billy Wilder at some of his satirical and cynical best.".

	schema:reviewBody "I got this movie on video when the second half of the Marlene Dietrich collection came out. Anybody remember VHS? Ah the good old days. A friend had recorded it for me but the sound was all garbled. I enjoyed the parts I understood and when it came out on video I had to have it.There are so many enjoyable moments in this movie. Congresswoman Frost gets one of the best masquerading as Gretchen Gesundheit only to cause her newfound companions to gleefully remark We're fraternizing with a sneeze! Heck she gets all the best moments. Jean Arthur an actress I never cared for due to her high irritating factor Shane anyone? does wonders portraying an irritating person. Phoebe Frost is so stalwart and dull it's remarkable she even breathes. When she finally lets her hair down it's painfully funny. I refer of course to her performance of The Iowa Song. Erika Marlene of course forces her to perform the song in front of everyone at the cabaret hoping to mortify her into leaving. Phoebe instead gives it the old college try and to watch her at the end of the song is amazing. She's terrible but she's completely forgotten that little fact. She looks so thrilled to be there singing the praises of her native land and everyone else is so thrilled they feel compelled to sing along. It's one of the funniest things I've ever seen. We're also treated to a quick cut to Marlene who's clapping her hands and puffing her cigarette like a freight train. Another great scene is Phoebe displaying her new dress to Captain Pringle. She found it hanging on the handlebars of a bicycle and it looked devastating. On her it looks as she aptly puts it like a circus tent in mourning for an elephant that has died. How someone so humorless as her can come up with things like that I'll never know. Billy Wilder must have been a great lunch companion! There is one strange thing about this movie though and here it is. Why would Marlene Dietrich and Jean Arthur fight over John Lund and even more puzzling how in the hell could Marlene lose? It's unbelievable! According to legend Marlene had quite a bit of animosity towards Jean Arthur and on screen she sure acts like it. Erika insults or mocks every little thing about Phoebe down to the ribbons shoelaces in her hair. She even says she has a face like a kitchen floor. Erika might lower herself that far having no dignity left but Marlene? Never. Not to mention playing a Nazi sympathizer. Why we even see her whispering into Hitler's ear! The look of horror and surprise on Captain Pringle's face when he sees that is priceless. He's talking about how she couldn't have been that important and he looks up to see her chatting with the Fuhrer. I imagine if Marlene Dietrich had gotten that close to Hitler she would have killed him and maybe gotten away with it.In all fairness Marlene gets some memorable moments as well such as when she bitches about her springy mattress. Pointing out a spring she mutters That one is the worst. And who can ever forget her surprisingly tolerable rendition of Black Market? Better yet who can forget how during Illusions she reaches back and puts her cigarette in Frederick Hollander's mouth WITHOUT EVEN LOOKING AT HIM? I can just see some other less elegant actress gouging him in the eye with it.I also admire this movie for showing what Germans must have actually been like after the war instead of focusing on Nazi atrocities like other films are prone to doing. This movie says that the Nazi Party wasn't Germany at least not all of it and definitely seeing the Germans living in the ruins of their formal lives drives the point home.".

	onyx:emotionText "I got this movie on video when the second half of the Marlene Dietrich collection came out. Anybody remember VHS? Ah the good old days. A friend had recorded it for me but the sound was all garbled. I enjoyed the parts I understood and when it came out on video I had to have it.There are so many enjoyable moments in this movie. Congresswoman Frost gets one of the best masquerading as Gretchen Gesundheit only to cause her newfound companions to gleefully remark We're fraternizing with a sneeze! Heck she gets all the best moments. Jean Arthur an actress I never cared for due to her high irritating factor Shane anyone? does wonders portraying an irritating person. Phoebe Frost is so stalwart and dull it's remarkable she even breathes. When she finally lets her hair down it's painfully funny. I refer of course to her performance of The Iowa Song. Erika Marlene of course forces her to perform the song in front of everyone at the cabaret hoping to mortify her into leaving. Phoebe instead gives it the old college try and to watch her at the end of the song is amazing. She's terrible but she's completely forgotten that little fact. She looks so thrilled to be there singing the praises of her native land and everyone else is so thrilled they feel compelled to sing along. It's one of the funniest things I've ever seen. We're also treated to a quick cut to Marlene who's clapping her hands and puffing her cigarette like a freight train. Another great scene is Phoebe displaying her new dress to Captain Pringle. She found it hanging on the handlebars of a bicycle and it looked devastating. On her it looks as she aptly puts it like a circus tent in mourning for an elephant that has died. How someone so humorless as her can come up with things like that I'll never know. Billy Wilder must have been a great lunch companion!

In my opinion they miss that the brilliant screenplay just smoothes out the edges and puts some very sharp and witty dialogue on a plot and setting which is actually very noirish at heart. I guess it takes someone like Billy Wilder who returned with this film to a city where he once lived and that he loved to discover the comic effect of a weightchallenged GI with a bunch of flowers and a dachshund on the lead walking to his Frulein through the ruins of a bombedout street. Less ingenious directors probably would have indulged in mourning and selfpity which is exactly why many German movies from that immediate postwar time are unwatchable unless you are fascinated by the morbid beauty of the ruins and rubble.As a German my only minor quibble with A Foreign Affair is the German dialogue not the occasional Strudel and Gesundheit from the American actors but the actual German by supporting actors and extras in most cases it sounds embarrassingly dumb even feebleminded. Apart from one scene that has the same level of cynicism as the English dialogue the choleric policeman asking You live? Do you have permission? after the Lorelei roundup only Marlene Dietrich is allowed to talk normally.Otherwise it's one of Billy Wilder's best films which is synonymous with being one of the best films of all time. Unfortunately you don't get characters like Captain Renault Casablanca Major Calloway The Third Man or Colonel Plummer A Foreign Affair anymore in contemporary films. A pity!".

	schema:reviewBody "Let me state this at the beginning I am not a particular fan of postwar movies because WWII was a very infamous page of history. Whenever I encounter a story from that period I prepare myself for heavy experience and get loaded with hard reflections. However A FOREIGN AFFAIR has been one of the exceptional movies. Being inspired by the original story by David Shaw and masterfully directed by genius director Billy Wilder with the clever screen play by Charles Brackett the film stands out as a unique production. Although the action is entirely set in the 'ruins of Berlin' where people suffer the consequences of the war one gets an unforgettable insight into the characters. Through the authentic depiction of the times we are led to certain characters in a natural manner the characters who act differently yet...something links them...something that you as a viewer must find out yourself.To start with let me refer to the major idea of the plot because without it I would not be able to discuss the core point of the story. The American Congress sends a committee to the divided Berlin where they are supposed to investigate the morale of American soldiers. In other words their task is to eliminate the 'moral malaria' that according to the great legion of decency is more dangerous than anything else. Among them is a charming lady Ms Phoebe Frost Jean Arthur whose determination in questioning will soon turn into passion in kissing. And...what they discover in the ruins of Berlin is an outrageous scandal that resembles the very violation of the law the very default of moral decency  immoral bars with 'forbidden entertainment.' It occurs the the infamous Lorelei bar is visited by American captains... Isn't the fact about Republicans being kissed by former Nazi women truly subversive?The change that is depicted in Ms Frost is a clear message of the movie which says openly desires far beyond regulations humanity far beyond the law the mutual far beyond the divided. From today's perspective we look at it in a different way this idea is more obvious to us. But in 1948 when the division of Berlin was the new political situation it demanded a great courage to make such a film! That aspect which so authentically manifests the German situation after the war was nicely executed in the scene between Phoebe and Captain Pringle  their first love moment in fact. Being angry about the amount of work she does for investigation Pringle asks her what she does anything for normal human reactions like laugh or tears. Then in the witty moment the shelves trap the young fragile beauty and... they kiss. Here her rules give in at last! New York Times reviewer Bosley Crowther praised the job of the movie by saying Particularly their interest is in how human beings behave when confronted by other human beingsespecially those of the opposite sex. And their logical conclusion is that granted attractions back and forth most peopledespite regulations and even differences in language and politicsare likely to do toward one another that which comes naturally. That aspect is also memorably revealed in two of Ms Dietrich's famous songs Illusions and Black Market. The songs occur to manifest the romantic aspect of the movie but also 'its vagrant cynicism and its unmistakable point. Crowther.Not much would be achieved if it weren't for the performances. It is another Marlene Dietrich's stunning achievement under Billy Wilder's direction. Here she portrays a realistic woman a German woman who does not give in in spite of the harsh reality. The role of Erika Von Schluetow was in fact the role for Marlene because she loved Berlin and she loved the right German spirit which paradoxically does not have much in common with the Nazi monstrosity. Her role remains in the memory of a contemporary movie buff as the depiction of the sensual woman rather than a former Nazi who becomes even more sophisticated and glamorous in the eyes of other characters. She is at the center again a similar entertainer like in DER BLAUE ENGEL yet a differently experienced 'sex symbol' Her appeal is strong enough to put the legion of decency onto its knees. Her scenes leave the viewer breathless her songs are unforgettable reaching their climax of course at the final song in the ruins of Berlin. Her first moment rewards you with wit... teeth brushing followed by a splash of... 'indecent behavior.' John Lund is fine as Captain Pringle natural with the right sense of humor and a great flair for teaching young ladies how to yearn for his lips and how to investigate the bottles. Jean Arthur is a revelation in the role that required from her a great challenge how to portray A CHARACTER that experiences the 'metamorphosis' in other words how to portray TWO CHARACTERS? She does it wonderfully becoming equally captivating in both incarnations as the restrained letter of the law and as a genuine human being. I will never forget her hilarious moments as Gretl who knows one German word Javol! Finally I would like to focus on one more aspect that perhaps has not been quite popular among the critics but occurs to be of significant meaning. Since Germany Third Reich was responsible for WWII not many people concentrated on their suffering. In fact the suffering of Berlin was quite ignored seen perhaps more as a 'punishment' for the Nazi system. Yet was the whole nation guilty? A FOREIGN AFFAIR is a revelation in the sense that it truly speaks for the German nation which though caused divisions was at the same time a bridge among people. Great script wonderful performances flawless direction and an interesting insight into the postwar Berlin a city that ALSO suffered. In the ruins of Berlin a new spirit was born and the song goes on telling us stories of unique dreams desires and foreign affairs...".

The casting is perfect Two blonds complete opposites one worldly wise and one with a hand over her open mouth in shock one oozing sex and the other oozing primness. Dietrich performs several numbers in her inimitable style which is an added treat.This is Billy Wilder at his cynical best with Pringle selling his birthday cake on the black market that Frost brings him from a constituent and being slipped stockings for his girlfriend. He also shows how the Germans in charge bow down to Dietrich knowing who she is.There are funny scenes sexually overt scenes including a suggestion of SM in the DietrichLund relationship and touching scenes in A Foreign Affair.

	schema:reviewBody "You would't imagine a comedy could be made set in the devastation of post WWII Berlin. The movie doesn't reflect on the realities of tensions that lead to the blockade of Berlin by the Soviets. This movie has two famous leading ladies Marlene Dietrich and Jean Arthur. Dietrich plays an exNazi groupie who is protecting a former high level Nazi. John Lund in probably his best performance plays a playboy Captain who is carrying out orders attempting to find Dietrich's Nazi boyfriend by courting Dietrich.Along comes a Congressional fact finding delegation of which Phoebe Frost represents a district in Iowa. Her name suits her character which initially is stiff and prudish. I always found Arthur's voice suited her many roles as a comedian. To me she just sounds hilarious. Congresswoman and the Captain meet through the presentation of a cake made by a fellow Iowan former girl friend of the Captain. The Congresswoman's main concern seems to be the fraternization of soldiers and Frauleins. Arthur manages to get picked up by two GI's and end up in a bar where Dietrich is the star attraction. The cake also ends up in the bar along with Lund who had previously taken the cake to the Black Market bartered it for a mattress for Dietrich and now is required to explain how the cake arrived at the bar. Lund invents a story that the cake was stolen and soon the Congresswoman begins to buy into Lund's charms. One of the best scenes is of Arthur and Lund outside Dietrich's apartment. Lund has to play his official role as an intelligence officer ferreting out exNazi's and also play his undercover role as boy friend to Dietrich. Director Billy Wilder who also had a hand in writing the screenplay handles this scene to perfection. He has Dietrich feigning her relationship and at the same time poking fun at the Congreeswoman's appearance and demeanor. At this point Lund's personal and professional life becomes a comedic complication. Arthur and Lund develop a love interest which is complicated by each others reason for being in Berlin. Her heart is hurt when she thinks the man she has come to love loves another women. And her professional pride is hurt when that woman is a Nazi. Lund on the other hand is torn between his love for Arthur and his duties as a soldier. Lund's boss a Colonel played by a great character actor Millard Mitchell comes to the rescue by purposely delaying the delegations flight back home. As the Colonel drives the party back to their hotel he learns that a shoot out has just occurred at Dietrich's bar. The good guys win but Arthur thinks the Captain has been killed. With his mission accomplish Lund can tell Arthur the truth. He loves Arthur.The funniest scene comes when the Colonel does not want to take any chances with his men falling for Dietrich's charms. He orders two guards to escort her to jail who are watched by two other guards who are watched by another two.The saddest thing about this movie is the waste of John Lund's obvious talents. He never had another good part. He doesn't seem like the same person in the remake of the Philadephia story where he plays the jilted groom of Grace Kelly in the remake of the Philadelphia Story.".

	schema:headline " A typical Wilder film  one where everything works!";
	schema:reviewBody "Nobody has an understanding of American cinema quite like the great Billy Wilder and even though this isn't his strongest effort Wilder still makes sure it works. Billy Wilder is a name commonly associated with American cinema but this film takes place in Germany. The film is both a romantic comedy and a nod towards postworld war 2 Germany when the country was divided up between Britain France Russia and the United States. The way that the great writerdirector combines these two elements is brilliant and too much is never given to either one thus ensuring that the film works as a whole rather than one that seems too caught up in delivering two sides  and that is testament to the talent of the main creative force behind the movie. The plot is typical for Wilder in that it doesn't focus on the mundane and follows a congress officer investigating army morals in the US sector. While there she stumbles on evidence that says exNazi turned caf singer Erika is being protected by an army captain. Captain John Pringle is on hand to help her out...only she doesn't realise that the man protecting the caf singer and Captain John Pringle are the same man!You can always count on Billy Wilder to pull great performances from his cast and he's done that here. The central threesome of Jean Arthur Marlene Dietrich and John Lund put in excellent performances which create the right mood for the piece and ensure that their characters are believable. This was one of the last screen performances for Jean Arthur and she certainly makes the best of it her character is the linchpin of the piece so a lot of the movie's success is up to her. This film was released during a tentative period with regards to the rebuilding of Germany so it's both a brave endeavour for a man who had to flee the country to escape becoming embroiled in Hitler's propaganda campaign and a film that will always be interesting for its historical relevance. The comedy element does play second fiddle to the more important factors but it doesn't matter too much as I wasn't watching this expecting to laugh my head off and what humour there is is generally quite funny. Overall this isn't one of Wilder's top quality movies but it's definitely one his better secondary ones and well worth seeing for that reason.".

Her character's last name of Frost is very descriptive. Frost's first drive through the American sector supervised by Col. Plummer Millard Mitchell is hilarious. She sees American soldiers fraternizing everywhere and the topper is a woman pushing a baby carriage sporting an American flag! Jean Arthur's expressions are priceless. The congresswoman's frost is uncomfortably melting. And the whole experience leaves her shocked yet somewhat sexually curious as though she was a teenager.Marlene Deitrich plays a German nightclub singer Erika who lives in the ruins of Berlin and you'd be surprised what's important when your city and country are in complete ruins  soap toothpaste and toothbrush and shampoo become of vital importance. Erika is a smart woman who knows how to use her sex appeal to get what she wants. Her target  American captain John Pringle played by John Lund. You can forgive Erika for doing what she did  trying to survive. But Lund's Pringle plays this like a complete dope. You'd have to believe American casualties were very high for him to rise through the ranks to the level that he is seeing that he doesn't seem to get that Erika may like him but she is basically using him and his rank to survive.Well Frost does some digging and realizes that Deitrich's character is an exNazi who is being protected by some American officer  she doesn't just know who yet. Unfortunately she confides in Captain Pringle. Somehow he must distract her from her mission. Now some of what I've told you is true and some isn't actually what it seems to be. I'll let you watch and find out.This is almost a perfect movie  I love that the two female leads are in their 40's and are playing romantic leads not grandmas. And Deitrich still has that Blue Angel charm and magnetism when she sings her numbers at the rundown bombed out nightclub. What I don't love  and maybe it was necessary to get it past the censors considering the rest of the material  was Millard Mitchell's character pontificating when leading the entourage of congresspersons on the tour of Berlin. The theme went something like  If only we could get these people to love hamburgers and hot dogs and get the kids to start playing baseball something like the Third Reich could never happen again. Billy Wilder wrote and directed this one so I know he knew it was more complex than that but sometimes you had to make concessions to get script approval in the age of the production code and I think that is probably what that was all about.I highly recommend this one. It's another example of Billy Wilder taking a slice of the past that is long gone and making it timelessly funny and witty.".

There is no attempt to patch over the CrashBabel formula the film embraces it and comes up with some fine set pieces like a gripping intervention Cliff Curtis and Justin Chon during a convenience store robberyshootout. The aerial views of L.A. will make natives want to freezeframe future DVDs to ID where we are. The climax NO SPOILER is played against an attenuated rendering of the National Anthem and packs a punch. Unfortunately there has to be another five minutes of Tying Up Loose Ends. Does it sound like I didn't like this much? On the contrary it was 113 minutes well spent and shouldn't have been relegated to the Purgatory of February. April maybe?".

	onyx:emotionText "This ensemble multiethnic cast turns in solid performances in this formulaic treatment of the everyday dramas faced by the hard working folks at Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Mexican Chinese Palestinian Australian and Persian plots carom off each other like Olympic Billiards as Harrison Ford whose obviously impending retirement is thankfully never mentioned his heart bleeding from frame one to the credits leads a solitary existence in an apartment at what has to be the Alimony Arms Hotel. There is no attempt to patch over the CrashBabel formula the film embraces it and comes up with some fine set pieces like a gripping intervention Cliff Curtis and Justin Chon during a convenience store robberyshootout. The aerial views of L.A. will make natives want to freezeframe future DVDs to ID where we are. The climax NO SPOILER is played against an attenuated rendering of the National Anthem and packs a punch. Unfortunately there has to be another five minutes of Tying Up Loose Ends. Does it sound like I didn't like this much? On the contrary it was 113 minutes well spent and shouldn't have been relegated to the Purgatory of February. April maybe?";

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Crossing Over";
	schema:reviewBody "Like Crash Fast Food Nation and Babel before it Crossing Over consists of multiple story lines bound together by a common theme examined sometimes with just a few characters straddling across the narrative threads to link them up explicitly. Writerdirector Wayne Kramer examines the issues behind the illegal immigrant problem in USA who are either trying to lay low in avoiding the law or trying their best to gain legal residency with each experiencing different challenges that lie ahead in their quest.And it's quite ambitious for Kramer to try and pull off no less than seven parallel threads in the film which to a certain extent I felt was largely successful despite some being almost peripheral if not for the presence of a recognized star. Anchored by Harrison Ford as Max Brogan an Immigration and Customs Enforcement ICE agent the film weaves in and out of the different threads without feeling too forced or the need for some compulsory and carefully designed moments to link the stories up intricately. Sometimes like the six degrees of separation the film captures the fact that we don't have full details of that web of links and it will feel very artificial if everyone knew everyone else or if one event would impact severely on another.In any case each of the story lines were engaging enough some employing deep emotions to argue their case while others even had to build to a crescendo of all out action such as a supermarket shootout one of the nicely executed ones I've seen. There's an illegal Mexican woman a very short role by Alice Braga who begs Ford's Max to look after her young son in the care of unfriendly relatives a Jewish musician Jim Sturgess who's waiting to qualify for residency and willing to do just anything to get there his Australian girlfriend Alice Eve and Hollywood actress wannabe who had granted 2 months worth of ondemand sexual favours to an Immigration official Ray Liotta in exchange for a green card whose wife Ashley Judd wants to adopt a child placed in a detention centre who meets an Iranian girl Summer Bishil whose essay failed to condemn the terrorists of 911 and gotten her and her family into hot soup. Then there's a Korean family who is waiting to be naturalized whose eldest son got involved with thugs ala Gran Torino rites of passage style and another ICE agent Cliff Curtis whose family cannot stand their estranged sister whom they feel is a disgrace of their values tradition and custom by adopting the lifestyle of Americans yet strangely ironic as they too pursue to be American citizens.Phew and all this with a little murder mystery thrown into the mix as well. It's about how one aspires to live in a country yet uncompromising in one's position to adopt and adapt to the new environment. Which brings about some xenophobia especially if one's too different from the rest and things are made worst with the citizens unwilling to understand and lend assistance in assimilation to a new country and its idiosyncrasies.But what seemed to be a common theme here is how power can be either used to do what's probably morally right versus abusing it for personal gain. Given three of the lead characters here are law enforcement or in responsible positions in government agencies it's easy to abuse privilege and it's nothing new too even in local context where sexual favours get traded for leniency or the closing of an eye pertaining to illegal workers or those here without the proper papers. And since the law is fixed and sometimes perverse by those who interpret it and justice blind I suppose there are times we may be compelled to lend a hand to a stranger out of nothing but on humanitarian grounds in doing what's right and decent for a fellow human being.Crossing Over presents many of such situations and while it may be a mixed bag in its narrative it certainly pushes the right buttons with its starstudded ensemble cast in making the audience think about empathize with and examine if the issues presented could have existed in the local context with similar challenges in the treatment of those who are illegal immigrants.".

	schema:headline " Far superior to muddled Crash";
	schema:reviewBody "Unlike Crash another recent disparatepeopledealingwithasociologicalissue movie Crossing Over is poignant stirring and rousing capturing what must be the wrenching experience of being an immigrant legal or otherwise in the United States. Led by Harrison Ford the ensemble cast touches all the bases. Although the movie can be very difficult to watch at times owing to its subject matter it's a toughminded look at the oftentragic issue of immigration.Ford plays Max Brogan an INS agent stationed in Los Angeles who decides to help an illegal textile worker Alice Braga by making sure that the woman's son is taken to his grandmother the woman's mother in Mexico when the woman is detained. Meanwhile Max's partner Hamid Baraheri Cliff Curtis struggles to reconcile his job with the culture of his family Iranian and the reckless behavior of his younger sister. Ray Liotta plays Cole Frankel an adjudicator who determines the status of immigrants and their green cards Alice Eve is an aspiring Australian actress who has to degrade herself to lengthen her stay in the country Ashley Judd plays Liotta's wife who defends immigrants in status cases. In a parallel storyline a young Korean youth days before his family's naturalization ceremony makes a decision that could have terrible consequences.All of these story lines are intricately intertwined but here's where the movie differs from Crash the interactions of the various characters never feel forced or insincere and the characters themselves are not simple good people doing bad things or bad people doing good things.The acting is uniformly grand. Ford who rarely plays nonhero roles let alone supporting roles is excellent as the crusty worldweary agent trying desperately to solve a serious crime that may hit close to home while also doing the right thing by the young textileworker mother. Also shining is Judd and to a lesser extent Liotta although he plays the same character in many of his movies now  a slimeball but really sealing the deal is Curtis 10000 BC Sunshine as the conflicted agent of Iranian descent.Like the issue of immigration itself the movie is complicated almost detrimentally so but the conflict should certainly resonate with its audience even if one is not an immigrant or part of a family that has recently immigrated. Certain scenes are almost deadly with their pathos figuratively rending your heart as they play out. Emotionally gripping scenes such as these particularly near the end of the film exemplify precisely the kind of psychological gymnastics that a director must undertake for a film like this to have any sort of positive effect on its audience. That is the entire issue of immigration is fraught with anger deceit terror and sadness and it can be tricky to walk the line between one feeling or another lest one be accused of bias.Crossing Over falls into none of the traps that Crash fell into. Its characterdriven storyline is brimming with plausible conflict that eclipses the usual copsandillegals pastiche choosing instead to deal with problems on a more individual level. The result is an honest illuminating look at a sometimesvexing subject although it is clearly not for all tastes.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am an immigration lawyer albeit an English one. I started my career dealing with asylum cases family reunions and illegal immigrants. Over the years I have gone on to act for students entertainers high net worth individuals and corporate clients. There is little in this field I have not witnessed from bigotry to desperation to the rich trying to take advantage from immigration officials acting to corruption in my very own profession.I have to say that this movie explores the issues surrounding immigration extremely well. Forced removal failed attempts to cheat the system the motivations for naturalisation which as the movie suggests are not always for the joy of becoming a new citizen and the general drive of some people to find a better life for their family. I also used to be engaged to an Iranian so I was quite impressed with the portrayal of the Iranian family. I do not mean honour killings that is not a common thing in wealthy Iranian families but what often can be is the concept of how one appears to others in the culture and the effect of negative gossip on the reputation of the senior members of the family.Also a lot has been made about the 911 sympathiser storyline. Indeed there is one reviewer on here who refers to it as disgusting. How laughable. It is perhaps a shame that audiences particularly American ones it seems do not actually listening to the dialog. What the character of Taslima says is that she does not agree what they did but she understood the motivation. The movie then cleverly goes on to show the conclusion jumping nature of some Americans in this instance the immigration official. At the end of the day Taslima's possible terrorist sympathies are left ambiguous neither confirmed or disproved and that is why I think a lot of less intelligent viewers jump to the same conclusion that the fictional official does by filling in the blanks that they desire to see because they do not wish to have a dialog about a difficult subject.The only disappointing part of the movie for me was the Harrison Ford storyline. I didn't feel that any part of it explored any particular immigration related issue until the penultimate scene and I couldn't understand the motivation behind Ford's character. However that aside I couldn't fault this picture either in it's script it's acting or it's direction.".

Some have accused this of taking the concept of Crash and just injecting it with immigrant issues. Be that as it may even the concept of Crash wasn't completely all that original but both movies are wellcrafted and wellexecuted. The interconnected characters and plots will leave you to ask questions about the meaning of liberty and what America used to stand for.The movie depends on its all stellar cast led by Harrison Ford in his most unusual role ever none of his typical savinghisfamily from terrorists in fact his character in CROSSING OVER is a loner who wonders whether his job as ICE agent is the right thing to do he's haunted by the implications and the impact of what he does for a living on those who just want to come here for a better life and angered by those who take advantage of the freedom bestowed upon them. After 911 happened the rules of the game have changed and Ford in a way is like that aching voice bugging us to rethink whether enforcing homeland security at the expense of a few good immigrants can be justified.All the rest of the supporting actors are outstanding in their performances Jim Sturgess plays a guy who sticks to his principles to get a green card while his girlfriend is willing to sell her body for it. Ray Liotta and Ashley Judd play a married couple and yet they're on two different teams one takes advantage of the newcomers while the other tries to save them. But the most controversial is probably the issue of freedom of speech presented by writerdirector Wayne Kramer in this movie. Once again it's the question of homeland security at the expense of freedom can be justified or not it's a bit of a criticism against Patriot Act. But isn't freedom of speech comes with limits? Because if it's without boundaries then anarchy and division are what would happen.Wayne Kramer does a good job in making sure not only each plot would flow well with each other as they overlap within a decent running time but he also tackles only the most imperative complexities without wasting time in taking unnecessary shots or moments. I love the story because it punishes those who take freedom for granted and rewards those who cherish it. In the case of that schoolgirl played by Summer Bishil it's still arguable.. is she an example of someone who abuses freedom of speech or is she a victim of persecution?I wasn't a big fan of Wayne Kramer's previous works which include Running Scared and Mindhunters but CROSSING OVER is a whole nother result he finally understands what he needs to do to come up with a good story not simply trying to confuse or depress you. One last note actor Cliff Curtis gives an Oscar worthy performance as Harrison Ford's partner in this movie too bad Curtis will be overlooked and this movie will remain as one of this year's underappreciated. Has America forgotten that it was once a land of immigrants?Rama's SCREEN".

One last note actor Cliff Curtis gives an Oscar worthy performance as Harrison Ford's partner in this movie too bad Curtis will be overlooked and this movie will remain as one of this year's underappreciated. Has America forgotten that it was once a land of immigrants?Rama's SCREEN";

It seemed like it would be subpar because of the fact that Blockbuster sponsored its release to DVD. Also the fact that Crossing Over is a lame and clich title for a immigration movie added more reasons to my skepticism.Anyways I popped the DVD in. Harrison Ford playing his usual role a law enforcementcopdetective actually gave a good performance. I am a big fan of the character of Amid in this film. His emotions were real and his performance during the holdup scene in the Korean Convenience store was suspenseful and emotional.I felt some connections to Crash with all the interconnectedness between the characters. Despite the cool and intriguing effect of the relationships between the characters it still wasn't amazing as Crash's.If I had to pick a scene no doubt would I choose the Koreantown convenient store scene. One of the best I have seen.I am shocked that this movie was on limited release. If you want to explore a new topic in illegal immigration with good performances and recognizable actors then this movie is definitely worth the rent. The overall message of this movie is proimmigration but it is an interesting and emotional ride to catch a glimpse of the hard and sacrificial life of an immigrant.".

	schema:reviewBody "Though there have been many films about the horrors faced by illegal  immigrants attempting to get into or stay in the US few films have  addressed the issues on both sides of the table as well as CROSSING  OVER. This film probably did not do very well in theatrical release  because of the very difficult subject matter with which it confronts  the audience few people who go to the movies to escape the realities  of life outside elect to be disturbed. CROSSING OVER as written and  directed by Wayne Kramer forces us to learn just how treacherous the  matter of immigration is on every level  from the border incidents to  document fraud to worksite enforcementraiding to the concept of  asylum to naturalization the green card process the problematic  office of counter terrorism and finally to the basic cultural clashes  that pit compassionate law officers against red neck raider type  officers.   To absorb the intricately woven aspects of the script a script that  addresses immigration issues dealing with Koreans Africans Iranians  Australians Mexicans and Jewishatheist Britishers the audience must  pay close attention lest the subtleties are lost in the swirling  nonstop drama. Harrison Ford as the compassionate burned out  immigration officer Max Brogan holds the film together as he attempts  to make sense of the various irregularities in every aspect of the  immigration process. His partner is Iranian American Hamid a  particularly fine performance by Cliff Curtis who faces family  problems with his American born sister and his father who is on the  brink of naturalization  one of the many subplots that involves 'honor  killing'. Another man Cole Frankel Ray Liotta is a smarmy role  reveals another view of a 'bad agent' while his wife Denise Ashley  Judd fights for the rights of an African orphan held for 23 months  awaiting sponsorship. A brave Iranian girl Taslima Summer Bishil  speaks out for the rights of Muslims to be heard and plunges her family  into deportation problems. Among the other subplots are stories about a  Korean family whose one son Justin Chon is forced into gang warfare  an Australian actress Alice Eve who must secure her green card  through sexual favors with Cole Frankel a Mexican mother Mireya Alice  Braga who is captured during a raid at a workplace and befriended by  Max Brogan and young British musician Jim Sturgess who must convince  authorities of his 'Jewishness' in order to maintain a job that will  result in a green card.   Each of these stories represents an aspect of our current dysfunctional  system management of immigration. The film does not take sides it  merely presents a smattering of the atrocities and imperfectly managed  departments of government that together form a system that is chaotic.  Of interest Sean Penn listed as being in the cast on this page of  Amazon.com requested his small role be cut because of the objections  of IranianAmerican groups over the use of the 'honor killing' subplot.  That may indicate how many people may view this film the story will  either anger or disgust some viewers. But what this very well acted and  produced and directed film does is provide windows through which we may  more closely examine the tragedies of our current immigration system.  Perhaps change will occur once people are informed of the injustices.  Grady Harp".

Unfortunately we take a huge leap backwards for the extremely similar 'Crossing Over.' No real performances stood out in 'Over' as Sandra Bullock's excellent turn in 'Crash.' We have a very old Ford playing his signature person of power doing the absolute right thing Liotta plays his normal sicktwisted male and Judd's the heroine for all humans! If you think about it barely a departure was any of these characters which was why I loved the performance of Bullock in 'Crash.' Gone was her goodytwoshoes role as was Denzel Washington's best performance in 'Training Day.' I would've liked to see some originality in 'Over' but there was little to none. Sure some moments were touching but the overall movie was a mess. Too hard did they try to mimic 'Crash' and it's overlapping 78 separate plots desperately trying to make you feel something for these characters. Basically we get about 78 different sides to the immigration problem and what people would give up or lie about to get citizenship. Major spoiler ahead. The worst storyline involved Curtis in law enforcement who after losing his sister gets hammered at a bar enough to be cutoff and then proceeds to drive to a liquor store to get more alcohol all the while plot 4 crosses over involving young Asians bent on robbing the said store. So completely drunk Curtis fires kills all but one he allows free so he can attend his citizenship ceremony the following day. Not once did any of the other police question Curtis's BAC or how he got there or the blatant evidence one bad guy was missing.".

Life is all about choices and if you make bad choices don't expect sympathy! It's too bad when kids are caught up in their parents' bad choices but that's the parents' fault not the fault of the U.S. The Moslem parents should have thought ahead of time about the potential effects their illegal actions could have on their kids. And how idiotic does a person have to be to make a speech in support of the 911 hijackers?! Whether a person comes to this country to be a model to work in a factory or to teach in a Jewish school that person has the responsibility to think first about the laws of the country he or she is going to and what steps must be taken to proceed in accordance with those laws. This movie tries to make all the illegals seem like poor downtrodden or disadvantaged foreigners who just want a better life. Where's the part about taking responsibility for one's actions?And the whole bleedingheart subplot about an attorney wanting to adopt a child that her spouse has never met and has no interest in is absurd. Who would do that? I agree with those who have said that it's another liberal Hollywood socialengineering feel good film...the kind that makes the rest of us feel even more disgusted with illegals than we already do.".

It manages to combine the horribly aged faces of Harrison Ford Ray Liotta and Ashley Judd all of whom clearly had boat payments to make with the usually fine Cliff Curtis and a supporting cast of whodats. Extremely clumsily written and directed with a heavy hand by a hack named Kramer it throws in enough cheap sex and violence to supposedly appease it's intended audience without offering anything original to say about America's screwed up immigration system. This movie is actually worse than a fourhour wait at the DMV and has less to say. Hurry out to Schlockbuster and rent it now!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "Crossing Over is a jumbled mix of stories and ideas  like Crash Babel Fast Food Nation and even bits of Gran Torino piled together. There's a powerful underlying theme of inequality the boundaries of freedom of speech and the inescapable abuse of power but the major viewpoints are forcibly shoved down our throats. The general public will most likely misinterpret the motif of being openminded to religion citizenship naturalization and hopes of opportunity with bitter antiAmericanism which will prevent sympathy for almost everyone in the film. It's a difficult concept to ingest especially when presented nearly hostilely. Crossing Over is a film that will ultimately struggle to find an audience.Max Brogan Harrison Ford is an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent ICE with a dangerous flaw  he has a heart and sympathy for the very people he must track down and deport. His partner IranianAmerican Hamid Cliff Curtis awaits his father's naturalization ceremony and appears dedicated to his job only to prove to his family how important it is to be American. As the duo runs routine busts on illegal immigrants several other stories are revealed  a defense lawyer Ashley Judd negotiates for a new family for an orphaned child and must also orchestrate the deportation method of a family whose 15year old daughter is accused of having ties to terrorism a young Jewish man Jim Sturgess tries to use his unpracticed religion to secure a job and Cole Frankel Ray Liotta uses his position as a green card approval supervisor to force a beautiful Australian model Alice Eve into some compromising positions.The film begs us to be sympathetic with several groups of people all who have broken the law. Some of the offenses are easier to understand to rationalize but most derive little real accord  each case is preceded and surrounded by corruption and gross misuse of power but condoning any of the actual crimes is never fully justified. It's apparent that bad decisions and uneducated choices are the cause for most of the predicaments. If only fate had somehow intervened perhaps that would allow for more compassion. And Frankel who deserves the least amount of clemency gets an odd and wholly unnecessary moment of remorse  one that does little to alter his fate.Crossing Over is political and thoughtprovoking but also muddled by the ICE lingo and green card terms and the overabundance of characters. Its failure lies in the multiple interweaving story lines that could have been reduced to one or two. Hiding behind jobs makeup and religious ties sums up the not too complex personalities and the murdermystery portion is evident from the start. The struggles of United States citizenship the impossibility of equality the undeniable corruption of those in power and the tragedy heaped on to the point of comedy are all noble attempts at a moving premise but an utter nosedive in the direction of entertainment. The film befittingly concludes on a note of how great America really is while flashing back to human heads exploding under point blank gunfire.The Massie Twins".

In an effort to weave the disparate narrative strands into a coherent whole writerdirector Wayne Kramer has intercut his scenes with endless birds'eyeviews of the city a technique that does little to enhance the fluidity of the storytelling. And despite the best efforts of a dedicated cast the movie never inspires us to care about the people or issues it's laying out before us. In fact Crossing Over errs in the opposite direction of the overwrought Crash by rarely displaying any genuine passion for its subject seeming instead to be simply going through the motions to make its points.Perhaps as a result of the limited screen time allotted to each character no one individual emerges from the pack to engage our sympathy or interest. The characters feel more like pawns in a polemicist's exercise than fullyrounded people in their own right. And there's a scene involving a convenience store holdup that is every bit as contrived and credibilitydefying as anything in Crash. But hey give Crossing Over a little credit. It's the only movie I know of that gives a nod to the Internet Movie Database known by most of us as IMDb. Surely it gets some points for that!".

	schema:reviewBody "OK so let's get the obvious out of the way this is a social film. It talks about current events and issues in America today that's why I rented it. The topic didn't bother me at all neither did the films view point. However if the film wanted you as the viewer to see its point then it failed. There was simply too much going on through out the film for you to get engrossed.In all total there are about 7 different stories being told in this film so you never actually get attached to any of the characters. Even Harrison Ford's character isn't endearing or someone you especially side with. I would rather they had stuck with the more controversial issues they put forth in the movie but instead they end up trying to show you both sides which this film doesn't start out trying to show you. It is a view of America from an immigrants point of view and how hard and trying it can be trying to become a citizen. They tried tossing in a few murders to keep things interesting but the murders and the other stories almost become afterthoughts making you remember that they're even in the film. The best case of this being the Asian kid's story in the film which to me felt not even necessary. It even felt a little rehashed from Gran Torino. This film could have been a very hardcore movie that would have maintained the issue at hand while making me see their side if they had narrowed their scope. Oddly enough all 7 stories are loosely connected through mostly haphazard coincidences. They lose audiences due to the fact that many won't like that the story takes a very convoluted route to make it points. On the one hand it does show that America does have an ugly side towards immigrants but it does show that there are e happy endings here as well. In the end I feel that with such star power as Harrison Ford Ray Liotta and Ashley Judd they could have put a much more powerful performance and film together leaving me very unimpressed.".

	schema:reviewBody "Stripes begins as a fine and very funny military service farce with Bill Murray losing his job girlfriend and apartment all in the same day. He decides with his good buddy Harold Ramis that they should both join the Army. Some of the funniest parts of Stripes are in the beginning of the movie with Bill's character trying to do pushups exhausted as he is trying to do as little as 5. Ramis cracks I think your ready for the Special Olympics! Harold also shines in a bitpart in teaching English to a class of all foreign students. He finds out that there are only a few in the class that speak any English at all. He asked a student who raises his hand You speak some English? The student answers back SOB and hit and the whole class than repeats it.The Basic Training sequences are very funny. Warren Oates shines as a tough drill Sergent and in addition to SCTV alumni Ramis John Candy joins the fun as likable lovable Ox. There are the typical sex gags simple jokes visit to a strip bar that you would expect in this type of movie and Murray Candy Ramis and Oates keep the comedy fun to watch. However this is probably due more to the talents of these actors rather than the storyline which was done a year earlier with Goldie Hawn in another similar Army movie Private Benjamin. There is nothing new or original about Stripes. Its best parts are in the first hour.After the graduation from Basic Training our likable recruits are assigned to man a top secret vehicle on a special assignment in Europe. Here is where this great comedy falls apart because at this sequence of the movie all the good parts have already happened so the viewer has to spend about 40 minutes watching the group operate the machine having silly onelines like Wow!!! let's see what this thing can do. rescue some of their group who get temporarily captured in Czechoslovakia and than arrive home to the predictable hero's welcome. The film goes from funny service farce to a bad Robocop sequel. It's almost as if the European mission sequence was needed because the producers didn't want to end the film at 90 minutes.I suppose that it was needed for the recruits to do something with their Army training. The problem is that once the team gets to Europe the things they do aren't funny anymore and the plot wears thin because of this. The first half of Stripes gets a solid 8 the second half a generous 4. Therefore my overall rating of Stripes is a 6.".

	schema:reviewBody "Stripes is firmly planted in my vernacular as one of those films that helped shape me as a twelve year old boy. It is also one of those films that made me become the film lover that I am today. I know films like Star Wars and it's two sequels First Blood and Rambo Jaws and it's sequel Halloween Back To The Future Ghostbusters Raiders and it's sequels and Stripes  there are many others but this review has to be under 1000 words taught me the beauty of how a movie can make you feel. And Stripes was the first movie that me and my best friend at the time  Gary  ever memorized word for word. And I think that it is this movie that established Murray Ramis and even guys like Candy and John Laroquette as comedians. It also has a small role for Bill Paxton in it somewhere. It was also a great stepping stone for the three amigos  Murray RAmis and Reitman  to get funding for a bigger project like Ghostbusters. And if you were an executive at Columbia you would probably hand them a blank cheque for that project after seeing this film. Simply put this film is a classic in every sense of the word.Stripes tells the story of how John Winger and Russell Ziskey  Murray and Ramis respectively  are two losers in life. Winger is an inept cab driver that hates his job so much that he throws his keys off the city bridge one day while driving an annoying lady to the airport. Ziskey is a terrible English as a second language teacher. And he is so inept that he tries to get is class to sing songs during class as their lesson.  I met her on a Monday and my heart stood still  Ziskey sings and his class responds  da do da da da da da da da do da da da da  and the he congratulates them and dismisses them until next week.After Winger informs Ziskey that in the last three hours he has lost his job his car his apartment and his girlfriend they decide to join the army. And then all hilarity breaks loose. It is here that we meet an assorted cast of hooligans and misfits that add to the enjoyment of the movie.You have Ox  Candy  as an overweight guy who thinks the army is a perfect place to lose weight for free. There is Francis Sawyer but everyone calls him Psycho as a nut that thinks he is in Vietnam or someplace. You also have Cruiser who joined the army because his father and brother were in the army and also because he thought he should join before he got drafted. Then there is Elmo who is played by a preFast Times Judge Reinhold. He is a wasted jolly stoner who is jjst looking to get stoned. Why he is joining the army is a little perplexing but really who cares? He is fun to watch so little details like this are overlooked. And of course we have Sgt. Hulka played with absolute earnestness by the late great Warren Oates. Needless to say it is an interesting bunch of characters.The film works for various reason but mainly because Ramis and Dan Goldberg have written a hilarious script that puts the misfits through one twistedly funny situation after another. If only the army were this fun everyone would want to enlist.The first half of the film works because of the basic training scenes. The second half works because the misfit recruits are assigned to protect a secret R.V. that the army has concocted. Winger and Ziskey of course can't stay bored for long and they take the R.V. out for a run to Austria to go pick up their girlfriends.Stripes is one of the funniest movies ever made and it should be checked out by younger people that were born after 1980. I was about 12 when I saw this and my dad laughed at this just as much as I did. And if all you have to go on for comedy is things like Waterboy and Big Daddy  very funny movies in their own right  you are missing some great older comedy. You should really check this out.".

	schema:reviewBody "I do like Bill Murray and I love John Candy so I thought this could be at least a decent film. But I found it uneven and it just didn't do much for me. The film is well made the score is wonderful Warren Oates is excellent and there is evidence of good direction. But here come the downsides overall I just didn't find it funny. The script does have weaknesses feeling rather sporadic and ramshackle in the laughs complete with jokes that feel forced and flat and while the story starts off well the second half has a change of tone into a kind of a very generic action film that jarred with the rest of the movie and some scenes especially the mudwrestling match and any scene involving PJ Soles and Sean Young that fell short on credibility. Oates is great the other acting isn't that good in my opinion Bill Murray plays a very obnoxious and unlikeable character and unfortunately he isn't very funny which is sad Harold Ramis' character is interesting but is rarely built upon both John Candy and Judge Reinhold with some weak scenes and dialogue are dull sadly and the best said about John Laroquette the better. All in all has the odd bright spot but I was left cold. 410 Bethany Cox".

Well the verdict is in and Stripes is a bad movie.Now Stripes may have been innovative comedy in the early 80s and it may appeal to people who have gone through basic training or who are Bill Murray fans but its still a bad movie.Why is it bad? Mostly because Stripes is supposed to be a comedy but it's just not that funny. There are some laughs but they are few and far between. Most of the movie is consumed by the dramatic plot which is incredibly convoluted and not very interesting. This lack of comedy is especially noticeable if you're used to more contemporary comedies such as Anchorman which strive for laughs in every part of the movie.Stripes further suffers from Bill Murray and Harold Ramis's lack of acting ability. Bill Murray is a great comedian but he was not a very compelling dramatic actor at this point in his career and Harold Ramis is playing Harold Ramis. These two are just not good enough as actors to carry the dramatic arch of the movie.Lastly most of the comedy that there is in Stripes revolves around Bill Murray's selfcentered smartalec manchild character so if you don't find that character funny like I didn't you're not going to find most of what little comedy there is in Stripes funny either.Stripes is very much a movie of its era it hasn't aged well and is not worth watching. If you want to watch an early 80's buddy comedy I would recommend Stir Crazy. Like Stripes the humor in Stir Crazy is not as fastpaced as in contemporary comedies but unlike Stripes it has aged much better and as a result is still watchable.".

	schema:reviewBody "In one of his funniest comedies Bill Murray takes on the U.S. Army and without question with guys like this on the front lines we can all sleep a little easier at night.  Stripes' directed by Ivan Reitman is the story of John Winger Murray who in one day loses his girl his job his car and his apartment.  So what's a guy to do after that but join the Army?  But he doesn't go alone oh no he also talks his best friend Russell Ziskey Harold Ramis into joining with him.  And just like that they find themselves at boot camp face to face with one of the most formidable Drill Instructors every to grace the silver screen Sergeant Hulka Warren Oates and surrounded by as motley a group of raw recruits as anyone could imagine. Among them there's Dewey Oxburger John Candy known as Ox' who plans to emerge from boot camp a lean mean fighting machine' and Cruiser John Diehl' who joined up to beat the draft Hulka  Son there isn't a draft anymore.'  Cruiser  There was one?' and Francis Soyer George Jenesky known as Psycho' Call me Francis and I'll kill you.  Touch my stuff and I'll kill you.  Touch me...and I'll kill you.'  Hulka  Lighten up Francis...'.The pressure is on for Hulka and his men when Colonel Glass Lance LeGault informs Captain Stillman John Larroquette that the General' is looking for a squad of crack new recruits to man a special project and Hulka's boys have been chosen.  The project involves a secret weapon an urban assault' vehicle that is to be unveiled on their base in Germany shortly.  But first Hulka has to get his troops through basic which will be a minor miracle in itself even though Winger goes Out on a limb' and offers to be their leader.  And things proceed just as badly as you would expect not only on the obstacle course but off when Winger and Ziskey get mixed up with a couple of female M.Ps. Stella P.J. Soles and Louise Sean Young and Ox gets coerced by Winger of course into taking part in a female mudwrestling event at a local night spot.  Along the way Reitman sets up the situations for some serious laughs and keeps it all on track with a good pace and excellent timing.  Murray is terrific as Winger with a performance that puts a generous helping of dry' in the expression dry humor.'  He plays it all so straight so serious from his quips and one liners watching a TV promo for the Army This looks pretty good' to his full blown inspirational speech to the troops on the night before their final test at basic training We're all very different people.  We're not Spartans we're not Watusi we're Americans with a capital A.'  That means our forefathers were thrown out of every decent country in the world' that it makes it all the more hilarious.  He never tries to be funny' or fish for laughs which is really what makes this movie work so well.  Murray is perhaps the best in the business at playing this kind of humor and putting it across Ben Stiller would be a close second.  Harold Ramis and John Candy also make invaluable contributions that make this one fly.  Watch Ramis reacting to what Candy is saying as Ox' as explains why he joined the Army it makes what Ox is saying twice as funny. And Ox talking about what a shy guy' he is and how You may have noticed I have this weight problem'  And Oates as well gives a singular performance that makes Hulka a real person beyond the typical stereotype of the hardnosed D.I.  His portrayal taken out of context is one that would stand up even in more serious fare like Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket.'The supporting cast includes Judge Reinhold Elmo John Voldstad Stillman's Aide Roberta Leighton Anita Antone Pagan Hector Fran Ryan Dowager in Cab Dave Thomas M.C. and William Lucking Recruiter. From beginning to end Stripes' is a funfilled laugh riot that's filled with memorable scenes and a plethora of lines you'll be quoting forever. This is one you can watch over and over again with a bunch of characters you're never going to forget.  Winger and Ziskey Ox Psycho Cruiser. These are the guys who Demi Moore as Galloway in A Few Good Men' could have been talking about when in response to the question of why she likes these guys so much replies Because they stand on a wall and they say nothing is going to hurt you tonight not on my watch...'  It kind of makes you think.  Or as Cruiser might say Yeah...  About what?'  I rate this one 1010.".

Stripes' directed by Ivan Reitman is the story of John Winger Murray who in one day loses his girl his job his car and his apartment.  So what's a guy to do after that but join the Army?  But he doesn't go alone oh no he also talks his best friend Russell Ziskey Harold Ramis into joining with him.  And just like that they find themselves at boot camp face to face with one of the most formidable Drill Instructors every to grace the silver screen Sergeant Hulka Warren Oates and surrounded by as motley a group of raw recruits as anyone could imagine. Among them there's Dewey Oxburger John Candy known as Ox' who plans to emerge from boot camp a lean mean fighting machine' and Cruiser John Diehl' who joined up to beat the draft Hulka  Son there isn't a draft anymore.'  Cruiser  There was one?' and Francis Soyer George Jenesky known as Psycho' Call me Francis and I'll kill you.  Touch my stuff and I'll kill you.  Touch me...and I'll kill you.'  Hulka  Lighten up Francis...'.The pressure is on for Hulka and his men when Colonel Glass Lance LeGault informs Captain Stillman John Larroquette that the General' is looking for a squad of crack new recruits to man a special project and Hulka's boys have been chosen.  The project involves a secret weapon an urban assault' vehicle that is to be unveiled on their base in Germany shortly.  But first Hulka has to get his troops through basic which will be a minor miracle in itself even though Winger goes Out on a limb' and offers to be their leader.  And things proceed just as badly as you would expect not only on the obstacle course but off when Winger and Ziskey get mixed up with a couple of female M.Ps. Stella P.J. Soles and Louise Sean Young and Ox gets coerced by Winger of course into taking part in a female mudwrestling event at a local night spot.  Along the way Reitman sets up the situations for some serious laughs and keeps it all on track with a good pace and excellent timing.  Murray is terrific as Winger with a performance that puts a generous helping of dry' in the expression dry humor.'  He plays it all so straight so serious from his quips and one liners watching a TV promo for the Army This looks pretty good' to his full blown inspirational speech to the troops on the night before their final test at basic training We're all very different people.  We're not Spartans we're not Watusi we're Americans with a capital A.'  That means our forefathers were thrown out of every decent country in the world' that it makes it all the more hilarious.  He never tries to be funny' or fish for laughs which is really what makes this movie work so well.  Murray is perhaps the best in the business at playing this kind of humor and putting it across Ben Stiller would be a close second.  Harold Ramis and John Candy also make invaluable contributions that make this one fly.  Watch Ramis reacting to what Candy is saying as Ox' as explains why he joined the Army it makes what Ox is saying twice as funny. And Ox talking about what a shy guy' he is and how You may have noticed I have this weight problem'  And Oates as well gives a singular performance that makes Hulka a real person beyond the typical stereotype of the hardnosed D.I.  His portrayal taken out of context is one that would stand up even in more serious fare like Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket.'The supporting cast includes Judge Reinhold Elmo John Voldstad Stillman's Aide Roberta Leighton Anita Antone Pagan Hector Fran Ryan Dowager in Cab Dave Thomas M.C. and William Lucking Recruiter. From beginning to end Stripes' is a funfilled laugh riot that's filled with memorable scenes and a plethora of lines you'll be quoting forever. This is one you can watch over and over again with a bunch of characters you're never going to forget.  Winger and Ziskey Ox Psycho Cruiser. These are the guys who Demi Moore as Galloway in A Few Good Men' could have been talking about when in response to the question of why she likes these guys so much replies Because they stand on a wall and they say nothing is going to hurt you tonight not on my watch...'  It kind of makes you think.  Or as Cruiser might say Yeah...  About what?'  I rate this one 1010.";

	schema:headline " Classic Military Comedy With A Vintage Performance By Murray";
	schema:reviewBody "By today's standards Stripes probably doesn't hold up to such comedies like Wedding Crashers or Old School where there are laughs every minute of the film. But Stripes is a classic comedy that paved the way for such modern films and fans of Bill Murray should check it out.As a kid I used to watch this movie over and over. My friend and I would rewind the scene where the guys were sitting in the barracks telling each other their stories about why they joined the army. This scene is one of my alltime favorites in any comedy I've ever seen.Murray's performance is vintage in this film. He is awesome as a smartalec loser who you just have to root for because of his charm and sense of humor and his ability to not care about anything at all. Ramis is also very good as Murray's best friend the two have great chemistry together.Anyone who has ever been in the military will find this movie hilarious. The film does a great job with all the secondary characters such as Ox John Candy Elmo Judge Reinhold Sergeant Hulka Warren Oates and Psycho Conrad Dunn. The two MPs played by PJ Soles and Sean Young are also sexy and great.With its 1970s80s humor and its classic soundtrack this movie is probably not something anyone under 30 would enjoy. If you like Bill Murray or have been in the military then you should give this one a look. Rating 8 of 10 stars.".

	schema:reviewBody "I watched this movie after the demise of Harold Ramis. Although I didn't expect to see a masterpiece I had the feeling I could look forward to two hours of humor and relaxation. In fact the cast beside Ramis there are Bill Murray John Candy and Warren Oates was promising. As were the first couple of minutes. Everything goes wrong in the life of John Winger Bill Murray within a couple of hours he loses his job his apartment his car and his girlfriend. Out of total frustration he decides to join the army together with his friend Russell Harold Ramis. From that moment the film doesn't escape the depth of Police Academy for example. What's supposed to be a comedy dives into a vulgar and tedious movie. When the squadron enters a nudie bar on their free evening the film reaches a low point where I have to admit that I seldom saw a more embarrassing and vulgar scene which is meant to be funny and titillating. From the moment that the action moves to the East Bloc the film turns to ridiculous. Of course the film isn't meant to be art house but the talents of the cast are completely wasted here. From later collaborations between Murray and Ramis we learn that they are capable of creating a really humorous movie but this is total crap.".

	schema:reviewBody "WARNING MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS WHICH WILL BE MORE ENTERTAINING THAN THIS TRIPE. Heres some good advise to anyone living in the U.K. Whenever Channel 5 has an old 80's comedy on late at night read a book instead. I am currently in the process of recovering from a seizure due to reading some of the comments on this film on here. I am actually shocked at the fact that someone actually said this film was realistic! All I can say is thank god the Cold War never escalated or else we might as well have given the Commie's our borders... I found this film dire in the utmost pretence maybe it is just my British perception of what makes a film funny who knows? But in all aspects this film is not just awful its teeth grindingly terrible.I've never been a fan of Bill Murray and its rubbish like this that justify my feelings towards him. Don't get me wrong I loved Ghostbuster's which was made only three years after this film. But this just sums Bill Murray up really. I can safely say that I haven't wasted my time so blatantly like this since seeing the first running of Operation Delta Force over here though these two films have more in common than you would think. For 1 thing they both have terrible action sequences from beginning to end and 2nd. They are both riddled with cheesy Clich's throughout.Heres one thing these guys are supposed to be in the U.S Army. Yet they are allowed to wallow around their Camp Willy nilly seducing female Military Police Officers and subsequently shagging them silly in the Generals Quarters. Talk about Random! This film is just terrible for this I'm afraid. Now don't get me wrong I'm no feminist sympathiser but the fact that these two women actually fall hands over heels in love with the two characters shortly after arresting them letting them go free... Twice is just insulting to the female race. The fact that one tatty haired fat lipped bum Winger and his hapless sidekick Ramis can simply sweet talk themselves into into the MP's underwear to which they fall madly in love with the two of them is nothing short of ludicrous.Then there is the training scenes where you get to meet the Squad Phycho who unconvincingly threatens to kill anyone who touches him or his stuff followed by the overweight bloke played by the late and great John Candy who claims he joined the army to avoid paying 400 for anger management classes. Leading to loud mouthed Murray paying tribute to the Giant Toe WTF? 'Drill Seargent' who honestly couldn't organise a pi up in a brewery let alone his band of recruits. All this scene serves to do is to prelude loads of fight scenes with people saying way to go ass hole'! all the time etc etc.The scenes then carry on showing the rag tag bunch making utter tits of themselves on the Assault Course leading to a scene where one of them shoots wildly into the air at some passing birds with an assault rifle peppering a watch tower with bullets. Just like that. Yep told you this film was random...He miraculously escapes undisciplined as well... Eventually Leading up the the passing out parade where the hapless squad make a magic turn around within the space of two hours. Bugger me Miracle! Thanks to some wise words from Murray to which they then direct a massively none military like dance routine in front of a Geriatric 'General' in front of the rest of the squads. All of this to the immense pleasure of their two Girlfriends on the stand who really should've been arresting them... Everyone laughs it off though. This bit is nothing short of amazing though. He then chooses them to guard a new MultiMillion Dollar Prototype Armoured Vehicle in Italy which turns out to be just a mobile home painted green with loads of gadgets on the inside claiming This is exactly what this Army needs! righto...Then there is the dire finale where Murray and Ramis decide to steal this topsecret prototype Military Vehicle to pick up their newly acquired and somewhat Hyperactive MP Girlfriends in Germany. To which the Hapless Captain John Larroquette then finds out and leads the Squad of fresh recruits on a retrieval Mission for this vehicle. To which they then take a wrong turn enroute and end up in Soviet Held Czechoslovakia where they are captured. Like we didn't see that coming... Thus begins a rescue attempt by Ramis and Murray  Birds in hand to which is where a big fight loads of shooting from the hip and blowing tanks up. With them coming back as National Heroes humiliating the Russians by calling them pussies etc etc. The end. Thats right. No Courts Martial nothing. They only just stole a prototype Military vehicle drove it into a Warsaw Pact country and almost caused an International incident which could've sparked WW3!This film is honestly more fun that being diagnosed with a terminal illness. I know its meant to be a Comedy it got all the right actors for it but where in the hell is it? Have Channel 5 cuts those bits out? The only redeeming feature in this film is the repetitive use of naked women taking showers and female Mud Wrestling. like I said Random Not that it helps to divert from the fact that this is an utterly crap film of course. This film should realistically be aimed at immature 9 year old's sadly we have to watch it instead. 1 star out of 10  Total Tripe. My advice do something a little more useful with your time. Like Castrating yourself...".

The two main characters John and Russell see no point in living life like lazy sleezeballs so they join the military for some fun. This is where the stupidity starts.John and Russell and put in a recruit squad including other morons. Sgt. Hulka is the typical hardass drill instructor who seems to always be punishing the two main characters for trying to act funny and cool obvious clich. There are many instances in this movie that I found completely ridiculous. The first one would have to be basic training when the recruits are with the mortars and accidentally almost kill Hulka which results in him just being hospitalized. The recruits don't really receive any punishment like kicked out or court martial but strong resentment from Hulka. Secondly would have to be when John and Russell are found breaking military law which obviously causes two female MPs to magically fall in love with them sneak into an officers nearby house and immediately have sex. Sexist and disgusting? Check.When the recruits realize that they are pretty much idiots and graduation is coming soon it serves as a time for John to finally act like a leader. This sounds good that they may actually take the army seriously but they don't. John makes some stupid overpatriotic speech about how We are in the U.S. Army the best army ever. We've been kicking ass for over 200 years lol don't you remember the Korean War and Vietnam John?. Anyhow this speech encourages the recruits to then do a onenight transformation for the next day which is graduation. They show up at the ceremony late marching in like a bunch of kindergartens and do a completely awkward and unmilitary like march singing pop songs. This is supposedly their one night transformation. Yet even with this stupid display the high ranking officers pick John and his recruits over EVERY OTHER RECRUIT PLATOON which acted more military than they did. They are sent to a NATO country on a special assignment which is testing a new EM50 Urban Assault Vehicle in reality a GMC motor home lol!.This assignment is too much for Russell and John and they decide to go to Germany by stealing the EM50 UAV to meet up with the pretty female MPs they screwed with back in the U.S. Sgt. Hulka finds out what John and Russell did and take the other recruits to retrieve the EM50 motor home back. Somehow they take a wrong turn into Czechoslovakia and are captured by the occupying Soviet Army. Russell John and the MP girls go to Czechoslovakia to rescue the men. This movie tries to portray how easy it is for American troops to invade a Sovietbloc nation by just smashing through a roadblock. Not to mention these idiots could have started World War III for their dumb actions! Russell John and the MPs enter the town the recruits are held in rescue them defeat a huge army of Soviet soldiers blow up tanks and survive rockets and grenades all thanks to the GMC Motor Home being super protective okay?. They all then return back to the United States being heroes and calling the Soviets puies which is an overexaggeration because how could a motor home beat an entire Soviet division? ProAmerican antiSoviet propaganda is why then again this film was made 34 way through the Cold War.I do not recommend this movie it is boring absurd and ridiculous. If you like watching a film where buffoons become heroes in an unreal way then this is for you.".

It's a cheap knockoff of Boulting Brother's Private's Progress' 1956 in which an allstar cast playing a squad of misfits is knocked into fine servicemen watched over by a tough gruff abouttoretire drill sergeant.  This downmarket US plagiarised version is just not in the same class.  Bill Murray is just a dull paininthe ass who selfcentred childlike persona is supposed to be comic.  Warren Oates and John Candy in supporting roles are acceptable with Oates almost reaching the standard set by William Hartnell.".

Bill Murray is somewhat charismatic as a bum who joins the Army along with his best friend played by Harold Ramis. Together they lead a ragtag group of losers under the command of Warren Oates who died less than a year after this film was released. Among them are John Candy and Judge Reinhold. John Laroquette and Sean Young also appear. There's barely a laugh in the picture Candy made me chuckle once in a great while and the heroes are such unlikeable douches you almost can't wait to see them courtmartialed for their hilarious antics of course it ends with them receiving medals for actions which I imagine would have begun WWIII in 1981.

It's just going through the same kind of jokes as in CARRY ON SERGEANT made some 34 years previously with some added TA to spice things up.The best thing about the production is unsurprisingly the cast headed by an onform Bill Murray. Harold Ramis is predictably decent and there's a nice role for John Candy before he adopted the lovable goof character of later years. PJ Soles and Sean Young are here too but I found their characters annoying getting in the way of the army situation.

Just as John Vernon was the analretentive square lording it over our slacker heroes in John Landis' film Warren Oates plays Sgt. 1st Class Hulka who gives Murray the most discipline he must've ever had in his life making him the closest character in the film to give the film cohesion. Otherwise this lazy but likable classic wastes most of its time overstressing situations contradicted from the start by Murray's character. The star act and his material are essentially misaligned until the tedious scattered script ultimately labors past basic training.The blessing I think Stripes brings to the goldenage slapstick template is a more vivid ensemble. Yes In the Navy and A Night at the Opera had plots but with the attention to detail and ripeness in dialogue and characterization of a presentday cartoon. The peripheral people around the stars of the act were virtually prevented from having too much presence or distinction for fear of upstaging the dealbreaking stars but in Stripes others clowning in basictraining include Judge Reinhold's headbobbing stoner Conrad Dunn's broadstroke acknowledgment to Travis Bickle likely more of a Harold Ramis contribution and John Candy's softhearted fatso who finds the Laurel to his Hardy in southern boy John Diehl. They all have the kind of indelible character we hope for in especially young performances of actors who later became more prevalent. And yet P.J. Soles and Sean Young are there for one reason the same one reason all us young guys wanted them in it. Other than that there is absolutely nothing else. Not a single realistic action is allowed from them.Director Ivan Reitman is a sure merchant. He knows that the cheap laughs are the most certain that we like to see bunglers get it together without losing their ungainly style and that it doesn't harm business to slot in a sorority shower scene or nude mudwrestling competition every 30 minutes or so. Vietnam was by now a bygone phase and this is Reagan's Good Army. When Ivan Reitman wants to ambush the Eastern Bloc in a Winnebago crammed with rockets he has the certified OK for dozens of tanks explosions shootouts and handtohand combat moments.

	schema:headline " Classic film the best Indiana Jones the film that started a franchise";
	schema:reviewBody "Classic Action Adventure film that started Indiana Jones character and a film franchise including a TV Show series on a big screen. It is one of my personal favorite adventure movies of all time. It was my second movie that I have saw and It will be always the best one in the series no order. Easily one of the best movies till this date I always enjoy this movie. Best Indiana Jones and Steven Spielberg film ever.Raiders has more energy than three action films. And that is what makes it the classic that it is.Raiders is such a great film containing some great action scenes the Truck scene and creating Indiana Jones which is the best adventure hero ever made partly I think due to Harrison Ford I don't think these movies would have been as good with Tom Selleck. Raiders of the Lost Ark 1981 also won 4 Academy Awards including for Best Art DirectionSet DecorationBest SoundBest Film Editing and Best Effects Visual Effects.The Effects were awesome and amazing in this film their wasn't any CGI in it but there were the special effects editing and visual effects were great! That made this film so great and it worked so well. The story and the plot were brilliant and intense. For me Harrison Ford is the only Indiana Jones that it is  an archeology professor who often embarks on perilous adventures to obtain rare artifacts. Jones claims that he has no belief in the supernatural only to have his skepticism challenged when he discovers the Ark. He acted the character believable like he was Indiana Jones a real adventurer. Paul Freeman as Dr. Ren Belloq Jones' nemesis was one of the best villains out there he acted his character terrific and convincing. Karen Allen as Marion Ravenwood a spirited tough former lover of Indiana's was one of the most amazing female characters she was really believable. John RhysDavies as Sallah the best digger in Cairo and Denholm Elliott as Dr. Marcus Brody did terrific as the support cast they didn't had so many scenes in the film but in the third entry they were both trough whole film. Ronald Lacey as Major Arnold Toht and Wolf Kahler as Colonel Dietrich did wonderful performance as the ruthless Nazi villains in the film. Raiders of the Lost Ark 1981 stays one of the best films in the series franchise and my favorite best Indiana Jones film ever. George Lucas and Steven Spielberg did a wonderful job on this film. The year is 1936. Archaeologist and adventurer Indiana Jones is hired by the US government to find the Ark of the Covenant before the Nazis. There you have the plot. The film that redefined adventure cinema Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark blends action serial thrills with oldfashioned Hollywood wit and remains a beloved classic. Steven Spielberg had hoped to direct a James Bond film when George Lucas told him he had something better for him. Spielberg and Lucas looked for a leading man for over six months. Then I saw The Empire Strikes Back Spielberg said Harrison Ford is Indiana Jones To create the illusion of Nazis being zapped with the energy of the Ark actors wore what were essentially light bulb squibs timed to go off at onesecond intervals. The film is bursting with great setpieces such as Ford being chased by a giant boulder and has some memorable images such as the rays of sunlight that open granite doors the work of the great cinematographer Douglas Slocambe. John Williams composed the Oscarnominated score for Raiders of the Lost Ark which was performed by the London Symphony Orchestra. The support cast around Ford is good too with Paul Freeman playing a rival French archaeologist Ren Belloq Denholm Elliott playing Indy's college colleague Marcus Brody Ronald Lacey as Gestapo agent Arnold Toht and Karen Allen as the feisty love interest Marion Ravenwood. The film also crackles with humour. In one memorable scene Indy is challenged to fight by a Cairo swordsman played by Terry Richards. The actor had spent months in training for what was due to be a lengthy swordversusbull choreographed fight. But Ford along with many of the crew was suffering from stomach illness. He suggested to Spielberg that they cut the scene short. Spielberg agreed resulting in the biggest laugh of the film. The Action scenes are terrific and stunning as the airplane scene was outstanding and I love it. Indy is challenged in to a fight ensues that is joined by a burly Nazi who pummels Indy before being punched backward and shredded to bits by the plane's propellers. Marion seizes one of the plane's machine guns and opens fire on Nazi soldiers in the process setting a fuel dump aflame. The fire destroys the area and the plane explodes but Indy and Marion escape. This is the best action scene ever! Indiana seize the truck containing the Ark. He survives a brutal chase and fight with Nazi soldiers while he is driving the Ark to safety. The scene on the submarine is awesome the illusion spirits attacking the nowterrified Nazis killing the entire contingent and destroying Belloq is awesome. can do. I love the original Indiana Jones film its my all time favorite action film the acting is great the action is awesome and intense at the same time the story is awesome Spielberg made a well mad ActionAdventure film this film is perfect. 1010 Bad Ass Seal Of Approval".

	schema:reviewBody "It is a hot sunny day in South America. We see a bunch of men shot mostly from the back. They are walking deep into the forest. We see a tall dark figure. He is wearing an old leather jacket he has the 5 o'clock shadow looking like it's closer to midnight he wears a fedora and he carries a bullwhip  yes a bullwhip . Finally two of the men enter a cave and we hear about some guy named Forstall who was good very very good but he never came out of the place alive. But they enter anyway. They are confronted with tarantulas spears that are triggered by blocking out the light a pit that they must swing over and then more tiny poisonous darts that come out of the wall. All this to protect an ancient gold statue. They recover it. One guy dies and the other barely makes it out of the room before it all falls on him. Then he has to get out of the cave and a giant boulder chases him. Finally he makes it out of the cave only to be surrounded by Hovitos and his arch enemy named Belloq. He takes the gold statue that this guy worked so hard for and then the guy runs and makes it to the plane where he is in the passenger seat and there is big snake in the plane. He hates snakes. This mans name? Indiana Jones!Whhhoooooo!! I'm left breathless just describing that opening. But is there a better beginning of a movie ever? Absolutely not. Does the beginning have anything to do with the rest of the film. No. It is all decoration for what the movie is going to put you through in the 90 minutes to come.Indiana Jones is the best character to ever hit the screens. And he better be. He is created by George Steven and played by Harrison Ford. That may seem normal now that we have lived with him for 20 years but can you imagine what that must have been like back in 1981. That would be like Tom Hanks or Will Smith joining forces with James Cameron and Steven Spielberg for a completely original idea in today's terms.Raiders took a simple idea and maybe an idea that the guys had from watching Saturday afternoon movies and made it larger than life. This film never stops for you to take your breath. It is filled with rich characters from Indy himself to Marion to Belloq and even to Marcus Brody. Each has their own personality that shines through in certain scenes. Some of my faves were when we first meet Marion having a shot contest in her bar in Nepal. Then there is her scene with Belloq and they get drunk together and she tries to leave using only a butter knife. And of course who can forget Indy's battle with the swordsman and his unrivaled determination to get the ark.  Indy there is not time. If you still want the truck it is being loaded on a truck for Cairo.   a battered and bloody Indy   Truck? What truck?  and then later  Get some transport back to England boat plane anything. Meet me at Omar's. I'm going after that truck. Sola   How?   Indy  I don't know I'm making this up as I go.Raiders has more energy than three action films. And that is what makes it the classic that it is. If you like movies then Raiders is a movie that will not let you down. It is pure entertainment and that is indisputable. It finds the youngster in all of us and bombards us with this silly whipcracking average incredibly determined archaeologist and only asks us to have fun. And that we do. And to me the only reason that Chariots of Fire won best picture that year is because it is a serious film. Raiders was heads and shoulders above Chariots and it should have cleaned up at the Oscars in 81. But more politics with the academy.Raiders of the Lost Ark is the epitome of entertainment. What more can be said about it. If you haven't seen this movie in a while or if you haven't seen it at all  gasp  then do yourself a favour and rent it tonight. It is awesome.TRUST ME".

So it was with excitement that I opened my presents on my birthday and found the boxset for the Indiana Jones Trilogy and with even more excitement when I finally watched the first in the trilogy Raiders of the lost Ark.It was just as I remembered fun excitement wise cracks a tiny splattering of romance but with a manliness that kids would allow and lots of stunts and action. It's a superb movie and captures that style of serials adventure stories and comic books perfectly how I know that for sure is only through repeats since I wasn't alive during those times.The set pieces are fantastic and although some of the wilder end sequences are slightly dated now it hasn't lost the excitement factor. It's a perfectly crafted movie as well moving from location to location without any distraction or superfluous scenes it just feels like it's all there for a reason and that it belongs there.Harrison Ford is excellent in the role and I'm inclined to think he was more Indy than he was Solo but that's a personal opinion. He has many more facial movements and voice inclinations in this early movie than he does nowadays now he belongs to the moody quiet school of acting then he was dynamic adventurous strong and as wisecracking as the best of them.There are some excellent movie making moments in this with George Lucas and Steven Spielberg showing talent galore just oozing out of every pore where did all that go for Star Wars I to III Mr Lucas? and they end up making an excellently entertaining movie.Some could argue that there could be a bit more depth or seriousness to the story but come on it's a ripping adventure yarn you don't need depth. Saving the Ark from the Nazi's surely that's enough! An excellent movie and great fun too without a doubt one of my favourite of all time.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you've seen this movie and heard the score then my one line summary won't read like a mating call for sheep but rather the absolutely exhilarating Raider's March which stirs my blood and makes me think of an unforgettable hero Indiana Jones. If not see it now.I love going to movies. I always have. I remember when this film came out. My friends had seen it before I had. They boasted it was great the best film ever. Some even said it was better than Star Wars utter blasphemy to a devout 10 year old Jediwannabe. I thought no way is this film better than Star Wars but I was still curious and began the begging of my father to take me.When I was young almost all of the films that I had seen I saw with my Dad. He would take me and my mother would stay at home with my siblings. We saw a number of films that failed to generate a reaction with him as they did with me but this one was different. This one my Dad might've enjoyed just as much.Who can forget the scene where Indy faces bandits in the marketplace fighting swords with his wits and fists only to be finally challenged by a dark robed adversary brandishing a heavy dismembering type of sabre as he swings the impressive blade about his head menacingly?Indiana looks his opponent up and down briefly and draws his pistol casually and shoots the villain dead as if his patience had been tested a moment longer than he could tolerate.My father and the entire audience for that matter laughed and cheered at this incredible scene. And it was the first time I'd actually been aware of his enjoyment of the film. Usually I'm so transfixed that I wouldn't notice if my legs were on fire. He enjoyed it so much that he still tends to bring up that scene even today.My father and I shared a great moment in movie history and I will never forget it for as long as I live. I will always be grateful for the time we spent together and the films that I otherwise would have been unable to see without him taking me.Just a side note about the scene I've described above. It wasn't meant to go that  way at all. As Steven Spielberg explained in a television interview the scene was meant to have an elaborate fight sequence but Harrison Ford was suffering from diarrhea and couldn't go through with the elaborate setup required. Someone said the only way we can finish this scene today is if he shoots him. Steven said Wait a minute we might have something there.As for where it ranks with Star Wars it's hard for me to say so I won't. Star Wars was the first film I ever saw and there's a story in that as well. Thanks again Dad.".

This one my Dad might've enjoyed just as much.Who can forget the scene where Indy faces bandits in the marketplace fighting swords with his wits and fists only to be finally challenged by a dark robed adversary brandishing a heavy dismembering type of sabre as he swings the impressive blade about his head menacingly?Indiana looks his opponent up and down briefly and draws his pistol casually and shoots the villain dead as if his patience had been tested a moment longer than he could tolerate.My father and the entire audience for that matter laughed and cheered at this incredible scene. And it was the first time I'd actually been aware of his enjoyment of the film. Usually I'm so transfixed that I wouldn't notice if my legs were on fire. He enjoyed it so much that he still tends to bring up that scene even today.My father and I shared a great moment in movie history and I will never forget it for as long as I live. I will always be grateful for the time we spent together and the films that I otherwise would have been unable to see without him taking me.Just a side note about the scene I've described above. It wasn't meant to go that  way at all. As Steven Spielberg explained in a television interview the scene was meant to have an elaborate fight sequence but Harrison Ford was suffering from diarrhea and couldn't go through with the elaborate setup required. Someone said the only way we can finish this scene today is if he shoots him. Steven said Wait a minute we might have something there.As for where it ranks with Star Wars it's hard for me to say so I won't. Star Wars was the first film I ever saw and there's a story in that as well. Thanks again Dad.";

	schema:reviewBody "I've seen Raiders of the Lost Ark numerous times on TV DVD and big screen. My local theatre had a special showing last night and the 400seat screen completely sold out as Indy films always do. Luckily for me and my pal we got the last 2 tickets available! I can't think of many films that still sellout 25 years after their original release. There's just something about Indy moviesiconic hero affection epic spectacle that brings you back again and again.The only trouble with that is there are zillions of reviews critiques and dissections of this movie already out there so what I have to offer will probably not be anything new. I will however not go the way of the clich and mention 1930's serials Tom Selleck or the swordgun fight.I will however ask you one question. Did you know that some of the more iconic memorable sequences from Raiders owe quite a lot to Duck Tales? What? Surely it's the other way around? Well no. The globetrotting adventures of Scrooge McDuck Huey Duey Luey and Donald in Carl Bank's Disney comicbooks from the 50s came first. If you can find some of these then you'll surely notice the similarities.The hunt for the Ark of the Covenant is more than just an excuse for action. So many movies these days seem to come up with action first and string them together with some lame plot. Movies like this are quickly forgotten and one of the reasons Raiders holds up so well is because it works the Covenant story so well into the plot.The action comes in a succession of setpieces. I do enjoy films that have to increasingly better themselves in every scene. Raiders introduced this as a standard that the sequels had to live up to. My fave scene has to be the massive truck chase through Egypt which is made up of many of its own smaller sequences. One little idiosyncrasy I like about Indy is that even though he's a College Professor and Doctor he has no beef killing people. So very far from the ubiquitous PC heroes of todays movies.You might think that it's rather geeky to hype up the editing and sound design but they do stand out from recent action movies. The gunfire and punching seem to have a sort of 'Indy' signature sound to them that I've not heard in any other films. And obviously John William's classic score is one of those themes that just everybody in the world knows though I prefer his score to Temple of Doom truly one of the best movie themes ever. Better than Star Wars! I'm not sure if Spielberg planned on Raiders starting the Indy franchise but there's already enough in here to establish a whole universe of potential stories and character arcs. There's talk of a fourth movie at the moment but I personally don't think it will happen and I don't want it to. It's perfect existing as a trilogy and a sequel that comes traipsing in 18 years after the last is just not going to feel right. Even if you are hungry for more Indy then there are loads of books and video games out there and then there's the Young Indiana Jones TV show where are the DVDs? which are official Indy canon and even starred Ford once they bounced around in time.I am giving Raiders 910 because I just have a soft spot for Temple of Doom which is obviously a 1010 movie. Even 25 years after it first came out it still has the power to captivate the audience and provoke sheer excitement every time. And in 25 years it will still be far superior to almost everything.Now there's something you cannot say about The Fast and the Furious! Sigh where did all the special movies go?".

The availability and quality of this film keep raising the bar of what I can get from it.I read someone posted that this is the king of B movies or something of that sort while I honestly think in some scenes like when Indy is running from the Hovitos and he rises over the hill the film had a really strange documentary feeling like if a comic actually came to life and like in the Twilight Zone you were stuck in it. It is great to see this film now that I edit and produce small independent films and have worked in post production in Los Angeles. I honestly think almost every scene in this film is better than what's coming out today in scifiadventure. I might pull back that comment in regards to some nice visuals in Riddick and maybe the new Star Wars Revenge of the Sith but I'm not certain.The amount of time and effort put into the comedy adventure and depth of each character dazzles me because I really can't tell it was filmed the same year Fame was. It really has a unique look to it. The key lighting in the piece is amazing almost everything looks like it was perfectly worked out.My only complaint is the attempt to visualize the opening of the Ark as most of the other scenes don't deal with the supernatural except maybe a burning crate with a nazi symbol on it. George should redo that last scene in my opinion and tighten it up because I really think it wasn't coming together however when I was a child it was so amazing and scary realistic. It's all perspective but my point it that now in this modern filming era the acting and film production is holding tight to this day.I forward you to just enjoy this film and look for things like formulas on chalkboards skeletons in classrooms proper patches on Nazi gear gun accuracy. Research the film's era and background and it only gets better. That's the ability that Spielberg and Lucas have attention to detail and clever twists on most of their bodies of work.Watch this film again it's worth it I promise you.".

	schema:reviewBody "Rating  out of There is no doubt in my mind that Indiana Jones is the best movie series in the history of cinema. And the one start it all was Raiders of the Lost Ark a fastpaced adventure packed with one deathdefying cliffhanger situation after another. To this day Raiders remains one of the best action movies holding up better than most of today's rapidcut MTVstyle thrill rides. Raiders relied on no CGI no flashy editing just pure exhilarating filmmaking and storytelling a combo of its kind that has only been surpassed by its second sequel Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.Harrison Ford stars as Jones an archaeologist who dresses in a brown coat and fedora armed with a revolver and liontaming whip. A delightful opening involving elaborate booby traps informs us he's used to these adventures especially his even closer brushes with death in Temple of Doom which was a prequel. When he returns to the states from his latest excavation he's informed by the military that the Nazis are after the ark of the covenant an artifact that could possess the power to make the Nazis an invincible army. So Jones sets out to retrieve the ark first in what will prove to be one of his greatest adventures.There's probably little doubt that Raiders is the fancritical favorite of the trilogy but there are a few things that I actually have to gripe about blasphemous as it may be. For one even though the story is excellent it's not without its holes. Most perplexing is in the film's opening scenes when we wonder why Jones bothered to bring along potentially traitorous porters when it's such a short distance from the river to the cave temple. Also spoilers one needs only to see the film once to realize that if Indy had never tried to intercept the Ark the Nazis would a have never found it or b still would have suffered the same horrible fate regardless.The action sequences are superb though an early bar shootout isn't quite as adrenalinepumping as it could be and looks quite bland compared to the film's other action scenes. Thankfully the following street chase is playful and exciting and keeps the joyous momentum flowing. Overall I'd still argue that both Temple of Doom and The Last Crusade boast more inventive action but there's no questioning that the action scenes in Raiders are fantastic and likely superior to any film you may have seen the last few years.As bitchy as I may sound I'm not trying to harp on Raiders at least not too much. The movie does feature the famous and deservedly so truck chase one of the most unbelievably thrilling and exhilarating action setpieces I've ever seen and given an extra boost by John Williams' beautifully rousing score. To this day even with the recent chase scenes in The Matrix Reloaded and Terminator 3 this sequence has yet to be surpassed.Other standout sequences include a sarcophagus almost entirely decorated with snakes imposing statues and wellpreserved mummies and Jones' manoamano battle with a seemingly impervious Nazi mechanic. The finale takes the film dangerously close to the horror genre climaxing things with a truly memorable and quite frightening light show for the ages. Every Indiana Jones film has a scene that scarred me as a kid and I think every one who's seen Raiders knows what I'm referring to as well as its sequelsI've said it before Harrison Ford is wonderful as Jones embodying a hero that's cool beyond words yet still entirely human and believable. The supporting cast isn't as up to par Paul Freeman makes for a decent but not particularly menacing villain as Belloq and Karen Allen is somewhat annoying as Indy's love interest but there are an equal share in gems particularly Denholm Elliot as Marcus Brody and John RhysDavies as Sallah The Last Crusade wisely gave these actorscharacters more screen time.Raiders of the Lost Ark was revolutionary cinema paving way for summer blockbusters that would attempt for the same winning mix of thrills and humor. Only its sequels matched andor surpassed it but some have actually come close The Mummy. If you haven't seen Raiders yet put it on the top of your list.".

What you do is produce sequels Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom Indiana Jones and the Amazon Women of the Moon and so on. Each imitation each sequel was less innovative and more desperate and sloppy but that's in the nature of decadence.Harrison Ford whose career this put the stamp of approval on is an archaeologist who is recruited to find the Ark of the Covenant hidden somewhere in the Middle East. It's 1936 and the Nazis are after it and who knows what havoc they might wreak with its powers? Jones drags along Karen Allen a former lover and assistant to provide a pulchritudinous sidekick with whom he can exchange insults. Anything resembling sex is out of the question though just as it would never have been considered in one of the 1930s Saturday afternoon theater serials on which this kind of story is based.Here's the schematic diagram of the plot Introduction suspense action suspense action suspense . . . n. Then the climax  a really BIG action scene.But the thing that made it successful and keeps it so enjoyable after thirty years is that the action wasn't of the usual sort. Oh sure Jones and his girl friend are threatened with immanent death lots of times  involved in comic fist fights shot at with poisoned arrows. That's de rigeur. But how often does a hero find himself dashing through an underground tunnel downhill pursued by a threeton rolling marble? Another element that contributed to its appeal was its reconstruction of the period 1936. The exotic settings of 1936 aren't just rebuilt. They're lovingly reproduced. The ordinary set dressings are there to suggest the exotic  always look for beaded curtains  but the men don't waltz around in immaculate doublebreasted white suits and pith helmets. The settings are overblown to be sure. I strongly doubt that in all of Nepal there was a saloon with the size and atmosphere of Karen Allen's. I'm not at all sure there were ANY saloons in Nepal in 1936. But they're meant to suggest authenticity not embody it and they succeed in an creative way.Finally the characters are kind of enjoyable in themselves from the often frightened and only barely willing Indiana Jones himself through the cartoon Nazis with the monocles and Swastika armbands. Oh boy watch the ark of the covenant MELT them down to nothing while they are frozen in place and screaming! The force unleashed.".

	schema:reviewBody "I understand that I may be forgiven for not thinking 'Citizen Kane' is so great but the following is cinematic heresy I've decided I'm not that crazy about the Indiana Jones series. They're fun films no doubt and there are certainly worse ways to spend a couple of hours. I watched 'The Last Crusade' again not long ago and last night I watched the first one. At the risk of stating the obvious what 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' really has going for it is Harrison Ford and a couple of slambang actionspecial effects sequences. Well you say for cryin' out loud isn't that enough? And yeah I suppose it is. I've just found I'm not nearly as enamored of the series as I once thought I was and each of the films has flaws that perhaps only become apparent on repeated viewings. The aspect of 'Raiders' that grates particularly each time I see it is Karen Allen's performance. I'm sorry I don't find her funny or attractive or even interesting. I understand that the idea is for her to be a feisty tomboy someone who speaks her mind and is more than a match as they say for Ford's Indy. But does that mean Allen's Marion has to be so utterly unattractive in every sense? At times she seems more like a gangly sociallychallenged thirteenyearold who hasn't learned basic table manners yet and who snorts when she laughs. I don't know what's more annoying her behavior or the fact that every male in the film seems to think she's gorgeous. Granted she doesn't have any competition... that must be it. So there's that. The film of course was a trendsetter in many ways resurrecting almost singlehandedly the grand old adventure flick. The durable plot elements and other characters were made to seem fresh again from the resourceful adventurer venturing to exotic lands to those most reliably evil of slimy villains the Nazis. And there is a toughness to the first Indiana Jones movie that seems somewhat lacking in the other two. Both Sallah and Marcus Brody are real characters here alternately serious and amusing. By the time we get to 'Last Crusade' the two men are strictly comic relief and Marcus in particular becomes a scatterbrained buffoon. The climax of 'Raiders' when it finally comes was something of a revelation so to speak at the time. This was the big payoff and it didn't disappoint though it's actually pretty brief. The facemelting and vaporous spirits to be used to a much greater extent later in Spielberg's 'Poltergeist' had audiences wideeyed with amazement. And then a clever little epilogue left cinemagoers feeling satisfied that they'd really gotten their money's worth. I shared all those feelings when I first saw 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' as I said it's only been the last two or three times I've watched it that I haven't been as blown away.".

I know plenty of adults who've never seen it  many who are not mad over it. But I'll admit I've never found anyone who genuinely dislikes it. Apart from me!310";

Ford is great  this is the type of undemanding hero type that he thrives on.  The rest of the cast are good  Freeman and Kahler stand out with their characters.  If it has any weaknesses then the lack of characterisation and plotting are the main suspects but I really think the flaws are greatly outweighed by strengths.Overall a good action film for older families.

	schema:reviewBody "I watched this film on the opening night and I was extremely perplexed walking out. The first thing that puzzled me was how on earth the film got away with a PG rating. I figured it this way. It was trying to be a kids adventure film but was so poor that it needed to compensate through over the top violence and horror. So my puzzlement was how on earth Lucas and Spielberg managed to bend the arms of the censors to get their PG rating which allowed them to keep on marketing the film as childrens fare. And the other thing that puzzled me was that the movie was over before it had even started. I hadnt noticed a story starting anywhere so I was wondering how the movie could have finished. In other words there was no film just a blaze of action and then suddenly the lights coming on. I heard someone comment on the way out Ive never seen anything like that before. I dont know if she meant it in the same way as I did but it was exactly my sentiment. I had never seen anything like that before! A film thats not a film at all! Just an excuse to put one action sequence after another. In fact the censors should have banned the film on account of its having no story. How could Lucas and Spielberg get away with this?! The overall impression I got was that theres something very rotten going on in the film world now.The above response was instantaneous and it was before all the legend around this film had grown up. I didnt think the film was going to be a hit. In fact I thought it was going to fall flat on its face. But the film went on to break boxoffice records everywhere and after the legend had cemented I started to have different feelings. I reasoned that I may have missed something the first time and after reading the umpteenth glowing review the film began to look better in my memory. However a recent viewing helped to dispel all these false notions. It must be stated out and out. This film is bad!!! Theres nothing more to be said about it but theres a lot to be said about the audience. I think its high time that we said a few things about the movie brats and the popular appeal that they court. The thing started proper with Star Wars in 1977 and this is where the Raiders phenomenon begins really. Star Wars is an equally bad movie but it had a few things going for it. It was presented as a myth or fairy tale for the modern age and it worked too. Three reasons for this. One the groundbreaking special effects gave it an epic quality exactly in keeping with the space mythology being presented. Two the Hollywood narrative was totally disbanded giving way for an episodic structure. This helped the mythmaking because without a narrative drive people could read whatever they liked into the movie. And three the notion of an omnipotent force with both a good and dark side captured the imagination of a world moving towards new ageism. So Star Wars started it all and the new age of the Hollywood blockbuster had begun. These films dont rely on the traditional virtues of film anymore. Their aim is no wow audiences with something else more specifically the expensive special effects laden set piece. They cater to the New Age mindset of me me me. People dont go to the watch the stories of other people anymore. They go to participate in the megalomania of the filmmakers who were making inflated films with inflated budgets and inflated subjects. It was the me me me for the filmmakers and the vicarious me me me for the viewers. In short the pornography of self worth. And Raiders is only another early landmark in this trend.Lucas and Spielberg claim to be reviving the B movie adventure serials of the thirties but there is something horribly ingenuous here. B movies are cheaply done purely escapist and never meant to draw attention to themselves. A film like Raiders does nothing but draw attention to itself. Its only an excuse to use the episodic structure so that one setpiece can be followed by another without worrying about character or plot. But all this doesnt explain why Raiders became so popular. I guess the secret lies in the hero  Indiana Jones. When Star Wars kicked off the whole thing there was an epic but no hero. Luke Skywalker is in no sense a hero. Only Hans Solo has a semblance of heroic about him but was much too roguish. I guess the original idea was to get Harrison Ford a new vehicle so that he could be a braver and less cynical Hans Solo. So thats my theory. Raiders is only a continuation of Star Wars supplying the hero which the first film sorely lacked. So Indiana Jones comes along and the definitive American hero for the new age is born. He is up to his neck in Hollywood excess and thats all that matters.So dont be fooled by all these reviews here that praise this film to the skies calling it escapist fun. There may have been some thrills for the audience back in 1981 but most of the excitement was from the audacity of breaking with tradition ignoring story and engagement with the characters concentrating on spectacle and excess and participating in an experience of concerted megalomania. After Star Wars this film really cemented the ground for Hollywood excess. Most of the people here are not judging the film itself. When people say that Star Wars is good I think they are in their New Age pious mood. The same sort of thing when they say that Raiders is good.".

	schema:reviewBody "If the starting point is zero the only way to move is forward said director Hiner Saleems in an interview. His movie Kilomtre zero is made out of this indestructible optimism in the middle of horror.In a small town in the North of Iraq during the times of the First Golf War the Kurd Ako Nazm Kirik is recruited by force to fight against Iran while Saddam Hussein is already preparing his extermination campaign against the Kurdish minority. After some time at the front he gets the order to escort a killed soldier to his family  his chance to escape the war. Together with an Arab driver who treats him only with contempt he takes of for an arduous journey through Iraq.With charm Hiner Saleem masters all the patterns that makes a movie on dictatorship and suppression attractive for the festivals. There is the stagelike minimalism in plot and equipment the impressive photographic production and the excellent choice of music. With so much ability the spectator excuses generously that the plot is getting out of hand in the end. The almost absurd ease is a clear post against melodramatic transfiguration of war  la Hollywood. An important reminder that suffering never can be completely seized by a movie.But what makes this movie really special is something else. It's the small glimpses between the lines of the filmtext. Truly eerie moments in which the movie is dropping all playfulness in front of a scenery of constant murder and terror. There is just nothing like this movie. Over 10 years virtually no movie was produced in the nation of Iraq. This is a piece of movie history.Trivia The constant presence of a huge statue of Exdictator Saddam Hussein on the set was problematic. The sculptor ordered to make this piece of art was once even thrown into prison before the filmmakers could clarify the situation.".

After some time at the front he gets the order to escort a killed soldier to his family  his chance to escape the war. Together with an Arab driver who treats him only with contempt he takes of for an arduous journey through Iraq.With charm Hiner Saleem masters all the patterns that makes a movie on dictatorship and suppression attractive for the festivals. There is the stagelike minimalism in plot and equipment the impressive photographic production and the excellent choice of music. With so much ability the spectator excuses generously that the plot is getting out of hand in the end. The almost absurd ease is a clear post against melodramatic transfiguration of war  la Hollywood. An important reminder that suffering never can be completely seized by a movie.But what makes this movie really special is something else. It's the small glimpses between the lines of the filmtext. Truly eerie moments in which the movie is dropping all playfulness in front of a scenery of constant murder and terror. There is just nothing like this movie. Over 10 years virtually no movie was produced in the nation of Iraq. This is a piece of movie history.Trivia The constant presence of a huge statue of Exdictator Saddam Hussein on the set was problematic. The sculptor ordered to make this piece of art was once even thrown into prison before the filmmakers could clarify the situation.";

As the body rots in the hot midEastern sun the Arab and the Kurd unsuccessfully suppress their animosity towards each other. The hatred which continues to this day although it is both Shiite and Sunni Arabs who hate each other as well as hating the Kurds lends but a small sense of the tragedy that is inevitable in ethnic conflicts. A tragedy seemingly mocked throughout the film by a statue of Saddam Hussein sitting on the back of a flatbed truck running about the countryside in constant salute mutely exhorting Iraqis to the greater glory of the state.Ako does get home and his family's story is somewhat resolved at the end as we fade to April 9 2003 in Paris. On this day we see Ako and his wife together in Paris jubilant at the news of the US taking of Baghdad.

	schema:headline " An emotional and unforgettable experience";
	schema:reviewBody "Despite having the opportunity to see Darren Aronofsky's absolutely extraordinary masterpiece Black Swan at this year's past Toronto International Film Festival I did regret missing out on Danny Boyle's 127 Hours. The film was one of the few to emerge from the festival with momentous Oscar buzz and even a bit of controversy over a specific scene late in the film that was causing people to faint in theatres.The film chronicles the true story of Aron Ralston James Franco a recklessly arrogant mountain climber whose arm gets crushed under a boulder during a trip through Utah canyon country. With no one coming to save him he must decide whether he will die or fight for survival.The logline and description may not sound like much but 127 Hours delivers one of the most riveting and incredibly emotional experiences I have had in a theatre in some time. I was unsure Boyle and his crew could top their Oscarwinning work in Slumdog Millionaire but this film improves upon it in every way possible. Because of all the talk about the scene the majority of people will know how the film ends well before they even consider seeing it. But everything leading up to Aron's lifealtering decision is absolutely amazing and the stuff of pure filmmaking magic.From the very beginning up until the very end you know you are in the hands of some truly special filmmakers specifically Boyle. Everything in the film seems to have a pulse and a life of its own whether it is the hyper kinetic editing the lush and gorgeous cinematography the often epic score the thoughtprovoking writing or just the general style of the film. Where other movies pay very little attention to the little things Boyle and company seem to have amped up the quality in the majority of those areas and made a film whose elements very much complement each other. I could not believe the short running time at first but they pack so much in and the film moves at such an aggressively energetic pace that you barely have time to slow down and breathe once the film really gets moving.One of the unique things that really stood out for me was the use of flashback throughout the film. Ralston spends a lot of time thinking about what brought him to this life changing moment and it is rather interesting how Boyle handles these thoughts. They act specifically as our way into Ralston's life and his character dynamic but they never seem to overtake the bigger picture of his being pinned by the rock. They work rather brilliantly as asides as mere stylishly and crazily edited set pieces a naked party in the back of an SUV is a particular standout. They are among the film's few scenes of character interaction and help the audience adjust deeper and deeper into Ralston's mindset. It aids the film in being an even greater experience of authenticity. His hallucinations are done in very much the same way but do not work nearly as great as these offthewall scenes do.The lengthy cast list may not suggest it but the film is really just the James Franco show. We only get fleeting and stylishly edited glimpses of him at first but after the boulder comes down the film becomes a deeply focused claustrophobic and devastatingly candid character piece driven almost exclusively by facial movements and reactions. 2010 has been a year of transformations by actors and Franco's turn as Ralston is no different. The camera gets right in his face and shows us the gritty reality of his predicament and Franco is eerily authentic in his portrayal. You can see the gradual exhaustion and desperation taking its toll on him you can see the visible fear on his face as he faces life or death. Not many actors are able to drive a film by mainly interacting with themselves and the static objects around them but Franco delivers in spades at every turn. Whether he is being devastatingly hilarious or dead serious he still manages to ensure the realism and intensity of his performance never changes. You will be unable to take your eyes off this riveting portrayal at any time.While it pains me to have to point out the film's small amount of imperfections even with the attention to detail it is only because I cannot wrap my head around the film being absolutely flawless. This is an incredible piece of cinema but there are a few special effects musical and editing choices made that are simply baffling. I understand the point and logistical ideas around some of them but some just stand out as odd. Why point out the insects that inhabit Ralston's surroundings and then make them so CGI'ed that they look visibly fake? Why throw in the out of place tunes to help try and convey his emotions? I know I am pulling at strings but there were at least a handful of elements that seemed out of place and made the film slightly less than perfect. It just seems these extra steps easily could have been made to make the film even more pristine.127 Hours is not just a film  it is an experience. It is only in limited release now but I can only hope that audiences everywhere will get the opportunity to see the movie. It is an amazing movie centred around an absolutely incredible legendary performance. Watching Franco bare his soul onscreen is practically a cleansing experience. I went in with high hopes and left with a huge smile on my face. It is authentically emotional and in a year merely punctuated with a handful of amazing movies amongst a sea of filth it more than just stands out. It is quite simply unforgettable.9.510.".

	schema:reviewBody "I came into this movie with high expectations. Danny Boyle who brought us 28 DAYS LATER and SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE had a lot to live up to with the quality of prior movies and he did not disappoint. He brought the challenge of creating an interesting movie based on our main character being immobile to life and captivating it was. Being stuck with our main character the entire duration of the film was anything but tedious as we follow the thoughts of canyoneer Aron Ralston James Franco as he gets trapped under a rock while exploring the beautiful sights of Utah. The camera does a fabulous job taking us everywhere a wandering mind might migrate in a situation such as this.The human connection element was most fascinating as we wonder what we would do if placed in a similar situation. We are really with Ralston on his journey as we see him discover a reason to live and how his life perspective changes not just how to get free from his predicament. The film manages to stay optimistic and warming despite the frustration and angst felt by Ralston and viewers. And we certainly thank Boyle for some of the lighter moments that temper the severity of the situation.The film does not shy away from tough choices and certainly keeps it real during the entire run especially during the critical climax scene. Despite being stuck in place the movie is fascinating at the pace with which it moves and keeps the audience's attention from start to finish. So while Ralston loves living on the edge we see Boyle create this movie in a similar fashion metaphorically speaking as the intensity and gripping nature of Ralston's circumstances comes alive and sucks us in.In the movie Aron Ralston sets off on a typical weekend excursion being outdoors and with nature. During his journey he befriends a couple of female hikers who are somewhat lost and looking to get back on their way. He shows them the ropes of the canyons and they set off home. Little do they know that their friend will need their help just moments later. Becoming trapped under a rock Ralston now is faced with the challenge of keeping himself alive while trying to break loose from the rock's firm grasp. As Aron works on a solution we see him wonder about the party he's been invited to just hours earlier think about how his has ignored his family wonder about where he left his Gatorade which would keep him hydrated longer do a live interview featuring himself on camera and drink his own urine.I think the part of the movie that moved me the most actually occurred after the climax where we see Ralston broken desperate and willing to end his lonewolf mentality for good. The emotions felt during the last 5 minutes signify human triumph perseverance and the power of the human spirit. Incredible movie a definite mustsee 910 stars".

	schema:headline " You may be dying but the world moves on";
	schema:reviewBody "You may be dying but the world moves on. That is the naked truth about our existence and the main allegory written in the stimulating visual experience provided by Danny Boyle in his latest film. 127 Hours is a wonderful metaphor for solitude and for the importance of what life means at an individual level. It enhances the indescribable experience of having a family friends and love but most of all cherishes the meaning of human contact. Solitude is perceived as being bearable and a lot of times needed but seldom is viewed as being fulfilling. Only when the epiphany pops into our minds we realize what we have been missing. It is a common and frustrating fact. Nonetheless Danny Bolyle's achievement allows a new and fresh take on this theme. The director shows the audiences that life happens when they least expect. And truth be told there is a bright place for those who abandon their egotistical independence and start sharing the events that life provides.Telling a story about a man who is stuck in the same place for such an extensive period of time is definitely not easy. Danny Boyle described the picture as an action movie in which the hero doesn't move and he certainly took the challenge. With this in mind two main conclusions can be withdrawn from Boyle's work 1 He was able to maintain the action dynamic and the viewers engaged through a series of devices that allow them to be interested not only on the hero's present condition but also in his past and quite possibly his future. The mind behind Trainspotting entered the psyche of his new hero and gave it a shape and a texture that transformed the general perception. The empathy towards the character grew and from that moment on the audience grabbed the hook. He was able to dissect James Franco's character thoughts and desires in a moment of extreme physical and psychological agony.2 It was extremely hard to be inventive in such scenario and some techniques proved to be tiresome. In certain moments during the movie Danny Boyle seemed to be trying to hard when having a simpler approach looked like to be more successful. He stylized the action in a way that doesn't always work even considering that he established his filmmaking style from the very beginning.With regards to the main performer it is only fair to praise James Franco's enactment. It is a truly astonishing tourdeforce that will probably be mentioned during the Oscar nominations. He's not only charming and witty but his personality fills the screen with such a great talent. It is very gratifying to observe his evolution according to the character's state of mind.127 Hours is a quite remarkable achievement. There's the ability to pick up a true straightforward story about survival and courage and enhance it through a sheer composition of good sense without falling on the old American clich. This story does not try to be epic or monumental. It tries to be honest and true. And we as viewers don't feel cheated or slapped across the face and that is really all we could ask for.".

	onyx:emotionText "You may be dying but the world moves on. That is the naked truth about our existence and the main allegory written in the stimulating visual experience provided by Danny Boyle in his latest film. 127 Hours is a wonderful metaphor for solitude and for the importance of what life means at an individual level. It enhances the indescribable experience of having a family friends and love but most of all cherishes the meaning of human contact. Solitude is perceived as being bearable and a lot of times needed but seldom is viewed as being fulfilling. Only when the epiphany pops into our minds we realize what we have been missing. It is a common and frustrating fact. Nonetheless Danny Bolyle's achievement allows a new and fresh take on this theme. The director shows the audiences that life happens when they least expect. And truth be told there is a bright place for those who abandon their egotistical independence and start sharing the events that life provides.Telling a story about a man who is stuck in the same place for such an extensive period of time is definitely not easy. Danny Boyle described the picture as an action movie in which the hero doesn't move and he certainly took the challenge. With this in mind two main conclusions can be withdrawn from Boyle's work 1 He was able to maintain the action dynamic and the viewers engaged through a series of devices that allow them to be interested not only on the hero's present condition but also in his past and quite possibly his future. The mind behind Trainspotting entered the psyche of his new hero and gave it a shape and a texture that transformed the general perception. The empathy towards the character grew and from that moment on the audience grabbed the hook. He was able to dissect James Franco's character thoughts and desires in a moment of extreme physical and psychological agony.2 It was extremely hard to be inventive in such scenario and some techniques proved to be tiresome. In certain moments during the movie Danny Boyle seemed to be trying to hard when having a simpler approach looked like to be more successful. He stylized the action in a way that doesn't always work even considering that he established his filmmaking style from the very beginning.With regards to the main performer it is only fair to praise James Franco's enactment. It is a truly astonishing tourdeforce that will probably be mentioned during the Oscar nominations. He's not only charming and witty but his personality fills the screen with such a great talent. It is very gratifying to observe his evolution according to the character's state of mind.127 Hours is a quite remarkable achievement. There's the ability to pick up a true straightforward story about survival and courage and enhance it through a sheer composition of good sense without falling on the old American clich.

I didn't really know what to expect as all I knew was it was based on a true story about a guy getting stuck in a canyon due to a boulder. I decided to give it a shot and well I was amazed by this movie. Danny Boyle continues to give us impressive cinematography and incredible performances in his movie thanks to James Franco who plays as Aron Ralston the mountain climber who gets stuck under the boulder if you didn't already know.I'm not going to go into any big spoilers but it was amazing to see how the movie builds up to the main plot. After getting stuck under a boulder for 5 days you're probably thinking How is this movie going to stay entertaining?. Well we witness some attempts of Aron trying to get out of the boulder as well as using the equipment he brought with him with his backpack to try and survive. He also tries to keep himself awake so that he can live long enough to not die. When all normal attempts to escape fail as a last resort he does something very terrifying to get out. When this scene happened I had to turn away in parts due to how extreme it was!With good uses of hallucinations and flashbacks to keep the story flowing Danny Boyle has managed to make this movie as realistic as possible. Great music great filming and stunning performance. 127 Hours is a fantastic movie about a reallife incident that may be too disturbing to watch for some people but I'd consider it a must see on all grounds. Definitely worthy of getting nominated for Best Picture at least surely?".

	schema:headline " A Triumph";
	schema:reviewBody "Sometimes even oftentimes in the world of film criticism the word triumphant is thrown around. It's often used to describe a film perhaps more often a performance. I've certainly used it it's a term I like to pull out when a film seems to go beyond the call of duty. When it's more than art entertainment or a combination of both. When the story images and characters pop off the screen and go with you and the lasting impression left on you means something more than having killed a couple hours in a big dark room with a bunch of strangers. Now after watching 127 Hours I feel I've never used triumphant in the correct critical context before.James Franco's performance is simply astounding. He as an actor is triumphant because his character is and because he delves into what it means to be bringing this incredible story to life on the big screen for mass consumption. This is a tough role  Franco is basically putting on a oneman show and he does so elegantly. We feel Aron Ralston's pain because Franco feels his pain and shows it in every line of his face verbalizes it with every sigh and lets it control him even as he battles to take control back and find a way out of his dire situation.It's pure masterful art. Franco is simply flawless. Trapped by the boulder much of his performance lies in his facial expressions and he is able to deftly switch from desperation to comedy to a brutal will to survive all while being barely able to move. I've rarely been so impressed by an actor's work Franco is wholly deserving of the Oscar.Danny Boyle's kinetic energetic direction is a perfect match for Franco's easygoing goofiness and even when the film becomes grounded in the narrow canyon where Ralston was trapped Boyle always keeps things interesting. He and cowriter Simon Beaufoy weave flashbacks and hallucinations into Ralston's dilemma to great heartbreaking effect and the premonition that drives Ralston to finally dive wholeheartedly into amputating his own arm is breathtaking in its tenderness.Also impressive is Enrique Chediak and Anthony Dod Mantle's cinematography. Instead of letting the confined space limit their camera techniques they tackle every possible angle often bringing the audience uncomfortably close to the action. Shots through the bottom of Ralston's water bottle mark time and heighten the sense of urgency. The addition of home moviestyle footage brings Ralston even closer to the audience when he expresses his delayed gratitude to his family you'll likely find yourself thinking about the last time you told your parents how much you love them. It's a great device and is put to best use in one of the film's funniest scenes when Ralston interviews himself Gollumstyle. The combination of the dark humor varied cinematography and Franco's impressive facial dexterity pitch the scene perfectly it's a lighter moment that is nevertheless grounded in the gravity of the situation.Complementing and combining Chediak and Mantle's beautiful shots is Jon Harris's dynamic editing. The use of splitscreen is particularly brilliant put to use in innovative ways throughout the film the bookend sequences mark Ralston's departure from and return to society and the technique in general represents the multiple facets of a seemingly simple tale. Yes when it comes down to it 127 Hours is a film about a mountain climber who gets stuck under a boulder and has to cut off his own arm. But it's so much more than that. It's about a man overcoming the physical emotional and intellectual strains of an unthinkable situation. It's about responsibility love and the will to live. Above all it's about the triumph of the human spirit show more clearly and beautifully here than in any other film I can think of.".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review 127 Hours";
	schema:reviewBody "I think the reports and those who claim to have fainted when watching this is probably highly exaggerated. Sure it's graphic but nothing not already seen in a typical torture porn film. Danny Boyle doesn't exploit this inevitable moment through lingering shots or in your face techniques but does enough to bring forth the sheer horror and pain of the entire 127 hours ordeal that culminates with a none too pretty or neat self amputation of a limb taking care of addressing and cutting through skin meat bone and tendon.Based on the memoirs of Aron Ralston's true life experience of literally being stuck between a rock and a hard place which of course makes for a catchy book title while I haven't read that book Danny Boyle has weaved an incredibly fast paced picture from the get go introducing us to Aron the weekend adventurer who takes to the canyons for biking climbing and exploration played to pitch perfection by James Franco in the leading role. Quite the ladies man as well with his boyish charms and manly antics if only to find himself never lingering at one spot always on the go not to allow anything to stand in his way of what could be the best weekend of his life. That is until disaster struck.When we begin from Zero hour you can't help but feel that it's probably going to be the same with another solo constricted space situation captured on film like Buried which had Ryan Reynolds in a one man show buried in a box underground and fighting for his life against his terrorist captors whom you don't see. With the camera constantly pulling to the surface of the earth just to quantify the significance of being alone and the worrying point of having nobody to contact the narrative here doesn't get all claustrophobic on us because Boyle made it a point for the film to be a little expansive with various reminiscence on Aron's part and out of body fantasy and imaginary sequences of being somewhere else other than where Aron currently is.And while that feeling of being confined is nothing new it does make you appreciate and realize that such moments aren't far fetched because with so many idle hours parked in between figuring out and planning how to get out we do that idle daydream even when we're busy so what more when we have time on our hands with literally nowhere else to go? There's a fine balance reached where we see how Aron splits time between keeping and planning to extend his lifespan when he realizes the really deep problem he's rooted in and that of taking time off to think about the larger picture.Which James Franco doesn't disappoint especially when he's chronicling what could be his final hours on earth in his camcorder. He flits from being the really energetic young adult that we get introduced to and the growingly desperate man before basking in exuberance at the new lease of life given to him. If anyone thinks Franco is but a pretty face without substance perhaps 127 Hours will change your mind about the actor probably best known in his support role in Sam Raimi's Spiderman trilogy. It's almost like a one man show for about an hour of the film so much of the weight of the film lies on Franco being able to convince us of the mixed emotions Aron goes through in different periods of the day and those hours which he does.Danny Boyle continues to assert why he's one of the most versatile directors of today tackling a variety of genres never running out of ideas to translate his vision in various films always straddling between telling emotional stories that resonate even if the premise and set up screams commercial. A.R. Rahman the Mozart of Madras continues in his second in as many collaboration with Boyle providing original music that rocks from the start and defines the film just like how his Chaiyya Chaiyya though it was already used for Dil Se did for Spike Lee's Inside Man.If there are messages to gain from the film it is to always prepare for the unexpected pack right and gather enough resources for the what ifs in life and not to be a bastard in relationships keeping an arm's length away from loved ones andor taking them for granted. There could be a time where we find ourselves regretting for not doing some things while we can so I guess it's up to us if we want to live life a day at a time while it's the last or to idle it all away thinking we're invincible and infallible. Highly recommended film befitting of a nomination but whether it could win with such illustrious company this year will be a bit of a stretch.".

	schema:headline " Boyle and Franco turn a true survival story into a powerful statement about living";
	schema:reviewBody "As demonstrated by his ability to earn acclaim in everything from zombie films 28 Days Later to foreign comingofage love stories Slumdog Millionaire Danny Boyle has an extraordinary gift as a filmmaker and in 127 Hours he channels it into an extraordinary story of human willpower. This could have easily been a compelling but plain and ordinary documentary on the Discovery Channel or National Geographic about a man pinned under a boulder who miraculously survives. Boyle however transforms it into a powerful statement about the will to live and where that motivation truly comes from.127 Hours does not simply prove the point that humans will do whatever it takes to survive in dire circumstances. In fact I might argue 9 of 10 people wouldn't do what Aron Ralston James Franco does in this film. Anyway Boyle makes it his mission to use Ralston's incredible true story  one that told at face value would probably just elicit gasps  to alter our perspective on living. What's obvious is that none of the impact of 127 Hours is possible without Franco. A film about a man trapped in a crevice for more than five days needs a heck of a lead actor and Franco despite few dramatic credits to this point proves beyond capable. Although boredom might set in for some during this film given its plot the believability of Franco's performance remains constant and irrefutable. He possesses the funloving and carefree charisma of Ralston then slowly breaks that shell and shows his human fragility.Yet remarkably Boyle leaves a substantial thumbprint on the film much of which he shares with cowriter Simon Beaufoy also of Slumdog. Because the story is so straightforward Boyle recognizes imagery and perception provide his only means of creativity. He shows us inside the tube of Ralston's water backpack water bottle and other closeups all of which seem unnecessary but they establish images which we will come to think about with a different perspective as the film wears on such as when Aron drinks his own settled urine out of the water pouch. Boyle uses the same process shot but suddenly we don't see it the way we did earlier and they become more meaningful than tedious.This subtly effective technique can also be found in the beginning and ending shots of the film. It seems completely random that Boyle would open with crowded streets of people as if he's tricked us and really made Slumdog 2 but the image gains significance after experiencing Ralston's journey.127 Hours will not be kind to people who don't take lightly to seeing blood outside of the shoot 'em up genre. Many of these people will leave the film thinking all they got was shock value but of course there's much more to it. Despite the how will he survive? plot a substantial amount of time is placed on flashes to memories Aron thinks of regarding his family fantasies and of course regrets. Boyle beautifully shows us that although survival seems an inherently selfish thing much of that motivation and will to live comes from other people even total strangers. Aron thinks a lot of the girls Kata Mara and Amber Tamblyn he hiked with just hours before the accident though otherwise he'd have likely forgotten them.The buildup and catharsis of Aron's story might not be the most powerful and uplifting basedontruestory you've witnessed but 127 Hours clearly surpasses expectation in terms of the message it sends and the impact it leaves. With it Boyle solidifies his place as one of those filmmakers you must always have an eye on and Franco emerges as a relatable everyman with aboveeverymangrade talent.Steven CVisit my site httpmoviemusereviews.com".

He possesses the funloving and carefree charisma of Ralston then slowly breaks that shell and shows his human fragility.Yet remarkably Boyle leaves a substantial thumbprint on the film much of which he shares with cowriter Simon Beaufoy also of Slumdog. Because the story is so straightforward Boyle recognizes imagery and perception provide his only means of creativity. He shows us inside the tube of Ralston's water backpack water bottle and other closeups all of which seem unnecessary but they establish images which we will come to think about with a different perspective as the film wears on such as when Aron drinks his own settled urine out of the water pouch. Boyle uses the same process shot but suddenly we don't see it the way we did earlier and they become more meaningful than tedious.This subtly effective technique can also be found in the beginning and ending shots of the film. It seems completely random that Boyle would open with crowded streets of people as if he's tricked us and really made Slumdog 2 but the image gains significance after experiencing Ralston's journey.127 Hours will not be kind to people who don't take lightly to seeing blood outside of the shoot 'em up genre. Many of these people will leave the film thinking all they got was shock value but of course there's much more to it. Despite the how will he survive? plot a substantial amount of time is placed on flashes to memories Aron thinks of regarding his family fantasies and of course regrets. Boyle beautifully shows us that although survival seems an inherently selfish thing much of that motivation and will to live comes from other people even total strangers. Aron thinks a lot of the girls Kata Mara and Amber Tamblyn he hiked with just hours before the accident though otherwise he'd have likely forgotten them.The buildup and catharsis of Aron's story might not be the most powerful and uplifting basedontruestory you've witnessed but 127 Hours clearly surpasses expectation in terms of the message it sends and the impact it leaves. With it Boyle solidifies his place as one of those filmmakers you must always have an eye on and Franco emerges as a relatable everyman with aboveeverymangrade talent.Steven CVisit my site httpmoviemusereviews.com";

	schema:reviewBody "I started loving this film within the first few seconds. 127 Hours begins immediately with the sound of Fresh Blood's Never Hear Surf Music Again There must be some fing chemical chemical in your brain that makes us different from animals makes us all the same. etc... just as featured in the 1st trailer. That notrippedoff euphoric feeling how many times have you seen a trailer with a perfect songmusic and then felt betrayed that it wasn't in the film later... yeah me too carried on all the way through the rest of the film.The film has an energetic start with a split screen showing officebound commutersworkers going along their daily drudge while our lead xtreme bikerhikerclimber Aron Ralston played to perfection by actor James Franco packs his gear unfortunately not finding his Swiss Army knife which might have made a lot of difference to him later on for a trek into Blue John Canyon country in Utah. While on his way he has a brief fun climbingdivingswimming interlude with two female hikers played by Kate Mara and Amber Tamblyn. He then heads off on his own and at about 20 minutes into the movie takes a tumble with a small boulder that ends up pinning his right arm against the side wall of the thin crevice of a canyon. And that is where we are with him for the next 127 hours but only 1 hour of screen time that it takes him to get loose.I'm not going to spoil that resolution here although most will likely hear about it anyway before seeing the movie. An obvious clue that he survives is given by the screen credit early in the film that says it is based on the book Between A Rock And A Hard Place by Aron Ralston. The guy must of survived if he wrote a book about it right? Well you can survive in many ways and not all of them leave you whole both mentally and physically.Director Danny Boyle brings a lot of the key Oscarwinning players of the Slumdog team back for this new film. Screenwriter Simon Beaufoy soundtrack composer A.R.Rahman and cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle this time paired with Enrique Chediak are chief among those. As an added bonus from the director of the toiletdiving cam in Trainspotting we now have the desperately thirsty character saves his own urine so it can be filmed while drunk through a tubecam in this movie.At the Toronto Film Festival's 2nd screening of the film Boyle was there to take questions from the audience and his enthusiasm and excitement about the film were infectious. Tidbits included his talking about their 6 days of location shooting followed by a soundstage recreation of the canyon based on 3D scanning imagery. Boyle also praised actor James Franco and emphasized how every time we see him in a new film he is stretching his talents and abilities unlike many lead actors who are just basically playing themselves in various different situations.Boyle said that for an audience to watch what would otherwise be deemed unwatchable you either had to be making a schlockynottobetakenseriously horror movie OR you had to make the audience completely identify with the character to the extent that they would believe that they themselves would have done the exact same thing to save themselves if they had to. Well Boyle succeeds in making you believe it.Seen at the Ryerson Theatre Toronto Sept. 13 2010. 2nd screening of 3 at TIFF 2010.".

	schema:headline " It's Not About The Arm";
	schema:reviewBody "You have probably heard the story about the man that went canyoneering alone in Utah in 2003 not telling anyone where he was going. Five days later he emerged out of the Utah canyons missing an arm. He had become wedged between a rock and a hard place literally and eventually had to cut his own arm off in order to survive. If you were like me you probably thought to yourself Wow what an awful experience I bet that sucks. Oh well back to my life. The truth is that the self amputation handiwork is not even close to what the man Aron Ralston had to go through for the first 124 hours of his ordeal. Having read It's Not About the Bike by Lance Armstrong I think it is fair to compare the two stories not only about survivorship but also about the bigger picture in which we call life. You have probably also heard how Armstrong survived testicular cancer to go on to win the Tour De France seven times. Again you might have thought to yourself Wow he had a small bout with cancer and now everything is all right. Oh well back to my life. The severe gravity of these situations don't settle in until you hear or see the personal stories of what these individuals endured to earn their lives back. Danny Boyle is the director who helped bring Ralston's excruciating story to the screen in 127 Hours. Boyle with an eclectic resume including a movie about heroin addiction Trainspotting a movie about two youngsters finding a bag of money Millions and a Bollywood movie Slumdog Millionaire focused on the events that put the viewer in Ralston's position then made that viewer understand that there was only two ways out of the cavern.We start the story with Ralston played by James Franco driving out to the Utah canyons while inconveniently forgetting his Swiss Army knife at home he would need that later. He runs into two young female hikers and introduces them to an underground swimming hole. Not knowing these are the last two people he will have contact with for quite some time.After parting ways with the hikers Ralston tumbles down a narrow canyon and his right arm becomes wedged between a small boulder and the canyon wall. He has the exact same reaction that I would have AGGHHHH!!! I understood his anger because I too would react in the same way. I too would not accept my situation. I too would be cursing at the rock.Before this movie I did wonder how Boyle was going to keep us engaged for the length of the film. It's a hard task considering Ralston was in one place for five days. Boyle along with Franco's brilliant acting was able to keep us flowing from day to day. Sure there are the flash back scenes and a few ScoobyDoo induced hallucinations. But the one thing that kept my attention was what Ralston actually did while trapped in the crevice. He had a video camera and he videotaped himself giving an ultimate gratitude list to his parents and friends. Even in his dying hours he wanted his parents to know how he felt about them. He even went as far as producing a humorous morning talk show with himself. It was real and it worked. That video is now in a safety deposit box where only a few sets of eyes have seen it.Should you see this movie? Yes but don't see it because a guy cuts off his arm to survive. See it because you want a story about why a guy cuts off his own arm to survive. See it because you need to know the answer to what you would do if you were in Ralston's predicament. See it because you are the type of person to quote an earlier Boyle movie to choose life and you know deep down inside that there is a force driving you.".

	schema:reviewBody "Danny Boyle deserves all the credit in the world for this directorial achievement. Personally I think he did an outstanding thing taking on a subject which is hard to put on screen for one hour and half and keep you interested in the character and keep things entertaining the true story of Aron Ralston a mountain climber who had to resort to one of the most desperate measures in order to fade death.A profound survival story that doesn't get too melodramatic nor boring or predictable. It challenges the viewer by putting him through the same experience as Aron's thanks to the amazing study of his character and his survival process. 127 Hours entertains by mixing up humor with drama and tense situations. A great journey through Aron's personal experience that goes from his first moments of clarity and then sanity disappointment and hope through his hallucinations and premonitions through his both states of denial and acceptance of the upcoming result and ultimately through his impressive ambition and desire to live and not accept death as a denouement. James Franco is responsible for caring this movie and make it entertaining thanks to his moving performance. He manages so well to balance his emotional state and play with his own sanity. His presence on the screen kept the audience in the back of their seats. Speaking of being in the back of the seat I heard a lot of talk about the cutting arm sequence which made people fainted or whatever. I expected it to be some gore stuff but it turned out to be more than just OK. It was nothing that harsh to watch... I don't know. Maybe for some really sensitive guys the scene might be a problem but for me it was really nothing that outrageous.Combining the nonconformism in editing with great photography beautiful landscapes and amazing cinematography 127 Hours standsout as a striking visually piece of filmmaking. The scenes were cut and put together in an intelligent manor and that majorly helped the movie's pacing. The soundtrack is also one of the best I've heard in a long time. A.R. Rahman is responsible for this beautiful mixture of tribal techno music and uplifting pure melody. The most impressive piece of music I consider it to be within the last couple of minutes right before his salvation and Dido's vocal performance in the film was destined to make the public to engage emotionally in the movie.127 Hours is another big step in Danny Boyle's career. A strong film that paints the road to survival filled with hope and deception. Carried by a strong performance by a solid narrative structure and dazzling technical detail 127 Hours needs to be in anyone's top 10 of 2010.".

	schema:headline " 127 Hours is a fantastic look at the strength of the human spirit.";
	schema:reviewBody "Danny Boyle has always been an indie favourite consistently producing  excellent films in many different genres. However his films never  enjoyed the boxoffice reach they deserved. That is until his 2008  surprise blockbuster Slumdog Millionaire broke all expectations. It was  a film that would then allow Danny Boyle to create whatever film  project he wanted with presumably whatever budget he needed.   This is a dream situation for any director but instead of taking the  opportunity to direct a massive budget film he writes and directs 127  Hours. The film which tells the incredible true story of Aron Ralston  could be handled in incredibly different ways. Luckily Boyle's film  about a man having to cut off his own arm doesn't leave you feeling  depressed but rather it is energetic and lifeaffirming. The film  doesn't tone down any of the difficult aspects in fact it throws them  right in your face. However what makes this film so fantastic is that  Boyle's style matches Ralston's view on life and explanation for  surviving the awful ordeal.   The film begins at a furiously kinetic pace one you would be hard  pressed to find in an action film. It is a jolt to the senses and it  sets the perfect mood for the film. It is not making light of a  terrible situation but rather putting you in the mind set that Aron  Ralston was in before the accident occurred. What makes this  directorial decision so important is the fact that without  understanding the kind of person he was we couldn't understand how he  survived the awful ordeal he was in.  This is what makes Boyle perfect for the material where another  director would most likely go very minimalist Boyle goes all out in  terms of style without ever losing the emotional connection. Boyle's  stylistic choices heighten emotional integrity where as other  directors' use of style is often just visual stimulation.   As important Boyle's direction was to making the film great if it were  not for James Franco's performance as Aron the film would have failed.  Franco gives one of the strongest performances of his career if not  his best. His performance could very easily have become showy and  overly dramatic yet Franco was smart enough to restrain himself until  the moment called for dramatics.   It would be a real shame to forget the unsung heroes of this film the  two directors of photography Enrique Chediak and Anthony Dod Mantle.  As the film features for the most part one man on screen for the  duration Boyle decided to make the visuals into their own characters.  To do this he employed two fantastic directors of photography to make  the visuals competing characters. As the film progressed remembering  the incredibly impressive shots became harder and harder to a point  where I lost count. The film features some of the most memorable shots  of Boyle's career many of which leave you wondering how they possibly  accomplished them.  Danny Boyle has made a career of films about men who are pushed to  their absolute limits yet the films always leave you feeling better  than when you arrived. He does not muddy his films with sentimentality  or out of place scenes to make the audience feel better but his films  still leave you feeling an energy for life. It is his talent of finding  the strength within people and his natural ability to present it to us  that makes his films so powerful. 127 Hours is one of the rare films  that leaves an audience in their seats during the credits and for  many even after the credits are done their scroll.".

	onyx:emotionText "Danny Boyle has always been an indie favourite consistently producing  excellent films in many different genres. However his films never  enjoyed the boxoffice reach they deserved. That is until his 2008  surprise blockbuster Slumdog Millionaire broke all expectations. It was  a film that would then allow Danny Boyle to create whatever film  project he wanted with presumably whatever budget he needed.   This is a dream situation for any director but instead of taking the  opportunity to direct a massive budget film he writes and directs 127  Hours. The film which tells the incredible true story of Aron Ralston  could be handled in incredibly different ways. Luckily Boyle's film  about a man having to cut off his own arm doesn't leave you feeling  depressed but rather it is energetic and lifeaffirming. The film  doesn't tone down any of the difficult aspects in fact it throws them  right in your face. However what makes this film so fantastic is that  Boyle's style matches Ralston's view on life and explanation for  surviving the awful ordeal.   The film begins at a furiously kinetic pace one you would be hard  pressed to find in an action film. It is a jolt to the senses and it  sets the perfect mood for the film. It is not making light of a  terrible situation but rather putting you in the mind set that Aron  Ralston was in before the accident occurred. What makes this  directorial decision so important is the fact that without  understanding the kind of person he was we couldn't understand how he  survived the awful ordeal he was in.  This is what makes Boyle perfect for the material where another  director would most likely go very minimalist Boyle goes all out in  terms of style without ever losing the emotional connection. Boyle's  stylistic choices heighten emotional integrity where as other  directors' use of style is often just visual stimulation.   As important Boyle's direction was to making the film great if it were  not for James Franco's performance as Aron the film would have failed.  Franco gives one of the strongest performances of his career if not  his best. His performance could very easily have become showy and  overly dramatic yet Franco was smart enough to restrain himself until  the moment called for dramatics.   It would be a real shame to forget the unsung heroes of this film the  two directors of photography Enrique Chediak and Anthony Dod Mantle.  As the film features for the most part one man on screen for the  duration Boyle decided to make the visuals into their own characters.  To do this he employed two fantastic directors of photography to make  the visuals competing characters. As the film progressed remembering  the incredibly impressive shots became harder and harder to a point  where I lost count. The film features some of the most memorable shots  of Boyle's career many of which leave you wondering how they possibly  accomplished them.  Danny Boyle has made a career of films about men who are pushed to  their absolute limits yet the films always leave you feeling better  than when you arrived. He does not muddy his films with sentimentality  or out of place scenes to make the audience feel better but his films  still leave you feeling an energy for life. It is his talent of finding  the strength within people and his natural ability to present it to us  that makes his films so powerful. 127 Hours is one of the rare films  that leaves an audience in their seats during the credits and for  many even after the credits are done their scroll.";

This movie is so inspirational moving intimate and makes you want to live life to the fullest and it shows how precious life is you'll be thankful to be alive and well. The cinematography is outstanding in this and Danny Boyle deserves an Oscar for best director because this is ten times better than Slumdog Millionaire.

Why does it get so high of a score?I knew right from the start this movie was going to be an awful experience. I knew right from the start it had two ingredients that would kill this movie for me. Firstly it is based upon real event and an interpretation of real events is always such a delight to witness. And secondly it was about a guy talking to himself for ninety five percent of the movie. To me even one of those two reagents is a no go.But alas I was in a way dragged in to see it nothing I could do about it. And the reason I hated this movie so much wasn't because of the two constructs established but a third I wasn't aware of before a movie ended. If it hadn't been for the third thing I wouldn't even waste my time on writing a review.And the third thing is it tries to convey a wrong message and does so poorly!There is a fundamental difference between being a loner and being an idiot. And our beloved protagonist played by Jim Franco is exactly both. But the funny thing is that the movie blames all his misfortunes not on him being an idiot but rather on him being a loner.I am a cynical loner myself. You could argue about my level of intelligence but in all of my individualism I would never go mountain or cave climbing alone without telling my relatives my exact route estimated times of arrival at each checkpoint and bringing both a long range mobile phone and GPS along with a massive amount of supplies with me.And that antihero of ours does neither of those things! And what does he blame it all on? Ooh he's a lone hero he doesn't need anyone. No no he's not stupid he's just a loner. Ugh what a load of bull.And the way they shove this idiotic notion in our faces is anything but subtle. That's why as I said earlier it tries to convey a wrong message poorly. That's about it when the movie becomes a total pile of steaming junk culminating at the end. Else I could at least let them score a point for telling an idea albeit a wrong one in a right way.This movie is nothing more than another piece of societal propaganda preaching and forcing their morals and values on us the individuals. But don't believe a word I say without proof. Watch it and judge for yourself but approach it very carefully as such movies are dangerous.".

	schema:reviewBody "We all know the story and it's outcome. Yet we want to see it for ourselves out of curiosity if the story is somewhat interesting after hearing the headlines. Isn't that true of every true story that is portrayed on film? People have commented that Aron Ralston is a loner and an idiot and give the movie 2 stars or less. How is that a bad comment about the story in the film? The character himself and therefore the real person calls himself these very things! As a loner he felt invincible yet as a self declared idiot he has the intelligence to admit how stupid of a thing he had done. Yes we can all sit on our little chairs and watch the movie and call him an idiot for not telling anyone where he's going or what he's doing... like we've NEVER done something idiotic before. Sure perhaps our very own moment of lack of good judgment has not put us in a situation that we may have sealed our own doom...for Ralston he had to come to terms with himself that indeed he may have just killed himself unintentionally.People also commented that he survives by sheer luck. To them I say can YOU survive for 6 days doing the same things Ralston did? Forget the idea that you would never be so stupid. The point is if it were to happen to you what would YOU have done? Would you even have stopped for a moment to leave a video for your loved onesloner that you are?People still commented that Ralston felt no pain. We could dismiss the initial accident as being in shock. Later on he shows a great deal of pain...and ingenuity. When I myself had an oops moment with a stupid chainsaw cutting a hole in my knee I didn't feel one ounce of pain. I just kept saying to myself how could I be so stupid to have not been more careful. If you only hated this movie because it is about one person for most of the film stuck in a canyon hallucinating about life screaming out for help ONCE and hating yourself for doing so because you know no one is out there to hear you and you know yelling is futile by the way people commented that they would be yelling out  for what? save your energy and look for other viable solutions idiot! contemplating taking your own life because of your incredible mistake you've made making a final decision  one that would leave you crippled  and I mean no offense to amputees still knowing that even without your right arm you still have to carry your bloodied self weak from dehydration and having lost over 40 pounds in 6 days I kid you not to the HOPE of safety...if you hated this movie for reasons such as these...then you've never had a true oops moment. You are perfect...perfectly lying to yourself.".

Isn't that true of every true story that is portrayed on film? People have commented that Aron Ralston is a loner and an idiot and give the movie 2 stars or less. How is that a bad comment about the story in the film? The character himself and therefore the real person calls himself these very things! As a loner he felt invincible yet as a self declared idiot he has the intelligence to admit how stupid of a thing he had done. Yes we can all sit on our little chairs and watch the movie and call him an idiot for not telling anyone where he's going or what he's doing... like we've NEVER done something idiotic before. Sure perhaps our very own moment of lack of good judgment has not put us in a situation that we may have sealed our own doom...for Ralston he had to come to terms with himself that indeed he may have just killed himself unintentionally.People also commented that he survives by sheer luck. To them I say can YOU survive for 6 days doing the same things Ralston did? Forget the idea that you would never be so stupid. The point is if it were to happen to you what would YOU have done? Would you even have stopped for a moment to leave a video for your loved onesloner that you are?People still commented that Ralston felt no pain. We could dismiss the initial accident as being in shock. Later on he shows a great deal of pain...and ingenuity. When I myself had an oops moment with a stupid chainsaw cutting a hole in my knee I didn't feel one ounce of pain. I just kept saying to myself how could I be so stupid to have not been more careful. If you only hated this movie because it is about one person for most of the film stuck in a canyon hallucinating about life screaming out for help ONCE and hating yourself for doing so because you know no one is out there to hear you and you know yelling is futile by the way people commented that they would be yelling out  for what? save your energy and look for other viable solutions idiot! contemplating taking your own life because of your incredible mistake you've made making a final decision  one that would leave you crippled  and I mean no offense to amputees still knowing that even without your right arm you still have to carry your bloodied self weak from dehydration and having lost over 40 pounds in 6 days I kid you not to the HOPE of safety...if you hated this movie for reasons such as these...then you've never had a true oops moment. You are perfect...perfectly lying to yourself.";

This was my first feature experience and working for Tim Burton was a hell of a way to start.But even as someone with a lot of time for his films and a preexisting bias I couldn't really connect with this. The cast acquit themselves well especially considering the noted difficulty in emoting to a tennis ball on a stick but all their tics and quirks seem to be masking a void at the centre of what should be a freefloating evocative trip. Sure it's weird looking but we've seen it before and back then in films like Edward Scissorhands it had a sense of purpose. Now we're left exploring a CGI wonderland that seems to be without a great deal of wonder. The book revels in its bizarre environs absurd dialogue and whimsical characters. This film grounds them drains them of that mystery and leaves us with a colourful but forgettable retread. It seems intent on driving us to a narrative conclusion that few people will have had much stake in through its running time simply because we're not giving much to care for.With a source material so familiar even to those whose knowledge is second hand references there needs to be a degree of innovation as in Svenkmejer's dark stopmotion version or the coopting of Terry Gilliam in to his Tideland narrative or else a studious and inspired adaptation that completely returns to Lewis Carroll. What we end up with is a midpoint that fails to get to grips with what enchants people about the Alice story and another chance to see a beautiful waif walk around twisted quasiGothic landscapes to a score by Danny Elfman.Not that this isn't an enjoyable experience in itself and as seen in the vast Screen 1 at the Empire it is at times breathtakingly pretty. It's just inessential and while it may be unfair to expect a classic from a favoured filmmaker every time out when they tackle something with the pedigree and history of Alice In Wonderland you can't help but hope for something special. And that's the problem that Tim Burton while he is still making decent films has been a long way off special for some time now.610 if they gave half stars it'd be 6.5 but that doesn't mean it's a bad film. It's possible that my grade is affected by high expectations and lost potential. If you have kids I'm sure it'll be better than 90 of the dross that passes for family films now. At least there is some artistry involved and while he might not be at his best I'll still always pay to see a Tim Burton film although I got this one for free...".

	schema:reviewBody "Sometimes I think that I should like Tim Burton movies more than I do. Don't get me wrong the man has made some excellent films such as the masterful Ed Wood. But all too often despite an agreeable tendency towards visual flamboyance I leave his films feeling somewhat underwhelmed. Alice in Wonderland is a case in point. It's a movie where CGI effects rule the day. But the trouble is that the true weirdness that is at the heart of this story is not captured at all with all the computergenerated imagery onscreen. Sure it's very efficient and welldesigned but like CGI in general it's far too polished to really strike a chord and convince. There is a distinct lack of wonder in this Wonderland. The otherworldly weirdness is dissipated too by the use of overlyfamiliar voices to give life to the various denizens of this world we are left thinking 'Oh that's Stephen Fry hey isn't that Alan Rickman I'm sure that's Christopher Lee and isn't that the bloke from Little Britain etc'. It consistently takes us out of the movie and grounds the characters in a way that is just counterproductive. We want weirdness from an Alice in Wonderland film not slick CGI and famous voiceover actors.There is also a dangerously cosy predictability at play here too. Tim Burton Johnny Depp Danny Elfman  they say familiarity breeds contempt well that's a bit strong but it IS seriously lacking in surprises and you cannot help think that all three individually talented men could do with taking a break from each other for the good of their careers. Depp's Mad Hatter is pretty uninspired by his standards while Burton's visuals and Elfman's music are nice but ultimately completely forgettable. I found it very difficult to care for any of the characters in this film and that is never a good thing. It also meant that the conclusion came across as deeply trite as we have been given nothing to empathize with. We don't know or have any interest in these characters so when Alice goes around her extended family one by one imparting her new knowledge onto them it means nothing. It also doesn't help that the journey to Wonderland has made absolutely no difference at all to the title character's state of mind  at the beginning she does not want to get married to the upperclass chump and at the end she does not want to get married to the upperclass chump. So you are left wondering what exactly was the point?I saw this in 3D and if there is one thing that this film has taught me it's that I am done with this 'new and improved' technology. I sensed it was a gimmick even before I watched Avatar now I am certain. A bad film is a bad film and no amount of extra visual depth is going to change that one iota. It's all surfaceveneer and really that's this movie's ultimate problem there is nothing of interest within the CGI3D. A great shame as the source material is undeniably compelling.I realize that I am almost done here but I have not even mentioned the worst thing about the film. What was it? It was when the Mad Hatter and then subsequently Alice do a truly cringeworthy little dance near the end of the film. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I halfexpected Britain's Got Talent winners Diversity to pop up in a cameo appearance at this stage and join in with some urban street dancing manoeuvres. That didn't happen.

	onyx:emotionText "Sometimes I think that I should like Tim Burton movies more than I do. Don't get me wrong the man has made some excellent films such as the masterful Ed Wood. But all too often despite an agreeable tendency towards visual flamboyance I leave his films feeling somewhat underwhelmed. Alice in Wonderland is a case in point. It's a movie where CGI effects rule the day. But the trouble is that the true weirdness that is at the heart of this story is not captured at all with all the computergenerated imagery onscreen. Sure it's very efficient and welldesigned but like CGI in general it's far too polished to really strike a chord and convince. There is a distinct lack of wonder in this Wonderland. The otherworldly weirdness is dissipated too by the use of overlyfamiliar voices to give life to the various denizens of this world we are left thinking 'Oh that's Stephen Fry hey isn't that Alan Rickman I'm sure that's Christopher Lee and isn't that the bloke from Little Britain etc'. It consistently takes us out of the movie and grounds the characters in a way that is just counterproductive. We want weirdness from an Alice in Wonderland film not slick CGI and famous voiceover actors.There is also a dangerously cosy predictability at play here too. Tim Burton Johnny Depp Danny Elfman  they say familiarity breeds contempt well that's a bit strong but it IS seriously lacking in surprises and you cannot help think that all three individually talented men could do with taking a break from each other for the good of their careers. Depp's Mad Hatter is pretty uninspired by his standards while Burton's visuals and Elfman's music are nice but ultimately completely forgettable. I found it very difficult to care for any of the characters in this film and that is never a good thing. It also meant that the conclusion came across as deeply trite as we have been given nothing to empathize with. We don't know or have any interest in these characters so when Alice goes around her extended family one by one imparting her new knowledge onto them it means nothing. It also doesn't help that the journey to Wonderland has made absolutely no difference at all to the title character's state of mind  at the beginning she does not want to get married to the upperclass chump and at the end she does not want to get married to the upperclass chump.

I came out of the theater wondering if it were just the mediocre script or the director who had failed to meet my expectations. The best part of this movie is probably Johnny Depps portrayal of the mad hatter who truly is mad. However Mia Wasikowska presents Alice in a dull manner that had me checking my watch every ten or fifteen minutes. Overall this film isn't awful but at the same time its no masterpiece for an interesting film to look at I suppose this would be an alright choice however if you want a great story and compelling acting you might want to check out something else because this isn't the movie you're looking for.".

Surely there is a creative reason to pull her back into the zany world. Nope she merely felt the urge to chase a rabbit who himself was seeking to fulfill a prophecy. And so Alice in roped back into the world of fantasyabsurdity.If you've seen anything at all on this movie then the strengths are obvious. It's Disney it's CGI loaded it's in 3D. Everything visual is well appointed with lavish detail. It makes me wonder if director Tim Burton is better suited as a set designer since he is always given projects for his vision. I recall a time where his vision wasn't hampered by the concepts of others at time when his films were so wholly original that nothing else compared and sadly he's been stuck in a limbo of revisions for a decade.For a girl who can't remember anything Alice is never surprised. She sees giant creatures she shrinks flies on a hat all without a yelp. The first person to blame would be Burton since Wasikowska lacks leading experience. Still I wonder what's going through her head when she decided to play Alice as oppressively jaded. Outside the last ten minutes she's the antithesis of Dorothy. Having a protagonist who's so down trodden in a beautiful world is counterintuitive.Johnny Depp. You pay the man and he'll do his thing. I can't tell you that his character The Mad Hatter is an original. I'm sure it's a combination of other Depp figurines. With the Hatter he has carte blanche to do anything anything at all and somehow be considered in character. It doesn't matter that he's periodically possessed by a Scotsmanhe's in character and he's Johnny Depp so it must be fantastic right? More amusing are Helena Bonham Carter and Crispin Glover the latter of whom you wouldn't recognize.The White Queen Anne Hathaway was in position to be the most complex element of the film. I suppose her role is to assume power in the event that her sister is dethroned. For a character who talks a big game of peace she sure does mix together an abhorrent potion to return Alice to normal size. Despite repeatedly saying she represents good I didn't see any evidence. Toes would have been crushed I'm sure but the vibe from Anne's portrayal suggested that she wanted to be the calculating nemesis.I can't tell you how stupid this movie made me feel. For some reason it figured a major plot point would be found in determining the identity of Alice. If you are seated in the theatre watching a film called Alice in Wonderland you will not be surprised to find that the lead character of Alice is indeed the very same mentioned in the title. Why we spend most of the film getting to this conclusion feels like an attempt to recreate Hook. By the end you realize that Alice is the problem with Wonderland. In the 13 years she's been gone her friends seem to be in good health despite the Red Queen reigning over the land. Why are they looking for her now? The Red Queen was in power this whole time and they seem to be in good shape but when Alice gets there the queen challenges them. I suppose she's just as upset to have such a lifeless young girl in her land. I for one am disenchanted.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was able to catch a prescreening of Alice in Wonderland tonight on March 2nd. Despite some pretty nifty visuals and jaw dropping set pieces I found the movie to be incredibly dull flat and utterly full of itself. The film is merely a vehicle for Johnny Depp to showcase his talents and he portrays the Mad Hatter as an actor who can't quite find the right shoes to fill in the role. He rotates from a Scottish brogue to a feminine lisp and staggers once in awhile as the unmistakable character of Captain Jack Sparrow. Where the visuals triumph the story lacks. The proposed 'sequel' to Alice in Wonderland is literally a rehash of most of the finer points of the original except a lot more Johnny Depp a character who the audience is supposed to sympathize with and root for but who i found a bit annoying and tiresome after awhile. The plot is fairly simple. Alice the stone faced newcomer Mia Wasisoska whose acting is limited to mildly concerned mildly puzzled and mildly agitated flees from an arranged marriage proposal from a wealthy lord. She follows a curious white rabbit and tumbles down a hole into Underland referred to as Wonderland by Alice. She then meets a variety of odd characters most of them familiar from the original Alice. The plot is fairly simplistic and a tad boneheaded. The Red Queen Bonham Carter slightly overdoing it but arguably the best actor of the bunch rules the land but is pitted against the tiresome goodness and light of her sister The White Queen Hathaway doing an airheaded imitation of you guessed it Captain Jack Sparrow. Alice is destined by some ancient scroll to defeat the Jabberwocky and end The Red Queen's reign of terror. Alice boils down to mere eye candysomething that is visually pleasing but is only a piece of fluff. If your a fan of Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory this movie is right up your ally. I prefer Burton at his best with movies that attempt to involve the audience like Edward Scissorhands Ed Wood and Big Fish. However this bloated mess is sure to rank in hundreds of millions of dollars but it tugs at our wallets rather than our hearts. It's a scary thought but I hope that Burton's best work isn't behind him. 410".

He rotates from a Scottish brogue to a feminine lisp and staggers once in awhile as the unmistakable character of Captain Jack Sparrow. Where the visuals triumph the story lacks. The proposed 'sequel' to Alice in Wonderland is literally a rehash of most of the finer points of the original except a lot more Johnny Depp a character who the audience is supposed to sympathize with and root for but who i found a bit annoying and tiresome after awhile. The plot is fairly simple. Alice the stone faced newcomer Mia Wasisoska whose acting is limited to mildly concerned mildly puzzled and mildly agitated flees from an arranged marriage proposal from a wealthy lord. She follows a curious white rabbit and tumbles down a hole into Underland referred to as Wonderland by Alice. She then meets a variety of odd characters most of them familiar from the original Alice. The plot is fairly simplistic and a tad boneheaded. The Red Queen Bonham Carter slightly overdoing it but arguably the best actor of the bunch rules the land but is pitted against the tiresome goodness and light of her sister The White Queen Hathaway doing an airheaded imitation of you guessed it Captain Jack Sparrow. Alice is destined by some ancient scroll to defeat the Jabberwocky and end The Red Queen's reign of terror. Alice boils down to mere eye candysomething that is visually pleasing but is only a piece of fluff. If your a fan of Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory this movie is right up your ally. I prefer Burton at his best with movies that attempt to involve the audience like Edward Scissorhands Ed Wood and Big Fish. However this bloated mess is sure to rank in hundreds of millions of dollars but it tugs at our wallets rather than our hearts. It's a scary thought but I hope that Burton's best work isn't behind him. 410";

	schema:reviewBody "Oh...the irony of it. As probably many know Tim Burton started as an employee of Disney. But his work was considered too frightening and surreal and soon he was fired. Now this movie marked his return. This alone should tell the story. Face it we never liked Tim Burton for his amazing skill to write dialogues for the deep characters he create because not counting Edward Scissorhand there were none. We liked him because he was a big kid with a fascinating dark twisted imagination. He had style and creativity. Now the kid is all grown up and became a moneyhungry prostitute. Sad and harsh. But true. Sweeney Todd was the first sign and this....this piece of... By the way i really had enough of Disney too they evolved completely into a regrettable monstrosity. Poor Lewis Carroll. And poor other artists you ripped off to make ridicoulus amount of money lately. You really have no shame left? When it comes to nowadays Disney i always imagine a scene from an average highschool movie. You know where the strong and dumb jock terrorises the nerd and when the nerd asks why he says because i can you cant stop me. Yes congratulation Disney a dead artist really cant stop you from completely destroying ruining nullifying his work. You really have no shame left? Sadly the answer is pretty clear. The only decent scene was the one with the execution. The other were only eyecandy without any hint of meaning or depth. Oh and congratulation for one more thing you even managed to completely ruin even the ending credits with that earraping dumb teenagepoprock whatever piece of trash song too. Its not everyday when a bitter and sour cake is topped so nicely with such a disgusting topping you really done something extraordenary but at least it was fitting. Tim Burton will never read this sadly but for what it worth i admired his work now i officially turn my back on everything he creates and let the little goths drool about it they are still young they might grow out of it someday too.".

	schema:reviewBody "I loved Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and remember it as an amazing and timeless adventure indeed. Alice wanders around in a world so enigmatic and unstable that you never know what will happen next and what twist will put Alice in just new trouble often unintentionally and tragically made worse by her own doing. Now this is all exactly what this movie does not have. After Alice arrives in the new 'underland' you will soon be in on the entire story It is two sides good against evil and Alice is to slay a monster. Not a single second is unexpected. Nor are there any twists. But even the first minutes are astonishingly wanting any concept Scenes without any real characters rush by there is no focus of attention in the opening. But most of all my understanding of then brand Alice is that she originally wanders around a dream land that confronts her with her own self her anxieties her shadowy anticipation that things will not be all nice and easy all taking shape in landscapes characters and events painted in dreamlanguage. Of this essence it should be no problem to create a movie that really leaves an impression  let alone if Tim Burton is in the team. But there is nothing nothing of this concept in this movie. Instead of joining a charismatic and mature character on the journey through her own dismal natural instabilities that every one carries inside the story here is already written and Alice is only to follow marked footprints. For the only reason that... she is the one foretold to do it. There is merely the most silly 'hollywoodintellectualism' where 'good against evil' must be taken as like certainly some sort of metaphor representing all our everyday struggles and it is so much about decision making and all... I'm devastated. Eventually Tim Burton has added his potential for design to a movie completely without content. The only metaphor I see is Lewis Carroll appearing at the end in the figure of the Jabberwokie and Alice slaying him. Carroll is dead long live 'Alice does Hollywood'.".

And during the whole length of the film I didn't hear a single child laugh or giggle. I didn't laugh myself either for that matter but how bad must a children's movie really be if it completely misses its target audience? I mean it's not like kids have that high standards.And I would have never believed that I would hold this against a film but WHY did they feel the urge to suffocate this wonderful piece of fiction under this concretelike story whose pseudoChristian undertones were lifted straight from the Chronicles of Narnia? Why must sweet little Alice become a soldier and killer for the suppressed inhabitants of Wonderland? Why must every character get a real name every piece of magic like the eat mecookies be explained with alchemy every place get a name and a location that is reachable by just... walking there. Any coherent narrative demands logic  but this logic contradicts everything that Wonderland used to be about.I have read the source material numerous times both translated and in its original form and again and again I was fascinated by its surreal magic its emphasis on twisted antilogic Lewis Carroll aka Charles Dodgson used to be professor for mathematic and a dean in the local church so he used the books as both an outlet for his more crazy thoughts and to praise the innocence of a child's mind and its beautifully incorporated themes  like the idea that the seconds books story unfolds like a game of chess.But this is Wonderland Revolutions and Alice now a young woman must go to war learn that Underland ? is indeed a real place and the only way to get home is not to just wake up but to kill a towering demon as... it was prophecied I guess.Tim Burton didn't seem to have any idea what he wanted to add to the Alicemyth that hadn't been done before so he constantly shifts back and forth between a nice children's movie in the tradition of the original Disneymovie and a dark psychological thriller  la American McGee's Alice without ever reaching the quality or comitment of either of them.The only redeeming factor in this CGIcrap is of course the acting. Helena BonhamCarter plays the Red Queen or better the Queen of Hearts the screenwriters screwed that one up too and she seems to have the time of her life. She was the only character in the whole flick that made me smile once or twice. Both Crispin Clover and Mia Wasikowska play their parts decent and nuanced enough considering what's going on around them. Especially newcomer Wasikowska plays the confusion and hidden inner strength of her character quiet niece and subtle and I'm looking forward to seeing her in a really good movie. Anne Hathaways White Queen was also noteworthy for her fragility and confined madness.But yeah this is after all a Johnny Deppflick and I guess he had it coming to damage his exceptional career by blindly trusting into Disneys Paychecks and Burtons.... whatever it is these two guys have in common. It's unbelievable! Here we have the same guy who played ingeniously Hunter S. Thompson and Jack Sparrow and Willy Wonka he plays the quintessential MAD figure of western culture... yet he is easily outacted by a CGIcat. A few years back the computer animated tears in The Lord of the Rings urged me to make some cynical remarks about the future of acting  but here we have an actor's whole performance depending on the photoshopping done to his eyes. And well a wardrobe and makeup which even Ziggy Stardust wouldn't have worn in his weirdest times.So to sum it up Its a shame watching this material and those actors going to waste for the sake of a narrative that no one would have missed. It fails as dark fantasy film and what's worse it fails as a children's story.The most depressing thought I had after leaving the cinema was How many parents must have felt relieved that they never read this crap to their children? Now I know how it must have felt to be a Transformersfan.".

It is that being the story of a nineteen year old Alice who returns to barelyremembered Wonderland but it also lifts dialogue and scenes from the original books. The story is your standard journey emotionally but all set in a very Tim Burton Wonderland.Which of course looks astounding. Wonderland is an amazing place often colourful but equally often ravaged and desolate. It's a treat for the eyes with the imagination and design shining through the technology. It's very very good but strange things happen if you look somewhere the 3D doesn't want you to look and there's the odd moment of strangely stiff animation especially when humanlike characters are completely CGIed up.Unexpectedly it sometimes feels like one of the Narnia films though makes those movies look like accountantled spreadsheets that have been printed out on toilet paper and left out in the rain but mainly it's exactly what you'd expect from Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland. It's a great big treat of a movie to be sure. Given that it's Tim Burton working with Disney it's often gruesome and scary but not too much. It makes you laugh at times it pins you to the back of your seat at others it gets you leaning forward trying to drink in every detail of the place but it's not ever actually surprising. You know what's up you know where things are going and you're never shocked. Maybe once in a quiet horrible scene that stands out even amongst the rest. Even if you've not seen a single still photo or second of footage if you know Wonderland and you know Tim Burton you can picture it yourself effortlessly.So much of it is still in my head this morning but it's all visual. There's no heartache or sense of triumph that lingers after a great story. Funny as it is there's only one line I'm ever likely to quote a single word. I just have these amazing images left in my brain. In that sense then it's appropriately dreamlike.I doubt I'll go back and watch it again at the cinema but I'm most definitely getting the Blu Ray when it comes out next week or whenever Disney decided they should bring it out.If it feels like I've damned it with faint praise I don't intend to. It's all pretty wonderful for the two hours it takes to speed past you but I just want to make it clear  nothing that goes into your ears or your heart ever quite matches what goes into your eyes.".

	schema:reviewBody "What a overrated selfindulgent movie. Right from the inclusion of Johnny Deep in a maddening avatar to Helena Carter as the tyrant witch witch an oblong head Tim Burton yet makes another movie that is barely watchable and completely loony in a bad way.Mia Wasikowska stars or rather pales as Alice devoid of emotion or interest. Her pale frail look gets on one's nerves as she sleepwalks throughout the film with an expressionless countenance that feels weakens the movie significantly. The scenes where she is supposed to be brave look rehearsed and forced. In fact I and my friends got so bugged that we wanted her clothes to fall off so that she could create some stir in the audience!Anne Hathaway vibrant and exquisite in Rachel Getting Married gives a superficial portrayal of the kind and loving White Queen. Poor soul is soulless in the movie as she tries hard to be Meryl Streep or Julie Andrews but falters. Why did Tim have to cast her for a role more suitable for an older actress? Though miscast she at least tries to make a character of her own unlike Mia but looks robotic. In fact she looked like a typical deceiving hag who would bear her fangs anytime. Oh she's wearing white! Symbolizes peace. She must be the good one but unfortunately she ends up getting wasted. And even though her performance is being berated by a number of viewers I feel that she at least tries to get into her role. Wish she didn't look so hideous here!Mad Hatter is played by the outlandish Johnny Depp but he too doesn't cast much impact in his halfbaked role. None of the characters including him connects with the audience. None are very likable. I remember in Chronicles of Narnia where though the main four Britishers aren't versatile actors but the supporting cast shines. Tilda Swinton was towering tormenting and impactful. Aslan though not a real character still was very likable. Here everyone is mundane and lifeless. Depp still tries to give his fullest but the dreary pace of the film outweighs him since his performance isn't groundbreaking or any of that sort. And I'm not a hater of Johnny or Tim Burton loved Charlie and the Chocolate Factory liked Timm's Batman Johnny's What's eating Gilbert Grape?Helena plays the Red Queen in a quirky fashion that gets customary and monotonous. She plays the role differently though not the traditional ones who are mostly staunch and resolute. Instead she plays a role similar to Meryl Streep's in SheDevil who gives herself too much airs. She is funny and redeeming for a while. Then she grates because she does the same act throughout the movie and makes her performance onedimensional.Crispin Grover is tolerable. Tweedledum and Tweedledee are neither funny nor likable overbearing at times. The story is tedious and the animation prosaic. The real world characters are so full of themselves and don't supply anything to the movie. The final scene is a bit implausible and rushed. Well it was a long long unending journey in the theater for me. Certainly a huge disaster from a talented guy. 1 out of 10 stars and a thumbs down.".

Depp still tries to give his fullest but the dreary pace of the film outweighs him since his performance isn't groundbreaking or any of that sort. And I'm not a hater of Johnny or Tim Burton loved Charlie and the Chocolate Factory liked Timm's Batman Johnny's What's eating Gilbert Grape?Helena plays the Red Queen in a quirky fashion that gets customary and monotonous. She plays the role differently though not the traditional ones who are mostly staunch and resolute. Instead she plays a role similar to Meryl Streep's in SheDevil who gives herself too much airs. She is funny and redeeming for a while. Then she grates because she does the same act throughout the movie and makes her performance onedimensional.Crispin Grover is tolerable. Tweedledum and Tweedledee are neither funny nor likable overbearing at times. The story is tedious and the animation prosaic. The real world characters are so full of themselves and don't supply anything to the movie. The final scene is a bit implausible and rushed. Well it was a long long unending journey in the theater for me. Certainly a huge disaster from a talented guy. 1 out of 10 stars and a thumbs down.";

	schema:headline " Movie Review 'Alice in Wonderland' is a beautiful world to behold";
	schema:reviewBody "Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland is a sequel and not a retelling of the original children's novels by Lewis Carroll. In this film Alice is now 19years old and soon after the death of her father is proposed to be married away. Feeling pressured she runs off following a white rabbit which leads her to Wonderland a place she only vaguely remembers from childhood. There she meets past familiar faces as the Mad Hatter Johnny Depp the Blue Caterpillar Alan Rickman the Cheshire Cat Stephen Fry and eventually the Red Queen Helena Bonham Carter who has been terrorizing the land with her harsh rule and beheading of heads. Alice finds out that her destiny is to end the Red Queen's rule by slaying the queen's dragon Jabberwocky as written in the prophesy. Along the way she meets up with all sorts of colorful characters.If you remember Steven Spielberg's Hook was the live action sequel to Peter Pan. Similarly Tim Burton's film is very much like a close cousin except it's about Alice. The progression of the story is also kind of similar where the main character Alice like Peter must rediscover herself and finally defeat her nemesis. Likewise both films are both elaborately staged they are both about growing up and making choices and there's a big showdown. Chances are if one liked Hook one will find many things to like about Alice.Tim Burton's version of the Wonderland's environments are gorgeous imaginatively created lots of colorful details and breathes life. The castles are sleek and intricately designed. The creatures are generally live versions CG of the Disney's previous animated version and they're even more odder and fun to look at. I particularly loved the portrayal of the Chesire Cat in this film and the way he snakes through midair like water feels very natural although it wouldn't feel so natural in real life. Only complaint I may have in terms of visuals would probably be where we see CG versions of natural creatures like dogsthey're not particularly stylized so their CGness can be more noticeable.Danny Elfman's score fits the environment just right giving added intensity when needed. This film is essentially Tim Burton's playground and even if there wasn't any story it still would be plenty of fun to just watch the loony characters in their environment. I will add that 3D aspect of it helped a lot.Johnny Depp plays the Mad Hatter with usual gusto as he brings much energy and quirkiness to such an oddball character. I suppose there is a mix of Willy Wonka and Jack Sparrow in there somewhere. Given that other characters are mostly or completely CG Johnny Depp's character can feel a bit of out of place as he still feels human. Helena Bonham Carter as the bigheaded literally Red Queen is fun expressive and extremely likable for such a shorttempered character. Mia Wasikowska is particularly noteworthy as Alice which she plays with freespirited pluckiness charm and beauty.The story admittedly is a simple one although it is to the story's credit that Alice is now an adultit helps since many happenings in Wonderland can be quite unfriendly bizarre and grotesque. Thankfully no more worries about some dream causing some lifelong trauma to some poor child. I also appreciated the fact that her Wonderland like dreams is an extension of her frustrations with the real world where she felt she had many expectations from outside forces. At the same time it's not like Where the Wild Things Are where other characters are actually projections of reallife people from the main character's life. For example to read Mad Hatter as an extension of her father feels a bit like a stretch although the Red Queen could possibly represent her future motherinlaw since they both dislike animals. Certainly one can merely enjoy it at face value and the creativity of this world and be fine with it.Overall I enjoyed this world of Alice. In one sense that may be the important thing if one were to stick to the flavor of the original novel. The story within the Wonderland I felt wasn't as poignant as real life moments which were filmed with much love and detail. Given the fact that original story consisted of series of random events and character interactions it was nice to see the characters work together a bit. The overall result isn't something beyond what one would expect from this style of work but it's fun and where it succeeds it succeeds well thanks to the consistency of Tim Burton's imaginative visuals.  out of  stars.For more of my reviews you can follow me on Twitter at httptwitter.comdart".

I also appreciated the fact that her Wonderland like dreams is an extension of her frustrations with the real world where she felt she had many expectations from outside forces. At the same time it's not like Where the Wild Things Are where other characters are actually projections of reallife people from the main character's life. For example to read Mad Hatter as an extension of her father feels a bit like a stretch although the Red Queen could possibly represent her future motherinlaw since they both dislike animals. Certainly one can merely enjoy it at face value and the creativity of this world and be fine with it.Overall I enjoyed this world of Alice. In one sense that may be the important thing if one were to stick to the flavor of the original novel. The story within the Wonderland I felt wasn't as poignant as real life moments which were filmed with much love and detail. Given the fact that original story consisted of series of random events and character interactions it was nice to see the characters work together a bit. The overall result isn't something beyond what one would expect from this style of work but it's fun and where it succeeds it succeeds well thanks to the consistency of Tim Burton's imaginative visuals.  out of  stars.For more of my reviews you can follow me on Twitter at httptwitter.comdart";

	schema:reviewBody "When I first heard that Tim Burton was making Alice in Wonderland and when later yet I saw the stills and first promotional shots I could not wait to see it. I decided to forget all about how disappointing Burton's latest movies were and thought to myself we'll probably all fall in love with him again.So when the first reviews turned out to be less than favourable I was surprised. When some of then were outright terrible I started suspecting that maybe my expectations had been too high. But nothing NOTHING prepared me for yesterday's bitter disappointment.First the positive. Nice costumes and I mean REALLY seriously nice costumes. Dresses to die for and hats to wear in a dream. And the Cheshire cat who is so fluffy that you are seriously tempted to reach out and ruffle his tummy. And the Red Queen who is the only believable character with acting worth the mention. And... oh wait the list ends here.If Burton had spent as much time writing the story developing the characters and working on the dialogue as he had on making sure that the dresses were spectacular this movie might have been quite alright. But instead he opted to provide a story so predictable and unimaginative you have to wonder why it was put to screen at all. And he seemed to have thought that if the story or lack of it to be honest was not dreadfully bad enough this could be fixed by carefully adding a clich to almost every line in the dialogue and by making sure that there was not a single funny like laughoutloud funny not a halfsmileOK funny moment in the whole movie.Worst of all he mercilessly murdered the essence and soul of the characters. Alice is lifeless boring and mechanical. The Hatter has a few brilliant moments and he was graciously allowed a few acceptable lines by Burton but mostly it is all beentheredonethat another overthetopfacialpaintrole for Depp. The movie leaves one thankful for the Red Queen  her character would not impress you in any better movie where she would simply be a decently amusing villain but here it's only her presence that can lighten up the screen somewhat. Hathaway's beauty is worth admiring but the White Queen would be better left in a poster as the moment she starts speaking or moving it is so unnatural word cringy does not do it justice. The others are not even worth the mention with the exception of the Caterpillar where Rickman's charisma cannot be so subdued that it would not shine through.At many points in this movie I tried to tell myself  this is a movie for children what do you expect. Well much more. There are many wonderful children's movies that are delightful to watch for audiences of all ages. This leaves you a feeling you just spent 2 hours watching the Mardi Gras carnival at 4 am where beautiful clad dancers barely even move anymore their steps mechanical and their eyes glazed over and the audience too drunk to care.I went with a friend who said she loved it as it looked nice. If this is all you are looking for and if you watch it while playing your favourite album on your MP3 player so as to limit your experience to moving images you might just find it enjoyable enough.".

How one could take a piece of literature and film in numerous outings and turn it to that is beyond my level of comprehension. This proves to me beyond a shadow of a doubt that Tim Burton can no longer be regarded as a genius or even a competent storyteller. He has become a quirky nightmare with a lot of money and fantastic art director. To boot Johnny Depp has become an unwatchable characterization of himself a bad parody that seriously needs to stop and much like the director needs to get back the formula of Ed Wood and Edward Scissorhands. I'm blown away by how poor this film was. I went in with zero expectations and it surpassed them in a negative sense. In a rating of 1 to 10 I give this film a burial at sea so no one can urinate on it any more than Tim Burton already has. Oh and Avril Lavine does the end music. She is to art what small pox is to life. Let me add I get it. It was supposed to be a follow up or sequel or something along those lines. Something of an homage piece if you will. This was not executed. In the least. The dialog was barely audible and both mixed and pronounced to the poorest degree. The plot was quick the inside jokes quicker and hackney the plot spoon fed and completely forced. This film disgusts me. It's everything wrong with modern Hollywood cinema directed at a younger generation and even to my own. Once again a treasured tale from youth and fond cinematic memory now has an blemish thanks to this. Tim Burton needs to stop adapting loved literature. Like now.

Alice in Wonderland should have been something up Tim Burton's alley and instead he turned it into something it wasn't. He should have taken over the screenplay from Linda Woolverton whoever that is and created darker more dimensional characters instead what we get is Tim Burton for kids. I would have preferred his take on Lewis Carroll's novel rather than a rehash of every Hollywood fantasy film. I thought the younger Alice in the film looked the part of the original illustrations and would have been perfect for the role. Depp ruined the Mad Hatter with his accent and incoherent speech Burton ruined the Mad Hatter with his ugly costume design. I was disappointed to not hear Hatter shout Change places! I understand he is saddened by resent events but even a mumbled sad Change places would have been nice to hear and keep his character intact through a simple and effective effort.The charm behind Carroll's novel is that there really isn't much of a story but rather a series of random and always bizarre events that are colorful and imaginative. You start to gain the sense that Alice really is in a peculiar land and at times you even often pity her. With her return to Wonderland the life behind everything the novel created almost evaporated. I say almost because the Cheshire Cat steals the show and truly did save the the film. Regardless I would have much preferred a stopmotion attempt The Nightmare Before Christmas from Tim Burton rather than the use of actors and actresses to portray Carroll's characters. What we're left with because of this is unnecessary though beautiful CGI and a lot of it. At the very least the mood atmosphere of Edward Scissorhands would have been a delightful treat.".

It was extremely a terrific performance by the leading stars though Salman Khan was in a supporting role he gave his best. StoryScreenplays  dialogues was critically acclaiming. MusicLyrics  Choreography was a hit. SalmanSanjay  Madhuri pairing was really amazing. Kader Khan brought us his comedic dialogue style again. Background ScoresViews  locations were well selected.Direction by Lawrence D'souza proved a successful one.Sanjay Dutt handicapped anonymous emotional character was excellent.. Hats Off to Sanjay Dutt. Great Performance by the three stars.... Overall its a mixed romantic drama script covered the Saajan theory completely.

	schema:reviewBody "A major chunk of the Indian movies are love stories and the idea of love triangle has also been hackneyed so much that nowadays hardly any filmmaker must be pondering over it for his next venture. However if I have to make a list of lovetriangles made in bollywood Saajan will be my numero uno in that list. I don't know whether the story idea was original or borrowed from somewhere else however it worked excellently and built the premise of a sentimental love story in which the element of sacrifice became prominent between the two male protagonists who by default became the reluctant rivals of a girl's love. Kader Khan and his wife Reema adopt the handicapped orphan friend Aman Sanjay Dutt of their son Aakash Salmaan Khan and foster him like their own son showering love upon him even more than their own son. Besides Aakash also keep Aman's friendship above everything else in his life. However Aman finds himself burdened by their obligations within his heart. He is a Shaayar Urdu poet and gets published under the pen name of Saagar. A middle class girl Pooja Madhuri Dixit who runs a book shop to make a living for herself and her mother Anjana Mumtaz in Ooty becomes his fan and maintains contact with him through letters. Aakash on the other hand becomes a womanizer not giving a damn for the real love. To take care of their new project of constructing a hotel in Ooty Aman reaches there and comes across Pooja. Pooja befriends him when he tells her that he knows Saagar personally and he promises her to manage her meeting with him. He sees that Pooja loves Saagar. Gradually he also falls in love with her but without expressing his feelings to her.The story takes a twist when Aakash reaches Ooty and falls for Pooja upon the very first encounter. When Aman comes to know of his love for Pooja he decides to sacrifice his love to pay the obligations of his fostering family and he introduces Aakash to Pooja as Saagar. Pooja starts loving Aakash but under the false impression of himself being her Saagar. With the passage of time Aakash comes to know that Aman himself is Saagar and he loves Pooja too within his heart. He immediately understands that Aman is trying to repay the obligations of himself and his parents through this sacrifice. Now it's his turn to sacrifice for his friend and he gets the lovers united.Saajan is the first directorial venture of the cinematographerturneddirector Lawrence D Souza and his uses his cinematographic excellence to the hilt while directing this emotional drama. The different camera angles catching all the three main protagonists in a single frame. depicting their mutual relationships their inner feelings and the peculiar equations between them is simply marvellous. Besides the picturization of songs like Bahut Pyar Karte Hain Tumko Sanam and Jiyen To Jiyen Kaise is nothing short of outstanding. This movie is definitely a marvel of cinematographic technique and those movie buffs who have seen it on the big screen are definitely fortunate.Another very big highlight of Saajan is the exceedingly marvellous music composition of Nadeem Shravan who were in top form those days and the lyricists Faiz Anwar and Sameer have given them excellent support. Only for one song Bahut Pyar Karte Hain I know that it's a copy of a nonfilmi Nazm  Bahut Khoobsoorat Hai Mera Sanam. For the rest I give full marks to this music team which includes Anuradha Paudwal Alka Yagnik S.P. Balasubrahmanium Kumar Sanu and of course the legendary Ghazal singer  Pankaj Udhaas Jiyen To Jiyen Kaise Bin Aapke also. The music album of Saajan is an all time hit and even today listening to these songs renders a soothing feeling to the listener's heart.The movie should have been trimmed by at least 2025 minutes. Otherwise the direction is marvellous production value is high the beauty of Ooty has been captured in superb way especially in the song  Mera Dil Bhi Kitna Paagal Hai Jo Pyar To Tumse Karta Hai and the narrative flows smoothly carrying the audience effortlessly with it.Performances are highly admirable. For Madhuri's dance number  Tu Shaayar Hai Main Teri Shaayari both the choreographer and Madhuri deserve huge clappings. One of the great dancing queens of the Indian silver screen Madhuri has acted well too. However the movie mainly belongs to the male leads. Sanjay Dutt has delivered the performance of his lifetime in this movie and I am sorry to see that he did not win any award for his intense role marvellously performed. Salmaan Khan has performed brilliantly in his Casanova role as well in the role of first a true but irresponsible lover and thereafter a sincere sacrificing friend. The climax belongs to Salmaan only and he provides a memorably touching end to the story. The ending scene is able to move the sensitive audience. Among the supporting cast Ekta as the arrogant society girl who genuinely loves Salmaan Kader Khan as the boys' father Reema as their mother Anjana Mumtaz as Madhuri's mother are perfect. Laxmikant Berde and Dinesh Hingoo have done good comedy. I also appreciate Raja Duggal for his cameo as Babulal the owner of the tea shop in Ooty.Saajan is a treat for the romantic people who like emotionfilled mature romance. It was a blockbuster and I bet it may again prove to be a blockbuster if rereleased. It has immense repeat value and can be watched any number of times for the visual as well as audio satisfaction provided by it to the viewers to their hearts' content.".

	schema:headline " Superb love triangle";
	schema:reviewBody "Love triangles have been done to death ever since time immemorial. films like SANGAM and many more have shown love triangles and many have worked too. SAAJAN released in 1991 was one of those but here there was a difference. In this film one of the character is a crippled poet. The film starts like a typical Hindi film where a small boy who is crippled is tortured by some bullies and then saved by child artist who of course become friends. The guy who saves is a rich guy son of Kader Khan and Reema Lagoo who have a hotel business. The son at tender age is shown peeping under the chair at legs of a women Reema also catches her hubby and child under the table. The film then shifts many years ahead the crippled poet has become Sanjay Dutt and the other guy is predictably Salman Khan. In a funny scene it is shown that Sanju gets a trophy in college while Salman says he got a plate.Woh cup laya main plate Sanju is also a poet who writes poetry and has a name Sagar and hides it from the world. One of his admirers is PoojaMadhuri who falls for him through his poetry. Another funny scene in the movie is when Salman fakes that he is blind and gets bashed by many girls while on the other side Kader Khan is raving about his sons to Dinesh Hingoo. Sanju is sent to Ooty where he meets Madhuri and then falls in love with her. Things go on well. Sanju and Madhuri scenes are fabulous in between some funny scenes like the hotel whose owner says his hotel doesn't sell first class tea but all teas are in the name of lord ram. Madhuri realizes that Sanju is Sagar's friend and hence becomes friends with him.There is a brilliant scene in the church where Sanju breaks down after he gets bashed up when Tej Sapru and his goons attack Madz and a inspector reprimands him that he cant take care of himself only Laxmikant Berde too has funny scenes where he plays a south Indian guy who takes care of the house in Ooty. Salman too follows Sanju and reaches Ooty and predictably meets Madhuri. The rest of the story follows as usual wherein at interval point Sanju realizes that Salman too loves Madhuri and then he decides to sacrifice for him. Salman then becomes Sagar and then falls for Madhuri and towards the end realizes Sanju's plan and then the climax. Drawbacks of the movie Length19 reels 3 hours is too long but those days films were long Also too many songs and some scenes are overtly dramatic Direction by Lawrence Dsouza is fabulous he handles the love triangle very well. Sadly he couldn't leave up to the success and gave more bombs later like AARZOO45 years in making. Music by Nadeem Shravan is a big plus. Almost every song became famous and all are shot fantastically. The first song Bahot Pyaar Karte Haipicturised on Madz is brilliantly picturised. Mera Dil Bhi became a big hit and is still remembered. Rendered by their fav Kumar Sanu and Alka Yagnik. Tu Shayar Hai by Alka too is one of the most remembered songs of Madz. Tumse Milne by S.P.Balasubramanyamvoice of Sallu in early 90s Bahot Pyaar karte haimale Pehle baar mile hai and the title song are fabulous. both versions of Jeeye to Jeeye Kaise are fabulous one on all 3 of them and one on Pankaj Uddas. Dialogues are fab especially the shayri Sanjay Dutt in early 90s had an image of an action hero but in this film he plays a subdued crippled poet and acts very well. He conveys emotions dejection pathos all convincingly. Though he has come a long way now. Madhuri looks beautiful and acts well in her role Salman Khan plays his by now famous playboy role well. this was his 4th or 5th film he renders an effective charm and like his early 90 days though he is uncomfortable in dramatic and emotional scenes like in those days yet he is full of life and exhuberant. amongst rest Kader Khan provides some funny moments and a good supporting act Reema Lagoo though few years older then Sallu and one year to Sanju acts well Laxmikant Berde is superb as usual rest are all typecast EktaMohinish's real wife is good in a small roleTrivia the film according to buzz was completed in 37 days which is a record for any film.".

Male stars like Bruce Willis and Nicolas Cage can star in one flop after another pulling in huge salaries but it does not matter as long as they get an occasional blockbuster.

I wasn't often convinced that the female detective was a physical threat to the male villains. The ending with a doubleopponent elimination was OK but I would like to have seen her action skills equal those of Bruce Willis for true equality to prevail.

She shows her vulnerable side yet you know that V.I. can take care of herself when she has to.  The foul mouthed little girl made me cringe a little with her first words in the movie. The chemistry between V.I. and the girl works for me.  Randy Edleman's music for the movie really delivers as well.  My test of a film really centers on the characters. If I like the characters and care about them that's usually enough. This film has a story which is more than I can say for other more popular films.  I would give it 4 stars out of 5.".

With suspects at every corner Vic doesn't know who to trust and who not to. Kat joins forces with Vic in a more helpful approach to the situation getting information that Vic can't obtain herself eliminating suspects and narrowing it down to one. The ending will blow your mind as it isn't expected.Filmed on Chicago's waterfront V.I. Warshawski delivers the goods for intrigue mystery and top notch action! If you haven't seen it give it a chance. It's worth the 1.99 rental price  don't listen to anyone who says this movie unbearable to watch because it's an outstanding film and one of Kathleen Turner's best.".

They took bits and pieces from at least four different books and threw them together badly. They watered down V.I. tho Turner did a hell of a job of working through it. The movie loses its way at the end. It's just a mess. The directing was halfhearted. And they never got much of the character of Chicago which is a major part of V.I. herself.This could have been a great movie. V.I. is one of the great unsung female characters in mystery fiction. Chicago is one of the great cities of the world. And the stories in the series are full and complex. And this movie wasn't any of it.It's good for the hardcore Kathleen Turner fans. She is the best part of this movie and manages to get the character to show through the bad dialog. But this movie could have been so much more.

Not only does she solve a case in the film she gets herself into a lot of violent confrontations as well from people who constantly want to foil her investigative findings concerning the inheritance of a shipping industry. Incredibly Turner is able to stand toetotoe with her male counterparts. She is impressively gruff tough seasoned and weary.There are good and bad elements in the film. As written the characters' mannerisms and dialogues are too mannered cute and artificial. Everyone seems to be wisecracking yelling and acting tough all the time. I know that's a common fixture of characters of the detective genre but it's just too much and too insincere. Some of the characters are quirky but they aren't threedimensional. There's no shortage of stock sleazy and mean spirited characters. I don't care deeply for the characters. They are merely pawns and not fully fleshed out. The film is heavy on dialogue and plot but it could have benefited from more heartfelt and intimate moments such as exploring the characters' relationships with one another and exploring the inner depths of characters. We rarely glimpse beneath the characters' tough superficial layer and wisecracks. At times the dialogue is stilted and awkward. There are a lot of feeble attempts at humor and one liners that are quite crude lame and inappropriate. The mystery isn't as intriguing or sophisticated as it should be. It's easy to figure out where the story is going as there aren't much surprises. The villains aren't very threatening either. By the end of the film I still have questions that are left unanswered. I do however enjoy Turner's gradual rapport with Kat the young actress overplays the part though the daughter of a murdered hockey player and who seems to be the key to solving the mystery.At times the film does display a quirky sense of humor that works as evident in certain jokes and sight gags. There are also some interesting and high energy set pieces. However some of these scenes detract from the main plot and have a juvenile mentality to them.Whereas other films have been successful and intriguing in their takes on the film noir and detective genre e.g. Night Moves Chinatown V.I.

Warshawski is much more averagelooking not ugly by any means but definitely not beautiful. Turner put in a very good performance but a different actress would have been more believable.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this movie ONCE in 1991 when it was released and it stunk so bad that 9 years later I STILL remember it and am returning to have my revenge. Particularly cringeworthy are the opening shots where Turner is talking to some butcher about various problems with males or her boyfriend or whatever while the background is literally a curtain of hanging sausages. Not a little too blatant on the symbolism there. Then after listening to V I complain about being ogled while jogging the camera rests lovingly on her bare pumping legs while she is um well out jogging  allowing the audience to condemn lowbrow sexuality one moment and indulge in it the next. Finally the director found it necessary to show all the disgusting closeup details of V I's elderly refrigerator contents after Turner's carefully filmed gasp of repulsion upon opening the door not even trusting the audience enough to let them imagine it for themselves.All in all an irritating waste of Kathleen Turner's talents and my time. I haven't given this the full and eloquent blasting it deserves and has received from other IMDb commenters but it WAS 9 years ago and time blessedly blunts the details.As an addendum let me say that while reviewer Marinelle K. Szenasy see below may have liked the film she's totally off base in attributing its critical panning to men's fear of VI's character. I get very tired of crappilyconstructed female characters being excused on the basis of offending male biases. It is possible for tough female characters to be both well written and appealing see e.g. Pulp Fiction  and I applaud those whenever they appear. Sorry Ms. Szenasy you'll have to come up with a better excuse than that for this dreck.A 2 on the starometer.".

	schema:reviewBody "I had a problem with this film right from the start. It is a problem that I would not have noticed if I had watched it in 1991 when it was released but being four years old at the time there was not much chance that I had watched it. Watching it in 2012 however may be a problem for some people and it is a problem that will have your mind wandering from the so called plot and onto something else entirely. Those 'some' people though would have to be Friends fans and that is because Kathleen Turner the lead of this movie plays Chandler Bing's Dad yes Dad in the hit US comedy show. This to me was a major issue as I just couldn't take the actress seriously. When she kissed her onoff boyfriend I couldn't help but think it was two men kissing. Not that it would be an issue if it was two men but I couldn't take the character of VI Warshawski seriously.Before I dig a hole with the stereotype of Mr Kathleen Turner sorry Mrs Kathleen Turner I will mention that she is also the voice of Jessica Rabbit from Who Framed Roger Rabbit? This created another problem because she has a really sexy voice. If I closed my eyes I could hear a sexy long legged red headed cartoon with huge breasts and when I opened my eyes I would see Chandler Bing's Father. This was a confusing time for me.I'll move on with the film it isn't good. In fact it is so poorly directed and written that it would have been better doing the Jessica Rabbit Chandler Bing's Dad cross character as it would have made this film much more interesting. It was corny and cheesy and most of the acting was absolutely dreadful which made lines that possibly weren't intended on being corny even more corny.The film is about Private Investigator Vicky Warshawski. She meets a man in a bar and later on that night he turns up at her door asking her to look after his daughter. Is that normal behaviour towards someone you've just met? She agrees he goes off is murdered and Warshawski intends on solving the mystery. She involves the daughter and they head off on a girl beats man mission. Every line is a comment to chauvinistic men. 'Us girls should stick together' that kind of poor dialogue.The plot is a complete wash over and everything is just far too easy. There is no investigating what so ever and the first clue they receive seems to be the only one they need as the case was obvious from the very first minute. I thought an investigation film needed to keep the viewer in the dark and spring an unbelievable surprise right at the end. Obviously not. The action scenes are dull. A boat chase where nothing happens and a final shoot out which just sucks. The only good thing from the film was the array of actors that you will see in films and programmes of today. We have a scientist from The Day After Tomorrow a cop from Dog Day Afternoon the small stupid pirate from Pirates Of The Caribbean the caretaker of the building in Friends and Wayne Knight the man who gets spat in the face by a dinosaur in Jurassic Park. There is also a cameo from the Ghostbusters's building I'm sure of it.At least this review has come to something. It has reminded us of all the other decent films out there that are a hundred times better than this one. I seem to have mentioned more films unrelated to this one than I have the one I'm reviewing. By all accounts Warshawski was a series of detective novels that portrayed the character completely differently to how she is portrayed by the film makers. Perhaps it could have been a better film if some reading of the novels had been done but that clearly hadn't happened. I'll sum up V.I. Warshawski in three words don't bother watching. 1  5Tolli Check out more reviews at www.tollimovieworld.blogspot.com Follow me Tolli04".

Later that night at the docks a tug boat explodes  Bernard caught in the blast is killed Kat hires Warshawski to find out who killed her father. Warshawski starts with Bernard's brother's  business partners Trumble Charles McCaughan  Horton Frederick Coffin soon Warshawski is feeling heat from the local police  the local mobsters as someone doesn't want her to find out the truth...Directed by Jeff Kanew this simplistic comedy thriller based on the V.I. Warshawski novels by Sara Paretsky really is as bad as everyone says in fact this has to be one of the worst big budget Hollywood thrillers of all time  lets face it there's some strong competition out there. The script apparently took three people to write it Edward Taylor David Aaron Cohen along with Nick Thiel  one has to say that for such a bythenumbers unimaginative film that amazes me. With the collective thoughts of three screenwriters why did V.I. Warshawski turn out to be so bad? Who knows who cares. The plot is no more complicated or clever than a simple murder mystery in which the killers motive is no more original or imaginative that money it really is as simple as that. There are no twists there are no clever red herrings or subplots  the whole story is just the most dumbed down collection of thriller clichs you can think of. I was waiting for some sort of clever twist some amazing plot development but this film has less intelligence  fewer surprises than the average ScoobyDoo episode. Then of course there's the unbearably unfunny  frankly embarrassing attempts at comedy from the expected comedy relief bad guy  his goons to someone constantly mispronouncing Warshawski's name to all the sexual innuendo fuelled jokes 'she can handle my hose anytime' or 'your a female dick' sums up the sophistication of or rather lack of this film which are so unfunny it hurts. The oneliners aren't funny the dialogue isn't funny the zero dimensional character's aren't funny  to top everything off there's a hugely annoying  irritating child actor just to grate on your nerves even more  make you hate yourself for watching it. There's no two ways about it  there's no nice way to put it V.I. Warshawski is quite possibly the worst crime thriller I have ever seen period.Director Kanew turns in an alright looking film it's competently made but not exactly stylish  the whole one action scene is very flat  unexciting. Basically it's two boats speeding along a river with Warshawski  Kat in one  a couple of bad guy's in the other that's it that's the films big action moment. Two boats on a river that never meet or touch. Lame. You know something I am really struggling to find anything positive to say about this film I really am. I suppose if you find Kathleen Turner sexy you might like this otherwise I suggest you give it a wide berth. This flopped big time at the boxoffice when originally released which was probably down to bad word of mouth the fact it was crap  most people not even being able to pronounce the title V.I. Warshawski let alone know what it meant. According to the IMDb Turner did her own stunts  ended up breaking her nose while shooting this  the producer Jeff Lurie currently owns the Philedelphia Eagles.Technically the film is reasonably well made but lacks any style  is instantly forgettable on all counts. Although set in Chicago the film was shot partly in Chicago  Los Angeles. The acting is pretty poor all round Turner was in it for the money probably  felt a big Hollywood action film might do her career some good...V.I. Warshawski is a truly awful film I really don't know how else to describe this dreadfully unfunny thriller that tries to be clever  funny but just ends up anything but. A turkey. Big Style.".

It will punch you in the nose kick you in the groin strenuously apply a ballpeen hammer to your kneecaps extract your teeth in slow motion and assault you with a hail of noogies wedgies and Indian sunburns.  If you are a masochist see this movie!  Watch it over and over rewinding frequently and going through the really stinky parts in slow motion.But if you're like the rest of us avoid this movie like armpit lice!  It means to do you terrible harm I tell you!I think this movie hates Kathleen Turner too.  It certainly made her look stupid...Rating 2 on my Manos scale";

	schema:headline " A superb Western and an excellent Oedpial drama";
	schema:reviewBody "OneEyed Jacks not only is a superb Western one of my alltime favorites it is also an excellent Oedipal drama that moves beyond the bounds of genre into the mythopoetic. Brando and Karl Malden both turn in outstanding performances and the supporting cast featuring Slim Pickens Ben Johnson and Katy Jurado is wonderful. Incidentally the featured user comment The Lost Eye The Lost Ear by tedg is erroneous Stanley Kubrick was fired from the picture tentatively titled A Burst of Vermillion BEFORE he was called on by Kirk Douglas who had an option on his services as part of the contract for Paths of Glory to replace the fired Anthony Mann on Spartacus. Kubrick who had increasingly become fed up with the snailpace progress on developing the script due to Marlon Brando's eccentric work methods had wanted to cast Spencer Tracy in the role of Dad Longworth but Brando was adamant about Karl Malden filling the role. According to one account a frustrated Kubrick has asked Brando Marlon I don't know what this picture is about.It's about the 400000 I've paid Karl Malden.Kubrick according to the account said he could not work under those conditions and quit the picture. Another account holds that Brando overheard Kubrick tell one of the producers that they'd have to keep Brando away from the script if they were ever to make the shooting date. Brando then fired him. Officially the press release said that Kubrick had resigned in order to work on Lolita the then infamous Nabokov novel he and his producer partner James Harris also under contract to Kirk Douglas had recently acquired.OneEyed Jacks began shooting in late 1958 whereas Spartacus began shooting in early 1959 and went months over schedule and millions over budget being shot in the expensive VistaVision process that cost 50 cents a foot in late 1950s prices. Brando reportedly shot hundreds of thousands of feet of footage as he sought inspiration for both himself and his actors particularly the emotionally fragile Pina Pellicer the  young Mexican actress who had just set out on her tragically abbreviated career. It is said that Karl Malden always calls his beautiful Los Angeles home The House That 'OneEyed Jacks' Built due to the small fortune in overtime he made from the film.Incidentally Sam Peckinpah wrote the first draft of the screenplay based on the novel The Authentic Death of Hendry Jones a fictionalized retelling of the life of Billy the Kid. Later Peckinpah would incorporate similar material such as the jailhouse scenes into his retelling of the Billy the Kid legend Pat Garrett  Billy the Kid. In a PLAYBOY interview Peckinpah explained that he was fired by Brando as Peckinpah had written Rio the protagonist as a killer as Billy the Kid was a killer in reallife and Brando would not play such a character. The film took over a year to edit after principal photography ended in 1959. Eventually the studio took the film away from Brando and recut it to their own tastes. Brando reportedly did not object becoming fedup with editing after spending so much time trying to perfect his film. He did complain after the fact that the studio cut took away the moral ambiguity he sought for his character. Brando said that all the characters in the film but Dad Longworth the ostensible heavy are two faced  oneeyed jacks with one face on top the public face and another face that is hidden. Although Rio accuses Dad of being a oneeyed jack to Brando Dad was the only one who was honest in the film. In Brando's cut Dad's last shot meant for Rio hits his stepdaughter Louisa instead killing her and thus leaving Rio with nothing in the end. The studio used the alternative ending where Rio and Louisa have an emotional parting at the beach and Rio promises to return to her.In a development that seemingly foreshadows his future personal life Brando had an affair onset with Pina Pellicer who later committed suicide. Their scenes together are quite affecting as they are emotionally true.".

Reportedly it was taken after Kubrick left due to altercations. Well this time Brando has one foot in front of the camera as well as one behind it. He does a great solid job. In fact this film never looked awkward or misguided  it felt like an intelligent western helmed by an Anthony Mann or Raoul Walsh. To further boost the professional polish of the film there is cinematographer Charles Lang Magnificent Seven How the West Was Won.Within this polished piece of work the muscle of the film is found in the wonderful character study. Here the characters like in many great stories are complex dark tempermental.  Although the film is about the hero'sor antihero's thirst for revenge on a man who done him wrong there's a romance in the film that is truly tender and fateful.The magnet in this film would have to be Brando. Karl Malden is great too. Brando's understated performance is of the subtle type using his famous darting eyes to penetrate the characters and the viewer. He's one of my favorite alltime actors.As with all great films OneEyed Jacks is a quiet masterpiece displaying what every good film needs great script powerful acting layered characterization and be technicallysound.".

Regardless of what Brando thought this is a really fine Western and a unique one too  it seems fresh and new like a Cool Man's West or something. Having Brando when he was still looking fairly trim in the lead role certainly gives it a certain glamor and the story itself  and execution  is great.Overall I wish Brando had made another film after this but to the best of my knowledge this is really the only true film he ever made.

	schema:reviewBody "It's 1880 in Sonara Mexico. Rio Marlon Brando is a bank robber on the run from the authorities. His partner Dad Longworth Karl Malden doublecrosses him and escapes leaving Rio behind. Rio is captured but he escapes from Sonora prison 5 years later. He hunts down Dad who is now a sheriff in California.This is most notable for being Marlon Brando's one and only directing effort. It's a simple western with some competent scenes. However there are a lot of amateurish camera work too. There's a reason Brando never became a director. Eventually he lost his overly long movie to be recut by the studio.The movie as it is cut by the studio is a slow disjointed western. It's not anything original or special.

	onyx:emotionText "It's 1880 in Sonara Mexico. Rio Marlon Brando is a bank robber on the run from the authorities. His partner Dad Longworth Karl Malden doublecrosses him and escapes leaving Rio behind. Rio is captured but he escapes from Sonora prison 5 years later. He hunts down Dad who is now a sheriff in California.This is most notable for being Marlon Brando's one and only directing effort. It's a simple western with some competent scenes. However there are a lot of amateurish camera work too. There's a reason Brando never became a director. Eventually he lost his overly long movie to be recut by the studio.The movie as it is cut by the studio is a slow disjointed western. It's not anything original or special. Karl Malden and Marlon Brando are both great actors in their prime. Neither characters are simple and the movie is compelling enough to watch. Mostly just to see what these great actors are going to do. There is a couple of nice performances from Pina Pellicer and Katy Jurado.";

	schema:reviewBody "Prison escapee Brando wearing only slightly less eye makeup than Liz Taylor in Cleopatra sets out to punish exfriend Malden but takes time out to romance Malden's stepdaughter in this adult psychological western. The film was started by Stanley Kubrick but when he took a hike Brando stepped in to finish directing the film his only effort behind the camera. Several things about the film are striking. One is the dustsand. This is a dusty sandy movie! Even Lawrence of Arabia may not have had this much dust a' blowin'. Also unusual is the setting oceanside. Then there is the attention to the psyche. Rare for an early '60's western the characters' thoughts and motivations are examined quite fully. Another striking feature is the parade of posed extended shots of Brando merely staring. One might call these vanity shots.....especially if the subject of them is also directing the film! He also has a tendency to stick his behind and crotch in front of the camera. The story has a beginning a middle and an end but sometimes getting to them takes a while. The movie is just plain too long. It's not that it isn't compelling but a few judicious cuts would have made it EXTREMELY compelling. Brando does a decent job if one can understand all his patented mumbling but Malden is the revelation. People familiar with him only from American Express commercials and The Streets of San Francisco will be amazed at the range he offers here. He is so much more menacing and sinister than most will remember him having been before. It's neat to see the two former costars of A Streetcar Named Desire square off. Another good performance comes by way of Pickens who would later reunite with Malden in the deadly Beyond the Poseidon Adventure. He is a very effective redneck deputy. There's some nice work by relatively unknown actress Pellicer as Malden's stepdaughter. Though her voice in her first scene seems inappropriately low she improves throughout and does a fine job. Jurado has less to do as her mother but still scores. Brando has a few sidekicks along for the ride. Johnson does well as a ruthless wanted man and Gilman a costar in no less than five other Brando films is okay. The film has some great scenery and some strong music. It's worst detriment is it's length which bogs down the sometimes slight story.".

	schema:reviewBody "Maybe it's the fact it's carelessly fallen into the public domain and that people can only see it now on awful quality knock off DVD's maybe it's because it was directed by it's star Marlon Brando who had never directed before or since but I really can't understand why this movie isn't considered anything less than an out and out classic.With the exception of only two or three I cannot stand the stoic American westerns of the 40's and 50's and always preferred the more antiestablishment and infinitely more stylish Italian westerns but man 'One Eyed Jacks' definitely sits at a fascinating place between the two.I'm not sure how much of Peckinpah's script or Kubrick's ideas made it into what was eventually Brando's film but it's definitely easy to make an argument that their marks be it directly through the script or just through influencing Brando are definitely there. It has all the things that makes the BEST Spaghetti Westerns so great a story that is uncomplicated it's just a revenge tale but at the same time takes no easy or obvious turns  rather than shoot his prey straight up Brando's character makes a much more protracted and fascinating game of his 'revenge'. And the reason for this and this in part where I think Kubrick's ideas may have come in is that this is not JUST a two dimensional story of settling scores at the end of a gun. The relationship between Karl Malden and Marlon Brando just bristles with possibility again like the best Spaghetti Westerns and UNLIKE a John Ford western you don't know where it's going to go. They are more than once in the movie allies then enemies and NEITHER of them is stupid.And as far as Brando's filmmaking ability goes his struggle behind the camera might be well documented now and he has even written this edit off as not being the film he intended but the direction here is not even close to amateurish. I really don't think there are many American directors in 1960 who would hold quite so long and so beautifully on Karl Malden as he considers betraying Brando for the first time. I got chills on Brando's arrival up the road to Malden's estate and the fantastic hold on Malden's face again long and perfectly acted as he watches this potential angel of death draw closer. It is obvious in that moment that this is a meeting he has been in a way anticipating and wondering about for many years  and never known what it would mean. Then there's the meeting between Brando and Malden through prison bars where with the tables turned Malden declares he will hang Brando himself. Just cold stuff taken from the best westerns there ever was but done with great modern style here.I sincerely hope a proper studio DVD of this film is produced soon and that this great western get's the recognition it deserves.Don't be swayed by the cheap packaging it's a wonderful film. Especially for those who love the intellectualism of Kubrick's films and the sheer action and cruelty of the Spaghetti Western ".

	schema:reviewBody "Possible SpoilersIn the only film that he directed Marlon Brando stars as Rio a bandit who is betrayed by his partner Dad Longworth and spends several years in a Mexican jail. Escaping Rio vows revenge and tracks Longworth down to a California seaside town where he has become the sheriff and seemingly a reformed character. Rio's quest for vengeance however is complicated when he falls in love with Louisa Longworth's stepdaughter from his marriage to a Mexican woman. Further complications are caused by the fact that Rio is in league with two other outlaws to carry out a bank robbery. As one might expect the movie ends with much violence and a bloody shootout.The above plot summary might suggest that this is a runofthemill revenge Western.  That would not be a fair impression. My summary is in fact very much telescoped the actual plot is a complex one. Although elements of the plot may be drawn from the commonplace book of stock Western clichs there is much about the film that lifts it above the commonplace. There is some fine acting from Brando himself who brings his characteristic intensity to Rio from Karl Malden as Longworth and particularly from the young Mexican actress Pina Pellicer as Louisa. Pellicer was not a classical beauty but she gives Louisa caught between love for Rio and loyalty to her stepfather a fragile tragic quality which is one of the most attractive things about this film.The other thing which lifts the film out of the ordinary is Brando's eye for beauty. Despite the name of the genre most Westerns are not actually set at the westernmost edge of the North American continent in most the action takes place considerably further east and I have even seen the term used to describe films about eastcoast states. Shenandoah set in Virginia is an example. OneEyed Jacks is unusual in its seaside setting and Brando makes full use of the magnificent Californian coastal scenery to produce what is visually one of the most striking Westerns ever.Although the film can be slow in places its length allows Brando to build up his characters more fully and effectively than would have been possible in a shorter fasterpaced film. This is one of the new type of longer epic characterdriven Westerns that were becoming popular in the fifties rather than the shorter actiondriven Westerns that had previously held sway. Other examples of this new breed of Western were Anthony Mann's The Naked Spur and William Wyler's The Big Country. Those are two particularly fine films made by two great directors but Brando's film can bear comparison with them. On the evidence of OneEyed Jacks it seems a pity that he did not persist with his career as a director. 810.".

This is one of the new type of longer epic characterdriven Westerns that were becoming popular in the fifties rather than the shorter actiondriven Westerns that had previously held sway. Other examples of this new breed of Western were Anthony Mann's The Naked Spur and William Wyler's The Big Country. Those are two particularly fine films made by two great directors but Brando's film can bear comparison with them. On the evidence of OneEyed Jacks it seems a pity that he did not persist with his career as a director. 810.";

Sadly I can't say that One Eyed Jacks has left me anything other than frustrated and cold with disappointment.Marlon Brando took over directing duties from Stanley Kubrick after the two giants fell out about the direction the picture was taking this let Brando loose to shoot for 6 months on a film meant to be wrapped in two. Now this may be the main problem to me because the film is painfully devoid of major fleshing out of the characters scenes are not expanded and there are obvious gaps due to mass editing cuts. It reads on the screen that our protagonist gets sentenced to 5 years in jail two seconds later we see a bearded haggard man escaping prison chained to another inmate next shot he is clean shaved and it seems we have missed some important chat between the two escapists. On it goes throughout the picture I'm sure that the final elongated cut rumoured to be between 4  6 hours would have been a joyous experience but as it is we get a cut down 141 minutes of film that rather outstays it's welcome. And to get through it you really need to believe in patience being a virtue.Brando of course holds court and is never less than interesting and at times he sizzles and dominates the screen in the way that Marlon was want to do. But the whole performance has the reek of over indulgence about it. Making it more about the actor than the actual narrative. Along side him Karl Malden is solid and gruff as the villain of the piece but Katy Jurado is badly underused and seems like an afterthought to be an important character. Sadly too Pina Pellicer struggles to convince in her only American film but naturally that is not important in the context that she was to take her own life at the woefully young age of 29 depending on what site you believe as regards age at death. The bright spot here is the cinematography from Charles Lang Jr at the various sites in California it is simply gorgeous check out the coastline shots and take it all in. I personally feel that this film is one that Brando fans choose to ignore the major flaws with. His name some how making the end product seem better than it actually is. In its longest form I'm sure it could have been a contender in the great Western stakes as it is it remains average and something of an unfulfilling disappointment. 510".

After his escape  the one sole purpose of his existence is to exact revenge on Longworth.  Marlon Brando stars as Rio and also directed this handsome western.  Judging by this firstrate piece of work it is a great shame that  Brando hasn't ever directed another film in his halfcentury in the  industry.  From the outset it is apparent that the movie is under the control of  an assured cinematic intelligence. The camera tracks forward passing  through the gates of a casada leaving the realm of titles and credits  and moving into the fictional space of the story Sonora Mexico in  1880. We see a bank robbery in progress and Rio is sitting perfectly  relaxed on the bank counter while all around him is drama and bustle.  This is a man we feel who is not subject to the usual human  frailties.  After the robbery Rio courts a Mexican beauty. This short scene  conveys important character information  we see that Rio can be  charming but that he is ruthless and manipulative.  It is often the case with westerns that the terrain is almost a  character in the story and so it is in this film. The two beautiful  settings of the action are filmed in Vistavision. Mexico is arid and  empty and the wind sculpts the dust into gorgeous shapes. The  barrenness of the land underpins the film's meaning  there is nothing  here for the Rio Kid. When the action shifts to Monterrey the majestic  Californian surf becomes an everpresent the constant boom of the  breakers acting like a Greek chorus reminding us that Rio is elemental  and untameable.  Brando is as always an enthralling screen presence. He can be  frighteningly still and silent as in the confrontation with Harv in  Red's cantina exuding lethal menace or explosively violent. Rio is a  fascinating character both unsettling and attractive at the same time.  Karl Malden Dad Longworth Ben Johnson Amory and Sam Gilman Harv  turn in competent performances as the bad guys. Katy Jurado with her  sultry hispanic looks was a 'must' for westerns of this period and  acquits herself well as Maria Longworth's wife. Slim Pickens is  memorable as the revolting Lon and Elisha Cook pops up as the bank  teller who fights back. Pina Pellicer was to die by her own hand a  short time after starring here as Luisa the girl who loves Rio.  Verdict  An outstanding western which stands alone as Brando's one  foray into directing.".

The Federales capture Brando and he's off to do a stretch in a Mexican prison.Fast forward several years and Brando busts out of prison and goes north of the border.

A bank in Monterey California that he says will be easy to rob. And the best part Karl Malden has gone respectable and is the sheriff there.Malden's not only respectable he's a married guy now married to Katy Jurado and stepfather to the wide eyed Pina Pellicer. A good line of talk and the sight of Pellicer ease Brando's resolve for revenge.In this stylistic western that is good but doesn't quite make it to classic standards Brando has managed to bring Hamlet out west. It took Hamlet the whole play to finally settle with his intended target and it takes Brando just about as long. His character Rio moves in fits and starts like Hamlet gets sidetracked a few times as well like the melancholy Dane. Hamlet's target is his stepfather who killed his real father and usurped the throne and it's no coincident that Malden's character is named Dad. Brando wisely cast his film with folks from previous westerns who look quite at home on the range if he sometimes doesn't. My best moment is Brando outwitting that lout of a deputy Malden has Slim Pickens to affect a jail break. Marlon Brando's legion of fans should find One Eyed Jacks acceptable and other western aficionados will like it as well.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is the only film that Marlon Brando directed. It's easy to understand why no producers would let him get near a camera afterward. It's expensive to expose film and while Brando the director would argue with Karl Malden the actor the cameras would roll philosophically along exposing the rehearsals the arguments the conversations about the weather the new styles in men's clothing and the conundrum of mindbody dualism. It cost a fortune  and the result is a long colorful Western with a conventional revenge plot. By conventional I mean that the usual fallacies apply. Whose gun is faster than whose? A clip on the jaw or a whack on the head renders a man unconscious for as long as the plot requires. A dozen men galloping after two fleeing bandits fire their pistols wildly although they're a quarter of a mile behind their quarry.It's not a BAD movie. It's just hard to assess. The location shooting around the Monterey Peninsula in California is rich in texture and exquisite as is the location itself  or was before it turned into Disneyland. Hugo Friedhofer's romantic score is appealing if overused. Brando must have had the cast improvising all over the place and in every instance it seems obvious and awkward. You'll notice the scenes when they come around.The story briefly is that Brando is betrayed by his fellow bank robber Malden in Mexico. After five years in the Sonoran pen Brando escapes and seeks revenge on Malden who has now become civilized and is a popular sheriff with a nice Mexican wife and stepdaughter in Monterey. They shake hands both faking. Brando spitefully seduces and impregnates the stepdaughter Pina Pellicer. And when the opportunity presents itself with the townspeople behind him Malden reveals his barbaric side bull whips Brando and smashes his gun hand. A final shootout resolves some of the issues but not all.It's far from Brando's best performance. He says little glowers a lot and blinks reflexively. When he's facing someone down his feet are in the first ballet position and when he walks he puts one foot in front of the other.

	onyx:emotionText "This is the only film that Marlon Brando directed. It's easy to understand why no producers would let him get near a camera afterward. It's expensive to expose film and while Brando the director would argue with Karl Malden the actor the cameras would roll philosophically along exposing the rehearsals the arguments the conversations about the weather the new styles in men's clothing and the conundrum of mindbody dualism. It cost a fortune  and the result is a long colorful Western with a conventional revenge plot. By conventional I mean that the usual fallacies apply. Whose gun is faster than whose? A clip on the jaw or a whack on the head renders a man unconscious for as long as the plot requires. A dozen men galloping after two fleeing bandits fire their pistols wildly although they're a quarter of a mile behind their quarry.It's not a BAD movie. It's just hard to assess. The location shooting around the Monterey Peninsula in California is rich in texture and exquisite as is the location itself  or was before it turned into Disneyland. Hugo Friedhofer's romantic score is appealing if overused. Brando must have had the cast improvising all over the place and in every instance it seems obvious and awkward. You'll notice the scenes when they come around.The story briefly is that Brando is betrayed by his fellow bank robber Malden in Mexico. After five years in the Sonoran pen Brando escapes and seeks revenge on Malden who has now become civilized and is a popular sheriff with a nice Mexican wife and stepdaughter in Monterey. They shake hands both faking. Brando spitefully seduces and impregnates the stepdaughter Pina Pellicer. And when the opportunity presents itself with the townspeople behind him Malden reveals his barbaric side bull whips Brando and smashes his gun hand. A final shootout resolves some of the issues but not all.It's far from Brando's best performance. He says little glowers a lot and blinks reflexively. When he's facing someone down his feet are in the first ballet position and when he walks he puts one foot in front of the other. He must leave not two parallel sets of footprints but a single trail of two prints one on top of the other.And when you get right down to it he's a pretty rotten guy. He lies to most of the people he meets and for the worst of reasons. In the last scene he rides off romantically into the white dunes of Monterey leaving behind a winsome young Mexican girl whom he has knocked up out of spite for someone else.

Whatever Kubrick's version was to be it had to be superior to the film's final product which can be summed Love conquers all. All the characters are exaggerated almost to the point of absurdity. This is most likely the product of Brando's inexperience as a director. The film lacks any genuine sense of realism and so there is no amount of intensity to Brando's Rio plight. When he's jailed a day way from being hung you know it's not going to happen. Great supporting actors of the Western genre such as Ben Johnson Slim Pickens and Kathy Jurado are essentially wasted. What's good about it? The cinematography is excellent. Cowboys riding horses against the backdrop of the California coastline is an unusual setting and camera man Charles Lang uses it to maximum effect. I read that the musical score is considered great but I just didn't notice it. When you compare this Western to the works of John Ford Howard Hawks Anthony Mann Sam Peckinpah and Sergio Leone it's just not in that class. Yes it's a pretty good movie but not in the same ballpark as the works of the aforementioned masters of the cowboy movie.".

But it also has something that's rare in the western film genre ... an ocean. The story begins in the deserts of Mexico but soon settles into the main setting near Monterrey California on the Pacific Coast. It's a quaint setting for a western. Anytime I can find something unusual or unique about a film I feel like rewarding it in some way.The credit here goes to the writer in this case Charles Neider for the original novel upon which the film is based. But in addition the screenplay itself merits praise because the cinematic story is nicely structured with well placed dramatic plot points good dialogue some of which is in Spanish for a nice touch of realism and interesting character arcs.Rio Marlon Brando and Dad Longworth Karl Malden team up to rob a bank and then make a hasty getaway. But their plans go awry which sets up the premise in a tale of betrayal and revenge. OneEyed Jacks is a character study of these two outlaws one who changes and the other who only appears to change.Malden is convincing in his role. Ben Johnson with those heavy eyes and Larry Duran are quite good in support roles. And I've always liked the engaging Katy Jurado regardless of what part she played. About the best that can be said for Brando as actor is that he manages to mumble his way through the script. But he looks and talks like a young Godfather on a horse an image I can't seem to shake.In addition to a great story and script OneEyed Jacks features some excellent cinematography courtesy of Charles Lang. Before Rio and Longworth arrive at the coast they ride through some colorful desert badlands that resemble the landscapes in those 1960's spaghetti westerns with a marvelous sense of visual perspective.Aside from the casting of Brando as Rio the only defects are the film's length and its music. Some of the scenes in the fiesta celebration could have been edited out. Also the intermittent background music tends to be manipulative. But these are mostly minor flaws. Overall OneEyed Jacks is an engaging character study of two outlaws. The story is wrapped in an attractive cinematic package and surprisingly well directed by Marlon Brando.".

Having seen the later film The Children's Hour about two teachers accused of lesbianism I wondered how the 1936 film would measure up. The answer Brilliantly.Part of the reason for this is as Lilliam Hellman the playwright herself stated  the play isn't really about lesbianism it's about a children's lie. And the vicious destructive lie of a child is still central here though now it concerns the supposed affair of Miriam Hopkins and Joel McCrea who is engaged to marry Merle Oberon Hopkins' partner in a girls school. Another reason for the film's success is the flawless direction by William Wyler and last but not least a sympathetic trio. Hopkins is a standout with her strong passionate performance.Bonita Granville the bad seed is such an evil blackmailing brat that I'm sure when 1936 audiences saw Margaret Hamilton slap her they broke into applause. I nearly did and I was watching it alone! It's an unrelenting performance though she's such a walking horror show it's remarkable anyone believed her in her earnest moments which were calculated as only a monster's can be! Highly recommended.".

	schema:headline " A Scottish Source";
	schema:reviewBody "In 1931 the noted Scots Criminologist William Roughead published a volume of his great essays on famous crimes entitled BAD COMPANIONS. One of the essays was called The Great Drumshleugh Case. Set in Edinburgh in 1811 it told the story of two women running a school for society girls in the Scots capital and how a malicious little girl spread a rumor that ruined them and the school. The little brat told everyone that the two women were secret lovers. The book was read by Lillian Hellman who took the story and fashioned the story of her play THE CHILDREN'S HOUR from it only changing it to America and putting a man a doctor into the picture as the third part of the triangle in the child's lie.There have been two film versions of the story this 1936 version with Merle Oberon Miriam Hopkins and Joel McCrae where the two women are made into heterosexuals and a 1962 version with Audrey Hepburn Shirley MacLaine and James Garner where MacLaine admits that she did love Hepburn but commits suicide. The later version is closer to the Hellman play. In the play there is no comeuppence scene where the little brat gets hers. However the scene where Margaret Hamilton slaps Bonita Granville is justifiably among the most satisfying comeuppence scenes in Hollywood film ranking up there with George Sanders tearing into the lies of Anne Baxter in ALL ABOUT EVE. Indeed the slap Ms Hamilton administers to Ms Granville makes up for anything the wicked Witch of the West tried to do to Dorothy Gail in THE WIZARD OF OZ.Although Mr. Roughead's essay is a good place to start one's study into the background of the incident which in 1811 was a possibly deadly one to be involved in  that same year in England two male homosexuals were executed for sodomy a full length study was published in 1983  SCOTCH VERDICT by Lillian Faderman. Ms Faderman does not excuse the young girl from her malicious attack but she does produce some evidence that the two ladies may have been having an affair and she shows that the young girl herself would end up being victimized by the publicity. The girl Jane Cumming was an illegitimate granddaughter to Lady Cumming Gordon and her birth did not endear her to the grandmother or her family. Despised for that reason her attitude of defiance and dislike leading to lashing out against her teachers is partly understandable. But Jane Pirrie one of the two teachers brought a series of expensive legal actions against the grandmother which ended in displaying ALL the dirty linen including Jane Cumming's birth. As a result when Lady Cumming Gordon finished paying the expenses she lost the final case Jane was even more disliked than before and banished from contact with the family. Not a happy result at all.".

On the arrival they meet Dr. Joseph Cardin Joel McCrea and he helps them to restore the farmhouse working hard. One day Karen meets the influent Mrs. Amelia Tilford Alma Kruger that helps them to get students including her spoiled granddaughter Mary Tilford Bonita Granville. Out of the blue Martha's arrogant aunt Lily Mortar Catharine Doucet arrives at the school and offers to give classes. Meanwhile Joseph proposes Karen and they are engaged to each other.When the spiteful and compulsive liar Mary who is a bad influence to the other girls is punished by Karen after telling a lie Martha has an argument with her snoopy aunt Lily in another room. Lily accuses Martha of being in love with Joseph and having encountered him in her room. Mary's roommate Rosalie Wells Marcia Mae Jones overhears the argument and tells Mary what Mrs. Mortar had said about her niece. The malicious Mary accuses Martha of being the lover of Joseph to her grandmother and Amelia spreads the gossip to the parents of the students that withdraw them from the school. Karen and Martha lose a lawsuit against Amelia and have their lives disrupted with the scandal. Further Karen calls off her engagement with Joe since she is not sure that he is telling the truth. These Three is a cruel and heartbreaking story that shows how destructive the power of a lie may be. William Wyler is among my favorite directors and this film is a little gem with a magnificent screenplay. In 1961 he remade this movie changing the title to The Children's Hour and using the theme of lesbianism instead of a triangle of love and a tragic ending. Both movies are worthwhile watching and it is hard to pointy out which version is the better. My vote is eight.Title Brazil Infmia 1936 Infamy 1936".

	schema:reviewBody "I knew nothing about this movie until it came on at 500 am the other morning. I had no idea that it was a William Wyler film. It seemed a little slow in starting and usually if I'm not intrigued in the first 30 minutes I'll change the channel. But then I became intrigued. Things started happening and all the charters seemed to jell. The screaming and yelling of the children was like chalk on a blackboard at first. Then I understood the brilliance of it you were supposed to react that way as we do in real life. No one likes to hear a child cry. But they do and that's one of the things that makes this film real. Great acting by the two main child actors Bonita Granville as the loathed Mary Tilford and Marcia Mae Jones with a breathtaking role as the troubled Rosalie Wells. Possible Spoiler It wasn't until bratty Mary was slapped by Mrs. Tilford's maid in a small roll who would soon become an icon as the Wicked Witch of the West the fabulous Margaret Hamilton. At that moment I knew I had indeed seen this film as a child and remember people cheering that slap. Quite a powerful moment that must have made an impression on me. If you're a William Wyler fan this is a film you should see.".

Then I understood the brilliance of it you were supposed to react that way as we do in real life. No one likes to hear a child cry. But they do and that's one of the things that makes this film real. Great acting by the two main child actors Bonita Granville as the loathed Mary Tilford and Marcia Mae Jones with a breathtaking role as the troubled Rosalie Wells. Possible Spoiler It wasn't until bratty Mary was slapped by Mrs. Tilford's maid in a small roll who would soon become an icon as the Wicked Witch of the West the fabulous Margaret Hamilton. At that moment I knew I had indeed seen this film as a child and remember people cheering that slap. Quite a powerful moment that must have made an impression on me. If you're a William Wyler fan this is a film you should see.";

Sure Mickey Rooney was a capable actor but sometimes I feel he IS acting. With the children in These Three I was dumbstruck. William Wyler had his hands full w child actors in this film and Kudos w a capital K to Bill for pulling the best out of everyone.Bonita Granville as Mary Tilford does a mindblowing job grasping a tremendously dramatic role and she did it so believably and without force that her blackmailing threat to Rosalie and the confrontation scene w grandmother and bulk of cast I got goosebumps. She carried the part very much like Bette Davis in Of Human Bondage in her famous wipe my mouth scene. She did the scene so delicately so conniving with such convincing facial expressions and tonal inflections that I was spellbound. Marcia Jones as Rosalie was quite good herself to the point it makes me wonder what the poor girl was threatened with before the scene was shot.I must say too that it is great to see Merle Oberon using her face in a way that doesn't make her look demented such as in Wuthering Heights. It was great to see her more natural less possessed looking w her eyes. In this movie she definitely was reeled in quite a bit and i credit Wyler for that. Miriam Hopkins was as beautiful soulful and sad as ever.Overall I believe the child actor Bonita Granville stole the entire film but I could feel Marcia's fear of her secret being discovered and punishment to ensue. I could feel Miriam's longing and Merle's calm sense of decency. As I said before William Wyler managed to get performances that were spot on for the film keeping the tone believability and atmosphere as convincing as films of the 30s could be.The cinematography was done very well and Gregg Toland who had his life cut short at 44 was very much a master of lighting and unique camera angles. A feeling of intimacy was established in a lot of the scenes in ways I can say I've never seen shot before. The 3 leads standing in Ms. Tilford's living room on the day they go to find out what the issue is standing side by side and Toland puts the camera behind them. That little subtle angle conveyed so much emotionally that i'm surprised it wasn't mimicked over and over by every DP worldwide. He went on to DP such greats as Intermezzo Citizen Kane Little Foxes and more where his influential yet extremely subtle camera and lighting from These Three was turned on it's head showing his extreme versatility.This is a great film especially for it's era. I'm a harsh critic so I give it a 6.".

At the building where the two women wish to house their school they meet Joe Cardin Joel McCrea who assists them in their endeavor. He makes three. They all become great friends open the school to resounding success and everything is just hunkydory.As usually happens children ruin everythingin this case one child Mary Bonita Granville. To understand Mary one must simply imagine Iago as a young girlafraid? Mary because she's spiteful young and doesn't understand consequences spreads a lie about her teachers in order to take the attention away from her own misbehavior. So what is initially a private mild unactedon love trianglethat probably would never have amounted to anything and fizzled away with timebecomes the business of the entire town.The original play had Mary's lie alluding to a lesbian relationship between the two friends however due to that pesky Hays Code McCrea's character was conceived and the lie turned into one of heterosexual deviance though even that is tiptoed around. Despite the changes to the source material the film never feels watered down as the contents of the lie really aren't that important at least not as much as the subsequent reverberations. Plus by not mentioning specifics it almost makes the whole thing more potent as the viewer's imagination is given free rein. The example often referred to in is from Shane and the intense sexual tension between the titular character and the boy's mother despite never showing anything. In this way censorship becomes creativity's unlikely accomplice. As weighty as the film is it's surprisingly funny. In particular Martha's aunt Lily Mortar Catherine Doucet who is a haughty loquacious former actress. She reminded me of one of Dickens' over thetop aristocratic characters. When a taxi driver played by Walter Brennan who I guess got tired of driving stagecoaches requests his pay Mortar merely chides him on his obsession with money.William Wyler's These Three is an excellent adult drama that hasn't aged a bit well maybe a little bit. Not a single performance fails to impressparticular Granville's as Mary a tough part for a child actorand the comedywhich is a gamble in a dramatic film for it runs the risk of deflating the whole thing feels completely natural. Few films I've seen handle the concept of mob mentality better than this one.

These Three based on a play by Lillian Hellman who also wrote the screenplay is the story of two debutantes Karen Wright and Martha Dobie Merle Oberon and Miriam Hopkins fresh out of school whoalmost immediatelyinexplicably decide to start their own school studies do say the public school system is built to churn out teachers. At the building where the two women wish to house their school they meet Joe Cardin Joel McCrea who assists them in their endeavor. He makes three.

But one night quite innocently McCrea is seen with Hopkins where they live by one of the girls. Bonita Granville had been chastised earlier on so now the evil little teen starts some gossip and as a result These Three have to defend themselves against something nonexistent. That's usually the worst thing you ever have to defend yourself against something totally made up.William Wyler directed this one with sensitivity and taste. And he lived long enough to direct the real version of The Children's Hour in the Sixties. Miriam Hopkins appears in both in different roles.Bonita Granville got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress in the first year Supporting players were categories. But she lost to Gale Sondergaard playing a wicked adult in Anthony Adverse.It's a good film but not as good as The Children's Hour. How could it be?".

Shocking enough I suppose at the time.But Hellman's story is almost as manipulative and goaloriented as Bonita Granville's brat. The stupidity runs riot throughout the script. A story that could avoid a calamity with a frank fiveminute conversation avoids the conversation instead. A remorseful old lady who begs forgiveness from the offended trio is repulsed with a sneer and a curse.

The women open up their school and with the help of Martha's gossipy Aunt Lily Catherine Doucet it become a success. There is however a ghastly little girl at the school named Mary Tilford played eerily by Bonita Granville who proves to be a problem when she formulates a lie about Martha and Joe and it spirals out of control. The play the film was based on featured a rumor about lesbianism but in 1936 with the Hays Code in full affect that could not be done so the play's author wrote this script instead. The changing of the rumor does not effect the message of the story but the film would not have been what it was had it not been for it's stellar cast. Alma Kruger is a strong presence as Mary Tilford's grandmother and you really feel for her character by the end. Walter Brennan and Margaret Hamilton round out the cast in small roles Brennan as a comic relief cab driver and Hamilton as the maid at the Tilford home. Hopkins Oberon and McCrea all turn in wonderful performances but it is Granville and young Marcia Mae Jones as the other main young girl Rosalie who truly hold their own with the pros. Granville who was nominated for a Best Supporting Actress Oscar was only 13 and Jones only 12 when production transpired on These Three and their performances are very impressive.The film does a fairly good job of not being melodramatic. There are some schmaltzy lines here and there but for the most part it it a gripping and well acted drama.".

It is especially poignant to return to this 1989 film now as we watch the soldiers returning from the war in Iraq and the raw treatment they are receiving in our Veterans' Hospitals.Three friends went off to the Vietnam War together and only two returned alive the problem is that while both men suffered in battle the one David 'Highschool' Flannigan Ed Harris is so severely damaged by posttraumatic stress syndrome that he 'exists' in a drunken vacuum with his very plain schoolteacher sister Martha Kathy Baker.

In the course of events Jacknife at first offers succor to Martha and eventually the two date  at a Prom Martha must attend  and at that prom drunken David completely falls apart destroying relics in the school and terrifying the townspeople and students. Jacknife makes Dave relive the moment in Vietnam when they lost their buddy and in doing so brings David to the point where he can begin his climb toward recovery. And the longsuffering Martha finds her needs tended by Jacknife too.All three actors give astonishingly fine performances Ed Harris offers one of his most fully realized roles while De Niro and Baker maintain the high standards set by their careers. More people should help resurrect this all but forgotten film as it is a brittle reminder of the damages our wars bring to the men who fight them and to the families who receive them after battle's end.

We all understand the fighting and the Apocalypse Now type of drama but this is so so different. What happens when they come back and try to live a life? They can't. It made me very aware of a large group of men that are rattling around lost in America. Not able to relate can't sleep can't have love affairs can't deal with normal society. They feel totally apart. This is a huge tragedy and one that isn't addressed enough. Yeah we've changed our attitude about Vietnam Vets we like them now but so what? It doesn't seem to have made any difference to them. It's too late? So it was a great film but I cried a lot. I have no other criticisms.".

Robert De Niro Kathy Baker and Ed Harris supply a well rounded look of 'Healing'. Kathy Baker was just great as a supporting role.I missed Viet Nam by one year my draft number was high enough in the year that the severe deescalation started. This is not a 'Platoon' or 'Full Metal Jacket'.  This film is about a couple of Vets in the years' aftermath. Takes place back in the States after the War is over.  Very few flashbacks were done but were neccessary to bring context to the film. Ed Harris plays the one person who is in the most pain and is always on the edge of hurting others because of it. Kathy Baker plays his sister. Robert De Niro was just perfect for the part he played as he comes into both their lives. It is not a perfect film or screenplay but the the actors pull it off. I believe Ed Harris was nominated for a certain award for his efforts not Oscar another kind.You don't have to have been to Viet Nam to appreciate this movie. Though it is about the aftermath of Viet Nam experience it can also be about Self. About how we have these opposites within ourself and how the best parts of ourself even though they may be injured try to reach out and save the most darkest part that we have. That movie describes what I just wrote and I could not avoid tears myself toward the movie's end. If you just stay with it you may know or appreciate what I mean.".

Ed Harris is giving one of the greatest performances up to date. He portrays his alcoholic hero superbly making us feel his broken heart in each line in each move. Robert De Niro makes us once again think of him as one of the greatest actors of all time in one of the simplest but also most realistic performances in his career. Jacknife is never getting boring as it shows its heroes clear of any typical Hollywood's typical character elements. After the war none is a hero. Everybody is a loser and this movie is about that simple truth. None can mend up his pieces after a war just like the heroes of this movie. Jacknife is about the diseases of the soul that war creates. Simply magnificent movie.".

	schema:headline " A very different kind of war movie.";
	schema:reviewBody "Jacknife is a war movie that is just about as far removed from the war as war movies get. It can hardly be classified as a war film because the only way that any war has an effect on the story or the characters is in their memories of it and even these we are hardly ever shown. It poses very interesting questions about life especially in the way that the movie's tagline says that only one of them is really alive and by the way even though the tagline refers only to Dave Ed Harris and Megs Robert DeNiro it is talking about all three of the characters in the film. Dave and Megs were friends in the Vietnam war and Megs has returned to take Dave out on a fishing trip that they have been planning for a lot longer than you might have guessed. DeNiro provides a perfect performance of the character of Megs who we are not really sure if we should like or if he really is as nuts as Martha thinks he is. Dave reminds Martha several times that Megs is not his friend just someone he knows. There is a great scene early in the film where Megs has gone out to grab a six pack of beer from his car for breakfast and he is just around the corner of the room when Dave says this. Megs pauses for a moment and then proceeds into the room with a smile and a huge greeting. It isn't until later that you realize how Megs must have felt when he heard that having been the one to remember what they had planned to do on this day. It reminds me of the fakeness of the old Sure let's do that' thing that people so often say to each other never having any plans to do any such thing.Ed Harris delivers a wonderful performance as Dave who never got over the effects that the war had on him. Even so many years later he has not managed to get over the death of a friend during the war blaming himself to this day for it and thus drowning his life in alcohol cigarettes and loneliness. All he wants he says is for people to leave him alone. This is not a man who is living his life the way he wants whether people actually leave him alone or not he is a man trying to forget that he's alive to detach himself from the world of the living as much as possible.His sister Martha reminds me of myself at least in terms of my roommates. I have two roommates who are 21 and 24 years old and both act like they still live with their mothers expecting their messes to just go away when they leave the room for a while. One on particular the older one sadly enough has absolutely no clue how to care for himself I'm surprised I don't have to wipe his chin while he eats. Martha has to do much the same for her brother who she waits on hand and foot while he staggers through life from one hangover to the next. Martha and Dave are stuck in a stagnant life and neither of them can get out of it until something major changes and Dave is the one that needs to do the changing. I tend to complain about romance in movies where it just doesn't belong about as much as Roger Ebert complains about those pathetic little tension devices the red digital readout. But in this case I don't think that the romance that develops between Megs and Martha had any adverse affect on the rest of the movie. On the contrary it made it that much more interesting because it was not predictable. The problem with the romantic subplots in Bruckheimer movies and whatnot is that they are so predictable that you just wait for the obvious end to come and hope that something interesting happens along the way. In this case however it's not as obvious that something is going to happen between Megs and Martha because we don't know enough about Megs. Martha could be right about him that he's one of Dave's crazy war buddies and that he's not the kind of man that she should be dating. Dave certainly encourages this idea.spoilers A couple years after this movie DeNiro did Cape Fear where he plays a deranged criminal out for revenge against the lawyer that landed him in prison a character that in retrospect makes it pretty easy to think that maybe at the end of Jacknife Martha realizes her mistake gets rid of Megs and she and Dave make up because he saved her from a horrible relationship and then he decides to clean up his act because he has done something good for her. I was half expecting this to happen so I was pleasantly surprised when Martha and Megs wound up together and even more pleasantly surprised when Megs asks Dave all the questions about what they had planned to do after the war was over. At times this is a slow moving drama but Jacknife is entertaining along the way and has a huge payoff at the end which amazingly manages to be sappy without being cheesy. There is an almost excess of emotion at the end of the film that scarcely fits with the rest of the movie but it is so good that it doesn't dumb down anything that the movie has accomplished up to that point. Everyone involved gives a wonderful performance and it is one of those rare films that just about makes you want to stand up and shake your fists victoriously in the air.".

Music is by Bruce Broughton and cinematography by Brian West.De Niro and Harris play two Vietnam War veterans trying to come to terms with their lives post the war. Things are further complicated when De Niro gets romantically involved with Harris sister played by Baker.Wonderfully sedate and intimate Jacknife whilst not creating anything new in the coming home from Nam genre of film is somewhat refreshing in how it relies on dialogue and believable character interactions. Some clichs do find their way into the play later in the day as Harris' character starts to come out of is troubled shell but this is mostly a thoughtful treatment of loneliness and the on going effects of the war. The three up top performances are well delivered with De Niro unsurprisingly carrying the film with ease.A box office flop on release there's a good chance that Jones' film came too late in the Vietnam War movie cycle. It's also safe to say that the slow pace and the dialogue heavy nature of it made it only appealing to a certain demographic of film lovers. It's worth seeking out now as an antidote to blunderbuss blockbusters because it's good film making that has a story that is touching and often humorous and for many of a certain era it's all too real. 710".

The three up top performances are well delivered with De Niro unsurprisingly carrying the film with ease.A box office flop on release there's a good chance that Jones' film came too late in the Vietnam War movie cycle. It's also safe to say that the slow pace and the dialogue heavy nature of it made it only appealing to a certain demographic of film lovers. It's worth seeking out now as an antidote to blunderbuss blockbusters because it's good film making that has a story that is touching and often humorous and for many of a certain era it's all too real. 710";

	schema:reviewBody "I stumbled on Jacknife playing on Bravo... I didn't know the title but Robert DeNero is a damn good actor so I started watching. And I started feeling like it was de javu all over again... I knew the story. Then I realized why I knew it. It was originally a play called Strange Snow and I did a production of it in collage. Play to screen allows for far more intricacies in story lines but it is the same  two survivors of Vietnam both reacting to the real world in different manners. The first thing I thought when I read the play after I was casted was this story is an interesting mixture of a discussion of PTSD and an parable of the Christ crucification Bobby's sacrifice of his own life in Nam being his... crucification. This movie is very much worth the time. An excellent collection of actors... the script equally effective. If you are looking for a technostunt movie this is not it... it is not a deep plot movie... it is a slice of life. An excellent slice.".

	schema:reviewBody "Released in 1989 Jacknife tells the story of Megs Robert De Niro a Vietnam vet who looks up an old war buddy in Connecticut. The buddy is Dave Ed Harris a bachelor and drunkard who lives with his sister Martha Kathy Baker in their inherited parent's house in the old neighborhood. Dave  Martha's situation has degenerated into lifeless habit and stagnation. Megs doesn't look up Dave because he necessarily wants to but because he has to  they have a longstanding date to go fishing a date with much significance.Kathy is a biology teacher and the classic enabler a onewoman support system enabling her brother to continue in his miserable cycle of boozehangoverbooze. She's trapped and her guilt will not let her escape and she knows shes trapped.There's a scene of Kathy leaving the school at the end of her work day where she goes out of her way to stop at the trophy case and looks at old pictures of her brother when he was a high school hero with much potential. You can feel what she feels as she looks at those pictures.Dave warns Kathy about Megs  he's half crazy and has spent a lot of time in the slammer on assault charges but Kathy instinctively senses that Megs is their catalyst to change their delivererer carbuncles and all. Yet Megs needs change as well and Kathy is HIS deliverer. Megs is an eccentric outcast and Kathy is his golden connection to a sense of family and community things he's been running from since he got out of the war 20 years earlier.Kathy is a bit of a plain Jane. Her stagnated lifestyle is reflected on her face. No one invited her to her Prom back in high school and who knows the last time she had a date. Yet on her initial meeting with Megs he just happens to mention she's pretty. This immediately changes her demeanor. When was the last time she felt the warmth of a genuine compliment concerning her looks? She naturally starts to develop love for this man  a deeply flawed man  something she hasn't felt for a long long time perhaps never. And she slowly starts to blossom.Jacknife is the perfect antidote to modern cgiladen drivel like Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull and Iron Man. Don't get me wrong those types of films have their place like when you're in the mood for mindless entertainment  goofy oneliners and all. By contrast Jacknife is meaningful and characterdriven suspense is created via raw unpredictable emotion and outstanding acting by all three members of the triangle. Take for instance the truckdriving scene where Dave and Megs have a confrontation. Megs starts to put the meddle to the peddle as they drive down an incline. Dave had implied that Megs was crazy and now Megs is making a statement. Or is he? Who knows what he's doing?! The truck goes faster and faster and the viewer is uncertain if this lunatic is going to kill 'em both or what.This scene is potent because it strikes the viewer as REAL. For me it brought to memory a similar situation when my wife and I were traveling through the heart of West Virginia. We drove in silence for a long time perhaps two hours and then I completely exploded screaming at the top of my lungs  spit and tears flying. Yet I wasn't yelling at her  not at all  it went much deeper than that. We were flying down the highway faster and faster while I continued to vent in raw emotion. Then my wife the epitome of calm and stable screams out IF YOU'RE GOING TO WRECK MAKE SURE YOU KILL US BOTH!!! That was almost four years ago and thankfully nothing like it has happened since. Why do I bring this experience up? Because Jacknife albeit a tad stagy which is natural since it was based on a play rings so true.The film was shot on location in the heart of Connecticut in Meriden Cromwell and Wethersfield the diner scene. The story obviously takes place in November and the authentic locations are great.BOTTOM LINE If you're in the mood for a meaningful characterdriven drama you can't go wrong with Jacknife. GRADE A".

The film focuses on a small serious story with emphasis on characterization and the complex tension between people in a close relationship. Stephen Metcalfe upon whose play Strange Snow the film was based wrote the screenplay.Joseph Megessey is a Vietnam war veteran suffering postVietnam stress syndrome who is having trouble fitting in with society. He takes on the responsibility of drawing Dave a fellow veteran now an alcoholic out of his shell by coaxing him to enjoy life again as well as urging him to face up to some of his darker memories.Megs finds himself attracted to Dave's meek sister Martha who lives with Dave and looks after him. This attraction leads to a love affair much to Dave's disapproval. Dave eventually vents his anger and frustration at a high school prom where Martha is a chaperon being accompanied by Megs. This leads to Dave finally facing his demons and acknowledging Megs and Martha for being there for him. Afterwards despite initially ending what was a promising romance Megs returns to Martha.This movie is extremely well acted by its performers particularly De Niro Harris and Baker.Despite the fact that the movie provides nothing new about the postVietnam experienceit still manages to become an eyeopener for the adjustments of Vietnam War soldiers at home.Still worth watching!!!".

	schema:headline " Underrated Film and Performances";
	schema:reviewBody "Jacknife 1989  12 out of 4 Powerful drama centers on a Vietnam vet Robert DeNiro who looks up an old war buddy Ed Harris but soon falls for his sister Kathy Baker. There were a whole slew of war movies during this period but this here is the most overlooked and that's a real shame because it's one of the best. I've heard some refer to it as a continuation of THE DEER HUNTER and there might be a lot of truth to that because this film takes place fifteen years after the war and it's clear with our characters that the horror of Vietnam are still haunting them. The movie is very quiet as it doesn't preach nor does it try to scream some sort of message. Instead we just peek in on these three people's lives and how the Harris character is pretty much dead even though he survived the war. I think what works best here are the performances which are all rather amazing. I called the film underrated but that's also true of DeNiro's performance which to me is one of the better ones in his career. Once again DeNiro dives head first into a role and really comes away with a very memorable character thanks to his performance. For the most part his character is out going and energetic even though he has some demons inside him and DeNiro perfectly pulls this off. I especially loved him during his out going scenes where he's constantly moving and dancing around to let off all the positive energy he's trying to give off. Those are the scenes that worked best with me and the ones that the legendary actor pulled off the best. Harris is also wonderful in the film and manages to steal every scene he's in. He doesn't have too much dialogue so the majority of his acting is with his eyes and he really does a remarkable job. Just take a look at the scene where he goes to visit the parents of his friend who was killed in the war. Baker doesn't get enough credit as an actress but she too delivers the goods here. This film has a slow pace which allows us to get to know the characters feel their pain and understand how all three of them are trying to grow. The moving hits on some rather dark subjects and has an overall depressing tone. This might keep some people away but that would be a shame because they'd be missing out on a very impressive film with three excellent performances.".

The problems are obvious but in all this tragic there is always the feeling of some hope on the basis of love and friendship. Jacknife might be the quietest Vietnam movie ever but after almost 15 years this is really plausible and therefor justified.

Tens of thousands of Vietnam veterans died from suicide many more suffered from post traumatic stress disorders many struggled to readjust to civilian life and today similar conflicts in the Middle East see approximately 22 US soldiers committing suicide a day.

The story is never developed to the point that the audience can truly understand and feel for the characters like the Deerhunter did. The Vietnam flashbacks are not as gripping or involved as the ones in the Deerhunter. This is why I can only give this movie 7 out of 10.However I think that the acting was outstanding. DeNiro and Harris are truly amazing actors. They totally immersed themselves in their characters and expressed the great anguish of two former friends who lost their best friend Bobby in combat. Harris' character is a halfdead alcoholic who hides the guilt that he has in Bobby losing his life trying to save his.I also like the supporting cast. Everyone in the town is part of the movie. The town obviously can't handle Vietnam vets very well. Like many small towns it is all about being quiet humble and minding one's business. Harris' character however can't be any of these things. It is interesting how wars effect people. Some people rebound quickly while others never really recover.".

	schema:headline " A Perfect World Is Perfectly Watchable!";
	schema:reviewBody "Some aspects of this film work better than others but overall A PERFECT WORLD is a highly watchable film.  Kevin Costner delivers a fine performance as escaped convict Butch Haynes. The film primarily focuses on the relationship between Haynes and an innocent 8 year old boy named Phillip whom he kidnaps and befriends well played by TJ Lowther. Haynes has killed two people thus far and gives the impression of a being a loose cannon but Eastwood evokes sympathy for the character as the audience learns about Haynes troubled childhood raised without a father by a prostitute mother  killed a man by the age of 8 and observe his genuine care and concern for the boy. Their relationship is reminiscent of Allan Ladd and the young boy in SHANE. As he slowly feeds us more information about Hayne's history and lets the audience wrestle with its ambivalent feelings towards Costner's character Eastwood keeps the film moving with lots of close brushes with the law car chases and shoot'em ups.Where the film doesn't work quite is when Eastwood himself is in front of the camera  playing a minor role  Chief Red Garnett  a Texas Ranger who's in charge of Haynes' capture.  The primary function of his character and Laura Dern's who plays Sally Gerber  a criminologist the Governor forces upon the Chief in the script is to supply further information about Haynes' past. Unfortunately Eastwood tries to flesh out the relationship between these characters through antagonistic chauvinist attitudes towards Gerber and creating a power struggle between the two which big surprise! over the course of the film gradually leads to a mutual respect between them! Granted Eastwood and Dern have marquee value  especially Eastwood are fine in their roles and of course  chauvinism was alive and well in 1960's Texas but I mostly found these minor subplots annoying and unnecessary. It's the scenes and issues focusing on Costner's character that are the life blood of this picture. This criticism aside Eastwood does a solid job directing weaving action suspense and thought provoking human drama into a well knit weave and Costner delivers one of the best acting performances of his career.7 12 out of 10".

	schema:headline " All you Kevin Costner haters out there WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!";
	schema:reviewBody "Kevin Costner's career has been in a downward spiral to say the least over recent years.  Now it seems like even people who admired him at first are suddenly forfeiting their compliments and jumping on the bandwagon along with the rest of the Costner haters.  Well I'm not gonna jump on that bandwagon.  This movie is sheer proof that Costner is a wonderful actor capable of playing characters of multiple dimensions.  Here he's given the challenge of playing a likable villain without having us forget that he has criminal tendencies.  I'm not condoning criminals but do you honestly think every criminal in the world is a coldblooded motherfer with not a single scruple?  They're human beings like everyone else only they choose to live dishonest lives.  In other words the easy way outat least that's what they think.  Costner played a completely onedimensional villain in 3000 Miles to Graceland but it was fitting to the tone of that film which plays out like a comic book fantasy.  His character of Butch is much more realistic and his main scruple is treating children like dirt.  He himself was treated like dirt as a child and whenever he sees mothers or fathers do the same to their children he goes nuts and sometimes homicidal.  A very interesting character which Costner plays to absolute perfection. I have a theory about movies.  Whenever you have an adult story excluding children's and familyoriented material involving a child in a major role the movie often turns out either good or great.  This one turned out great. Good movies come more often than you think.  Great movies don't come quite that often.  A real motion picture experience is when you get lost in the story to the point where you feel you're right there with the characters and not sitting on your couch watching these characters on a TV screen. This is one of those experiences.  The film is totally characterdriven which also appeals to me.  It took me a journey through the lives of Butch and the young boy.  I felt a deep connection to each of them.  The ending had me pouring with tears. I have to give it up for Clint Eastwood who usually scores behind and in front of the camera.  The film runs a little over 2 hours but when you have solid characters like these the time flies by in a snap.  Hell Corky Romano was under 90 minutes long and I may as well as have been watching it for 10 hours.  The most powerful scene in my opinion is when Butch and the boy stay over the home of the black slave.  Butch sees the way the father physically abuses his son and goes to the extent of tying him down to a couch.  He then forces the father to say I love you to his son like he really means it.  A Perfect World is a film I'll never forget and I'm so damn glad I spent my 14.99 to purchase the DVD.  I have only one very minor complaint  the guy who plays Philip overacts like crazy in a cartoonish performance. My score  9 out of 10".

	onyx:emotionText "Kevin Costner's career has been in a downward spiral to say the least over recent years.  Now it seems like even people who admired him at first are suddenly forfeiting their compliments and jumping on the bandwagon along with the rest of the Costner haters.  Well I'm not gonna jump on that bandwagon.  This movie is sheer proof that Costner is a wonderful actor capable of playing characters of multiple dimensions.  Here he's given the challenge of playing a likable villain without having us forget that he has criminal tendencies.  I'm not condoning criminals but do you honestly think every criminal in the world is a coldblooded motherfer with not a single scruple?  They're human beings like everyone else only they choose to live dishonest lives.  In other words the easy way outat least that's what they think.  Costner played a completely onedimensional villain in 3000 Miles to Graceland but it was fitting to the tone of that film which plays out like a comic book fantasy.

	schema:reviewBody "In 1952 Charles Crichton had produced a successful suspenseful movie with a derivative premise a man an excellent Dirk Bogarde compelled to take a brat hostage with him because he was the witness of his murder and to flee with him across Britain to escape the police. This journey had brought the two runaways together and Bogarde eventually felt real love and care for his young hostage. Crichton I find it hard to believe that it's the same man who 36 years later will cook a Fish Called Wanda 1988! had construed his topic with a lot of reserve and sensitivity which bestowed his wonderful piece of work with pathos and tenderness.40 years later Clint Eastwood freshly showered with praise for his dusky Unforgiven 1992 takes back this formula for a flick which basically was to be directed by Steven Spielberg but the latter had a lot to do with Schindler's List 1994 probably his finest moment. The amount was a Perfect World 1993 and it deserves better than the lukewarm reviews it received and stands as a winner in Eastwood's eclectic filmography. In spite of a few installments in its second part that one can deem as overlong it has enough commendable stuff to grab the audience.First Eastwood's vehicle is helped by the work of John Lee Hancock who 4 years later will pen the scenario for another Eastwood flick Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil 1997. Because it eschews the formulaic ingredients of the movie genre a Perfect World deals with and it encompasses various tones from the droll moments Kevin Costner goes through with his young hostage to gripping scenes which incommodes the audience the scene when Costner holds the black family in their living room with a song he hadn't heard for years the script takes the viewer by surprise. It's true that suspense takes a back seat during most of the viewing but Eastwood's flick has other stuff in store. In the favorable reviews it has been said that the relationships between Costner and his young partner were highly interesting. From their first confrontation Costner has an evident interest in the little boy a nagging curiosity that will grow throughout his run. In this way his attitude at least in the outset of the film is quite different from Bogarde's. The latter realizing that he has no other choice to take his brat with him expresses at first hostility and scorn before starting to get interested in him. Not Costner who is clearly interested with his hostage from the outset and for whom he feels affection. In the two flicks the little boys may see in Bogarde and Costner the father figures they never had. Their households are characterized by an absence of father. As for Costner he unveils to his partner scraps of his anterior life which might explain one of his attitudes towards him. Maybe he tries to play his role of father and this way to get close to him we have a lot of things in common you and me we love Coke we never had father. He wants to make him discover a new life a freer and more maverick one in which anything goes he asks him to write the things he craves to do.Nature plays a momentum role in a Perfect World it surrounds the characters and is of a vivacious green which symbolizes bliss and hope. In this perfect world the two main protagonists try to search for support friendship bliss but impending danger waits around the corner.Eastwood's flick was also decried because the other sequences of the film in which Eastwood and his crew appear were rather weak. I don't think so. True the character of Laura Dern is a little formulaic but in one sequence the most important members offer their vision of a perfect world. And even if here he doesn't hold the main role Clint Eastwood has a prime secondary part. The cast is a major asset of the film. The little boy is directed with care and respect and Eastwood gave Costner his last great hour given the duds in which he acted afterward the horrible Waterworld 1995 a waste of money and time and the insipid Postman 1997.Coming after a pinnacle in his career Unforgiven I feel that Eastwood wasn't hampered by this critical and commercial triumph and broke new ground in the fugitive movie with this startling piece of work. Give this movie a chance. It deserves it. And if you have the chance to see Hunted don't think twice. Eastwood's flick compares favorably with its 40 year old model. And after the projection try to ask yourself this question what is a perfect world?".

So even though he's a criminal he's got a good side and obviously his bad upbringing took him down the wrong path in life. I though TJ Lowther was also excellent as the boy and was very believable. On the other side is Clint Eastwood as the tough law man who cares more about catching his criminal than making his bosses happy. And last but not least Laura Dern was also very good as Clint's cohort in catching the bad guy. While Clint relies on his years of experience she comes from the psychological side and what she's read in books. They often disagree but there is a mutual respect between them even if they don't show it. There are enough light moments to keep this otherwise serious movie from being a turn off. Out of 4".

	schema:reviewBody "Being a sucker for any decent road movie i was always predestined to enjoy this one. The surprising thing is that it's taken all of nineteen years to get round to it. I've always found Kevin Costner to be a likable screen presence and it's here at the height of his stardom with top billing that he's on great form. Costner plays Robert 'Butch' Haynes an escaped convict who due to a botched robbery ends up kidnapping 'Buzz'  a young boy T.J Lowther with whom he forms an unlikely mutual bond. Although there's an inherent darkness to proceedings there's also much sweetness. They form the kind of father and son friendship that as the film unfolds we realise Haynes never had making it easier to feel sympathetic toward him amid the crime spree. Later in the film that same sympathy is tested as it's revealed how emotionally damaged Haynes is. To the boy the whole thing is an exciting adventure as it's highlighted early on that his religious background has kept him somewhat excluded. Haynes on the other hand seems to treat the escapade as therapy for the upbringing he never had. He constantly gives the boy choices and at no point does it feel like a dangerous hostage situation. As with all the better Clint Eastwood directed films it's stylistically unfussy with emphasis on building a strong relationship between audience and character. Eastwood himself is a great presence in the film playing a law man trying to keep a steady head and shares some excellent screen time with Laura Dern. The screenplay also deserves a nod as it serves up some fun interplay dialogue and observations. Some very minor flaws push the limits of credibility one in particular involving Buzz behind the wheel of a car and some expert last minute breaking but they give way to what is a heartfelt and touching experience.".

	schema:reviewBody "Continuing my plan to watch every Kevin Costner movie in order I come to 1993's A Perfect World. Plot In A Paragraph Butch Haynes KC escapes from prison and kidnaps a young boy T.J. Lowther In hot pursuit is a Texas Ranger Red Garrett Clint EastwoodA Perfect World is not a great movie it's an underrated masterpiece that has somehow slipped through the cracks despite great reviews I remember one saying You'll be Unforgiven For Missing A Perfect World it was overlooked on its initial release and has been largely forgotten since. On paper the film should have produced an instant box office hit. KC was Hollywoods golden boy producing hit after hit Dances With Wolves Prince Of Thieves JFK and The Bodyguard whilst Eastwood had just won a pair of Oscars for Unforgiven and had a hit with In The Line Of Fire yet for some reason audiences stayed away. The trailers didn't really help as they were uninspiring to say the least and didn't convey the tone of the movie at all.I urge everybody to revisit it. Not only because A Perfect World features the best performance of KC's career it may also the best movie Clint Eastwood has directed yes I am including my own personal favourite The Outlaw Josie Wales and Oscar winning Unforgiven in that statement. The movie has a prison break a kidnapping and murders but it's not really about any of their things it's so much deeper than that. The heart of the movie is the relationship between Butch and Phillip. Butch isn't a nice guy we see plenty of examples of this but he is kind to the boy and Phillip isn't a cute movie kid and with his natural performance and expressive face he does not come off as a child actor either which is the highest compliment I can give This isn't just KC's best performance it's probably my personal favourite KC performance too. It's amazing and combines everything that he is so good at. Butch is charming and sincere but also short tempered especially if he sees children being mistreated unpredictable and very dangerous. Most of KC's scenes are with Lowther and the two have such great chemistry together that you really do feel the bond developing between them.Clint takes an unexpected back seat in this one and that's fine. Also fine is Laura Dern who I've always being strangely attracted to playing a criminologist who isn't just along for the ride.While the movie could have easily been a bog standard chase movie but it's patient pacing and its themes father and son bonds elevate it to greatness. Much like Unforgiven the movie is a warning about violence. Especially violence towards children. As a crime drama it is effective and tense but as a story of fathers and sons it becomes something more poignant. It's a a deeply satisfying slowburner that only improves with age. Worthy of note is the score by Lennie Niehaus who Eastwood used often and a track called Big Frans Baby the location work and Eastwood's use of colours. Criminally over looked at the time of its release. A Perfect World ended the year 54th highest grossing movie of 1993 with a domestic gross of 31 million to put that into context Cop And A Half grossed more!! America should hang it's head in shame. Everyone who has seen it should revisit this gem. If you haven't seen it I strongly recommend you do so. 1010 for this reviewer.".

Plot In A Paragraph Butch Haynes KC escapes from prison and kidnaps a young boy T.J. Lowther In hot pursuit is a Texas Ranger Red Garrett Clint EastwoodA Perfect World is not a great movie it's an underrated masterpiece that has somehow slipped through the cracks despite great reviews I remember one saying You'll be Unforgiven For Missing A Perfect World it was overlooked on its initial release and has been largely forgotten since. On paper the film should have produced an instant box office hit. KC was Hollywoods golden boy producing hit after hit Dances With Wolves Prince Of Thieves JFK and The Bodyguard whilst Eastwood had just won a pair of Oscars for Unforgiven and had a hit with In The Line Of Fire yet for some reason audiences stayed away. The trailers didn't really help as they were uninspiring to say the least and didn't convey the tone of the movie at all.I urge everybody to revisit it. Not only because A Perfect World features the best performance of KC's career it may also the best movie Clint Eastwood has directed yes I am including my own personal favourite The Outlaw Josie Wales and Oscar winning Unforgiven in that statement. The movie has a prison break a kidnapping and murders but it's not really about any of their things it's so much deeper than that.

Meanwhile the authorities headed by a Texas Ranger Clint Eastwood set out to capture Haynes in an Airstream trailer.Costner does a fine job as Haynes an interesting character who happens to like waltz music. Lowther is equally good in his role a boy who comes from a family whose religious beliefs are quite strict. On their sojourn the boy acquires and sometimes wears a Casperthefriendlyghost mask a symbol of childhood innocence that contrasts nicely with the seriousness of a dangerous hostage situation.The relationship between Haynes and the kid evolves into a kind of fatherson union wherein Haynes does most of the talking and the kid reacts usually with clever nonverbal expressions. It's a good acting arrangement that plays up the strengths of both actors. It's the best element of the film.Throughout their odyssey a collection of oldies pop songs helps to capture the early 1960's era though I could have wished that the volume had been turned up. Haynes' goal is Alaska but he doesn't quite get there and the film ends much more interestingly than it began.The main problem with the film is the plot. It gets off to a hokey contrived start. And throughout the film the law enforcement component does not work at all. It comes across as stereotyped irritating unnecessary and it is not funny despite attempts to make it funny. You get the feeling you're watching reruns of The Dukes Of Hazard especially with that corny trailer.Even so the film is worth watching for the acting accomplishments of Costner and Lowther and for the interesting dialogue that takes place between their two characters.".

	schema:reviewBody "With the relatively recent string of directorial hits from Clint Eastwood it's easy to forget about this rough cut gem from 1993 in which Eastwood also has a supporting role. A Perfect World takes one through an entire range of human emotion while focusing on a hostage situation in progress. Kevin Costner plays against type as a small time hood who kidnaps an eight year old boy with his partner and then dispatches the partner when it appears he may have tried to abuse the youngster. Reaching back into his own troubled past Butch Haynes Costner over the course of the picture attempts to provide his ward Phillip T.J. Lowther with the type of surrogate fatherhood that both have lacked in their respective lives.What makes the story so compelling is the way Butch takes Phillip under his wing as the story progresses. At all times Butch is a straight shooter he tells Phillip the truth about the boy's father never coming back and how his mother's lying about it. At an age where he instinctively knows this to be true Phillip comes to respect and trust the man who in every other respect is a frightening criminal. The telling moment is when Butch takes the boy 'trick or treating' and Phillip makes repeated attempts to hold his hand until Butch relents. That single moment captured the essence of a relationship that was about to turn horribly bad.This is one picture for certain that doesn't fall into convention where you can see the end coming from a mile away. In the split second during the scene when Butch terrorizes the black family you don't have enough time to reflect on whether Phillip will actually pull the trigger or not and then BAM!  it's an entirely different story. As with many pictures though the dramatic ending leaves a lot more questions than answers. For example what about the trauma Phillip is likely to suffer for his role in helping to capture and kill Butch? Whisking him away in an emergency helicopter doesn't resolve that whole issue much as we like to see our pictures tied up into a nice neat bundle.Anyway this is a compelling story that isn't afraid to bring it's viewers 'outside the box' of traditional movie fare. It forces one to think about the nature of good and evil and how they can exist in the same person. It's a movie that you won't easily forget the day after you saw it as is the case with so many pictures relying on shoot 'em up action and a clear cut victory for the good guys.".

	schema:headline " Dirty Harry Atoned";
	schema:reviewBody "Violence is something I've tried to move away from.  EastwoodMost of Clint Eastwood's early films were reactionary fantasies. Later in his career he actively set out to repudiate the messages of these films. And so from the late 1980s onwards he'd specialise in flicks which meditate upon violence critique machismo flawed father figures and supposedly put forth anti violence messages though in most cases Unforgiven Gran Torino etc what these films do and pretend to do are completely at odds. Still Eastwood's films during the second half of his career sometimes went interesting places the best examples of which are probably White Hunter Black Heart and A Perfect World.Set in 1963 the year President JFK was assassinated A Perfect World stars Kevin Costner as an escaped convict who kidnaps a seven year old boy uses the kid as a hostage and flees crosscountry in a stolen car. Costner is pursued by a team of Texas Rangers led by Eastwood. While the film sports all the totems of the roadpursuitTexancatandmouse movie  lots of evocative shots of rural Texas trigger happy law enforcement officers car chases an episodic plot etc  Eastwood's film functions more as a meditation on the genre think Sugarland Express or Thelma and Louise as written by a bleeding heart criminal psychologist. And so rather than a catandmouse game the film's law enforcement officials are mostly inept are given no generic action set pieces and spend the film lethargically pontificating andor dwelling on their target's psychology history and motivations. Fairly radical the film then explicitly blames Eastwood's character for causing Costner's descent into criminality. It is rare for a film to reject essentialism but World does this portraying Costner as a victim of social exclusion and socialstructural forces all of which were exasperated when a hardlined cop Eastwood literally playing an elderly introspective Dirty Harry unnecessarily sentenced Coaster to prison as a kid a place where he was reformed into a supercriminal. The message Dirty Harry causes crime the socialstate creates the personal and authoritarian rightwing justice has long term negative effects even if they occasionally have short term gains.The film's title  A Perfect World  however injects an air of ambiguity. Wild West justice has horrible ripples the film says but we're positioned to side with Costner when he murders a paedophile. Elsewhere Eastwood challenges us with a daring unconventional prolonged last act sequence in which the once lovable Costner abuses a family a black family no less a middle finger to liberals. The film also features an interesting if woefully underused character played by Laura Dern. She's a criminal psychologist the effeminate touchyfeely foil to the ageing Eastwood a woman who challenges Dirty Harry's conceptions of law and crime prevention.The film features a woefully overextend final act too much false moments and forced pathos is 30 minutes too long and contains a predictablesappy ending in which Costner is gunned down but nevertheless remains one of Eastwood's best. T. J. Lowther who plays the kid Costner kidnaps is also given a good coming of age arc. His performance is powerfully raw at times.It's World's plot though which makes it stand out. At its core it pits Right realism which focuses on control containment and punishment against the soft rehabilitation of Left realism. Each side of the spectrum criticises the other one painted as too hardnosed and futile the other too impractical sympathetic and obsessed with causes. In the 1980s academics Crime and Human Nature by Wilson and Herrnstein began to put forth more nuanced explanations of crime considering biological social and genetic factors whilst in the 90s some studies Murray's Bell Curve began to revert to Darwinist connotations by attributing crime to low impulse control low intelligence poor socialisation genes and excessive extroversion. Political scientist Charles Murray would go so far as to blame the generous revolution of the welfare state for crime. In the 80s Right realists began to turn to theorists like Ron Clarke who asserted that Rational Choice Theory proves that individuals have free will and the power of reason and should therefore be punished harshly. Left realists counter this and take a more existential position turning to neuroscience to question the very nature of free will autonomy and consciousness. In the 21st century studies began officially debunking links between IQ and crime whilst right realists were accused of focusing on petty street crime whilst ignoring larger corporatestate crimes which are demonstrably more costlyharmful. The Right's zero tolerance policy began to once again be accused of leading to discrimination and racism and several studies were published which debunked the longstanding notion that tough policies reversed rising crime rates during the 1970s90s.Existing outside the leftright divide you then have anarchists who typically romanticise working class criminals. Left realists argue working class criminals mostly victimise other working class people not the rich. The right thinks they're both insane. Marxist scientists ignore all groups from an aloof perch. For them all crime is a matter of economics. Today numerous studies Lea and Young etc corroborate the seemingly obvious aside from crimes of passion crime is overwhelmingly due to deprivation and economic marginalisation.

	onyx:emotionText "Violence is something I've tried to move away from.  EastwoodMost of Clint Eastwood's early films were reactionary fantasies. Later in his career he actively set out to repudiate the messages of these films. And so from the late 1980s onwards he'd specialise in flicks which meditate upon violence critique machismo flawed father figures and supposedly put forth anti violence messages though in most cases Unforgiven Gran Torino etc what these films do and pretend to do are completely at odds. Still Eastwood's films during the second half of his career sometimes went interesting places the best examples of which are probably White Hunter Black Heart and A Perfect World.Set in 1963 the year President JFK was assassinated A Perfect World stars Kevin Costner as an escaped convict who kidnaps a seven year old boy uses the kid as a hostage and flees crosscountry in a stolen car. Costner is pursued by a team of Texas Rangers led by Eastwood. While the film sports all the totems of the roadpursuitTexancatandmouse movie  lots of evocative shots of rural Texas trigger happy law enforcement officers car chases an episodic plot etc  Eastwood's film functions more as a meditation on the genre think Sugarland Express or Thelma and Louise as written by a bleeding heart criminal psychologist. And so rather than a catandmouse game the film's law enforcement officials are mostly inept are given no generic action set pieces and spend the film lethargically pontificating andor dwelling on their target's psychology history and motivations. Fairly radical the film then explicitly blames Eastwood's character for causing Costner's descent into criminality. It is rare for a film to reject essentialism but World does this portraying Costner as a victim of social exclusion and socialstructural forces all of which were exasperated when a hardlined cop Eastwood literally playing an elderly introspective Dirty Harry unnecessarily sentenced Coaster to prison as a kid a place where he was reformed into a supercriminal. The message Dirty Harry causes crime the socialstate creates the personal and authoritarian rightwing justice has long term negative effects even if they occasionally have short term gains.The film's title  A Perfect World  however injects an air of ambiguity. Wild West justice has horrible ripples the film says but we're positioned to side with Costner when he murders a paedophile. Elsewhere Eastwood challenges us with a daring unconventional prolonged last act sequence in which the once lovable Costner abuses a family a black family no less a middle finger to liberals. The film also features an interesting if woefully underused character played by Laura Dern. She's a criminal psychologist the effeminate touchyfeely foil to the ageing Eastwood a woman who challenges Dirty Harry's conceptions of law and crime prevention.The film features a woefully overextend final act too much false moments and forced pathos is 30 minutes too long and contains a predictablesappy ending in which Costner is gunned down but nevertheless remains one of Eastwood's best. T. J. Lowther who plays the kid Costner kidnaps is also given a good coming of age arc. His performance is powerfully raw at times.It's World's plot though which makes it stand out. At its core it pits Right realism which focuses on control containment and punishment against the soft rehabilitation of Left realism. Each side of the spectrum criticises the other one painted as too hardnosed and futile the other too impractical sympathetic and obsessed with causes. In the 1980s academics Crime and Human Nature by Wilson and Herrnstein began to put forth more nuanced explanations of crime considering biological social and genetic factors whilst in the 90s some studies Murray's Bell Curve began to revert to Darwinist connotations by attributing crime to low impulse control low intelligence poor socialisation genes and excessive extroversion. Political scientist Charles Murray would go so far as to blame the generous revolution of the welfare state for crime. In the 80s Right realists began to turn to theorists like Ron Clarke who asserted that Rational Choice Theory proves that individuals have free will and the power of reason and should therefore be punished harshly. Left realists counter this and take a more existential position turning to neuroscience to question the very nature of free will autonomy and consciousness. In the 21st century studies began officially debunking links between IQ and crime whilst right realists were accused of focusing on petty street crime whilst ignoring larger corporatestate crimes which are demonstrably more costlyharmful. The Right's zero tolerance policy began to once again be accused of leading to discrimination and racism and several studies were published which debunked the longstanding notion that tough policies reversed rising crime rates during the 1970s90s.Existing outside the leftright divide you then have anarchists who typically romanticise working class criminals. Left realists argue working class criminals mostly victimise other working class people not the rich. The right thinks they're both insane. Marxist scientists ignore all groups from an aloof perch. For them all crime is a matter of economics. Today numerous studies Lea and Young etc corroborate the seemingly obvious aside from crimes of passion crime is overwhelmingly due to deprivation and economic marginalisation. Some counter this poverty was high in the 1930's but crime low and increases with rises in living standards. Enter relativity. Professor W.G. Runcimans starts using the concept of relative deprivation to explain the paradox. For him an ideology of individualism self interest at the expense of others and individual rights cause crime and social disintegration undermining values of mutual support and selflessness.

	schema:reviewBody "There are numerous directions Clint Eastwood and screenwriter John Lee Hancock could've taken in his film A Perfect World and the one he sucks up and follows is a brave endearing rollercoaster of emotion sentiment and commentary all providing slick and clean moments robbed of mawkish sequences. This is the seventeenth directing effort by Eastwood himself cementing the fact that the question of whether or not he is a better actor or director can never be answered. There are far too many examples to back up both.A Perfect World begins by showing us a deeply depraved saddening family of devout Jehovah's Witnesses. Phillip Perry T.J. Lowther is a young boy victim to not having birthdays holidays or events that pack in true joy for a child because of his mother's preposterous rules. His two sisters are too the victims. When a robbery is committed in the house Kevin Costner's Butch Haynes takes the kid as a hostage and Butch's loudmouth partner just waves a gun around and causes mayhem.When he is finally abandoned long after the robbery Butch and Phillip discover they have a lot more in common with each other than they could've imagined. Butch's dad was never around and his mother was a prostitute accompanied by men they couldn't care less about him. Phillip's dad is a simple deadbeat never there and never going to be. The film shows how destructive and possibly dehumanizing it can be without a prominent male influence in your life. I'm blessed to have two caring parents and that has helped me in more ways than I can imagine.It's big shame that many grow up today fatherless. An argument could be made about what is tougher growing up with no mother or no father. Without a father you don't get the time to be a man talk you never feel you can ask personal body questions to anyone and this leads to the lack of parental supervision causing kids to perhaps meander the streets aimlessly. Without a mother you've lost the softness every person must occupy. You lack the necessity of maybe truly being safe and cared for. Sure a man could do so but answer me this when children cry do they want mommy or daddy? I've trailed off course. A subplot of A Perfect World involves Eastwood's Texas Ranger Red Garnett and his crew on hot pursuit destined to find Butch and Phillip. The subplot sounded so obligatory on paper but writer Hancock is intelligent about keeping it a minimal occurrence. Not to mention it isn't as intrusive or as dopey as it seems. It's actually taken with a lot of seriousness and heart.Performancewise the film is around the clock superb. Much acclaim is due to Costner's character who is serenely nuanced enough to make a true memorable character. He has an outerlayer of cruelty but an inner layer of gooey anticynicism which comes forth very quickly. T.J. Lowther is spunky and charismatic as little Phillip and Eastwood do I even need to say it? Is incredible.A Perfect World may extend a bit over the recommended time limit but few few spots are dry the script is always attentive and the casting and directing style of Eastwood is fitting and balanced. This is probably Costner's most dedicated and engaging performances yet due to the moderate box office receipts and the minimal impact it has likely made him reconsider serious roles. Same thing could possibly go for Robert De Niro. It's undoubtedly easier to immerse yourself into a character that is thin vacuous and dull than one that is developed deep and potentialridden. Eastwood has made a sentimental gem of a picture with topics that hit seemingly hit every note but.Starring Kevin Costner T.J. Lowther and Clint Eastwood. Directed by Clint Eastwood.".

	schema:headline " A perfect movie";
	schema:reviewBody "many spoilers!!!!I just saw this movie today and was impressed. I know I should've seen it earlier but I missed it every time it was on TV. A Perfect World with Kevin Costner and Clint Eastwood tells the story of the fugitive convict Butch Haynes who escapes with his partner Terry Pugh from the Huntsville prison in 1963. On their flight they kidnap the young 8yearoldboy Phillip Perry and continue their race across Texas. As Pugh tries to abuse Phillip Butch kills him. While Texas Ranger Chief Red Garnett Eastwood hunts them the two discover similar bonds and Butch really comes to like young Phillip. The boy himself overcomes his suspicion and accepts Butch as a kind of older brother or even stronger as the compensation for his father whom he never knew. As the hunt continues Butch tells Phillip about his life and his wish to find his own father on Alaska where he would like to live in peace and dignity. They make certain stops steal three different cars and survive confrontations with the local cops. The movie deals not only with this flight of a criminal but also strongly with the issues of fathers and sons. That's what put this movie for me above the usual road movie. It goes deep deals with exhaustion love hopelessness and pure human emotions. The climax of the movie is unexpected. Butch and Phillip stay on a farm when the situation gets out of control. The farmer beats his young son and Butch attacks him even threatens to kill him. That's what causes Phillip to raise the gun against Butch and even shoots him in the stomach.Garnett reaches the place. Butch stumbles out of the farm and follows Phillip who sought for refuge on a big tree. Police forces surround them snipers get into positions. But Phillip is not willing to leave Butch though he would have let him go to his mom who also arrived at the scenery. He runs back to the wounded Butch and hugs him. There you can see the love and sympathy the boy feels for the criminal. I was caught in high attention unable to move. How would the movie end? Criminologist Sally Gerber is with Garnett and both of them know really know Butch Garnett even knows him from his childhood in Amarillo on. They try to solve the situation peacefully. But when Phillip and Butch move towards Garnett hand in hand Butch stumbles again and tries to give the photograph of Alaska which his father sent him to Phillip.

	onyx:emotionText "many spoilers!!!!I just saw this movie today and was impressed. I know I should've seen it earlier but I missed it every time it was on TV. A Perfect World with Kevin Costner and Clint Eastwood tells the story of the fugitive convict Butch Haynes who escapes with his partner Terry Pugh from the Huntsville prison in 1963. On their flight they kidnap the young 8yearoldboy Phillip Perry and continue their race across Texas. As Pugh tries to abuse Phillip Butch kills him. While Texas Ranger Chief Red Garnett Eastwood hunts them the two discover similar bonds and Butch really comes to like young Phillip. The boy himself overcomes his suspicion and accepts Butch as a kind of older brother or even stronger as the compensation for his father whom he never knew. As the hunt continues Butch tells Phillip about his life and his wish to find his own father on Alaska where he would like to live in peace and dignity. They make certain stops steal three different cars and survive confrontations with the local cops. The movie deals not only with this flight of a criminal but also strongly with the issues of fathers and sons. That's what put this movie for me above the usual road movie. It goes deep deals with exhaustion love hopelessness and pure human emotions. The climax of the movie is unexpected. Butch and Phillip stay on a farm when the situation gets out of control. The farmer beats his young son and Butch attacks him even threatens to kill him. That's what causes Phillip to raise the gun against Butch and even shoots him in the stomach.Garnett reaches the place. Butch stumbles out of the farm and follows Phillip who sought for refuge on a big tree. Police forces surround them snipers get into positions. But Phillip is not willing to leave Butch though he would have let him go to his mom who also arrived at the scenery. He runs back to the wounded Butch and hugs him. There you can see the love and sympathy the boy feels for the criminal. I was caught in high attention unable to move. How would the movie end? Criminologist Sally Gerber is with Garnett and both of them know really know Butch Garnett even knows him from his childhood in Amarillo on. They try to solve the situation peacefully. But when Phillip and Butch move towards Garnett hand in hand Butch stumbles again and tries to give the photograph of Alaska which his father sent him to Phillip. The sniper an arrogant FBI agent supposes Butch would draw a gun and fires a shot into the chest of the man. He dies Phillip kneeing on his side taking the photo and eventually his mom draws him away from Butch. Garnett is angry. He wanted to save the guy for he knew the good heart of Haynes.

	schema:reviewBody "I can't believe that so many reviews of Midnight Express have degenerated into exchanges of opposing political views that skirt over the film itself. While this may be based on a true story like any good filmmaker the director Alan Parker has shown the shades of gray here. The film's message as far as any fairminded viewer should discern it is that the individual and the state whether one's own or a foreign country exist in a fragile state of consent with each other which requires fair and proportional responses on both sides. Neither side is totally in the right or the wrong here in Parker's film.Billy Hayes is not a guiltless redblooded hero here and Parker doesn't portray him as such. Hayes committed what would have been a crime in any country smuggling heroin and he was caught and rightfully prosecuted. He has broken laws and must pay the price.Just to be on the safe sideMINOR SPOILERS HEREHayes is initially handed a sentence by the Turkish court approximately 4 years that would probably be considered fair in any civilised society for his activities. The prison is tough it's not supposed to be a cakewalk but Hayes accepts his punishment and overall stays out of trouble while in the prison. Then with little more than two months left in his term and the prospect of release dangling before him a higher Turkish court for obscure and apparently contrived reasons making someone an example suddenly comes back basically saying he's going to spend the rest of his life in prison for his one earlier slip. At this point the moral compass as it may be shifts to Billy. He's done his time he's behaved he's accepted his punishment and it's hardships and suddenly the rug is pulled out from under him. To all the hotbloods here who say Hayes was a rich American who deserved what he got have you ever heard of the concept of proportionality in law? Hayes did not commit a violent crime against anybody both in terms of his initial act and up to the time the appellate court extended his sentence he did not even commit a property crime like stealing or burglary. This is what Parker is saying Hayes was in the wrong for smuggling and was justly punished for those four years but the arbitrary extension of his sentence close to his release and the sheer length of the term pretty much a lifer are grossly disproportionate and unbecoming of a civilised society. In many if not most countries even many killers are usually sentenced to far less than the 30 years that were suddenly tacked onto Hayes's term and they don't experience the sort of sadistic torture meted out by the wardens in the jail in this film. It had the stink of scapegoating and the rest of the film shows Hayes's desperate attempts to survive and escape a system that has become corrupt.For what it's worth I'm not an American and I don't in any way harbor illusions of superiority on the part of the West or East. One might make similar criticisms of things like the 3 Strikes Law in the USA which are also pretty arbitrary. Parker isn't commenting on which civilizations isare superior he's saying that there are some universal civil liberties that any civilised society should strive to and societies both west and east fail when they deny them to the most vulnerable people namely those sent to prison and stripped of even the freedom to mix with the general population. And note furthermore that the Turks in the prison the vast majority suffer as much as the foreigners. BTW to the commentators who've stupidly claimed that this film is merely American propaganda Alan Parker is British. If you're going to hurl an accusation like that at least get such a basic fact straight.BTW I've been to Turkey and I've found the Turks to be among the world's most generous and kind people esp to strangers. And sometimes I do wish that Parker had included more Turkish characters with more agreeable qualities which even in a prison one would be likely to find and I also found the comparison to pigs comment in the courtroom to be inappropriate. But Parker wanted to make this a gritty film with an air of desperation throughout and for this reason alone one should be careful about extending what's seen in this film to the Turks as a whole.".

Before you condemn Turkey remember that at the time Turkey was being pressured by the world community particularly by the US to do something about the drug flow coming out of the country.

Having lived in Turkey I know this to be totally false. In addition with the exception of the skyline of Istanbul in the opening scene none of the movie was filmed in Turkey.

I am not one of those people who think that a true story must be completely true I think that the purpose of movies is to entertain and this one certainly does that if in a harrowing way.  But given the politics of our time if the author of the screenplay wanted to create a demon people for dramatic effect perhaps it would have been better to have set the story in a fictional or unidentified country.  The other observation I would make is we are not much better than they are. We regularly sentence people to ungodly amounts of prison time for drug offenses both on a state and federal level.  Our prisons are no picnic either with many of the same sorts of things that were portrayed in the movie happening right here at home.

	schema:headline " A ThrillRide Of Fictional Proportions.";
	schema:reviewBody "I have to be fair the movie does what it's supposed to and that's giving the audience a horrific thrill ride. You'll spend your time watching the movie in sheer horror and at the edge of your seat wondering what's going to happen next. As with all Oliver Stone movies such as Salvador Born On The Fourth Of July and Platoon Midnight Express is brutal and merciless. Oliver Stone it seems has made a habit of making money and getting Oscars from controversial andor little known events in history and dramatizing on it to a point of making the story haunting. The only downside is for the sake of awards and art a culture was demonized beyond redemption and any limits over a fictional story Oliver Stone himself wrote the story for the movie. The following is not a spoiler from the movie but points out an event from the plot In reality William Hayes it turns out was arrested at the Turkish airport for trying to smuggle packs of drugs attached on his body into the U.S. and he was held for a time before being given to the American authorities for deportation. William Hayes and Oliver Stone themselves it turns out have already apologized to the Turkish people for the overly dramatized and fictional parts of the movie and the book. It's funny actually how a movie can create so much on a true moment in life to a point of fiction and still call it a true story. The Turks don't get any breaks in the movie. All their people cops judges lawyers and inmates are shown in such extreme way as ugly merciless demonic and sadistic people that one who knows nothing about Turkey would think that its population consists of demons and ugly merciless sadists. Actually this can be compared to movies which have been made about the Russians in the past which always seem to show the Russian women as ugly people with facial hair and nothing attractive while in reality Beautiful Russian women dominated the modeling business in the world. While apologies have been made the damage has already been done on the image of the Turkish people. People who are antiTurkish love praising this movie and insisting that it's a true story all the way while the Turks keep getting rightfully offended.

	onyx:emotionText "I have to be fair the movie does what it's supposed to and that's giving the audience a horrific thrill ride. You'll spend your time watching the movie in sheer horror and at the edge of your seat wondering what's going to happen next. As with all Oliver Stone movies such as Salvador Born On The Fourth Of July and Platoon Midnight Express is brutal and merciless. Oliver Stone it seems has made a habit of making money and getting Oscars from controversial andor little known events in history and dramatizing on it to a point of making the story haunting. The only downside is for the sake of awards and art a culture was demonized beyond redemption and any limits over a fictional story Oliver Stone himself wrote the story for the movie. The following is not a spoiler from the movie but points out an event from the plot In reality William Hayes it turns out was arrested at the Turkish airport for trying to smuggle packs of drugs attached on his body into the U.S. and he was held for a time before being given to the American authorities for deportation. William Hayes and Oliver Stone themselves it turns out have already apologized to the Turkish people for the overly dramatized and fictional parts of the movie and the book. It's funny actually how a movie can create so much on a true moment in life to a point of fiction and still call it a true story. The Turks don't get any breaks in the movie. All their people cops judges lawyers and inmates are shown in such extreme way as ugly merciless demonic and sadistic people that one who knows nothing about Turkey would think that its population consists of demons and ugly merciless sadists. Actually this can be compared to movies which have been made about the Russians in the past which always seem to show the Russian women as ugly people with facial hair and nothing attractive while in reality Beautiful Russian women dominated the modeling business in the world. While apologies have been made the damage has already been done on the image of the Turkish people. People who are antiTurkish love praising this movie and insisting that it's a true story all the way while the Turks keep getting rightfully offended. Be aware however that 80 or some more of this movie is purely fictional. Even just logic would tell you that at a time where the U.S. and Turkey had such strong relations during the cold war something like what is shown in the movie would have been unthinkable by the Turkish authorities. For a person who just wants to watch a good thriller movie and doesn't care nor wants to get involved in any dramatic flame wars or political discussions on this board or any other it's worth watching at least once.

	schema:reviewBody "Midnight Express is directed by Alan Parker and adapted to screenplay by Oliver Stone. It is loosely based on Billy Hayes' book of the same name. It tells of American Hayes' Brad Davis arrest and subsequent conviction for trying to smuggle hashish out of Istanbul Turkey for which he was sent to a hellish Turkish prison to serve his time. It also stars Randy Quaid John Hurt Paul L. Smith and Irene Miracle. Music is scored by Giorgio Moroder and cinematography is by Michael Seresin.Although controversy followed it due to its portrayals of the Turkish people Midnight Express is today still a raw and uncompromising experience. In fact if we strip away Moroder's Oscar winning electro bubbling score the film holds up as a fresh and pertinent piece of film making. Parker doesn't cut corners or attempt any sort of Hollywood gloss he keeps it grimy oppressive and harsh in its telling whilst the handheld camera work keeps things jittery harmonising with Billy Hayes and his fellow cons' state of mind. The narrative unfurls from Billy's POV and it's mostly in a downwards direction with that it's hard to call the picture essential entertainment we are after all observant to mental and physical abuse with the disintegration of the human spirit front and centre. Billy's alienation is deftly crafted by Parker where the non use of subtitles for the Turkish characters helps us to feel as isolated as Billy was. However there's the odd glimmer of hope and humanity courtesy of Billy's interactions within the few friendships he forms and of course there's the overriding urge to see him escape his hell.Stone won the Academy Award for his screenplay and even though it has been frowned upon for some of the perceived bile unleashed on the Turks it mostly excels on a human's under duress basis. The interactions between prisoners is often solemn and edgy due to the characters being from different walks of life while much of Hayes' outpourings of emotion have conviction by way of the words even if one particular speech is ill advised and over the top. Cast are excellent where Davis calls on the sadness in his real life upbringing to give a performance of real intensity while Hurt and Quaid are beaten down by drug fuelled resignation and tempestuousness respectively. It has flaws and the over dramatising of certain events tends to deviate from a real story that hardly needed extra oomph but always Midnight Express remains a harrowing and potent piece of cinema. 810".

	schema:headline " Very Powerful Film Despite Several Distortions of The Real Story.";
	schema:reviewBody "Midnight Express tells the story of a young American Billy Hayes who was arrested in 1970 for possession of Hashish in Istanbul Turkey. The film chronicles Billy's journey into the nightmarish hell of the Turkish prison. Slowly the viewer begins to see how Billy's personality begins to change from a funloving individual to a decaying vegetable as the justice system betrays him. Originally sentenced to 4 years and two months the head prosecutor successfully appeals the verdict to the Turkish Supreme Court forcing the trial court judge to resentence Billy to a minimum of 30 years.The torture scenes involving Billy getting sadistically beaten by the prison guard Hamadu are very painful to watch especially a scene early on in the film where Billy is strung up by his ankles and beaten on a rack for taking a blanket without permission. Billy and his inmates escape plans provide great dramatic tension in a terrific narrative style. Ultimately Billy engages in a brutal fight with an inmate named Rifki whom everyone hates especially Billy because Rifki rats on all of the prisoners. Rifki likes to make life even more miserable for the inmates. As punishment Billy is sent to the prison's Section 13 for the criminally insane.Billy is given bribe money by his girlfriend Susan who comes to see him in a heartbreaking scene. Almost all of Billy's innerstrength is taken away by the harsh realities of the prison. However he is able to say I love you through many tears.The head guard Hamidou refuses to be bought and takes Billy to the Sanitarium where he beats him and tries to have sex with him. Billy charges the guard rams the guard's head into a spike on the wall killing him. Stealing his uniform Billy escapes the prison and shortly afterward we learn that he arrived home with his family 3 weeks later.I have actually read Billy Hayes' book Midnight Express. In reality Billy did not have any major quarrels with the Turkish people. The film shows the opposite. There was really only one guard that treated him badly but nowhere near what Hamidou did in the movie. In reality Billy never was transferred to the insane part of the prison for fighting. He had one minor altercation with an inmate. The book talks more about the unsanitary conditions of the prison. There are many instances in the book that will make you want to surrender your lunch unfortunately.The biggest distortion is that in reallife Billy Hayes never killed any guard as a part of his escape plan. He simply got out one night and swam across the boarder into Greece and that was it.There are differences in how the film was made as well. The Turkish Government was outraged at how this movie distorted the real Billy Hayes case and refused to allow the movie to be filmed there. Most of the film was shot off the island of Malta. A good deal of the language spoken in the movie is NOT Turkish but Maltese which to the untrained ear is often mistaken for Turkish dialect.Nevertheless I rate the film highly because it is still a very good movie with great acting music and dramatic tension. Amazingly the actor who played Billy Hayes Brad Davis died of AIDS. He did an excellent job as the real Billy Hayes. In my view many scenes had to be changed for dramatic effect. You will remember this film forever. It will undoubtedly make you think twice about doing something stupid in a foreign country! Despite its flaws when compared to Billy Hayes' reallife story Midnight Express is still a very emotional film that withstands the test of time. It would be a 1010 if it were closer to the truth. However the film is still excellent and is strongly recommended viewing.".

By the way I must mention that a Turkish jail is not worse than an American jail where prison rape is everyday's business.

After some certain point it's getting boring and annoying since there is too little atmosphere in the movie and that leaves a cheesy aftertaste.It's a pity why Olive Stone didn't go deeper into the characters because then the audience have had some knots to cling to some interesting aspects.

	schema:reviewBody "Ok I'll try not to be subjective as the movie itself while judging it whereas it'll be hard. Now it has its pluses and minuses like all the movies ever made in the history of cinema. Nothing wrong with that for sure. What's wrong though is that the minuses override the pluses in this movie BIG TIME! Life in a Turkish prison might not be anywhere close to a vacation in Hawaii but the situation is exaggerated 5 million times in this movie. First of all foreigners are always treated nicer than locals in Turkey in all aspects of society including the prisons. Second this Hayes guy wasn't imprisoned just because everyone in the prison was ugly and the prison needed a handsome detainee he was imprisoned because he was trafficking DRUGS! Even in Holland where the law permits the use of hash trafficking so much stuff would be enough to make one look at the world through the jail bars. For those who don't know There was another American guy who went to prison in Turkey at about the same time as Hayes for the same crime. And upon watching this revolting movie he wrote a book about his experience in the tourist cell of a Turkish prison and he clearly states Hayes is a big time BS thrower and his life in the Turkish prison was exactly as good as a life in any prison could have been. So one could easily tell that the storyline on this movie is not necessarily imaginary but an absolute exaggeration of the reality.Enough about the story now let's talk about the cinematography itself. Well.. It's BAD! The Turkish lawyer and the Turkish prisoners speaking Turkish with an Italian accent the Turkish judge speaking Turkish with an American accent the Turkish prosecutor played by an Armenian terrorist speaking in a terrible Armenian accent.. That's hillarious! Also everyone who plays a Turkish role in the movie is ugly as hell. Women all wear ninjasuits. Well what else? Or do we need any other reason to say this movie is a failure? It's so obvious that the director is tearing up his rear to make Turks and Turkey look bad. And if it takes such an obvious try to do that it means his filmmaking skills are not good enough to manifest his message. If you want to see a movie that's showing things 0 out of which are the least bit real and if you want to lose all your respect to director Alan Parker go watch this movie right now! But if you just want a good movie avoid it at all costs it'll make you nauseous.".

	schema:headline " The true story of American Billy Hayes' nightmarish prison stint...";
	schema:reviewBody "Midnight Express is the type of movie that stays with you that makes you think about the things that you have in your everyday life and makes you cherish those things. The movie opens with our hero William Billy Hayes wrapping himself up in aluminum folded hash as he is preparing to attempt going through customs with the drugs around his waist. It's Turkey in 1970 and as the movie points out bombs are being planted on aircrafts like flies on syrup. Right off the bat we can see that Billy does not have the cojones for such a task as the recurrent heartbeat that becomes the movie's trademark along with its Oscarwinning score by Giorgio Moroder gets stronger and stronger to the point where that nervousness and lack of cool costs him his freedom. He is searched before boarding the plane and is taken away into a nightmarish ride.There's a problem that I have with a character played by American Graffiti's Bo Hopkins who comes in and is very fluent in Turkish and introduces himself as sort of a representative from the U.S. Consulate. The problem that I have with this character is that we are never told his name or why he is even there but he is certainly a key element in the film since he is the one who put Billy behind bars after a stupid attempt to escape.Now I do agree on the fact that the punishment must fit the crime and at the beginning the 4year sentence that Billy's given seems to be just about right for a federal offense such as trying to smuggle drugs from one country to another but our hero never seems to be able to understand the severity of his crime and never seems to regret his actions even coming close to demanding that his father get him out of there. After his sentence is changed to Life in Prison Billy goes berserk and starts a monologue against Turkish justice and even its people that must have caused quite a controversy back in its day.The supporting characters are all brilliantly played namely John Hurt in an Oscarnominated turn as an English prisoner who has been half eaten by drugs and prison life and who is left behind by Billy at the end but we never are told what became of him. Randy Quaid is equally good albeit in a more thankless role as a fellow American who was imprisoned for 7 years after stealing a candlestick from a temple.The movie is not easy to digest but is realistic enough to make you feel for the leading characters especially Billy even though we know that he deserved to do the time we don't feel like he deserved Life Sentence and so that is why the ending is so rewarding in our hearts. Rewarding not in a Shawshank Redemption fantasy type of a way but in a true sense because unlike Andy Dufresne in Shawshank Billy's escape is purely random and we go along with him for the ride towards freedom not like Andy who snuck out the back door and left us wanting for more. Don't get me wrong I do believe that Shawshank is one of the top 5 movies that I've ever seen but Midnight Express stays with you a little longer. They don't make 'em like this anymore. By the way this was Oliver Stone's first script to be turned into a movie.I highly recommend this movie as it is one of the true jewels of the golden era of Hollywood in the 1970's. Check it out.".

And the very first thing about Midnight Express I got contact with was this music.  It's modern it's sinister it's tense. Listening to it with eyes closed you can imagine a frantic chasing scene a cold quiet killer running after a frightened sweating guy in any sleazy areas of any big city.  Running yes there must be some running.Watching stalwart Sir Alan Parker's movie viewers need to be psychologically prepared for the dark elements he often employs on the to some degree shocking scenes.  I still cannot stomach Bob Geldof's suicide pool Pink Floyd The Wall.Crime and punishment humanitarianism use of drugs liberal and repressed societies etc can all be discussed after one has seen the movie.  I watched this one when I was about 15.  When the Turkish jailers wanted to rape Billy I was so silly to ask my brother who is five years younger than I am what they were doing and he told me their intention.  Shocked.  And I more or less have very little interest in prison movie afterwards.  Later I have a chance to read a little of the book not a very wellwritten one more like a report.  The movie at my viewing somehow reminded me of Papillon another escape from a foreign land.  That one is less nauseating.Seeing west Turkey some ten years ago I talked with some Turks about the movie.  Quite a number of them watched it outside the country.  The truth is that they don't mind how ugly the west portrays their prison or even their country because the movie only told partial truth and this has already confirmed by B Hayes himself.  According those Turks the Turkish jailers would rather have women than men because they are not that easily available. The west still conquers the world mass media.  Viewers have to keep their heads clear.".

The movie is both a confession and an hymn to life. It doesn't try to moralize the audience although some spectators were concerned about the message such a film might send. You have to remember that the events described in LNF take place in 1986 when the concept of HIV and AIDS were still abstract and to be defined. Collard himself said in a 1992 interview that the irresponsability of his character Jean having unprotected sex although aware he is infected would be rightly considered criminal by now. The virus serves as a driving force for a main character that is learning to love opening himself to others to the world. But to reach the light you must first go through the darkness and the task is not an easy one to witness. LNF demands a lot on the viewer asking him to let go of his preconceive ideas and ideals. Very much influenced by his mentor Maurice Pialat Collard makes a daring film one which you could never imagine coming from the all too clean world of Hollywood film making. Here energy comes first technical aspects of movie making later. Therefore life real life shines through. Les nuits fauves is a force to be reckon with. An unsettling experience I will never forget.".

The bouncing around of highlow's from absolute certainty of overcoming the disease to deep depression and sending everything love included straight to hell. But also the dangerous and sometimes silly sense of humor with which the director plays his role is what makes this movie invaluable to me. To my knowledge this is the first film in which HIV positive blood is used as a defensive weapon and saves the life of two of the characters. I sincerely hope that there is some form of afterlife and that they have cable. Collard deserves to know he was is deeply appreciated as so many others who where cheated out of time to see their work achieve recognition. One is what one does they say.".

I sincerely hope that there is some form of afterlife and that they have cable. Collard deserves to know he was is deeply appreciated as so many others who where cheated out of time to see their work achieve recognition. One is what one does they say.";

For a start the depiction of ambisexuality is quite sincere showing the suffering this ambiguous sexual behavior considered an orientation in spite of its apparent lack of direction brings to people really involved or in love with the socalled bisexual entity who feels attracted to both men and women. The motion picture is not fiction or a bad joke but mainly facts based on Cyril Collard's own life who infected the woman he was involved with played here by Romane Bohringer knowing he was HIVpositive. First came the revelation through the novel of the same title and then the film in which he played his own part because no French actor even considered to play it finding it too risky for their careers. Collard plays himself apparently as he was a vain irresponsible hedonistic strong case of satyriasis the male counterpart for female erotic mania and thanks for his daring to show his lifestyle his passions and his mistakes at least he left a starting point for openminded partners to discuss a subject that may be affecting their relationships. It is a film as hard and bleak as Wong KarWai's Happy Together but both are necessary. There is time for To Wong Foo and for Priscilla Queen of the Desert there is even time for explicitness. But there should be also time for putting moralistic judgment aside and watch and talk about dramas that show aspects of our condition that we tend to trivialize or deny and that may make unhappy the persons we love. Five days after Cyril Collard died Les nuits fauves won the Csar France's top film prize for Best Film Best First Work Best Film Editing and Best Female Newcomer Miss Bohringer who three years later played again the victim of two men in love Leonardo DiCaprio and David Thewlis as Rimbaud and Verlaine in Total Eclipse.

Stories about the HIVAIDS epidemic and they're coming in the thousands right after brilliant documentary How To Survive a Plague the stream continued with Dallas Buyers Club Behind the Candelabra and the upcoming adaptation of The Normal Heart. They're all heroic real and influential tellings and they're getting a lot of praise from everybody. Meanwhile I took the time to look back at the time machine and search for works that were released back in the nightmarish days when the plague was a horrific death sentence and a theme barely touched on the screen. Among those Les Nuits Fauves Savage Nights is one that needs to receive a special attention. It's unlike any of the forementioned titles it's daring at the same time it's unpleasant careless controversial and it's a different take from almost all the other films of the period. This is the antiPhiladelphia  I make this comparison because they were released very next to each other the same year in most countries.What you're about to see was a real story fictionalized at times but real. Its writer director and main star Cyril Collard exposes a dark truth that frightens revolts and angers but he was being truth to himself and to the public. First with his 1986 novel of same name and then by making this adaptation huge risks in presenting his story about Jean a HIV positive cinematographer wanna be director who refuses to deal with his condition still living a hedonistic and wild life of parties drugs and sex with both men and women. We focus on two of his lovers the 17 yearold Laura Rohmane Bohringer naive and impressionable enough to fall in love with him and the rugby player Sami Carlos Lpez bisexual just like Jean but they're more into the attraction part than dealing with a lovehate kind of thing. Torn between these two and also with casual sex encounters with strangers under a Parisian bridge Jean ignores his disease living as if things never changed deeply knowing that he is changing getting affected more and more each day goes by. Everything's resumed into knowing that he's alive and kicking and there's some time to be enjoyed before death. But don't be fooled. Savage Nights is pain after pain pleasure is very limited. The relation with Sami is a pure escapism since most of the time he's committed with girls and finding time to be join a racisthomophobic group beating up people like Jean where he can release his frustration of not living the same way he did with his criminal father back in Spain the love affair with Laura is a constant headache mostly because she doesn't handle well the fact that Jean likes guys and she knows about Sami. It gets worse when Jean reveals that he's HIV positive and she might be as well because they had unprotected sexual relations. His excuse for not saying it before is unreasonable yet believable and probably used by many folks out there he thought she'd never get AIDS because their love is strong and overcomes anything even a deadly virus. It's the greatest and most difficult scene of the film and some will focus their anger and hate not on the character but on Collard. I appreciated the film because Collard has given a different perspective on a delicate theme at the time had a lot of nerve in telling his story but not necessarily a full factual retelling there's rumors that the story ended differently for the real girl who inspired Laura and despite the obstacles faced with his new reality finding ways to see life with some optimism grasping to it with the few strength he has and seeing it a little differently. Sure he's still careless about others and himself always putting his feelings above the others including family and friends but now he can truly say he loves his life. Sickness feels less important the complete opposite of what happens in similar themed films where you see characters slowly succumbing to the disease which is always on the foreground preventing them to do anything about it. Collard's adaptation of his own novel doesn't betray his source though he left out great sequences  the one in Morocco is reduced to bits and pieces but it was poetic translated in surreal scenes  but the way he conducted its transformation to the screen was very good small chapters and fragments of a full speeding life that runs towards the inevitable end that never seems to actually feel it. It's a circle of parties drugs sex wild nights fights and risky business in a city whose corners seems to invite all of those at any given moment.But what's wrong with Savage Nights? It's lack of focus in the disease's progress. The character forgets about his problems and still lives his life but in terms of reality the disease becomes overlooked when it shouldn't. But forget that. What about his message to audiences? I'm positively sure that Collard was simply telling his own story without endorsing or condemning his actions  though anyone else can get easily confused with everything presented there. Let people figure out for themselves. That's what happened but it wasn't very helpful since many critics reacted badly with the movie others praised it and the man hasn't lived enough to expose his thoughts dying a few days earlier of the rain of awards at the Cesar. The enigma stays on with this film testament who was he and how to describe him and his acts? Rebellious honest sickening hateful fearless? Hero or villain? Choose yours. 810".

	schema:headline " A lukewarm French film about an HIV man and his torment.";
	schema:reviewBody "Savage Nights is a character driven film about an HIV bisexual man and his love affairs particularly with the female lead. As is often the case with Europics especially French films this movie is not so much a story as it is a study of behavior. In this case the behavior is of interest because the male lead who really was HIV and died from AIDS at age 35 continues to lead a life of promiscuity in spite of his affliction wrestling with his awareness of his disease his inability to reconcile himself to his fate and the temptations represented by his love interest and sexual partners.

	onyx:emotionText "Savage Nights is a character driven film about an HIV bisexual man and his love affairs particularly with the female lead. As is often the case with Europics especially French films this movie is not so much a story as it is a study of behavior. In this case the behavior is of interest because the male lead who really was HIV and died from AIDS at age 35 continues to lead a life of promiscuity in spite of his affliction wrestling with his awareness of his disease his inability to reconcile himself to his fate and the temptations represented by his love interest and sexual partners. Unfortunately Savage Nights is a journeyman film at best which grows tedious quickly as it gets wound up in its own confused emotions. However it does have a sort of intriguing honesty about it and rejects the pity which is so often a part of films about people with HIV.";

	schema:reviewBody "Many films are described as true life dramas. but this is the one if ever there was one. The central character Jean Cyril Collard a hedonistic young film producer who engages in sex with both men and women mirrors the real life story of Cyril Collard who was suffering from the AIDS virus during the making of this film and succumbed to it when the film was finished.  This is a great shame because obviously Cyril Collard has lots of talent both as actor and producer and had he lived we could have enjoyed a whole lot of top quality films. This film starts on a quiet note but gathers strength after Jean reveals he is suffering from AIDS.  His girl friend Laura is shocked at the revelation as they had been engaged in unprotected sex.  Wild scenes of erratic and uncontrolled behaviour indicate the frustrations of the couple.  His outburst I don't want to die! is a high point and her constant appeal to him to give up his male contacts bears little fruit. Help me to leave you! is her pathetic cry. Cyril Collard has a great charm and infectious smile which he uses to advantage in his characterisation of Jean.  It is a powerful drama with a constant feeling of desperation as we the viewers anticipate the fatal outcome.  Not a film to cheer you up after a hard day but it has a frightening authenticity about it which compels you to watch it to the end.  The film clearly makes the point that we have a responsibility re the health of others beyond our own self satisfaction.".

Where some cinema pontificates and emotionally rapes the audience this film priviliges the viewer.   We see nonhegemonic cinematic bravery and an engagement with freedom and how that leaves one raw and damaged.  Yet each day alive is a gift.

	schema:reviewBody "The movie is a classical tragedy. The star writer director Cyril Collard has Aids and knows he is dying when making the film. He storms and rages against the forces of negativity and affirms life in ways that seem obscene to many but really focus on the basics of life love and the willingness to actually live your life even knowing that you are about to die. To quote Dylan Thomas He rages against the dying of the night. This is not a gloomy film except for the immense talent that Collard has in a number of areas not the least writing and directing. The tragedy is that his libertine life of reckless homosexuality killed him and many others. Unlike Philadelphia an artifice of politically correct maudlin nonsense this film has Aids sometimes right in your face and sometimes in the background but it is always there. Hedonism killed many and still does in the Aids epidemic and in the U.S.A. this film would attract few positive reviews and almost no distribution because Collard refuses to play the victim game. Over 80 of Aids deaths have been caused by homosexual behavior. In the film Collard can't control his impulses and because of Aids he wants to squeeze as much out of life as he can. The love story with Laura beautifully played by Romane Bohringer is tragic in and of itself but their love is fatally compromised by his disease. Collard desperately wanted to live his life with Aids and not have Aids run his life. Unfortunately that is impossible although he gives it a mighty effort to free himself from thoughts of death which never really leave him. He continues to have grimy homosexual encounters supposedly not involving dangerous sex at least in the film my surmise is that in real life he lived dangerously right up to the end. When he has sex with Laura the first time he doesn't use a condom and doesn't tell her he has Aidsa classic kind of denial an attempt to conquer the disease through action  which is selfish. Many homosexuals will see this film which other scenes do not really show them in a positive light as a film to suppress. Reckless behavior has volcanoed in the last few years but gets no publicity because of the leftwing press who refuses to see Aids victims as anything but victims who didn't really cause their disease. Collard's film slaps the faces of hypocrisy and lying about Aids again and again in this film. It is a testimony to his will to live and to make a film that doesn't cover up the reality of how Aids is spread and how little impulse control many gays have. Drugs will not stop Aids deaths safe sex and sometimes no sex will. Also and very important Collard wants to show that the heterosexual relationship with a loving woman is the way to live your life but for him his refusal to control his impulses and perhaps his genetic inability to control them though that is difficult to infer keeps him from what would have saved him. Hedonism is not spat on in this movie but its terrible results in many cases are exemplified in the tragic death of such a talented and lovely man.".

What makes this film more tragic is the fact that its main star and directoralso a bisexual 'free spirit' had a somewhat similar end to his life dying from an HIV related illness just one year after the movie was released. i think this adds to the whole feeling of the film  as you watch his respective lovers one male one a teenage girl desperately try to hold his admiration and attention you almost forget that the main character himself is trying to come to terms with his own eventual demise. although a serious subject the carefree attitude of the main man leaves a sense of Hope.".

Almost the whole thing takes place in a high school gymnasium around a long table around which the twelve jurors sit. Every performance is superb including that of the director who plays the foreman and Sergei Garmash as the cab driver juror. The screenplay follows the tortuous deliberations in which every juror has at least one soliloquy. Excellent camerawork and lighting augment the heavy drama.It is more likely in Russia today that twelve whites would end up forming a jury although less so that no women would be serving. Director Nikita Mikhalkov evidently chose to remain faithful that much to the American movie on which his is based Twelve Angry Men. One wonders whether it might have been more interesting with women jurors contributing their anguish to the picture and since this version is simply titled 12 the possibility of including a woman or two as would be realistic in this day and age was presumably open. Also the film is not realistic in the sense that Russia does not have a jury system therefore this situation would not arise in real life. What Mikhalkov was probably trying to do was to create a morality play and this he does magnificently. These criticisms are therefore minor. This is a wonderful piece of work.As the film is starting for those who know Russian one sees the logo of Patriotic Films. This may cause groans among those who know more about Russia. Patriotic Russians today seem reactionary and defensive to many Westerners. But Mikhalkov does not dance around the sensitive race issue at the core of the plot a Chechen boy accused of murdering his stepfather a Russian military officer and facing life in prison. Mikhalkov's main interest really is in truth justice and honesty. The idea of these qualities as components of patriotism actually lies at the core of this story and it is brilliantly executed. By the end if you can suppress cynicism and believe that this many men of conscience could assemble in one place in Russia today you will be moved to tears. This is a major achievement.".

This is a terrific interpretation of the story made famous in the classic 1957 Sidney Lumet version.Director Nikita Mikhalkov who has an Academy Award for his Burnt by the Sun tweaks the story by having a Chechan teenager accused of killing his unclestepfather. The story revolves around the prejudices and preconceived ideas that each of the twelve jurors bring with them into the makeshift deliberation room. Here a school gymnasium provides an interesting backdrop.As with the original the suspense builds slowly as each of the characters' back stories unfold as if we are reading a book ... one at a time. We find ourselves as the viewer passing judgment on each juror just as they pass judgment on the accused.The cast is exceptional and varied which allows the script to work its magic. Whether you are a fan of the original or just enjoy character studies this one is a must see.".

The film is about 12 Russian male jurors who decide the fate of a Chechyen orphan who is accused of killing his stepfather a Russian soldier and officer. Anyway the film is done quite well with a fantastic cast of actors who each take a turn in defending their guilty to not guilty decision on the basis of the boy. Each actor takes a dramatic turn and we learn about their reasoning and rationale for their decision. It's a fascinating portrait and study of the Russian judicial system and an event such as the Chechyen War conflict which I don't know much about except from the film that it's bloody dangerous and unforgiving hell. The boy and the jurors aren't given names but each possess great performances in dramatic film. This Russian film is terrific and was nominated for the Academy Award for foreign language film.

Mikhalkov turns everything on its head in the end very unconvincingly trying to argue that freedom is slavery and negating any civic benefit that the movie could have.

	schema:reviewBody "A loose remake of Sidney Lumett 12 Angry Men 1957 which was made by the words of its creator to honor the 50th anniversary of the beloved classic  12 set in 2007 in a gym of one of the Moscow High Schools where the other 12 angry men are struggling to decide the fate of a Chechen teenager who is charged with the murder of his Russian stepfather the Army Officer the Veteran of Chechen war who had adopted the boy after his mother and father were both killed. All evidences point at the boy and there are the testaments of the eyewitnesses against him.I personally believe that 12 2207 is a bad movie with the huge holes in the plot with the characters that are more of caricatures and clichs than the real 12 angry men representing the different layers of the modern Russian society  and with the good actors giving overheated nonconvincing performances that often sounded false and made me cringe. To top it all Mikhalkov took it upon himself a role of Godlike figure who is above the laws and who knows better than anyone else what is good for the particular case for the law and for the whole country. I am a big fan of earlier Mikhalkov's films. He is a talented filmmaker. He's made more than few films he could be justly proud of. Among them Friend Among Strangers Stranger Among Friends 1974  simply great it was first film Nikita Mikhalkov directed and starred and it was first Russian Artaction movie that takes place during the Civil War of the 19181921. It is fun  clever nicely shot and wonderfully acted by the best actors of the time. Is regarded as one of the best Easterns the western Russian style and is almost as popular and beloved as the masterpiece of the genre White Sun of Desert. There is also Slave of Love 1976 with the incredible performance by the Muse of his earlier films Yelena Solovey as a doomed silent screen star in the shattering world of the Russian Revolution of the 1917 and the following Civil War of 19181921. The final scene of the movie  Olga Voznesenskaya Solovey in the runaway tram is heartbreaking and tragically beautiful. Mikhalkov's adaptations of the Goncharov's Oblomov and Chekhov's Platonov are first rate and proved his taste talent cinematic vision and ability to get the fine performances from all his actors. He was successful in creating smaller chamber compelling pieces with only few main characters like Five Evenings 1979 and Without Witness 1983. He deservingly won the Oscar for Burnt by the Sun 1994 which I see as the tragic sequel to his earlier masterpiece Unfinished Piece for Mechanical Piano. It went down the hill after his Oscar victory. The Barber of Siberia 1998 was nothing more than a glossy post card  From Russia with Love. I think he only made it to be able to play the Russian Emperor Alexander III. And now  12 12 jurors or 11 apostles following who? V belom venchike iz roz vperedi Isus Christos In a white roses nimbus on his head Jesus Christ is walking ahead? Is that the role Nikita Mikhalkov wants to play in the movie and in the reality?".

	schema:reviewBody "In Mikhalkov's preposterously overblown remake of Sydney Lumet's Fifties jury deliberation drama 'Twelve Angry Men' a Chechan teenager Apti Magamaev is on trial for the murder of his adoptive Russian father. To begin with as in the Fifties movie one man initiates a long complicated process of reevaluation by voting not guilty when everyone was prepared to send the boy off to life imprisonment and go quickly on their way. In the original he was Henry Fonda whose air of probity was impeccable. This time he's a successful inventor with a lurid alcoholic past Sergey Makovetsky and he sets no standard of probity. Though reasonable doubt is mentioned one of the jurors has studied at Harvard and has the phrase in his head the dissident vote has no logical or specific basis. He just sort of thinks it was a good idea to vote the other way.Forget what happened in court the meaning of the case the analysis of the evidence presented. '12' focuses on the lives the traumas and prejudices of the participants the turmoils of a nationand finally most peculiarly on what's best for the accused be he innocent or guilty.'12' is elaborate illogical and absurd. In terms of jury deliberation it is absolutely ridiculous. But it puts on a great show.We are somewhere around Moscow. The twelve worn out middleaged men are locked by the bailiff in a school gym. And this is emblematic of the film's style. The men may be locked in but they have a lot of room to play around in. No mere solemn deliberations around a long table for themthough there is a long table and they do intermittently sit at it these heavyset darkly garbed men with a cluster of plastic water bottles in front of them.Never for very long though. In the course of the drama the twelve jurors throw a ball at a basketball net and a hypodermic at a dart board or lift weights or play a piano. They restage the crime in a mockup of two matching apartments. They throw knives and to prove a point one threatens to stab another. They wander around smoke send off alarms throw up rage sob. Mikhalkov is shamelessly prepared to do absolutely anything to keep this from being just a lot of talk. Hence the gym and all its accouterments which include a giant disco reflector ball an auxiliary lighting system moments of total darkness candlelight and spotlights a large decaying heating pipe and a wheelchair. And the corniest possible symbol of confinementa lone sparrow. And a series of independent arias when one juror or another gets up and does a long dramatic monologue about himself.But that isn't enough. In the middle there is a giant explosion and there begin a series of flashbacks to the Chechan war with fires and bombs and a dog running past the camera with a severed hand in its mouth. There are also many images of the accused as a boy cowering among the rubble or as a prisoner dancing around in his cell in a down coat to keep warm.Nonetheless '12's so successfully full of itself that it makes its over two and a half hours go by before you know itdespite a lot of wasted time and sloppy excess. Through the jurors' wild digressive monologues Mikhalkov and his cowriters Vladimir Moiseenko and Alexander NovototskyVlasov almost succeed in redefining what deliberations are about. But ultimately they are simply distracting us from the fact that he's only using the deliberations as a hook on which to hang all his thoughts about Russia's modern journey and the meaning of life.The deliberations therefore aren't about the case. They're about the jurors this figures in Lumet's film too but more quietly. A belligerent bigot cab driver Sergey Garmash calls Chechans savages and assumes the boy is guilty. He attacks the elderly Jewish intellectual Valentin Gaft who's the second to switch his vote to not guilty. He intimidates the Harvard man a TV producer and a caricature Yuri Stoyanov into a fit of nausea and paranoia that leads him to change his vote back to guilty. And later a reenactment awakens such painful contrition over his own violence as a father that he switches late in the game to not guilty himself.A surgeon Sergey Gazarov sympathizes with the boy because of his Caucasian origins. A selfmade man with sympathies for the underdog he rejects the cabbie's bigotry early on. He also does a carnival turn showing off his backhome skill at knifetwirling. The director himself plays the jury foreman who has his own surprise twist toward the end to disrupt things after it seems unanimity has been achieved at last.What are we to make of all this? It must be seen more as an epic operatic riff on the theme of Twelve Angry Men than a contemporary Russian reimagining of its original concept. The concept of the law is remote from ours. In fact there is an epigraph to the effect that though the law is steadfast mercy may take precedence over it. And there is no doubt about the reasonableness amid all that is surreal here of such concepts coming to mind when jurors must deliberate in a murder trial.I lost tract of the reasons why various jurors changed their minds. When one did usually somebody else followed suit. It was to be expected. One forgot to ask why. And in the end '12' violates our essential notions of what a jury trial is about that it has to do with arriving at a fair and accurate decision about a specific case. This can't possibly be called a good movie. But it's too vivid entertaining and rich in ideas to dismiss out of hand. As an artifact of contemporary Russia it is a mine of informationthough all to be taken with a grain of salt.".

Most actors are strong and there is real emotion in the movie. The problem is with the idea behind it.Unfortunately there is no way to review this movie as purely artistic piece since it is based on a very political agenda. The movie can be seen as the world according to Mikhalkov who directed the film and starred in it in a role of wise honest and so on Russian officer. All of the stories told by characters are very impressive much more so than in the original Lumet film but each and every one of them is fake an unreal stereotypical look at the 1990s when the country actually experienced one of its greatest moments. But characters only seem to remember crime. All kinds of crime. The characters who would in real life be much more vocal and reasonable are portrayed as clowns or idiots. There is no place for them at this feast.What makes itanother thousand times worse for me is that Mikhalkov lost the main idea of the original. The reasonable doubt. No. Here we know everything for sure. Of course it is obvious to the Russian officer who killed whom. But the point should have been that it is enough to doubt the evidence not to have evidence against someone else. And obviously the evil killer is the capitalist real estate company.Most Western viewers will not see those inconsistencies within the movie. They will just again be scared of this awful life in those uncivilised countries and this horrible horrible capitalism and those poor Russians. Well thank you. We are actually doing fine. Not all of us are losers we did a great thing in the 90s and we don't need your lazy sympathy. But if you like it so much please please take Mikhalkov away from us.".

I would like to make a few N. Mikhalkov's plot of that same play 12 Angry Men by Reginald Rose which was used to make the 1957's movie is certainly more elaborate and complete. While the Lumet's movie was a considerable advantage in his age it has a number of holes and most of all holes in the storyline.For starters if you disagree 1. in the 1957 classic we do not receive the answer who was the real killer and WHY. This question is not even discussed. Everyone present including the personage so well played by H. Fonda Davis seems to be interested just in getting away ASAP. The only difference between Davis and the others is that the architect Davis wants to get away with his conscience clean. Admirable purpose surely but quite limited.Compare this aspect with Mikhalkov's remake...2. The 1957 version despite all of its advantages gives us no perspective whatsoever. So what really just happened? Some guy apparently a skilled leader just managed to convince 11 other guys using common sense logic and manipulation as necessary. Everyone happily leaves the room and the boy possibly becomes multimillionaire from the sales of the movie 12 Angry Men... Unrealistic scenario at best.3. Although we learn from 1957's about biases and prejudices of everyone and that is the strongest side of the old movie we still do not see the present men as real people with the exception perhaps of the Davis personage and the old man. They do look mostly like automatons to me at least.I can continue in this vein for quite some time. The point is if I were to make a point is that if you want only superfluities of the plot then 1957 version will suffice. If you want to go deeper than mere jurisdiction then you go watch Mikhalkov's remake in Russian if you can H. Zimmerman PhD M.D.".

Despite the obvious language difference the Nikita MikhalkovAlexandr NovotoskyVladimir Moiseyenko screenplay follows the Reginald Rose original  which began life as a Studio One teleplay in 1954  fairly closely in form and outline. Again eleven members of a jury stand ready to convict a young man of firstdegree murder in this case for killing his foster father an officer in the Russian army for money  until that is the lone holdout is able to sow enough doubt in the other jurors' minds to eventually get them to vote his way. And while in the original film the suspect faced racism and xenophobia on account of his being Hispanic the suspect here suffers a similar fate for being Chechnyan.In the central role of the original dissenter Sergei Makovetsky lacks the easily recognizable charm and charisma of Henry Fonda  and while this may make him a bit more believable as an everyman figure it also makes him a less compelling focal point for a drama that takes far too long to play itself out. The extended length results primarily from the inclusion of brief flashbacks to the defendant's past recounting the leadup to the crime and the crime itself as well as from individual speeches that drone on long past the point where any point can still be made. Each of the twelve jurors gets his moment in the spotlight to ham it up and declaim wildly on his theories about the case his hatred of one ethnic group or another in addition to antiChechnya sentiment there's a great deal of antiSemitism floating around the room as well and the deplorable state of life in Russia  till the point where we no longer care about these people or the decision they're being forced to make. Eventually we just want to get out of that place as badly as the men who are trapped inside it. And not all the talk about the Russian soul not all the discussions of national politics or personal spleenventing on the part of the participants can make us care one iota about the drama that's unfolding.The question one must finally ask when watching 12 is why anyone would want to take a work like Twelve Angry Men celebrated for its brevity and dramatic precision and turn it into a lumbering ponderous elephantine bore  replete with endless speechifying and scenerychewing performances. Why indeed!".

	schema:reviewBody "I found this movie to be a theatrical feast but with a couple of nagging annoyances.I want to get the annoying parts off my chest first because chronologically that's how I encountered the movie. It seems to me that Russians have never mastered the art of sound mixing. Whether in old Soviet films or in this modern Russian one there is always something not quite right with the sound.As the film began I found that the background noises were much louder than the speech of the actors. The sounds of doors slamming children yelling workers working and so on were loud and clear but the actors' voices were practically whispers in that maelstrom. I don't know why that is. Could it be only in the foreign subtitled version of the film? I don't see complaints about the sound levels from anyone else but I'm pretty sure it's not just me. I desperately wanted to listen to the Russian dialog but the low audio level of the voices forced me to read the subtitles throughout most of the film. It was a bit like walking with a small stone in my shoe.Not having seen the 12 Angry Men movie on which this current film was based I was forced to accept 12 on its own merits. Thus I experienced this film not as a remake of a previous movie but as a filmed a stage play with phenomenal actors. Perhaps as a result I unequivocally enjoyed this acting extravaganza. There may have been some occasional carpet chewing but overall the performances were astounding. I certainly wish the IMDb list of players had more information about who played which role and had more biographical information about the individual actors. Perhaps someone familiar with Russian films and actors could throw more light on the matter. Much the same criticism of course could apply to IMDb's level of information on foreign films in general.Frankly I didn't take the matter of the guilt or innocence of the accused very seriously. With all the theorizing the jurors were doing and with the serious lack of real information for us in the audience there was absolutely no way to determine real guilt or innocence. If anything the flashback scenes were more confusing than enlightening. So as far as I was concerned it was the jurors particularly the Great Russians among them  who were at the center of the film. Watching their paralysis by analysis was the real treat irrespective of whether they reached the right conclusion in the end. As far as that conclusion is concerned I have no idea what Mikhalkov means by it. His own screen character was obviously implying that he has a unique insight into things intimating that perhaps he had been at one time in the KGB GRU or had been a member of some other allegedly allknowing organization? Frankly this was a bit offputting and seemed to imply that the State and its workers knew things that the average citizen just hadn't a need to know. In any event despite having a relatively modest role for most of the film at the end Mikhalkov came a little too much to the fore for my taste. I'd be very happy to read a Russian reviewer's explanation of Mikhalkov's character.A word or two about the depiction of Chechens. The music dancing and overwhelming maleness of Chechen culture were solidly if briefly presented. One certainly cannot stereotype all Chechen men as being similar to the Chechen fighters depicted in this film but the characterization of those fighters was phenomenal. In this film the Chechens fighters' raw power to intimidate threaten and attack their enemies those was palpable. I'm aware that even Alexander Solzhenitsyn praised the indomitable culture of Chechens in the Gulag. They just never ever yielded to the Soviets.So I rate this film very highly. Perhaps I'm missing the film's more subtle propaganda that some here have mentioned but that's something I can continue to think more about. I highly recommend 12.".

It wasn't the propaganda in 12 that I personally didn't like. Although this film is full of it. It wasn't the story. I think the story had a lot of potential. What irritated me throughout the film is that it was made to imitate the worst Hollywood films in which rapid movements of the camera and the characters are used to make up for the absence of thoughtfulness and good acting. The characters are jumping running roaming around throwing things saying things that are out of place interrupting each other. This is all so unnatural so unrealistic and so Hollywood. This film is made for Americans with a short attention span not for Russians. Russian film tradition is making slow films that focus on good acting and an idea not on rapid camera movements and quickly changing scenes. Cheap Hollywood effects had no place in good Russian movies. I guess Mikhalkov was aiming for American audience and Oscar which he didn't get anyway.".

Mikhalkov is trying to stir his nation's conscience to call its people to act rather than lounge about in cynical resignation. I accept Mikhalkov's purpose but I don't think it justifies characters that are at times painfully flat and symbolism that is frequently as direct as an express train. I'll recommend ''12'' to anyone interested in Russian psychology and society it's certainly worth watching but I won't call it a masterpiece.".

So 12 members of blueribbon jury represent almost all of social classes in Russia. Virtually all of them are successful and rich but the movie goes on narrating that these people got their prosperity via different ways. Each of them tells his dramatic story and someone's opinion changes. We see triumph of justice in Lumet's one and here it's triumph of charity.

	schema:reviewBody "First and foremost the movie is 'almost' a remake loose remake of English classic 12 angry men both dealing with 12 jurors attempting to make a judgment of teenager's fate with the limited information they have. This is the 3rd version of 12 angry men including original that I have seen and liked it equally the other one is Ek Ruka Hua Faisla from India. I used 'almost' earlier because in this Russian version it's the politicswar ChechnyaRussia relations in the backdrop and also the ending is twisted to a certain extent. Now that being said I will only talk about this movie here but do keep in mind that many points will actually apply to original one too both pros and cons. The plot involves 12 jurors attempting to make an important decision on Chechnya teenager charged with the murder of his Russian step father. The jurors are accommodated in school gym which for me was one of the major pros and works so well with the script as the actors got some props like piano soccer ball wheel chair weights and which are all used at one point or other to great success. Also the huge space allows the actors free movement around the gym to reconstruct the crime scene based on floor plans plus one of the best scene in the movie would not have been possible if not for the space. Pros The characters are well defined everyone gets chance to explain their situation and find relevance to the case or why their vote is swinging from guilty to not guilty and so forth. The actors performing their respective characters are very believable. The film moves at a good pace and at times explodes out with some great acting. One of such scene is when a cab driver explains what if scenario to producer sitting on a wheel chair it is as good as it gets and the actors performing this are in top form. The use of wheelchair gym instruments soccer ball and space just makes it even more worth watching. Then there is a scene where doctor starts dancing with the knife is again top quality. There are other scenes too which are equally good and wonderfully played by all the actors. Dialogues are at times really witty esp. when taxi driver talks about his new girlfriend dramatic and emotional at times. Nikita Mikhalkov is at the top of his game direction wise. Then there is a little twist towards the end which makes movie even good. Cons The only con with the movie is the way jurors come to the decision which is solely based on the guess work and their better judgments of character and people. But again it is already made clear to us that the defense lawyer didn't present the case with great enthusiasm so eventually all the jurors reasoning actually makes sense to us even though not supported by actual evidence. But then in the end we know for fact that the boy is indeed innocent and we can finally sigh good work jurors!! You might really enjoy 12 even if either you haven't seen 12 Angry Men or if you did watch English classic and don't fall in comparison trap. I enjoyed and liked both these movies!".

	schema:reviewBody "12 Meter ohne Kopf or 12 Paces without a Head is a German 100minute movie from 2009 so 3 more years and it will have its 10th anniversary. It is one of the more known works by German filmmaker Sven Taddicken who is not only the director here but also one of the writers and so he is probably the one who is most to blame for how weak this turned out overall. When this one came out pirate films were even much more hyped than right now because of the American PotCfranchise starring Johnny Depp. It's perfectly fine to try to jump on the bandwagon and the tone and story here are completely different which is nice too but in terms of quality it stays underwhelming from start to finish. The cast is fine I guess there's a handful names and faces in here that German film fans will immediately recognize.This is apparently the story of Klaus Strtebeker and I write apparently because the focus switches more and more to Gdeke Michels. What is the reason for this? Probably that Michels is played by Schweighfer a crowd magnet in German cinema and Ronald Zehrfeld who plays Strtebeker is a much much better actor than Schweighfer but does not get the material or screen time to really shine in here. It is as usual pretty embarrassing to see Schweighfer try to make an impact with the great dramatic material he is given but he comes oh so short all the time because he has simply no range to make anything work other than forgettably stupid romantic comedies.In his defense you have to say that his character also suffers from bad writing. Inserting a message that one month has passed is simply not enough to make the audience believe or convince them that a main character has completely changed in terms of behavior and attitude from being an unlikable character to being somebody who would give his own life for somebody else he just fought with all his force in a previous scene. The character writing is generally very bland here. This also refers to Zehrfeld and Striesow but also to Pallaske whose character added basically nothing to the story and it was not the actress' fault. They just wanted a female character in here and completely missed the point in how to include her.Another problem with this movie has to do with the fact that it has nothing to do really with the real Michels and Strtebeker or with who they were and what happened to them and using these names seems to me like a desperate attempt to lure audiences to theaters in order to make the film look authentic and relevant. This film lacks in a whole lot of areas and it is a perfect example when people are very ambitious in making a film but just don't have the talent to make their ambition work especially Taddicken and Schweighfer. That's why I have to give it a thumbsdown and I don't think this is nowhere near the best German film has to offer this millennium.".

This also refers to Zehrfeld and Striesow but also to Pallaske whose character added basically nothing to the story and it was not the actress' fault. They just wanted a female character in here and completely missed the point in how to include her.Another problem with this movie has to do with the fact that it has nothing to do really with the real Michels and Strtebeker or with who they were and what happened to them and using these names seems to me like a desperate attempt to lure audiences to theaters in order to make the film look authentic and relevant. This film lacks in a whole lot of areas and it is a perfect example when people are very ambitious in making a film but just don't have the talent to make their ambition work especially Taddicken and Schweighfer. That's why I have to give it a thumbsdown and I don't think this is nowhere near the best German film has to offer this millennium.";

Without the explicit sex of the remake this story is a lot freer to be interesting rather than explicit.  The court case and the mistrust between the lovers is as good as the early desire giving rise to murder.Lana Turner is excellent as the femme fatale she is smouldering and very very desirable.  Garfield is also excellent as the man trapped in her web. The two are the very center of the film and are both superb.  If the film has any weakness then it may be that modern audiences need more than very subtle stuff but that's probably our problem rather than the film's.Overall this is very enjoyable it has a great sense of mood and builds well to the inevitable conclusion.".

	schema:headline " Slightly Softened from Cain's 1930's Novel but Still Holds Its Own as a Noir Classic";
	schema:reviewBody "The original book published in 1934 by James M. Cain author of Double Indemnity was a gritty unsentimental story of a lowclass drifter and bum Frank who is taken in by a German immigrant Nick who owns a roadside caf and his beautiful wife Cora who turns out to be much darker on the inside than the facade of her pure white skin. Cora we learn is dissatisfied with her life married to this older immigrant and the drifter becomes her catalyst to change her situation. The movie adaption of twelve years later is a slightly sentimentalized version of Cain's noir classic. That said the movie still holds its own as a noir tale of betrayal and murder but doesn't quite have the edge of Billy Wilder's adaption of Double Indemnity.Still the movie works very well under its own terms particularly because of the outstanding chemistry between the leads John Garfield and Lana Turner. In fact the star of the show is really Turner who turns in a tourdeforce performance. Turner continually shows us the many faces of her character Cora Smith who is sometimes weak and vulnerable and other times resolute and stubborn even unsympathetic and yet oozing with unrealized sexuality. We gather that Cora is no ordinary woman or at least not the soft sentimental Doris Day type. More like a cross between Eva Peron and Madonna. Sometimes hard and mean and other times sweet and feminine she is the complex epitome of the Cain femme fatale of this era. She remains enigmatic from beginning to end which is I think what Cain would have wanted. Garfield in probably the role of his career is equally superb at first rejecting the murder scheme and then later embracing it. Although lacking the enigmatic complexity of Cora Frank is equally ambiguous and ambivalent to his life choices and Garfield well conveys the multisidedness of Frank.The story concerns a young man looking for work finds a roadside caf up a few hours north of Los Angeles probably up the 101 freeway and becomes the hired help. He is employed by Nick a simple Germanstock olderthanmiddleage man who simply wants to make enough money to be comfortable and occasionally play his little guitar. His wife Cora is about 40 years younger and wants to make something of their caf instead of just eking out a meager living. But fleeing with Nick and beginning from ground zero is not what she wants. She would like to have the caf and make something of it. And when the hired help Frank falls for her she realizes he is the perfect means to get both of them out of their hellish existence.A fine example of 1940's film noir with many of the stylistic considerations such as the camera panning from feettoface when we first meet the woman Cora the many unexpected twists and turns and of course the dark desires of the leads. Every series of scenes leaves you guessing as to what will happen next. A couple of scenes were contrived that were superfluous to the book. Unfortunately the film suffers slightly because of the stringent ethics codes that started to be imposed on films of that time. Probably film noir offerings suffered more than most because of their probing the darker sides of human nature. However Postman still ranks as classic film noir.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Postman Always Rings Twice is simply the best film noir ever done. Lana Turner who got billing above John Garfield in this movie and deservedly so is stunning as Cora the most alluring woman I've ever seen on screen the quintessential femme fatale. John Garfield gives a bravura performance as Frank Chambers the drifter who can't keep his hands off another man's wife. The story is by James M. Cain whose Double Indemnity is another memorable film noir adapted for the screen. Cain's stories are a mix of lust and crime and deceit and doubledealing.But this movie belongs to Lana Turner from the moment we and Frank the drifter first see her to that fateful moment .. and I won't say when that moment arrives .. when Frank's and Cora's dreams and schemes are forever dashed. Frank says several times in the movie I just wanted to look at her..I just wanted to see her..It was horrible to be away from her.. and Frank wasn't the only one who had those feelings. That first time we meet Cora is simply one of the most erotic powerful scenes ever filmed. Frank is sitting at the restaurant counter Cora's husband Nick has gone to see a customer and we see a tube of lipstick rolling on the floor. The camera follows Frank's gaze from the lipstick to the path it took on the floor to its owner and the reason it fell to the floor. The camera stops  as Frank's gaze does  on Cora's shapely legs shown in all their splendor from midthigh to heel because Cora is wearing shorts. We see Cora's face and then Frank's and we can literally see Frank's breath being taken away. Ours too. It doesn't take long before nature takes its course with Frank and Cora but that creates the problem of what to do with Nick? First they simply decide to leave him but that doesn't work because of the three of then Nick is the only one with money. There is a botched murder attempt which Nick recovers from. Nick isn't the brightest bulb in the array since he never realizes that his wife and the drifter he hired just tried to kill him. Some parts of this first attempt are masterfully done and some aren't. Frank and Cora's sexual tension builds along with the fear that they'll be found out for what they tried to do. They succeed in killing Nick on their second attempt but are soon caught. These aren't master criminals you see. Cora and Nick are played against each other by the Prosecutor and we soon see them for their true selves as they turn on one another. Hume Cronyn plays Cora's attorney here in a role evocative of Billy Flynn in Chicago some 55 years later. This defense attorney has it all under control. He manages to razzledazzle the prosecution  and the court and get both Frank and Cora off! Cronyn is so good here he nearly steals the movie!It's not necessary to say more about the story. We know in a film noir universe that evil schemes never succeed. Frank and Cora will never get away with Nick's murder. Even though they are free things soon begin to unravel for them. Their relationship is undermined by all the deceit and legal manuevering of the prosecuting attorney and Cora's lawyer. Neither trusts the other. Things go from bad to worse and ultimately both Frank and Cora pay for killing Nick.This movie is not perfect. There are some plot points that do not hold Nick's stupidity the sudden discovery of the life insurance policy a stupid housecat and others. It is tedious in spots especially the middle.The botched first murder attempt is not essential the legal wrangling takes too long and the tension that builds between Frank and Cora after they are free takes too long to build. Frank has a dalliance with a waitress that either should have been cut or expanded. But for all its faults it is quintessential film noir. Frank and Cora for all their good looks are rotten at their core and that's why we love them. We love the movie because in the end they get what they deserve justice triumphs over hormones and greed. 9 out of 10.A footnote the newly released DVD has a bonus feature on the life of John Garfield. He died in 1952 at the age of 39 a victim of the House Unamerican Activities Committee. Garfield was a prominent target whom the committee sought to discredit and destroy in an attempt to gain credibility with the American people. How very sad that so many lives could be shattered with such implacable malice emanating from Congress itself. Let us pray it never happens again.".

It's an absolute mystery to me how this title made it through intact when great titles like Farewell My Lovely were dumbed down to Murder My Sweet for the sake of Hollywood audiences. James M.

One note for femmefatale buffs Cora and Nick in the film are surnamed Smith which in the book was Cora's maiden name. Nick in the book was Greek  Papadakis Is this a statement on marriage in general or perhaps a desire to eliminate the racial implications in what happens?

	schema:reviewBody "I was not expecting a classic film noir along the lines of Double Indemnity or Out of the Past when I put this movie in and for awhile I thought I might have been wrong.  Maybe the cover was too cheesy I'm not sure but I didn't have extra high hopes for this movie.  Then my mood brightened when it actually started to become very entertaining.  I wasn't being blown away but I did start to enjoy the film noir 101 plot.  The reviewer who noted MGM's dramatic lighting of Turner is right it's ridiculous but it does come with the territory I guess.

Maybe the cover was too cheesy I'm not sure but I didn't have extra high hopes for this movie.  Then my mood brightened when it actually started to become very entertaining.  I wasn't being blown away but I did start to enjoy the film noir 101 plot.  The reviewer who noted MGM's dramatic lighting of Turner is right it's ridiculous but it does come with the territory I guess.

This face paced and thrilling filmnoir from 1946 is certainly a classic... one of my favorite films from class to date. Many elements of film making went into this piece. Great lead role acting particular camera angles and appropriate mood lighting make this film the high quality that is. For example Lana Turner's character Cora is unforgettable her excellent acting skills allowed her to be enticing on screen but not carnal or even just too dramatic. John Garfield's character Frank Chambers is a strong supporting role and I really liked his sense of humor and the way he portrayed his infatuation with Cora I felt the passion between those two after that infamous lip lock. The camera aids her in this smooth sense of seduction as well. Lighting throughout the film also helped to make the mood suspicious in the way of her careless husband Nick yet captivating and sensual Cora's form fitting outfits and intense kissing scene I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and enjoyed it all to myself this time too!".

	schema:reviewBody "As a child in the 1970s I cringed whenever I viewed a television soap opera that my mother insisted on watching. Every soap opera I ever involuntarily watched was shockingly bad.The Postman Always Rings Twice is like a forerunner for those horrible soap operas. The innumerable plot turns are often unbelievably absurd the dialogue is very shallow the characters are stupid and everything is melodramatic. The fact that the Lana Turner character is one of the hottest movie characters I've ever seen can't save Postman.The first half of this 1946 movie deserves a 5 or a 6. I often love movies that focus on a few characters but I just wasn't interested in this film's three main characters. Turner's marriage to an unattractive smalltime restaurant owner old enough to be her Dad is not credible. It certainly wasn't Cecil Kellaway's brains that appealed to her because he is oblivious to an affair that occurs right under his nose. Turner and John Garfield's behavior around Kellaway is abnormal.More importantly the affair between Garfield and Turner  which begins when he attacks her  is uninteresting. They say nothing to each other about their hopes and dreams nothing in depth about their love for each other nothing intelligent and nothing that reveals who they are. I know virtually nothing about their backgrounds and there is little character development.Despite the flaws the plot is interesting enough that I can understand why people like the first half of Postman. The second half of Postman however just flabbergasted me. The stupid plot turns include The district attorney who prosecuted Turner for killing Kellaway was the closest thing to a WITNESS to the murder because he was the FIRST one who saw the crashed car. After witnessing and prosecuting the murder the D.A. decides to let Turner off on a prisonfree manslaughter charge after a 30second conversation with the defense attorney. Several minutes earlier the defense attorney ignored Turner's objections and entered guilty pleas for murdering Kellaway and trying to murder Garfield. Shortly before the two guilty pleas the D.A. and defense attorney bet on whether Turner will be found guilty of murder  in front of the other suspect. After the guilty pleas Turner and Garfield are placed in the same room in a courthouse and are allowed to move freely although she has just plead guilty to trying to kill him and he has signed a complaint saying he witnessed her murdering Kellaway. In the room Turner implicates Garfield in the Kellaway murder in a confession that is made right in front of him  and typed by someone impersonating an officer of the court. After trying to put each other in jail for life Garfield and Turner decided to live with each other. The community is so unbothered that a convicted killer is serving no jail time that it flocks to her restaurant to solicit her autograph but it is outraged that two unmarried people live together. Thus Garfield and Turner marry. The impersonator tries to extort Garfield and Turner for the paper with the confession he typed although they certainly knew he could have made copies of the paper. The police suspected Garfield and Turner of an earlier attempt on Kellaway's life but they stopped probing because he recovered. Essentially they negligently allowed Kellaway to be murdered.There are other plot twists. They occur approximately every 30 seconds. I kept getting the impression that the writers were aware a plot twist was illogical so they wrote another one to try to explain the previous one. With each plot twist they dug themselves into a deeper hole.This movie is so stupid that I'm probably being generous in giving it a 3.ZWrite".

The story starts out to be relatively simple allowing the cast and the atmosphere to carry it and then heads through a series of twists and turns picking up the pace as it goes along.John Garfield and the supporting cast are solid but it is Turner who really stands out and grabs the attention anytime she is onscreen. It's nothing against Garfield to say that in comparison he is almost just along for the ride yet he does a creditable job and makes his character believable.

There may be a couple of tooconvenient plot developments but otherwise it is wellwritten.This classic version is quite a bit better than the early 1980s remake which required little imagination to make or to watch. Turner's character and performance in particular aided by good camera work demonstrate that the suggestive can be quite a bit more effective and memorable than the explicit.The Postman Always Rings Twice has just about everything you could ask for in a filmnoir.

	schema:reviewBody "I think it is totally unnecessary polemics about the moral character of this film. POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE is tremendously tense and dramatic film helped with great atmosphere and very good acting. Motives of adultery and crimes of passion are certainly the most thematically processed but do not compromise the spirit of the novel on which the movie is based.In fact nothing could be more sensational besides the beautiful legs. A passionate story of an emotionally torn characters. Love passion murder and sentences. I am delighted with the atmosphere that prevails in and around the small diner. Everything important happens at night of course is no accident.The tension and passion grow in intervals. The climax is the murder. The violence in the film occurs suddenly and rapidly. John Garfield as Frank Chambers is a raw young rogue who wanders aimlessly and eventually falls into the trap. Garfield maintains a rhythm from start to finish.

	onyx:emotionText "I think it is totally unnecessary polemics about the moral character of this film. POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE is tremendously tense and dramatic film helped with great atmosphere and very good acting. Motives of adultery and crimes of passion are certainly the most thematically processed but do not compromise the spirit of the novel on which the movie is based.In fact nothing could be more sensational besides the beautiful legs. A passionate story of an emotionally torn characters. Love passion murder and sentences. I am delighted with the atmosphere that prevails in and around the small diner. Everything important happens at night of course is no accident.The tension and passion grow in intervals. The climax is the murder. The violence in the film occurs suddenly and rapidly. John Garfield as Frank Chambers is a raw young rogue who wanders aimlessly and eventually falls into the trap. Garfield maintains a rhythm from start to finish. I think how he is naive character actually know that he is in love and vice versa.Lana Turner as Cora Smith It is quite good as frustrated beautiful woman who wants out of life to do something. Crime is not entirely her choice. She was more scared and hurt than determined. She was an ordinary woman trapped in a passion. No way femme fatale.It is obvious that crime does not pay.

Though at this point in time Cain certainly was at the high point of his career. Imagine having back to back film successes with Double Indemnity Mildred Pierce and The Postman Always Rings Twice.But what a view of women these films portray. The comparison with Double Indemnity and Postman is really almost too obvious. A weak and opportunistic man and a tramp of a wife drift into an affair and then they decide to kill the husband. And neither of them can live with the terrible secret of it all. They've even got the same kind of dogged gumshoe after them for Lana Turner and John Garfield it's District Attorney Leon Ames and Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray have Edward G. Robinson.With Pierce though it's a little more difficult but think of Ann Blyth's character as a TurnerStanwyck in training. No doubt had she not done her foul deed early on in life she would have grown up to be the same kind of ice dame as these other two. Lana Turner on a loan out from MGM plays for the first time a really bad girl later on she would play more. Usually up to this time she played wholesome beauties kind of at variance with her private life. Maybe that's where the real acting came in for her. But you'd do just about anything to possess this one even murder.John Garfield was two films away from ending his long term Warner Brothers contract and certainly they gave him a good role to go out on. Originally the part was offered to Bogart but it wouldn't have been good for the older Bogey who most would have seen as too street smart and not so hormone driven as Garfield.Hume Cronyn has a neat role as a sleazy but very effective defense attorney. One of the best roles of his early career.The Postman Always Rings Twice is one great and sordid tale of murder and betrayal. Even operating within the Code it still conveys a really twisted view of humanity.Courtesy of James M. Cain who probably didn't think too much of women in his view of the world.".

But later we're introduced to confusing legalities compounded by contrived twists. And the ending contradicts the darker tone of earlier sequences.Much of the plot is a tangled web of this and that held together entirely by the three lead characters. It's like the writers sorted through dozens of script drafts couldn't decide then in frustration hurriedly wrote a final draft that was a compromise of the previous versions.John Garfield is well cast and does a fine job. But someone other than Kellaway would have been better in the role of Nick. Much much worse than the casting of Kellaway however was the casting of glamorous Lana Turner as Cora. Turner with her blonde hair and glossy facade is not at all convincing either as Nick's wife or as a young spidery beauty stuck in a twobit hamburger joint. Further her acting is awful. She doesn't act so much as she ... poses for the camera in a bid to show off her glamour for future starring roles. Her presence seriously detracts from the story.I think Audrey Totter who plays a minor role would have been fine as Cora. So too would have been Ida Lupino. Indeed almost anyone would have been better than Turner even Broderick Crawford in a wig.Critics regard this film highly. I'm not sure why.

Garfield and Turner have an attraction for each other that reaches a dangerous level and we follow the consequences of their actions...The cast are all good  my favourite is Hume Cronyn who plays Arthur Keats a very cunning lawyer and he steals the show in every scene that he is in. Lana Turner is also a very cool customer and one of her best moments occurs after she has just been kissed by Garfield for the first time. Instead of the customary slap in the face that we are all expecting she just reapplies her makeup and walks past him. How cool is she?As for the story you need to suspend belief on a few occasions. First of all it is just completely impossible to believe the marriage between fat old Kellaway and young attractive Turner. Even less difficult to take in is the willingness on Kellaway's part to encourage the much younger betterlooking and better suited lover for Turner to spend as much time possible as he can with her. WHAT!!? This Kellaway character is INCREDIBLY stupid. Another corker of an idea is to have Garfield and Turner plan to kill Kellaway by throwing some marbles under him so that he will slip and kill himself. This is getting pretty stupid now isn't it?There are some memorable scenes but the ending is rather too convenient and the final scene has some rather forced dialogue to try and justify the film's title.

	schema:reviewBody "Terry Gilliam's fantastic twisted story of a virus destroying all but a handful of people across the Earth and forcing them to move underground and the man sent back in time to gather information about it is a fantastic dizzying and highly stylized film that boasts Bruce Willis' best performance ever.What sets 12 Monkeys apart from most timetravel scifi movies is that Bruce Willis character actually deals with what the psychological effects of timetravel that is not knowing what reality is actual reality the place that the timetraveler comes from or goes to.  Also the film recognizes that things that have past cannot be altered and that the prevention of a cataclysmic event in this case the release of said virus cannot be stopped or changed.  As Willis asserts It's already happened while he's in a mental hospital the major dilemma the film trudges into is not a trite overdone plot to save the world instead it's Willis' inner struggle to simply survive himself.  It's a fresh innovative concept and it works beautifully thanks to a tautly written script by Peoples and Gilliam's unique brand of dementia.Besides this 12 Monkey's storytelling is totally nonlinear and instead opts to distort and bend the way the story is told skillfully incorporating a bevy of different time sequences flashbacks dreams memories the present the past the future and even a scene that is lifted out of Hitchcock's Vertigo.  All serve to envelop the viewer into its disturbing cacophony of madness and futility.Visually Gilliam is a master of desolate umbrage and shadow rivalling Tim Burton in his strikingly despondent scenery and imagery.  With cold wide and immersing cinematography Gilliam plunges into the colorless surroundings and darkness of his characters.  The scenes are often bathed in a strangely antiseptic dead white and help serve as a contrast to the often veeringonmadness characters.Performancewise Brad Pitt steals most scenes filling them with a patented loony offthewall performance that deservedly garnered him an Oscar nomination.  As mentioned Bruce Willis gives the best performance of his career not reverting to his heroic cliches and cardboard hero and instead portraying Cole as a simple poignant tragic everyman.   Equally good is Madeline Stowe as Willis' psychologist.  She holds her own injecting her character with both wild energy and strength as she collapses under the weight of what she comes to believe is a false 'religion.'Gilliam's expert overwhelming and complex handling of what could have been a routine actionscifi film makes 12 Monkeys a compelling vision of a nightmarish futuristic landscape.  Its rich wellthought out intricate storyline along with bravura performances from the entire cast and its brooding bleak cinematography make it a masterpiece of madness.

	schema:reviewBody "In the future humans exist underground the surface having become uninhabitable due to the release of a virus years before in 1996. The ruling classes are scientists and large sections of the population are held as prisoners in tiny cells prisoners who volunteer to help work out what happened back in 1996 that killed off 99 of the population. Requiring information about the visit James Cole is sent back to 1996 to gather what information he can. However sent to 1990 by accident Cole finds himself in a mental hospital where he meets From the very start this film marks itself out as being very much a Terry Gilliam product and those who hate his work will probably dislike this film for the same reason. However pleasing people like that is not my concern and 12 Monkeys is actually one of Gilliam's most accessible films as it sets his imaginative style within a narrative that is satisfyingly complex and thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish. The story is not perfect though the connection to the start is nice but the ultimate twist behind the virus just seems to have been thrown in to keep the film tidy a minor complaint though because even then the main thrust of the story Cole keeps it together. The twisting plot plays with both Cole's and our sense of reality and it is genuinely gripping from start to finish Gilliam's direction is superb whether it be the realistic world of the 1990's filmed with clever angles and shots or the wonderfully twisted world of the future it is all excellent and was such a pleasant find in my local cinema at the time.The film benefits from great turns from the cast. Willis was having a bit of a career resurrection in the mid90's when several films showed us that he could actually act  for me 12 Monkeys was one of them. Willis is superb as he spins from madness to sanity and back again he underplays all the way and is so much better than the wisecracking everyman that he is better known for. Pitt is just as good but in a different way. Getting an Oscar nomination that he deserved Pitt risks overdoing it but pushes his crazy performance as far as he can without being indulgent  I'm not saying he is perfect but I would could this as one of his best performances to date. Stowe is very much in the shadow of these two but she holds her own well. Morse Seda Meloni and Plummer are all good in minor roles but really the film belongs to the lead three  Willis in particular and Pitt in a great supporting role.Overall this is a great scifi the story is great and is only helped by Gilliam's imaginative direction and awareness of the fantastic. Meanwhile the cast are very strong with the famous leads giving some of their best performances to date. Downbeat imaginative engaging and one of the more accessible of Gilliam's films it stands out as one of the best American scifi's of the past few decades.".

Some good and some bad but it was one of those films you had to pay attention to every second so I was a bit worried. Just because I felt like for a minute if this was going to be one of those films that I had to watch several times to get. But I watched it last night and I was really impressed this movie had everything in it action drama scifi history dark humor and even a little romance. The actors all did a terrific job I give a lot of credit to Bruce during his scene in the car with his psychiatrist he really got to me. But Brad Pitt I'm just amazed with how much of a great job he did. He didn't over do his character who was crazy and just made it work and was extremely believable. The story was just scary but very good and a wake up call.James Cole is a man in the future where a virus broke out in the past and killed 5 billion people and only 1 of the population survived including him. Animals are now ruling the ground above while the humans are down below but scientists send James to the past of 1990really meaning to send him to '96 to find out about information of the virus. James gets put into a mental institution meeting his new psychiatrist Dr. Kathryn Raily and another mental patient Jeffrey Goines. He tells them the future of course no one believes him he goes back to the future. But the scientists send him back to the correct year to where the doctor is kidnapped by James but he tells her more and believes him. Now they are set on trying to prevent the virus from ever happening.12 Monkeys was an incredible film. Like I said the story was so scary just because it's not at all hard to believe that we are not far from that happening. But the whole movie was just great the cast the sets just the whole picture was a great one. It had a Terminator type of feel to it where we might loose something precious one day ourselves if we don't listen to others. What is right and what is wrong? Who knows? But I would highly recommend 12 Monkeys it's a great movie that if you give it the proper chance I'm sure you'll enjoy it.910".

Cole could be any person. We don't know anything about him but in a way that doesn't matter since he is little more than one of many expendable volunteers and hints of his character sneak in later as he gets closer to fulfilling his mission. What we do know is that he is a man who dreams and his dreams may have been reality he may have already been at the scene of the Event of 1996.It's this constant sense of deja vu that keeps popping up throughout the movie. When taken to a mental ward by mistake in 1990 he meets Jeffrey Goines spastically played by Brad Pitt Oscarnominated here who frantically spews forth talk about doom and destruction and later Cole believes he has seen Goines in his recurring dream as a man pushing a boy aside while escaping... what? He doesn't know. Later he meets a psychologist Kathryn Railly Madeleine Stowe and one of her first reactions to him is that he's insane and that she's seen him before. This becomes a running notion throughout her participation in this story from passiveresistant to active and even slightly crazy believer that Something Terrible is coming This Way especially when she meets him six years later she has seen Cole before. At the same time Cole continues talking about a dream he keeps having in which she also plays a part as a blonde woman running down the aisle screaming for help after shots have rung out and a particular redheaded man in a ponytail Jeffrey Goines? has apparently escaped not before pushing the little boy who is an innocent bystander. The questions arise have these events happened? Are they going to happen? Who is really a part of this or better yet  is everyone down to the smallest player a part of a Greater Plot? Or is this all some trick in the fabric of time in which Time in itself is one huge conveyor belt showing repetitions of fragments of events that slide by over and over again? These questions are formulated in a masterful sequence which includes key scenes of Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece VERTIGO in which Madeleine ElsterJudy Barton mourns her own brief existence You took no notice she says as Cole and Railly watch from their seats in the movie theatre they are hiding in. Snippets of dialog from VERTIGO form a foil to the dialog between Railly and Cole and later when Cole awakens from having apparently dozed off in the theatre and goes looking for Railly he comes facetoface with her in disguise looking almost exactly like Eva Maria Saint from NORTH BY NORTHWEST as the swelling Bernard Herrmann score plays the emergence of Judy Barton dressed as Madeleine Elster. It's a fascinating sequence more so because of the most improbable occurrence of the names of the actors in both films Madeleine Stowe plays Kathryn Railly who dons a blond wig and grey trenchcoat and calls herself Judy Simmons while helping an insane man named James Cole James Stewart plays a detective who tries to help insane Madeleine Elster who will later reappear not once but twice first as brunette Judy Barton and later as Madeleine.

Light sabers UFO's aliens time traveling... most of the time it's nothing for me. However there is one movie in the genre that I'll always give a place in my list of top movies and that's this Twelve Monkeys I remember to be completely blown away by it the first time but even now after having it seen several times already I'm still one of its biggest fans. Every time I see it this movie seems to get better and better.Somewhere in the distant future all people live underground because an unknown and lethal virus wiped out five billion people in 1996 leaving only 1 percent of the population alive. James Cole is one of them. He's a prisoner who lives in a small cage and who is chosen as a 'volunteer' to be sent back to in time to gather information about the origin of the epidemic. They believe it was spread by a mysterious group called 'The Twelve Monkeys' and need the virus before it mutated so that scientists can study it. But their time traveling machine doesn't work perfectly yet and he is accidentally sent to 1990 where he meets Dr. Kathryn Railly a psychiatrist and Jeffrey Goines the insane son of a famous scientist and virus expert...What I like so much about this movie is the fact that it is never clear whether all what you are seeing is real or not. Is this just an illusion created in the mind of a mentally ill man or is it real? Does he really come from the future and can he really travel through time? Was the population really wiped out by a virus released by the army of The Twelve Monkeys? Those are all questions that will leave you wondering from the beginning until the end. If the makers of this movie had chosen to make it all more obvious I'm sure that I would never have liked it as much as I did now. It's just that mysteriousness that keeps me interested time after time. But that's not the only good thing about this movie of course. The acting is amazing too. Normally I'm not too much a fan of Bruce Willis but what he did in this movie was just astonishing. Together with Madeleine Stowe and Brad Pitt he should have won several awards for it because together with the amazing story they made this movie work so incredibly well.Even after several viewings I'm still a huge fan of this movie. Except for this movie I have only seen one other Terry Gilliam movie and that's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas which wasn't bad but didn't really convince me either. However it's this movie that really makes me look forward to his other work. I give it a 910 maybe even a 9.510.".

In his travels he discovers mysterious graffiti announcing the arrival of the Army of the Twelve Monkeys.Terry Gilliam has always been an interesting film director and visual stylist even when some of his movies are uneven. With 12 Monkeys he perhaps produces his most wholly satisfying work. It's a consistently compelling mystery within the framework of a timetravelling scifi narrative. It's a fairly complex story so attention is demanded of the viewer. This is perhaps the chief strength of the film however as the labyrinthine narrative is one that benefits from multiple viewings. There are still some elements of ambiguity even at the end so it's a film that actively encourages discussion.There's a good cast too. Bruce Willis was on a bit of a run in the mid 90's and this is one of the great films he appeared in at the height of his powers. On the other hand it's one of the first films where Brad Pitt was allowed to display his acting chops and show that he was a lot more than just a pretty face. While in visual terms it's as interesting as you would expect from a Gilliam movie although not as phantasmagorical as some of his more personal fantasy features. In 12 Monkeys he was a director for hire but it's not immediately obvious. Perhaps the distance this gave him actually helped instill some discipline that made the whole more cohesive on the whole. Whatever the case this is an excellent scifi film with a compelling central mystery.".

At the time the only words that escaped my mouth were Awesome. Just awesome. I like to think I can articulate myself a little better than that but at the time I was somewhat incapable of doing so.The story is intriguing and thought provoking and the acting is first rate from all the principals. This film was the first one that Terry Gilliam directed that he didn't have a hand in the writing credit for. Back with Universal after his long arduous battle with them over Brazil Terry had achieved what he wanted most the final cut. Terry is a master craftsman and each shot is like a beautifully conceived painting that has been constructed carefully with determination and conviction. It is only justice that such an individual should be unfettered in his attempts to convey a concept. Unfortunately limitations still exist in such arrangements.The Universal Collector's Edition DVD of this film is simply amazing although most of the bonus features aren't listed on the box. It contains among other things a directorproducer audio commentary and an informative and extremely interesting 90 minute documentary on the making of the film called The Hamster Factor and Other Tales of 12 Monkeys. It tells of some of the creative pitfalls in filmmaking including a test of mettle when preview screenings tested poorly striking the team with feelings of selfdoubt and despair. Fortunately for all of us they decided to change very little about the film and released it to an enormous success.".

Gilliam allegedly produced a long list think about the aircraft one from the Fifth Element and handed it to Butch Bruce. It was entitled Things Bruce Willis Does When He Acts. It ended with a simple message saying please don't do any of the above in my movie.There is a fact about this movie definitely true. Gilliam didn't have a hand in the writing.I would contend that these two factors played a huge role in creating the extraordinary if not commercial success that is The Twelve Monkeys.Visually the Twelve Monkeys is all that we have rightly come to expect from a Gilliam film. It is also full of Gilliamesque surrealism and general but magnificent strangeness. Gilliam delights in wrongfooting his audience. Although the ending of the Twelve Monkeys will surprise no one who has sat through the first real Gilliam borrows heavily from Kafka in the clockwork bureaucratic relentless movement of the characters towards their fate. It is this journey and the character developments they undergo which unsettles.I love Gilliam films Brazil in particular. But they do all tend to suffer from the same weakness. He seems to have so many ideas and so much enthusiasm that his films almost invariably end up as a tangled mess Brazil in particular. I still maintain that Brazil is Gilliam's tour de force but there's no denying that The Twelve Monkey's is a breath of fresh air in the tightplotting department. Style substance and form seem to merge in a way not usually seen from the exPython.Whatever the truth of the rumour above Gilliam also manages to get a first rate and very atypical performance out of the bald one. Bruce is excellent in this film as are all the cast particularly a suitably bonkers  and very scary  Brad Pitt.It's been over a decade since this film was released. When I watched it again I realised that it hadn't really aged. I had changed of course. And this made me look at the film with fresh eyes.

Half his output leaves me cold the other half dazzle me beyond belief. 'Brazil' is his movie that I would rate the highest but I've come to think that I have unfairly underrated 'Twelve Monkeys'. I have always enjoyed it but I've only come to realize just how good a movie it really is. Sometimes I think it is even better than 'Brazil'. It's a close pick. Unlike 'Brazil' Gilliam didn't come up with the script. He basically was initially involved as a director for hire. Thankfully the script itself by David and Janet Peoples is first rate. On top of that Gilliam manages to stamp his own style and approach on to the material without sliding into complete selfindulgence as he sometimes does. The budget of this movie wasn't anywhere near as large as you would imagine from the impressive results on screen. It looks superb. Gilliam coaxes  first rate performances out of Bruce Willis quite a surprise and Brad Pitt not such a surprise see also 'Johnny Suede' and 'Kalifornia'. Madeline Stowe is also very good as is Christopher Plummer and in a small but important role David Morse. It's difficult to fault this movie. It is a joy to watch and improves with each viewing. I also highly recommend Chris Marker's 'La Jetee' the short experimental film which inspired 'Twelve Monkeys'. It is also brilliant.".

A virus killed a lot of people back in 1997 and a guy named Cole Bruce Willis is send back to 1990 and 1996 to find a cure for the virus. In 1990 he is arrested and put in a mental hospital. There he meets Jeffrey Goines Brad Pitt who probably has something to do with the virus. He also meets psychiatrist Dr. Kathryn Railly Madeleine Stowe who doesn't believe him in 1990. When Cole disappears from the mental hospital while he is chained and locked in a room and reappears in 1996 Kathryn starts believing Cole's stories.The movie constantly plays with time. Cole makes a phone call and leaves a message in 1996 it is picked up in the future and they send someone. For Cole that someone appears only seconds after the phone call. Things like this happen throughout the movie and therefore you must keep attention. You could ask some questions but since you can't have an answer yourself it is better to agree with the movie.'Twelve Monkeys' works as scifi with some great images and a dark atmosphere and it works as a thriller. You are never certain of what will happen next and that helps the movie. May be it has some flaws in the story but since it is about a fictional thing like time traveling you should accept what the movie tells us and just try to enjoy. That was the easy part for me.".

	schema:headline " Intelligent  Creative Science Fiction Movie Gilliam's Best Yet!";
	schema:reviewBody "Terry Gilliam's and David Peoples' teamed up to create one of the most intelligent and creative science fiction movies of the '90's. People's proved a screenplay with bizarre twists and fantastic ideas about the nature of time  I especially love the idea one can't change the past it's a nice counterpoint to so many timetravelling movies which say otherwise  biological holocausts and the thin line between sanity and madness. Gilliam visualized his ideas with unique quirkiness perfection and originality.The story itself is engaging one man James Cole played by Bruce Willis in a heartwarming performance travels several decades to the past to retrieve information about a virus that's wiped out mankind and left only a few survivors alive living underground with the information he'll collect scientists hope to find a cure so everyone in the future can return to the surface. But because their timetravelling technology isn't perfect he ends up being sent towards different other pasts and complicating things. And from that a brilliant science fiction thriller with shades of film noir ensues as the multiple pieces of a huge jigsaw start fitting together to form a bizarre narrative involving animal right activists end of the millennium paranoia biological weapons the perception of reality and the definition of sanity. With such a complex movie it was easy for Gilliam and Peoples to create a mess but instead Twelve Monkeys is a thoughtprovoking narrative which will please those who like to be challenged and have patience to appreciate some crazy ideas.I watched this movie once around 10 years ago. It marked me a lot I remember still thinking about many days afterwards for my young mind this seemed quite mindblowing and it was one of the first movies to make me appreciate cinema as something serious and important. I've rewatched this movie a few days ago on DVD and it's better than I remembered it. Brad Pitt still steals all the scenes he's in playing Jeffrey Goines  almost a prelude to his Tyler Durden character in Fight Club  a rich kid with some anarchistnonconformist ideas who's also crazy and according to Cole perhaps responsible for the virus. The scenes between Jeffrey and Cole in the madhouse are the best in the movie Pitt's eyes voice and quirky mannerisms convince you he's really a crazy guy locked in a warped logic only he understands. Pitt's Oscar nomination was well deserved! Surprising was also Bruce Willis' performance his I didn't remember very well but it's beautiful and full of sensibility he plays a man who spent almost all his life underground and when he comes to the past you'll share his childish fascination with something as simple as breathing the fresh air of the morning or watching the sun go up. Cole is a rather ambiguous character Peoples' tried to imbue some darkness in him and he does other disturbing things to other people and to himself the scene where he removes his own teeth reveals how far his dementia has gone unchecked. Ironically Cole didn't start as a crazy character but when he starts warning everyone about the end of the world he's considered mad and convinced it's all in his mind until he arrives at a point when he can't distinguish past from future reality from fiction. Willis spends a lot of time looking confused and insecure and it works perfectly. One of the fun twists in the narrative is when Cole's shrink Dr. Kathryn Railly finds undeniable proof he's really from the future and now has to convince him again of his mission to save the world. The screenplay is full with weird twists like this and it keeps the movie in a fast pace. Their relationship is also wellhanded although perhaps a bit compressed for time's sake. But I enjoyed watching Cole and Railly falling in love and trying to escape the authority of the future to live a peaceful life in the past. But then things end in a tragicbittersweet climax at an airport wrapping all the pieces together which will blow many minds away.There are two great endings in this movie a twist in the sense of Se7en or Fight Club and a more intimate ending where Railly is crouching next to Cole who's just been shot and looking around for a younger James Cole who's witnessing his future self die the two share a brief look and she smiles at him. The twist is brilliant but I prefer this ending for emotional impact. Madeleine Stowe is very good playing Dr. Railly she drew many different emotions from me in her performance. The movie is filled with a sense of fatalism with the idea the past can't be changed this movie shows that in a terrifying way. It reminds me of Chinatown in that sense the way Jake Gittes messes everything up the more he tries to help. Railly's character shares that fatalism the more she tries to help Cole  first dealing with his 'madness' then helping him in his mission  the more they're sucked into tragedy.The twist ends with a hopeful note though with the feeling Cole's mission hasn't been in vain. Twelve Monkeys is a great movie to watch if one wants to be entertained it's not supposed to be art although it's more artists than many artistic movies. It's an unpretentious movie where all elements from music to editing to costume design etc. came together beautifully to produce a modern cinema masterpiece.".

	onyx:emotionText "Terry Gilliam's and David Peoples' teamed up to create one of the most intelligent and creative science fiction movies of the '90's. People's proved a screenplay with bizarre twists and fantastic ideas about the nature of time  I especially love the idea one can't change the past it's a nice counterpoint to so many timetravelling movies which say otherwise  biological holocausts and the thin line between sanity and madness. Gilliam visualized his ideas with unique quirkiness perfection and originality.The story itself is engaging one man James Cole played by Bruce Willis in a heartwarming performance travels several decades to the past to retrieve information about a virus that's wiped out mankind and left only a few survivors alive living underground with the information he'll collect scientists hope to find a cure so everyone in the future can return to the surface. But because their timetravelling technology isn't perfect he ends up being sent towards different other pasts and complicating things.

It's a shame Terry Gilliam's films don't have as big a fanbase as other types of film and director but his fans are loyal.The film starts off with Bruce Willis' flashback and him waking up in this strange prisonlike place which automatically frightens you the first half hour of the film is like this. One particular part is when Willis is walking through the abandoned shopping centre it's a very atmospheric film. The plot is very interesting it can become quite confusing at some points but as with a lot of Gilliam's films it all ties together at the end. The camerawork in this film works really well and provides a lot of the atmosphere and tension in the film's plot. The acting in this film is pretty good. The two main strengths in this film are of course Willis and Brad Pitt. Bruce Willis is an actors who has been typecast unfortunately but this film broke the mould. He does not do any typical Willislike actions and although he is the film's protagonist he doesn't seem that way at all in this he portrays a muddled odd person who eventually tries to save the day. Brad Pitt is astonishing it's the best I have ever seen him perform. It shows how great he really is as an actor and he's not just a pretty face.Overall I would recommend this film if you have seen a Gilliam film before and enjoyed it. If you have never liked any of his films you will probably not like this one. If you've never seen any then at least give this film a chance it deserves a lot more credit than it received.".

Never mind that time travel to the past is an absurdity. We're forced to rise above that because Gilliam presents time similar to the way Kurt Vonnegut did in his novel SlaughterhouseFive 1969 namely that all time is happening simultaneously and especially right now forever.We are reminded that time is an illusion. Our experience and perception of time is as it were linear allowing us a comprehension of time similar to what twodimensional creatures might have of three dimensional space. Time does not exist. It is a construct from the way we compare events. Notice that when James Cole dies Dr. Railly is not sad because Cole lives on in the person of his younger self the child at the airport watching his death. This will be the case for eternity.There are some funny bits in the script. After Cole beats up the pimp to save Dr. Railly and forces a trade of teeth to evade the trackers implanted in his teeth and the cops come the pimp says all hurt I was attacked by a cokedup whore and a crazy dentist. Another nice touch is to have the virologist father of crazyvisionary Jeffrey Goines sound like a southern politician instead of your usual mad scientist. I also liked it when psychiatrist Dr. Kathryn Railly said Psychiatry is the latest religion...I'm in trouble. I'm losing my faith. She's right psychiatry and clinical psychology in general is a secular religion.".

	schema:headline " Keeps you enthralled right through to the end even if you have seen it before.";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie is brilliant and I would say as close to original as movies go except that it was inspired by a 1965 French Short film called La Jetee. It is a tragedy in a sense though you are not quite so sure how it is going to end though you do suspect that it is going to end badly it is just one of those films. However throughout the film Cole Bruce Willis has visions of a man being shot at an airport and a blonde haired woman running to him. For the most part we do not meet a blonde haired woman the only woman we get to know is a brown haired psychiatrist Madaline Stowe.It is now the future and six billion people have been killed by a virus and the rest of humanity has been driven underground. The interesting thing is that the animals are immune to this virus. Throughout the movie we are constantly referred back to the Army of the Twelve Monkeys and are informed that they will release the virus yet how can an insane boy create let alone steal such a powerful virus that will wipe out humanity yet leave the plants and animals? This movie involves a lot of time travel and the purpose of this is to get a sample of the virus so that humanity may inhabit the surface again. Cole believes that he must stop the virus from even beginning but that was not his mission. He was never ordered to stop the virus just to get hold of it. As is said it is all about following orders. The mission that Cole is on is not the mission he was sent on.The time travel doesn't work fully. People are sent back in time but in most cases they do not get to the time they are supposed to. Cole at first is sent back to 1990 instead of 1996 and lands up in a mental hospital. This is very dark and dirty and really underlines the horror of humanity. Jeffery Goines Brad Pitt gives us a definition of insanity here and that is not following what the majority follows. The world is a world of majority rules and if you don't follow the majority then you are considered mentally ill. This is very true just look around and see how minorities are treated. I remember a time and it still is when you were a geek if you used a computer.The Cassandra Syndrome is brought up and is connected with the prophets of doom that are appearing more and more rapidly the closer one gets to 1996. They are warning the world of the disease the passage from Revelation where the angel pours the bowl of disease upon the world is read out a number of times but nobody ever believes them. Nobody wants to believe that the world that they love is coming to an end. Yet belief and reality seem to play a very major part in this movie especially around Cole. At the start he believes that the world will end and that his future is the present but the more time he spends in 1996 and the more time he spends with Katherine Raily Madeline Stowe the more his sense of reality becomes twisted. The last time he visits the future he enters it as a dream and returns to 1996 as reality. By the end of the movie in Cole's mind the whole virus is something that comes from the mouth of a mad man. Yet the more he tries to deny what is happening the more the evidence piles up to prove to him that what is going to happen is true.Erbert brings up the style of the movie and the scenes that it is filmed around. Almost everything in the movie is dirty decaying and falling apart. We catch glimpses of skyscrapers and the beauty of civilisation but are brought into the reality of the slums and vagrants. The future is not something to look forward to but rather something to shun and the most important part is that it cannot be changed. Cole says it is like a movie that you have already seen you know what is going to happen but every time you see it you notice different things. So true he realises that he knows what will happen he has seen it and he knows that even if he tries to stop it it is only bringing him closer to his doom.Twelve Monkeys is a movie that portrays the bleakness of the human existence. Though there are a few that live lives of luxury to the majority it is a bleak world falling closer to destruction.

	onyx:emotionText "This movie is brilliant and I would say as close to original as movies go except that it was inspired by a 1965 French Short film called La Jetee. It is a tragedy in a sense though you are not quite so sure how it is going to end though you do suspect that it is going to end badly it is just one of those films. However throughout the film Cole Bruce Willis has visions of a man being shot at an airport and a blonde haired woman running to him. For the most part we do not meet a blonde haired woman the only woman we get to know is a brown haired psychiatrist Madaline Stowe.It is now the future and six billion people have been killed by a virus and the rest of humanity has been driven underground. The interesting thing is that the animals are immune to this virus. Throughout the movie we are constantly referred back to the Army of the Twelve Monkeys and are informed that they will release the virus yet how can an insane boy create let alone steal such a powerful virus that will wipe out humanity yet leave the plants and animals? This movie involves a lot of time travel and the purpose of this is to get a sample of the virus so that humanity may inhabit the surface again. Cole believes that he must stop the virus from even beginning but that was not his mission. He was never ordered to stop the virus just to get hold of it. As is said it is all about following orders. The mission that Cole is on is not the mission he was sent on.The time travel doesn't work fully. People are sent back in time but in most cases they do not get to the time they are supposed to. Cole at first is sent back to 1990 instead of 1996 and lands up in a mental hospital. This is very dark and dirty and really underlines the horror of humanity. Jeffery Goines Brad Pitt gives us a definition of insanity here and that is not following what the majority follows. The world is a world of majority rules and if you don't follow the majority then you are considered mentally ill. This is very true just look around and see how minorities are treated. I remember a time and it still is when you were a geek if you used a computer.The Cassandra Syndrome is brought up and is connected with the prophets of doom that are appearing more and more rapidly the closer one gets to 1996. They are warning the world of the disease the passage from Revelation where the angel pours the bowl of disease upon the world is read out a number of times but nobody ever believes them. Nobody wants to believe that the world that they love is coming to an end. Yet belief and reality seem to play a very major part in this movie especially around Cole. At the start he believes that the world will end and that his future is the present but the more time he spends in 1996 and the more time he spends with Katherine Raily Madeline Stowe the more his sense of reality becomes twisted. The last time he visits the future he enters it as a dream and returns to 1996 as reality. By the end of the movie in Cole's mind the whole virus is something that comes from the mouth of a mad man. Yet the more he tries to deny what is happening the more the evidence piles up to prove to him that what is going to happen is true.Erbert brings up the style of the movie and the scenes that it is filmed around. Almost everything in the movie is dirty decaying and falling apart. We catch glimpses of skyscrapers and the beauty of civilisation but are brought into the reality of the slums and vagrants. The future is not something to look forward to but rather something to shun and the most important part is that it cannot be changed. Cole says it is like a movie that you have already seen you know what is going to happen but every time you see it you notice different things. So true he realises that he knows what will happen he has seen it and he knows that even if he tries to stop it it is only bringing him closer to his doom.Twelve Monkeys is a movie that portrays the bleakness of the human existence. Though there are a few that live lives of luxury to the majority it is a bleak world falling closer to destruction. Cole says that he wants to make 1996 his reality but as we look around at what Gilliam shows us there is very little to distinguish it from his future. There is still a race of overseers and underlings the virus just causes the balance of power to shift in another direction.";

	schema:reviewBody "The central plot of the movie appears to be SciFi but in the end is it really?Ostensibly we learn humanity is nearly wipedout in 1996 due to a super virus so humans from the future send someone Bruce Willis back to investigate to supposedly find a cure for use in the future. This narrative unfolds as one would expect if a person appeared claiming to be from the future Willis is put in a psychiatric institution. This is where 12 Monkeys begins to distinguish itself from the typical time travel film.Because we are following Bruce Willis'character both in the future and the past the viewer can't say for sure whether Willis' character is actually from the future or merely psychotic. The movie somehow is able to maintain the plausibility of both possibilities up until the very end. Sane or insane timetraveler or nutbucket is what the film plays with expertly.Theories abound to explain one version or another. My personal view is that a you're not supposed to know if it's real or fantasy that IS the point but that forced to pick b I'd go with the SciFi sanity explanation. I favor the explanation that both the doctorswardens of the future and Willis are caught in a temporal paradox which plays itself over and over much like the movie we get to see repeatedly every time we pop in the DVD. Events are bound to happen because Bruce Willis is unable to stop the virus outbreak.Some feel that Willis himself enables or even is necessary for the virus to be unleashed in the first part. This theory holds that the red head that steals and unleashes the virus is partially inspired from Dr. Railly's first lecture in which Willia and his buddy from the future Jose play a part in the Dr's presentation on the Cassandra Complex where someone knows the future but cannot change it. The red head feels the human race does deserve to die but is rebuffedignored by Dr. Railly perhaps fueling his desire to disprove the Cassandra complex and deliver a world destruction he has foreseen. Theorists on this line also point to Dr. Railly's call to the Virus lab which causes the head scientist to give up security to the red headed guy allowing him to steal the virus in the first place. The major problem with this theory is initial causation.If Willis from the future is needed to create the virus dispersal event how did he ever end up a time traveler in the past to begin with? If he is needed for the virus outbreak how could it ever have happened in the first instance if only the young Willis was at the airport the very first run through? The better explanation to my mind is that if you assume the timetravel sanity POV Willis must NOT be necessary for the virus outbreak at all and that he once viewed the event without seeing himself involved only to be sent back and become involved creating the childhood memories for future paradox loops. By this theory we're only watching one showing of the loop where Willis is involved but can't thwart the virus outbreak. The only major defect in this scenario is why would the people from the future send him back to begin with considering the final scene on the airplane where the woman from the future sits next to the red head and claims to be in insurance indicating the people in power in the future desire the virus to get out...so why send Willis to investigate? None of the SciFi explanations is without logical paradox which leaves the more mundane psychosis explanation which since it is based on logicalmental inconsistencies can explain everything by means of delusion. Sure some argue the bullet the picture the kid in barn etc but since we get the story through Willis we can't really trust any of it.As you can see this movie is complex and presents very interesting questions. Everything about the film shines as it uses the medium to create the two possible narratives simultaneously. This couldn't have been an easy movie to write edit or direct and yet all are superb.Also one has to point out Brad Pitt's role is perfectly acted. Pitt's performance is worth the price of admission or rental even had the movie been terrible. Not only excellent but simply an amazing portrayal of an insane man. Pitt deserved an Oscar for best actor.If you haven't had the chance to view this yet make a point to.".

A captivating element of the relationship between her and Willis is their sense of seeing each other before in another place or time.  12 MONKEYS is essentially about time and the madness the futuristic people immerse into it and the times of the present when killers and a psychotic genius can alter the world.The brooding city of Philadelphia is a dark and gothic backdrop for Willis' plight to complete his mission which is against all usual Hollywood stereotype NOT to save the world.  He is gathering information.  The film plays tricks on the viewer as well placing Willis in a new setting at the drop of a pin.  This must have been an extremely difficult picture to make but Gilliam seems to be the master of hardboiled movie making.

The screen is this man's canvas and he knows how to paint a sometimes terrifying picture of the world and its possible future within the mainstream atmosphere of bigbudget films.

Despite some good clever action scenes this is not a straightup action film. Instead it's more of a thriller that likes to challenge viewers and that it does successfully. It helps that there are a few mindblowing twists and turns thrown in.This film is about a jailed guy James Cole who is sent back in time to prevent a virus that wipe out the majority of the human population by 1997. He meets a psychologist and together they try to find the 12 Monkeys cult which is believed to be the ones that let the virus out.The acting is really good. Bruce Willis and especially Brad Pitt are on top of their games in the movie. Brad Pitt really gives it his all by playing a mental person with a weird imagination. Bruce Willis is really good as the guy who just wants to do his job and leave. Madeleine Stowe also does a good job even though I thought she was confusing at times.Overall this is a very good film both as a narrative and a technical display. Both worlds past and future are depicted as grim and dirty. It must have influenced 2006's Children of Men because that is what the bleak landscape reminded me of. This thriller reminds me of the old Hitchcock films and the early Shymalan films with the kind of plot twists the movie has. This is a really scifi film and it holds up well. I rate this film 910.".

	schema:headline " Watch Willi endure every clich known to comedy";
	schema:reviewBody "Heinz Erhardt debuts his television character Willi Winzig on the big screen in this musical comedy based on the stage play Das Had Man Nun Davon by Wilhelm Lichtenberg. Winzig and his pal Felix Klein Ralf Wolter are two tax collectors who board with Frau Stirnima Helen Vita hence the opening number which doubles as a subtitle for the film GruB Sie Gott Frau Stirnima. As the two jolly penny pincher's leave on their tandem we learn that Klein has a crush on their secretary played by Ruth Stephan who would go on to play Willi's wife in his next film but that sequel is only related by the name of the title character anyway. Back in this film however Willi is a determined bachelor and warns his fellow 'Steurinspecteur' about the rigors of marriage. Little does he realize their landlady Strinima wants to gets her hands on a piece of Willi.Stella Mooney costars as Winzig's sexy niece Helga described in the third edition of the Speelfilm Encyclopedie as 'geil'. She is coming to stay with Uncle Willi though she does so mainly to be close to her singing sensation boyfriend Frank Rex Gildo. Of course worrisome Willi  Felix fail to grasp this fact and go out in search of her when she goes clubbing. They are pointed in her direction by the hairiest least attractive and most scruffy looking folk band ever seen on celluloid The Minstrels. Naturally both the Minstrels and especially Rex Gildo get ample opportunity to strut their musical stuff and slow the pace of the film down considerably. Helga takes a job as a waitress and soon becomes the object of some misplaced jealousy when secretary Engel gets the wrong impression of Helga's feelings for Felix. Yes they couldn't afford to let that old comedy chestnut rest.Willi being a fourth generation civil servant has been a bit too lenient with some of his nicer read female clients and the powers that be are catching on. So he first pretends to be a daytime sleepwalker another tired old clich then to have lost his marbles altogether.

	onyx:emotionText "Heinz Erhardt debuts his television character Willi Winzig on the big screen in this musical comedy based on the stage play Das Had Man Nun Davon by Wilhelm Lichtenberg. Winzig and his pal Felix Klein Ralf Wolter are two tax collectors who board with Frau Stirnima Helen Vita hence the opening number which doubles as a subtitle for the film GruB Sie Gott Frau Stirnima. As the two jolly penny pincher's leave on their tandem we learn that Klein has a crush on their secretary played by Ruth Stephan who would go on to play Willi's wife in his next film but that sequel is only related by the name of the title character anyway. Back in this film however Willi is a determined bachelor and warns his fellow 'Steurinspecteur' about the rigors of marriage. Little does he realize their landlady Strinima wants to gets her hands on a piece of Willi.Stella Mooney costars as Winzig's sexy niece Helga described in the third edition of the Speelfilm Encyclopedie as 'geil'. She is coming to stay with Uncle Willi though she does so mainly to be close to her singing sensation boyfriend Frank Rex Gildo. Of course worrisome Willi  Felix fail to grasp this fact and go out in search of her when she goes clubbing. They are pointed in her direction by the hairiest least attractive and most scruffy looking folk band ever seen on celluloid The Minstrels. Naturally both the Minstrels and especially Rex Gildo get ample opportunity to strut their musical stuff and slow the pace of the film down considerably. Helga takes a job as a waitress and soon becomes the object of some misplaced jealousy when secretary Engel gets the wrong impression of Helga's feelings for Felix. Yes they couldn't afford to let that old comedy chestnut rest.Willi being a fourth generation civil servant has been a bit too lenient with some of his nicer read female clients and the powers that be are catching on. So he first pretends to be a daytime sleepwalker another tired old clich then to have lost his marbles altogether. But when he decides to check himself into a 'Nevenklinik' the doctor in charge turns out to be nuttier than he is you guessed it it was an inmate pretending to be a doctor. Frau Stirnima is getting nowhere with her advances aimed at Willi either. When she invites him up to her bedroom all he does is grab the opportunity to borrow her late husband's tux.During a posh party Winzig starts misbehaving himself in order to be judged certifiably insane in front of the minister of state Willy Reichert.

To discover the rest of the story I highly recommend Harpo Marx' autobiography Harpo Speaks.  Although Harpo also recalls the scathing insults and practical jokes that were a central part of the story of this Round Table group his book relates a number of hugely funny and sometimes heartwarming scenes that indicate that at least some of these people truly cared for each other and expressed strong positive feelings in many different settings.  In short Harpo's stories e.g. several croquet fanatic episodes offer a telling comedic counterpoint to Mrs. Parker's almost continually cynical and selfpitying pathos.  Read Harpo's book to balance out the negative. You'll be glad you did.".

	schema:reviewBody "From what I have read of and about Dorothy Parker she was a paradoxically sad person. A woman that seemed to long for true love but seemed to keep everyone at a safe distance. She seemed to use her cutting wit and great appetite for booze as a defence against any possible close personal relationship with her friends and peers.  The only men in her life were equally committed to keeping their distance and control. This movie captured those feelings and relationships with great acuity. Jennifer Jason Leigh was superb as Dorothy. In fact all of the actors were fantastic. This film isn't for the crowd that throng to the next Lethal Weapon sequel in ever growing numbers. Those of you that look for movies with intelligence and style will be greatly rewarded.".

	schema:reviewBody "Towards the end of her career Dorothy Parker remembers the past days when she was part of the Algoquin Round Table a group of friends who shared interests in the arts drink and witty barbs at each others' expense. However behind the wit she has a lot of hurt and the story follows her through broken relationships and lost happiness.I have seen this film several times but am only writing a review of it now. It always strikes me as being a very worthy film that is good' and should be appreciated.  But this doesn't make it an easy film to access or watch. On the surface the overlapping dialogue and quick wit makes for a film hat could be accepted several ways.  I was stuck in the middle.  At once I felt that these people were pompous and condescending but then also felt that they were witty people and clever!  The same with Parker herself  at times she was a good character but then at others she was mysterious and very hard to understand.I suppose this is to the film's credit that it never paints it's subjects in one colour  there is room for interpretation.  The one thing that struck me me who uses a lot of sarcasm is how much hurt was often put behind the barbs.  As one character says she never talks deeply with any of her friends and never gets beyond the next barbed remark.  The fact that her life slides the way it does shows the danger in this.  However the film does still allow the brighter side of her life to come out as well so that it isn't al gloom.  This still doesn't make it easy watching  there is no one central narrative other than Parker herself.  This made it feel a little free floating and aimless and it occasionally felt as hollow and pointless as the quick wit shared by unhappy people around the table.The cast is pretty good.   Leigh does occasionally come over as a woman giving an impression rather than a performance but she does manage to seem more natural when talking rather than quoting.  The support cast is made up of quite a few Bgrade stars of quality and some not and they all give good account of themselves.  Broderick Gallagher McCarthy Taylor and Tucci are among the cast but really it is Leigh's film to win or lose.Overall this is a classy film.  The direction and sets really get the period right and film feels good.  However at times it seems aimless and much of the film is actually pretty depressing stuff.  I took the warning from it of opening up rather than trying to be a smartase all the time but I'm not sure if that was what it was saying.  The cast do well and Leigh makes a good Mrs Parker despite just stopping short of out and out impersonation.".

Only someone who already knows her story and can keep her various husbands and lovers in order can piece this mishmash together.

The gang scenes work because of the fast pacing the movie drags when we spend time with the individuals. According to comments recorded here Miss Leigh is doing a good vocal impression of Dorothy Parker. Maybe so I've never heard Parker but Leigh's delivery is so totally annoying that it's enough to drive the AUDIENCE to suicide. Is she trying to do Hepburn on downers? Sometimes her mannered accent veers toward Transylvanian.Throughout the movie Parker herself denigrates her little doodad poems but that's all the film offers us of her creative output. We never really find out about the contents of her books and plays and how she ended up in Hollywood and what she wrote there. After a few of her doggerel verses they become trite.

Leigh strikes out here just as she struck out when she attempted to win plaudits for her Catherine Sloper in WASHINGTON SQUARE.Nice period atmosphere sets costumes and music can't make up for an utterly aimless script that is as empty as the babble going on among the sophisticated literate circle Parker was a part of. She gets some nice support from a cast of competent players but since the whole film depends on understanding what makes Parker tick it's got to be called a failure.Parker deserved better than this. Hopefully some day someone with a sense of how to bring her to life will do so with a script that can make us sympathize with the characterization instead of the sketchy view we get here. Nor does it help that few of the characters bear any physical resemblance to the people they're portraying. Did they know what Robert Benchley looked like?".

Parker a unique talent who could write with pathos and humor was surrounded by the likes of Robert Benchley Edna Ferber Charles Macarthur Alexander Woolcott Deems Taylor and Robert Sherwood.

I realize these are generalizations  just how general remains to be seen.The atmosphere is set wonderfully in this film which tells something of Dorothy Parker's sad life as she finds and loses love. Unfortunately with possibly the exception of Campbell Scott as Benchley and at times Ms. Leigh everyone is PLAYING Woolcott MacArthur etc. It's all a kind of let's pretend instead us showing us real people  as famous as they all were they were human beings. The script is uneven the crazy frenzied scenes at the Algonquin are the best ones but we don't know these people well enough to be interested in smaller scenes.I had the great pleasure of seeing Jason Leigh on Broadway in Proof and she was excellent  she is a very fine actress with a broad range. But in her attempt to successfully have all of Dorothy Parker's externals she's tripped herself up. I unfortunately only understood maybe 40 of what she was saying. Not only do I doubt that was true of the real Dorothy I also doubt going that far with the voice was necessary  very very few people who would see this film ever heard Dorothy Parker speak. It's a little like doing Eliza Doolittle  if you actually spoke pure Cockney the audience wouldn't understand a word. Parker's droll tones channeled through Leigh's mouth don't work. She does however create a very real and very sad person who lived in an interesting time wrote about it and who loved and drank her way through it.".

Essentially they told a possibly interesting story but they did so very incompetently. I was totally incapable to forget that the lead actress was acting. She was absolutely false from start to finish and I found myself strongly disliking her. The movie is full of scenes with Parker facing the camera in a kind of Shakesperean aside which enabled us to hear her poetry. The poetry is OK I guess but was murdered by the wooden acting and the funny voice that Parker was forcing out without a pause. The rest of the movie is just boring and I couldn't bring myself to finish the thing. I wonder if those people were really as tedious and pretentiously awful as they were portrayed as being. I guess I will never know. If you are interested in Parker read her original work. This film will do nothing at all to endear her to you.".

Essentially they told a possibly interesting story but they did so very incompetently. I was totally incapable to forget that the lead actress was acting. She was absolutely false from start to finish and I found myself strongly disliking her. The movie is full of scenes with Parker facing the camera in a kind of Shakesperean aside which enabled us to hear her poetry. The poetry is OK I guess but was murdered by the wooden acting and the funny voice that Parker was forcing out without a pause. The rest of the movie is just boring and I couldn't bring myself to finish the thing. I wonder if those people were really as tedious and pretentiously awful as they were portrayed as being. I guess I will never know. If you are interested in Parker read her original work. This film will do nothing at all to endear her to you.";

The real stand out in this huge ensemble cast which includes Matthew Broderick Gwyneth Paltrow and Jennifer Beals is Campbell Scott simply remarkable as Robert Benchley.The movie itself is uneven. Early on we see Parker and Benchley in Hollywood in the 1940s where they are cordial at best and then a flashback to Algonquin Circle days the 1920s begins. We naturally expect to find the root of the estrangement as the entire construction screams that something happened. But the movie doesn't deliver on its promise we see a complex and tender relationship but we never see what happened that would prevent them to continue in their fond dance of neverquiteromance. Despite its failure to provide a denouement this relationship is the soul of the movie and very much worth seeing. Otherwise Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle barely rises above the typical tortured artist story. Mrs. Parker was brilliant but unfulfilled. Mrs. Parker drank and attempted suicide. Mrs. Parker recites her own poetry into the camera. Yadda yadda. By the end Mrs. Parker totters and slurs to such an extent that one wonders if this can possibly be true it seems a parody. My sense is of a script that veered away from its own fulfillment and wanders around the outside. 710".

Larry Parks plays the producerdirectorstar Danny Miller who has to pay off a gambling debt with this show or die.Though the music isn't that memorable the story is charming and the film contains a lovely performance and great dancing by Hayworth whose voice is dubbed by Anita Ellis and she's given excellent support by James Gleason Culver and Edward Everett Horton.Larry Parks fresh from his starmaking role in The Jolson Story does a good job but one wonders had he not been blacklisted what would have happened to his career. He wasn't a particularly strong leading man. But we'll never know because a few years later he was finished.As for Hayworth it's a shame that someone so incredibly beautiful and vivacious who brought so much happiness through her work could have had such a miserable life  abuse by her father a string of bad marriages and finally Alzheimer's. It was her Alzheimer's that helped to bring the disease to national attention. Princess Yasmin Khan Hayworth's daughter has become an internationally known spokeswoman and active fundraiser to increase awareness and finance research to find a cure for Alzheimer's disease. Besides her glorious presence Rita had one more gift for the world.".

Larry Parks plays the producerdirectorstar Danny Miller who has to pay off a gambling debt with this show or die.Though the music isn't that memorable the story is charming and the film contains a lovely performance and great dancing by Hayworth whose voice is dubbed by Anita Ellis and she's given excellent support by James Gleason Culver and Edward Everett Horton.Larry Parks fresh from his starmaking role in The Jolson Story does a good job but one wonders had he not been blacklisted what would have happened to his career. He wasn't a particularly strong leading man. But we'll never know because a few years later he was finished.As for Hayworth it's a shame that someone so incredibly beautiful and vivacious who brought so much happiness through her work could have had such a miserable life  abuse by her father a string of bad marriages and finally Alzheimer's. It was her Alzheimer's that helped to bring the disease to national attention. Princess Yasmin Khan Hayworth's daughter has become an internationally known spokeswoman and active fundraiser to increase awareness and finance research to find a cure for Alzheimer's disease. Besides her glorious presence Rita had one more gift for the world.";

	schema:reviewBody "Danny Miller is producing a musical on Broadway Swinging the Muses about two war pilots who end up in the days of Greek mythology romanced by a man hungry Terpsichore the Greek Goddess of song and dance. This portrayal upsets the real Terpsichore who decides to go down to earth and make the musical accurate. Enter once again Mr. Jordan and messenger 7013 to help her come to the land of mortals and into the play where she gets the lead role easily using the name of Kitty Pendleton. TerpsichoreKitty and Danny have constant arguments over the way the musical is being presented but Danny becomes so infatuated with Kitty that the musical in a preview is presented accurately which when produced becomes an artistic and symphonic production but bores the audience to sleep or an early exit. When Danny decides to do the musical the way it was intended to be Kitty storms off the set and asks Mr. Jordan to return to heaven but Mr. Jordan informs Kitty that Danny needs this play to succeed since its being backed by a racketeer Manion who Danny owes 20000 to in gambling losses and if the show flops Danny will be rubbed out. Kitty then decides to return and make the show a success even though she realizes she will have to return to heaven and lose Danny. The movie is good but really lacks much of the charm of its predecessor Here Comes Mr. Jordan. The film is a star vehicle for Hayworth but she is very enchanting in the role. Parks wasn't romantic leading material but has the talent to get by still has his singing voice lipsynced. Culver's Mr. Jordan is less charming and a more serious version than Claude Rains' version but his performance is still admirable. Horton and Gleason are the only ones reprising their roles from the original. The film's setback is that the musical numbers aren't that good and seem to last forever the last one from the film is OK but the two versions of the ancient Greek setting musical drag on for an eternity. Still a good film but you may be lost or disinterested if you didn't watch Here Comes Mr. Jordan. Rating 7.".

The color is lush and Hayworth is breathtakingly beautiful and certainly suited to play the goddess of music and dance Terpsichore her singing voice was again dubbed by Anita Ellis and Larry Parks is adorable as the young Broadway producer who wants so desperately to succeed. George Macready who played Hayworth's evil spouse in Gilda again appears here in a similar role with comedic undertones  his office even seems to be the same as in the earlier film. It's also fun to see William Frawley in a small but memorable role. Parks sadly had a shortlived career as it was virtually destroyed by the McCarthy witch hunts. And the romance is touching and even a little tearinducing. The term Heavenly Goddess certainly applies to the lovely Rita. Adele Jergens is also great as the original dancer in the show that KittyTerpischore replaces. Not the best Columbia musical but an offbeat film and worth watching simply because of the dance sequences color cinematography and Rita at her most enticing.".

RodgersHart did well by them in By Jupiter their last original collaboration. But Cole Porter had a misfire with them in Out Of This World. And the team of Doris Fisher and Allan Roberts aren't quite of the caliber of Porter and RodgersHart. No great songs come out of the score here and that certainly would have helped the film a lot.In Down To Earth Terpsichore does just that when up in her celestial viewing spot she sees that performerproducer Larry Parks planning a musical comedy that is a satire of the Greek Gods. She's not happy that liberties are being taken with her relations so she comes down and of course gets the dancing lead and the leading man sort of.Rita Hayworth was dubbed by Anita Ellis who did her songs in a few of her Forties films. But why people were expecting the voice of Larry Parks in his one duet with Hayworth to be Al Jolson's those Greek Gods only know. Parks was dubbed by a singer named Hal Derwin and I took a look at Mr. Derwin's credits and he dubbed at various times Lee Bowman Gene Nelson and Bob Cummings in various films. It wasn't Jolson by why would anyone expect that.Helping out in Down to Earth are three roles from Here Comes Mr. Jordan one of Columbia's earlier comedyfantasy hits. Stepping in for Claude Rains as the all knowing Mr. Jordan is Roland Culver. And repeating their roles from Here Comes Mr. Jordan are Edward Everett Horton as the snippy heavenly messenger and James Gleason as the good hearted but slightly confused Max Corkle who has quit managing fighters and is now an actor's agent. I suppose the job calls for the same skills.But this film is really Rita Hayworth's show. She's at the height of her screen fame when this was made and one look at her by young fans who might not have been alive when she was will tell you why that woman was the greatest screen sex symbol ever.So in overcoming a mediocre musical score Rita makes this film as personally her own as Gilda in the previous year. Not as good as Gilda but all Rita.".

Not to decry the sweet nature of the story and it is a charming fable there's too many things wrong to make it fully function as an uplifting musical.The songs from Doris Fisher and Allan Roberts are weak and uninspiring and they are further hindered by the overtly evident voice dubbing of the cast. Not normally an issue to me but when the lyrics are so tepid the focus is drawn to the irritants. Then there is the lack of spark between Hayworth and her leading man Larry Parks as the show's producer Danny Miller. Parks was riding the crest of a wave after his Oscar nominated turn in Al Jolson the previous year but here he struggles and looks nothing like leading man potential. The choreography is fine including a well constructed sequence in a play park and the set design is easy on the eye. But there is no getting away from it without Rita Hayworth in the lead this film would have sank without trace from the musical aficionado's memory bank. A generous 510 from me as it looks fabulous on a High Definition TV where you can see that producer Dan Hartman at least had the vision to put on a glossy show.".

	schema:reviewBody "I suppose that Technicolour was a big selling point when this film came out 1946. The colour is beautiful to look at but much of the rest of the film is rather slim. In this film Rita Hayworth is a muse who becomes upset when she learns that a Broadway musical is going to portray her as a jive crazy love machine. She heads to earth to correct matters and the audience settles in for 101 minutes of unmemorable musical numbers and several poorly choreographed dance scenes.Allow me to guess what happened here. Columbia was looking for a musical vehicle for Hayworth then at the top of her career. They had script for a B musical ready to roll but they needed to beef it up a bit. So what they did was steal a few of the characters from a past hit HERE COME MR. JORDAN added Technicolour and hoped that it would prove enough of a draw. If you do watch this film note how poorly the JORDAN characters are worked in  especially Max Corkle.Elements of the Broadway musical DOWN TO EARTH also appear in Fred Astaire's THE BAND WAGON which came out in 1953  but the numbers in the later film were far more memorable. I had enjoyed HERE COMES MR. JORDAN and was curious as to what the sequal would be like. My curiosity has been satisfied  yet another halfbaked movie sequel.".

	schema:reviewBody "Wow Columbia Pictures really shocked me with how this film began. Believe it or not it is a sequel of sorts to Here Comes Mr. Jordan. While the main character Robert Montgomery is not in the film many of the other characters aresuch as his friend and agent James Gleason and the angel Edward Everett Horton. However this time they are not dealing with an accidental death and how to rectify it but with the angry Terpsichore Rita Hayworth. Apparently this Muse got wind of a Broadway musical down on Earth in which she and the other gods are portrayed incorrectly! She asks Mr. Jordan is she can have permission to go to New York and fix this problem. Jordan agrees and sends his befuddled angel Horton along as her assistant and to be sure she doesn't break any rules in fixing the play.While the producer does immediately fall under Terpsichore's spell and lets her rewrite the play as well as star in it there is a serious problem. The final product is just awfulsort of like a Wagnerian opera and Busby Berkeley hybrid that dumbfounded the audienceand effectively killed the show. While it was SUPPOSED to be bad I can't see why the Columbia folks also insisted on showing so much of this bad play that was supposed to be bad! In other words why torment the audience when they can just show tiny snippets and let us know the audience hated itinstead of making the movie audience wonder why the heck they went to see this when there was a perfectly good Clark Gable film playing down the street!! Too too much...that's for sure! Well despite the problems this is only about midway through the filmso it's obvious that something will happen next. What this is and how the whole production is salvaged if it is is for you to see for yourself. However it's not one of the better musicals of the era and is no where nearly as good as Here Comes Mr. Jordanso you'll have to decide if it's worth it! Oddly practically everyone in this movie cannot singa serious problem as it's a musical!! Many of the characters were dubbed and while Rita Hayworth was gorgeous it was silly to pick a lead who could sing though she was a fantastic dancer. I think the reason she was used is because she was the studio chief's Roy Cohn pet actressand he featured her in practically all of the studio's Apictures during this era. I guess in an odd way I can understand thisbut why use Larry Parks and a couple others who also couldn't sing?! Aside from its very dubious views on the afterlife and theology this is an enjoyable bit of fluff and no moreand certainly not a mustsee. However the main story idea was never good enough to have encouraged some idiots to remake it decades later as the godawful Xanadu. Aside from some good music Xanadu should rank as one of the dumbest major studio films of the last 40 years!".

But she looks like a manic insane person she has no idea where she is going next. It doesn't look like fun at all!The direction seemed amateurish instead of wider shots of the dance group during the opening night of the play the camera wanders around the confusing scene often becoming filled with a bewildering mass of arms. I kept worrying that the live flames of the torches being waved around would catch in the billowing costumes  I wondered if they'd had any injuries during the filming. And on a purely superficial note the choice to lighten Rita's signature bright red hair and smoky eyes gave her a pale insipid look that did nothing to reinforce her presence on the screen.Too bad this film didn't have more scenes like the one where Terpsichore pleads with Mr. Jordan to let her stay on Earth. Rita was classic when she could cry on the screen. She was a much better serious actress than a comic one.".

	schema:reviewBody "This highly enjoyable sequel to Here Comes Mr. Jordan and according to Hollywood legend the inspiration for Xanadou is a colorful musical that gave Rita a chance to escape from the Gilda image created the year before. The seemingly haughty goddess Terpsicore goes down to earth with ohdear angel Edward Everett Horton at head angel Roland Culver's request to supposedly stop a show about the muses of Mount Ponassus from being ridiculed in the public's eye. There she takes on the leading role of the show replacing disgruntled leading lady Adele Jergens and gives producer Larry Parks a very hard time. When she finds human emotions and falls in love with him realizing that he has laid his life on the line for this project she decides to follow his rules and the show goes on. But after opening night she has to honor her promise to the angels which finds her emotionally distressed as she goes from being a Broadway diva to an unable to cry muse once again.When Rita Hayworth smiles men are transfixed by her beauty. Her long ravishing red hair photographed to the max here adds to her beauty. She can sing dance act even charm the socks off the director in spite of being out to sabotage him. She wants to make the show respectable at first but allows her emotions to take over her actions later on. Rita was Columbia's jewel in the crown by this time and no expense was spared to make her a film goddess to rival the Greek one she portrays. Along for the ride are two holdovers from Here Comes Mr. JordanEE Horton and agent Max James Gleason. Mr. Gleason's character is more of a comical buffoon here than he was in the original film walking through a moving set door at one point and becoming very befuddled by still being inside the theater. Roland Culver replaces Claude Rains as Mr. Jordan and is acceptable but no one can truly replace Mr. Rains in talent and onscreen magnetism.Larry Parks The Jolson Story is fine as the love interest not sounding at all like Al Jolson here when he sings. Marc Platt already a wellrespected Broadway hoofer does a fine job in the dance sequences but in his conflict backstage with Hayworth there is never any doubt who would come out the victor if Hayworth hadn't agreed to change her plans. He comes off more as an annoying sidekick to Parks due to his stiff acting. As for the musical numbers the lyrics aren't always the greatest even though the bad lyrics of the opening song For instance take a chick like me they call me Terpsiquore are meant to be parody. The bigamy song is probably the worst number but People Have More Fun set in New York's Gramercy Park is fun and Let's Stay Young Forever is very pretty. Look for William Frawley of I Love Lucy as the investigator questioning Gleason. While not as good as the two other big color musicals that year Mother Wore Tights and Good News it isn't as bad as critics wrote. I've seen it over 10 times in the past 30 years and enjoy it more than a lot of movies I saw as a child then revisited several times as an adult.PSAnybody know where I can get a copy of the song they mention Who hit Nellie in the belly with a flounder?".

Rita looked like she was having a lot of fun making the film. I hope she was because I am fan of her's...but that doesn't mean I have to like all of her films. Most people agree critics alike this movie was just a vehicle to show off Hayworth's looks and dancing talent. However I don't think the dancing came off that well either. I preferred her dancing earlier in the decade in a couple of Fred Astaire movies. Rita was really something in those movies  a fabulous dancer.This was the musical version of the 1941 hit film Hear Comes Mr. Jordan That was a far far better movie than this one. The songs are insipid and Rita's voice is dubbed by Anita Ellis and the story even worse. This prettylooking fluff was good escapism for audiences back in 1947 still recovering from the long horrific World War II. Today however this doesn't translate well. At least it wound up being an inspiration for somebody as it spurned the 1980 musical Xanadu starring Olivia NewtonJohn.".

	schema:headline " Quite underrated";
	schema:reviewBody "Down to Earth is a charming musical that showcases Rita Hayworth and her many talents to distinction. In this sequel of the classic Here Comes Mr. Jordan 1941 she plays the Greek muse Terpsichore who could be a more natural choice for a goddess than Rita Hayworth? who is infuriated that a jazzy satirical stage musical based on the muses is being produced in New York City. She demands from Mr. Jordan played by Roland Culver to be sent down to earth to play her part under the guise of helping producer Danny Miller played by Larry Parks. Her introduction to him is in a scrumptious sequence in which she sneaks into the chorus and completely upstages the star with a great dance routine proving again Hayworth's singular talent of taking charge of the screen.Danny is initially excited that Kitty Pendleton will play the lead but then she becomes a nightmare demanding script rewrites and changes in costume and set design prompting a memorable quip from James Gleason as her agent I think she musta went to college. You know how that'll ruin anybody. . However she seduces Danny making him warm up to her ideas changing the basic premise to one worshipping Terpsichore. The result is disastrous a bizarre and selfimportant turkey that draws the ire of the audience and critics. The cast and crew unceremoniously dump Kitty and revert to the original. Mr. Jordan reveals to her just what Danny has riding in this show a pact with a gangster in which he will relieve his debt of 20000 about 200000 in 2010 with either a successful show of his life. Humbled she goes back to Danny begging to come back to the show promising that she'll do it his way. He accepts the show is necessarily a smash and Kitty finally reveals her love to Danny. However Mr. Jordan reappears telling her that since her original mission of helping Danny is completed she must come back Up. Once again a goddess and heartbroken she yearns to know what will become of Danny. Mr. Jordan reveals to her what happened Danny remained in love with Kitty and became a successful producer. When he dies and is waiting to board the aircraft Future Terpsichore appears and he immediately understands she boards the plane with him and it flies off. Present Terpsichore rejoices and the movie ends with a lovely shot of her dancing happily toward the camera.I believe some of the criticism of the film is unfair. Contrary to other opinions the score mostly presented as songs in the show is surely serviceable and has two strong ballads Let's Stay Young Forever and They Can't Convince Me sung admirably by Parks. Certainly the movie is decidedly less profound and moving than the original film or its 1978 remake Heaven Can Wait. Ironically the movie is much better though much lesserknown than its infamous remake Xanadu 1980. Fluffy and silly Down to Earth works well not really because of its musical numbers but its wonderful mix of rollicking humor amply supplied by James Gleason and Edward Everett Horton who reprise their roles from the original film and a sweet romance good pacing and the great talent of Rita Hayworth. Though she showcased herself well in acclaimed dramatic performances in Gilda 1946 The Lady From Shanghai 1947 and Miss Sadie Thompson 1954 she displays here a great comedic talent able to transmit both righteous anger and pettiness.Fans of Rita fantasies and Classicalera musicals will enjoy this most dazzling concoction.".

Humbled she goes back to Danny begging to come back to the show promising that she'll do it his way. He accepts the show is necessarily a smash and Kitty finally reveals her love to Danny. However Mr. Jordan reappears telling her that since her original mission of helping Danny is completed she must come back Up. Once again a goddess and heartbroken she yearns to know what will become of Danny. Mr. Jordan reveals to her what happened Danny remained in love with Kitty and became a successful producer. When he dies and is waiting to board the aircraft Future Terpsichore appears and he immediately understands she boards the plane with him and it flies off. Present Terpsichore rejoices and the movie ends with a lovely shot of her dancing happily toward the camera.I believe some of the criticism of the film is unfair. Contrary to other opinions the score mostly presented as songs in the show is surely serviceable and has two strong ballads Let's Stay Young Forever and They Can't Convince Me sung admirably by Parks. Certainly the movie is decidedly less profound and moving than the original film or its 1978 remake Heaven Can Wait. Ironically the movie is much better though much lesserknown than its infamous remake Xanadu 1980. Fluffy and silly Down to Earth works well not really because of its musical numbers but its wonderful mix of rollicking humor amply supplied by James Gleason and Edward Everett Horton who reprise their roles from the original film and a sweet romance good pacing and the great talent of Rita Hayworth. Though she showcased herself well in acclaimed dramatic performances in Gilda 1946 The Lady From Shanghai 1947 and Miss Sadie Thompson 1954 she displays here a great comedic talent able to transmit both righteous anger and pettiness.Fans of Rita fantasies and Classicalera musicals will enjoy this most dazzling concoction.";

	schema:reviewBody "There is a lot wrong with this movie but none of it is Rita Hayworth. She plays the part of a goddess briefly visiting earth and not exactly fitting in which indeed she was. In this movie she comes from a heaven which strangely is managed as both the place of the human afterlife and the abode of the Greek gods. Trailing after her is Edward Everett Horton providing comic relief but at a certain point he drops out as the movie becomes more serious and unsettling. There are songs and they sound all right but nothing is catchy about them. There are dances and people complaining about the dances and you can't quite tell whether you're being ribbed for enjoying the dances or ribbed for not enjoying them. Rita Hayworth never gets a romantic dance with a partner although Marc Platt as the friend becoming alienated from the male lead gets a few moments to show off his own energetic moves as he and Hayworth being part of a threesome dance to a song about how happy they are that is set in a gloomily deserted twilight playground. And how could they be happy? Everyone in the story is angry jealous fearful or violent and there is no place on earth for love. The movie is dated 1947 and for no obvious reason men are shown more than once in military uniform. Perhaps the confusion the uncomfortable jostling of the earthly and the otherworldly and the threat to the solidarity of the male buddies have something to do with the atmosphere of war's end.".

Very unexpected in a popular star vehicle particularly because it's fairly long and doesn't really feature Hayworth or Platt very prominently. One wonders how Cole got away with doing it and keeping it in the film. Well worth watching.The contrast with the original Kiss of the Muse dance and the abbreviated final show version of the Greek ballet makes an enlightening statement about highbrow art vs. entertainment. It's a shame that Adele Jergens didn't get more opportunites to dance in films. She does a marvelous job as the first Terpsichore in the overthetop Kiss of the Muse number. Marc Platt's dance skills were also underutilized  he's in all the numbers but the choreography don't really make any demands on his skills.".

	schema:headline " I adore musicals I'm so tired of thinking! or Zeus Bless This Bigamist Home";
	schema:reviewBody "The quote probably sums up this musical the best. I was looking at Turner Classic Movies and this was on and I didn't know that Xanadu was a remake of this idea though one of the actors states I had butterflies in my stomach before but now they are on roller skates in a strange prophetic vision to what was to come for this movie.The story is about the same. Muse comes to Earth via a helper which is odd to me because if she was a Muse and didn't like a play I would assume that she would tell Papa Zeus and he would let the thunderbolts rain down on the production and that would be that. I do like that Terpsichore says Dionysus is her dad which actually makes sense if you think of Dionysus' pleasure loving characteristics if not true by the book. It was a little hard for me to get past that fact that Terpischore was seen as the Muse of theater and dance because a couple of the other Muses were theater inspirations too Thalia MelpomeneCalliope but this is nitpicking because I like the myths. The musical portrays that Americans like jazz and hot dogs while mythology or old European culture makes them snore so the musical director makes a musical where the Muses act like trollops. This leads to some interestingly progressive numbers like one where the Goddess says she is going to marry two men then four. I thought this womanas bigamist as kind of a cool idea but one I wouldn't expect in a 40's musical with its standard treating of women. It is hard for me to understand why a Muse needs to not only rely to men but also a pilot that I guess would be sort of a St. Peter to get her down to Earth used the title of the movie here ha when Gods in mythology could come down whenever they wanted to. They needed no guides. Thought it is interesting to think of a heavenly place where the Gods of the Ancients comingle with Christian theology. It is probably another progressive idea that should be explored more since I think Christianity got its idea of heaven from the Greek Gods living on Mt. Olympus. Anyway as far as musicals go this one is fine by me. It would probably help if you like Rita Hayworth andor Greek mythology. The songs are adequate enough some are better than others to me like the opening and the great GrecoRoman Reconstructionist middle where the Muse takes us back to a more ritualistic high brow time. Then other numbers are not as great like the ending people are the best song with people dancing on a playground or even the Kiss of the Muse song. Overall I can see why this was made into Xanadu because it is sort of a diamond in the rough and in its remake we got a version with a lot better songs some of those were big hits. Of course that was grade A cheese too. I grew up in the 70's and 80's so I was all into it when I was a kid and there was a movie about a muse coming to Earth. So now I am also into this lost gem of a movie.".

I can't understand how they managed to wrangle these guys into this boring thriller I just don't get it. As the movie goes there really isn't very much to say the plot is as thin as the paper the screenplay was written on. It begins with all of our castminus Ving rolling down the highway in what seems to be a trip for college students with Val Kilmer appearing as a professor of some sort seaming to be the leader of the group accompanied by his wife it's not made clear what the whole trip was about probably due to the fact that it all means nothing due to the van crashing into a tree after a shadow of a girl appears. Then they build up that a MASSIVE storm is approaching  they wind up stranded at Ving's place.Everything that happens next was to me kind of boring not very exciting and overall not that entertaining. They had such talent to work with  they wasted the potential of that with a bad script  limited character development. Rhames character was by far the best without him the film would sink faster than the titanic he holds that certain kind of unsettling conviction that worked well in his character but even he cannot save the film. When the twist was revealed it was somewhat surprising but nothing to write home about or text your friends about. 510I don't recommending paying to see this film in any form whatsoever.".

Did he learn anything about writing or filmmaking before he embarked on this project because it certainly doesn't appear that way. I am literally ANGRY about having watched this amateurish clap trap. No wait that's an insult to amateur filmmakers who undoubtedly could have done a better film than this. I imagine that a considerable portion of the movie's budget went into getting Kilmer and Rhames on board but it did little to help the quality of the film. In fact I'd say either man likely gave the worst performance of his professional career. But what do you expect with Carraway's horrible writing and seeming inability to properly give his actors something to do in a scene other than stand looking at one another in wooden lifeless poses. I love how he escalates the action only to bring it back down again in this sort of anticlimactic sine wave that rolls irritatingly along throughout the movie. One minute they're yelling at Jack convinced he's out to get them and the next everyone's just walking around the house again having poorly written conversations. As much as Carraway is to blame for this pile the fact that someone green lit this movie is beyond me. I know a lot of studios put out these horrible typically straighttoDVD releases to make a quick buck but seriously can't you at least try not to make them suck so completely. In short this is movie is an absolute insult to all struggling writers and filmmakers looking for their big breaks.

In short this is movie is an absolute insult to all struggling writers and filmmakers looking for their big breaks. They work hard everyday to create compelling innovative new stories and you let THIS guy make a movie?";

Good try Luke too bad about your costars.The sound was outrageously mixed. I'm betting the sound engineer was some kid who was brought in because the mixing console was brand new and he wanted to learn how to use it and was given six hours to put the whole thing together.I loved how the writer telegraphed every scary scene in the movie so well that it was impossible for you to not realize that you were shortly going to be shocked. Problem with that is that it kind of minimizes the shock value when you're sitting there saying Oh here's a scene with a mirror that means we're going to have a ghost appear shortly....then you do a countdown from 20 and VOILA....ghost appearing in the mirror behind the actor or actress.The overall plot had a kernel of a good idea but it required a good writer to grow that little kernel into a full blown food producing plant.This whole thing reminded Me of a bunch of people getting together and they're all saying Oh we have to do another boring movie. Okay well if I HAVE to do it okay but I'm not wasting my time on putting any effort into it. If you have not seen this movie yet and have gotten to this review please give it a pass.

The film deals with the history of a house where in 1911 a family was murdered and that 100 years later after an accident some people get stuck in it along with a strange man who takes care of the house Rhames.Frankly speaking this is one of the worst movies in every way I've ever seen the story is very weak and is extremely clich and has many holes in the narrative which is inconsistent and without any interesting point.The footage is bad even renting a house with theoretically more than 100 years it has everything brandnew even the infrastructure of a new home with nothing of dust or cobwebs even in places that would be less care of.Otherwise besides a gas station and a forest well cared for that matter has no other locations. Special effects in just a few seconds in the final minutes and even they were poorly made.The actions and roles are some of the worst I've ever seen the best of all in a regular performance is Vig Rhames and Val Kilmer who I no longer consider a good actor is terrible with a brief paper and without a definite personality from a rude guy to a mentally ill one from nothing. The others actors  characters are meaningless and horrible.The music and sound effects are adequate nothing more.In total is a poor film not even a class B one a total loss of 1 and a half hour of my life... this is really a movie that should stay 7 feet below the ground. My score 2.0  10.0.".

Frustratingly vague in details and full of plot holes this reasonable cast of decent actors also including a slumming Val Kilmer is tedious beyond belief. Every attempt to get scares and jumps from the audience fails miserably. The huge storm that drives them to the house in the first place turns out to be a little bit of rain. If any of the characters would think logically for even 60 seconds in this film it would be over.

We have a couple of name actors in the film such as Val Kilmer Ving Rhames and Luke Goss. But these actors cannot bring a dull script to life let alone some 100 plus year old corpses who were murdered more than a century ago. The plot is about a family of four that is murdered by the young son and how Ving Rhames fits in to the picture is just plain dumb. I won't spoil the so called plot for you but to suffice to say by the end of the movie if you get that far you will be scratching your head and asking yourself Really? Come On!The score I found irritating and the constantly dark sequences and thunder and rain outside is monotonous after the first half hour. The only good thing I can say that caught my attention was the artwork on the DVD cover. I gave it a 2 out of 10. Viewer beware this film may put you to sleep.".

	schema:reviewBody "I think to gain a full appreciation of Don't Come Knocking it will help to be familiar with the work of Pulitzer and multiple Obie winning Sam Shepard who contributes the screenplay for this movie. I've read reviews all over the internet complaining that the film lacks in terms of realism but this complaint seems illconceived if aimed at Shepard who has generally operated artistically by exploring mythical tableaux as in plays The Horse Dreamer Fool for Love etc. It serves to recall that Paris Texas explored an ideal of the mythical West in which main characters wonder the desert chain their wife to a boiler before lighting the trailer on fire ie don't always act rationally.Having arrived with the caveat that this film is a fable not a traditional American here's the main conflict here's the resolution Hollywood special Don't Come Knocking is really an amazing example of film as art something attempted all too rarely. Shepard also stars in the film as Howard Spence an actor known for roles in Westerns. It is this idea of the man as a Cowboy constantly wandering living hard unattached that has become Howard so completely that he loses all bearings and feels he must escape from his movie set and find something.Contacting his mother whom he has not seen in some 30 years he begins to see himself through her eyes as someone who appears regularly in tabloids for a myriad of irresponsible behaviors someone who uses others and is completely unconnected to anyone. His mother informs him that he has a child by a woman in Wyoming and ducking the law and a film insurance exec played brilliantly by Tim Roth Howard sets off to find his child. In the world of Shepard the fatherson relationship often centers on abandonment and is often central to the conflicts in his stories. So it is in DCK in which an outraged son rampages through his small town wrestling with his own origins and upsetting his mother played with predictable brilliance by Jessica Lange.The beautiful cinematography and precise dialog are truly built for each other and this movie continues to realize Wender's vision of the open American West. If the story lines seem implausible try to look just beneath the surface at what is going on. Shepard discovers he has two children the other a young woman named Skye who has come to Butte to spread her mother's ashes. Skye embodies the female voice a rarity in the work of Shepard. Skye is centered and desires a relationship. She asks her both her halfbrother Earl as well as Howard Do you want to be related? This story is about discovering the desire for human relationship and family a necessity for buttressing against the harsh realities broken boxcars junked autos litter the landscape of the West as well as the preposterous unrealities propagated by Hollywood myths of perfect love and sunset happiness.In an interview Shepard once said that it is the aloneness that fascinates him about human relationships as explored in A Fool For Love where estranged lovers meet again to love fight violently and leave again. In Don't Come Knocking Shepard seems to leave us with more hope of overcoming our own contradictory natures to create relationships with those we love.The film offers great appeal in its images of mirror disco casinos open road and its costumes. The western costume the waitress Lange as eventempered caretaker to the coffeedrinking old men and internet surfing youths alike the businessman Tim Roth in his Porsche Cayenne insisting that the outside world not be let in the modern cowboy Howard throws away his credit cards and cellphone but keeps his sunglasses which allow him to maintain his distance from all real relationships.Go see this movie laugh at the ridiculous nature of some scenes the humor is intentional as when exercise bike riders watch Earl's mother's conflicted confrontation with Howard and very funny. The film is not perfect but is layered and complex presenting deep conflicts such as the feminine versus the masculine will the authentic America versus the Hollywood version the destructive nature of art and creation etc. Don't Come Knocking is rich and richly achieved and if you approach it with an open mind I think you'll enjoy it. I really did.".

	onyx:emotionText "I think to gain a full appreciation of Don't Come Knocking it will help to be familiar with the work of Pulitzer and multiple Obie winning Sam Shepard who contributes the screenplay for this movie. I've read reviews all over the internet complaining that the film lacks in terms of realism but this complaint seems illconceived if aimed at Shepard who has generally operated artistically by exploring mythical tableaux as in plays The Horse Dreamer Fool for Love etc. It serves to recall that Paris Texas explored an ideal of the mythical West in which main characters wonder the desert chain their wife to a boiler before lighting the trailer on fire ie don't always act rationally.Having arrived with the caveat that this film is a fable not a traditional American here's the main conflict here's the resolution Hollywood special Don't Come Knocking is really an amazing example of film as art something attempted all too rarely.

Without question Don't Come Knocking immediately jumps into the same class as those two extraordinary films. Collaborating with the insanely talented writer Sam Shepard for the first time since Paris Texas Wenders offers up a character study that many of us have more in common with than we might first imagine.With a rare appearance in a film he has written Mr. Shepard plays Howard Spence a washed up western film star who hits the road in search of the life he somehow missed. Admittedly when the film opens with Howard galloping off into the desert away from the film set my stomach began to churn as I had flashbacks to Electric Horseman. Not long afterward I became mesmerized by the pain of this man seeking redemption and meaning. Sure there will be comparisons to Broken Flowers and many other meaning of life films but writer Shepard never once pretends to be writing the great American self realization story. This is a VERY simple story about a handful of VERY interesting characters.Jessica Lange Shepard's real life honey plays his long ago nearly forgotten love who has never wandered from her small town Montana roots. What Shepard learns after visiting with his mother Eva Marie Saint for the first time in 30 years is that Lange has raised Shepard's son Gabriel Mann. The focus drastically shifts for Shepard as he tries to make sense of it all. Just to add to his misery Shepard is stalked by Sarah Polley carrying her mom's remains in an urn who suspects she is his daughter.The genius of the film lies in the characters and setting. We never feel we are observing. Instead we are part of the story. Winders camera angles really capture the thought cycles of Shepard in the motel room at the bar and on the sofa in the road. Watching this wouldbe dad and these mightbe kids come to terms with all of this is on one hand slyly funny but mostly intensely painful and intimate.Spectacular performances by Shepard Lange and Eva Marie Saint as well as strong support from Tim Roth Polley Mann and even the great George Kennedy make the story unfold in our reality. Wenders terrific camera work and small town setting with stunning panoramic views keep us comfortable yet very aware. The pulsing guitar of the seemingly everywhere T Bone Burnett drives our pulse up or down depending on the scene.This is marvelous filmmaking and pure joy for film lovers. At the post screening QA Mr. Wenders expressed his enthusiasm for working with Mr. Shepard and creating a masterpiece out of a seemingly little story. We as movie goers are the lucky ones.".

	schema:reviewBody "Wim Wenders' makes extraordinary movies about ordinary people. Whether the inhabitants are important personalities or 'little people' they are always especial because of their humanity.When I did an internet movie quiz that supposedly answered the question If someone made a movie about your life who would direct it? I kinda hoped it would be Wenders. His characters are tiny flecks on a vast landscape made infinitely interesting by fine observation and untiring attention. Each character is a mystery unravelling.In 'Don't Come Knocking' we follow the almost incomprehensible actions of a leading Hollywood actor played by Sam Shepherd who absconds from a film set in the middle of the American desert. He is struggling to escape a lifelong persona of drink drugs and women but doesn't know what he is looking for or why he feels life has passed him by. He is nudged occasionally in the right direction by his mother and followed by a mysterious young woman carrying her mother's ashes  and whose knowing smile gently holds back a reservoir of yettobeexplained emotion.Wenders can never be accused of hurrying things along. His movies can be like watching paint dry  except that when the painting is finally ready to touch we may feel a masterpiece has just crystallized before our eyes. This is perhaps one of those occasions. Tim Roth as the inscrutable bond man tracking down the wayward actor is barely recognisable till half way through the film so perfect is the characterisation. Sarah Polley as the mysterious Sky can almost make us burst into tears before we have any idea why or of the secret she is holding. Shepherd plays Howard Spence with biopiclike conviction. Add a score by TBone Burnett that seems to suspend time in the desert with guitar chords that hang in the air and framed scene upon scene that looks like a classic movie poster waiting to be discovered.Don't Come Knocking is like one big Do Not Disturb sign on the things we most need to know and that noone wants to tell us. It's why they're secret  and why we also have to know. The film takes a very long time to answer it's own puzzle but if you can stand the pace the result is ultimately worth it.".

Wenders joins forces with playwrightactor Sam Shepard and the result is a wonderful journey in Wenders' best style of a man who flees his life to search for himself. Howard is an overthehill western movie star who's had his share of sex booze and arrests in the past. He never settled down and prefers the lush life. Until one day he decides to flee a movie set apparently for no reason apart from an existential crisis. He searches for anonymity in his small home town visiting his mother for the first time in 30 years and discovers he might have had a child with one of his ontheroad conquests. This realization sends the middleaged man on a search which confronts him with his own past the way he has lived his life and what he could have done with it had he decided to live it another way. But don't expect a morality tale Wenders and Shepard are too intelligent for that. True to his instincts Howard will persist in his erratic behavior till the very end. In short in an age of comic book movies Don't Come Knocking holds you onto your seat with a story that lets us breathe a bit of humanity. Wonderful performances with kudos to Jessica Lange maybe in her best performance ever. And we still get a homage to John Ford with images of Monument Valley and the large expenses of the West. Truly a gem of a movie!".

	schema:reviewBody "I really wanted to like Don't Come Knocking. It's a contemporary Western by famed German director Wim Wenders written by PulitzerPrize winner and stud actor Sam Sheppard and including in the cast Sam's main squeeze and my first crush Jessica Lange. With these credentials I would have bet that Don't Come Knocking would have been in my Top 5 at Sundance this year.Not even close.Here's my 1 criterion for judging a movie Did I care about the characters? Love 'em or hate 'em either one is OK they just have to mean enough to me to care about what happens to them. And unfortunately I didn't care two hoots about Howard Spence Sheppard the washedup Western actor who tries to escape his past of hard living and general selfishness. I didn't even care about Doreen Lange a former girlfriend from a movie shot in Butte Montana. And I certainly didn't care about Earl Gabriel Mann Doreen's son no matter how overthetop obnoxious his behavior. Maybe I did care for Sky the Butte native played by the remarkable Sarah Polley who was clearly the most likable and the only truly compelling character in the movie. And Tim Roth's portrayal of the studio bond man was interesting at least.But beyond character development this movie just didn't have any direction suffering from the thinnest of story lines and a pace that often needed a quick kick from Howard Spence's spurs. It does feature some interesting locations and beautiful southern Utah landscapes. But that's not why we go to movies.Wenders and Sheppard go back to their collaboration on Paris Texas in 1984 and they spoke very fondly of each other during the QA. They collaborated on the story over a period of years and have looked for a chance to work together again. I wish they would have produced something better.Interesting Tidbit from the QA Sheppard's son Jesse is an expert horseman and did his father's riding stunts for the movie. Sam Sheppard also rides well but his contract limited his riding to a trot.Second Interesting Tidbit Wenders has wanted to shoot a film in Butte for twenty years since his first visit there and was concerned that someone else would film there before him.".

This time he also stars in the film as a cowboy movie star on the search for his ex and his son who he never met. The landscapes reflect the ghostliness of an Edward Hopper painting. Few people exist in the town where he shows up. There are beautiful shots that are very memorable such as the view from the health club looking out the window where Shepard and Jessica Lange are fighting. Another great scene involves a trade in identity where a guy on a horse gets pulled over by a cop and ....well you'll see.

It's all about the emotions and the amazing pictures.Sam Shepard portrays his role so wonderfully that you can sense his frustration with his life and his search for some meaning and his longing to change his ways.Eva Marie Saint is equally adept at her portrayal of the old western actor's mom. Jessica Lange though is truly outstanding. She steals the movie with one scene in particular and really deserves an award for her work in this film.At the end of the day this is Wim Wenders as we know him and as we like him best.".

It's all about the emotions and the amazing pictures.Sam Shepard portrays his role so wonderfully that you can sense his frustration with his life and his search for some meaning and his longing to change his ways.Eva Marie Saint is equally adept at her portrayal of the old western actor's mom. Jessica Lange though is truly outstanding. She steals the movie with one scene in particular and really deserves an award for her work in this film.At the end of the day this is Wim Wenders as we know him and as we like him best.";

Wender's beautiful slow moving style to unfold the story lets you follow and feel what's going on within the hero and the people he encounters. The marvelous scenery of the West is shot to remind you of some scenes of Thelma and Louise. The music blends in wonderfully. The interactions are almost every time worked out in every detail and dialogs sound so real you can imagine this to happen in your neighborhood. Last not least all of it is played by an outstanding group of actors making it very hard to decide who'd be your favorite which adds to complete the reason why this movie is excellent to me.Funny scenes laughter and deep emotions  if you're a lover of fastfood movies  don't go.

	schema:reviewBody "Don't Come Knocking 2005A disappointing attempt at gritty Western aura movie insider savvy and creative parallel plotting and editing. It has elements of camp of postmodern drama references to earlier movies or movie types and even some genuine sincerity.There is a terrific George Kennedy who is still active and very much making movies with his oversized persona. There are smaller roles by several women including a wan and frankly dull if pretty Sarah Polley. And mostly there is Sam Shepard being Sam Shepard which is pretty good stuff. But he plays a famous actor who walks off a cheesy movie shoot into reality and for the rest of the movie is walking as if in a dream through a reality he never quite knew existed.I think this looked great on paper. At least until someone read the script. It just doesn't hold water partly for the simple fact that we couldn't care less about most of these folk. In particular the movie makers the directors and execs are playing meaningless roles that might mean something to insiders but to the rest of us I'm not an insider thankfully it's selfindulgent and well boring.What works best? Well since the story pushes you out you look at the performances straight up and some like Shepard's are strong he reminds me of Woody Harrelson in this film for some reason. There's the music by TBone Burnett an often used electric guitar sound with a country twang that is appealing and sometimes even evocative. And there is the filming which is unadorned and very nice depending on some amazing scenes and the light and color in them. If there is ever an Oscar for scouting for period sets that hype up the truth of a certain period this is a good candidate. Certainly the light is romantically appealing.But I'm stretching to see the best in a plodding film that had potential and lost its velocity very early on. It has to be added that the director Wim Wenders has done some amazing work and has his own following. But he might be trying to cash in on Paris Texas which has its own small cult following and which at least has a quirky and disturbing element to it. Here it is mostly a matter of wandering in the modern wilderness and Wenders I really believe is not quite in touch with what makes America America. It feels cold and superficial. See his Wings of Desire for a masterpiece. Here? Have patience. Oh...and enjoy the scenery!".

But in my opinion the most difficult thing to overlook is the complete detachment from reality that this movie operates with. Are we supposed to believe that people really act this way? For example would people really react to their reunion with their long lost father with overthetop anger? Or with complete placidity?

The Sutter character is not fleshed out and his comic moments as when ordering in the diner fall flat and seem out of place. Dialogue overall is tepid never sparkles not a single line can be remembered. Two speeches stand out a little Doreen's finally giving Howard the lowdown on his behavior and Sky's speech at the very end but it is all too little. Ending Howard back to his Bpicture and his kids happily singing in his car suggests some sort of resolution but does not fit to what went before at all and consequently feels tacked on. Wender's love for Americana results in some beautiful shots of scenery but this has been done before and after all this is not a documentary. Best performance is by Lange weakest by Mann but he is given the most commonplace dialog and behavior of all characters. I pity in particular the actress who played Earl's girlfriend she was given such a clich character airheaded groupie and yet she makes the best of it and is the only one to exude any warmth.

Unfortunately we the audience are taken along on his mundane quest to nowhere. Solid production quality does nothing to help this humorless dreary odyssey. The acting is good but the drama is forced and the lines are often downright silly. Tim Roth's performance as the eccentric bounty hunter sent to retrieve the AWOL actor is simply weird even by his standards. I was unable to care about any character in the movie  not a single one! In the end I was hoping an asteroid would suddenly appear and strike Butte Montana killing all the characters there. That would have be the best way to end this pretentious movie.".

He is Howard Spence an aging actor with his best years far behind who wants to run away of the life he is living searching for something of which he doesn't know what it could be. Having played roles for his whole life he forgot who he himself really is. His search which is at the same time a flight from a private detective who has to bring him back to the film set turns out as a search for a home a place where he belongs for relationships. This time he fails as he is caught up by the life of duty and schedules in the person of the detective but he learned that there is something else... He found a family a son to whom he might be a most needed example in the very last moment. A Mustsee".

	schema:reviewBody "There aren't many ways to be a screenwriter ways of delivering a story. There are fewer than the playwright has though the stories can have more variety and structure. Sam Shepard crossed that line a long time ago. He was lucky at first because he found a sweet spot where the limits of the portal between the two could have such restrictions that he could write about those restrictions and have them convey as some sort of existential clarity. Since then he's been more active as a player than a playwright. But in this he's less an actor than what used to be called a character actor meaning there's one type that he is famous for playing and he just gets plugged in wherever that character is required.It must be extremely depressing to be so limited in your art and know it. The knowing is the hard part and I suppose its easy to see it as a life wasted. So what does someone in this position do? He writes about it. What else is there?So we have a story about an aging character actor who breaks away from acting. He just cannot stand it any more. So he reaches out the family he knows his mom. And from that he learns of another family and then a family beyond that. His reallife wife is an actress of some range and ability someone less intelligent and perhaps as a result more committed and successful. She plays the old short lived girlfriend he got pregnant during a shoot. Her character though she is a waitress is someone successfully in the world and able to cope with loneliness. Sarah Polley is a writer actress director who I think has enormous talent which is a shorthand way of saying that she limits the art rather than the other way around that Shepard has. She plays a third layer of family a sort of calm anchor a sort of token of the other extreme from Shepard's character.That's it. That's the structure of this thing. All else are episode that set the fences and paddocks. Its pretty darned effective if you know what it is and touching.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

Don't come knocking is a lot more American in its nature but does an excellent job at making a European movie in America. Its great to see how Sam Shepard and Jessica Lange cooperate you can easily see that the love between them is real  not just on the screen. Sarah Polley has an excellent performance as well.".

He is leaving a movie shoot filled with creature comfort sex and all the drugs he can use. In his first act of atonement or is it castration? he gave up his horse boots and even his spurs. Then he walked in his socks out into the desert.Surely a man suffering a midtolate life crisis should deserve some sympathy? But Sam Shepard who cowrote the script didn't cut him any slack. In fact he had done such a good job playing this character it is strange he wasn't even considered for an Oscar.So he went for a little walkabout in the wilderness. Did he have any vision? From the back of a bus he saw a man in an electric blue suit wandering along the highway carrying a set of golf clubs.He decided to go home to mum except for a little inconvenience of not having even called his mother for the last 30 years. In another piece of excellent casting we see Eva Marie Saint as the forgiving mother. Of course this is a Wim Wenders movie and mum isn't always as sweet as apple pie.Now in the sanctuary of his mother's home our cowboy looked back at the follies of his life. The director arranged this in the form of a scrapbook of tabloid's clippings. We are left wondering like the hero on what is true and what is not.But the ranch he had known as a boy is no more. Instead his hometown had been turned into a frontier casino. He didn't even recognize someone who claimed to be his high school classmate. Disillusioned our hero fell again. In his movie he would have ridden off or die in a hail of bullets Just Like Jesse James. But he was ignominiously arrested and sent home like an errant teenager.In the midst of sorting out what left of his life his mother let on that he may have had a son out of a movie set fling. Off he went in search.And hot on his heel is a bondsman who had underwritten the movie. The Hollywood template would be a tough muscle man in an action packed chase. Nope we have Tim Roth in yet another brilliant performance. Just like our hero our bondsman is a loner. While he may be comfortable in his own cocoon filling out crossword puzzles he does make feeble attempt to connect. He just yelled out loud into the desert asking if anybody is out there.Into the last third we have all the players coming in for the showdown.Kiss and make up? Got two. One in front of a gym with guys on their exercise bikes looking on. The other a hilarious swipe at the classic screen finale.Gunplay? Yeah a single shot. In a scene that starts off with a wonderful time lapsed photography of a car in a deserted parking lot the usual cowboy  Indian drama is inverted onto its head.Don't watch this movie if you can't afford to have it haunting you. It is like a Zen koan it will just keep buzzing around your brain. Don't believe me I'm writing this at 5 in the morning.".

	schema:reviewBody "Writeractor Sam Shepard plays Howard Spence an aging out of fashion and out of control Hollywood star who finally begins to come to terms with life in this well written wonderfully acted beautifully shot marvelously scored sad and poignant film.Howard stars primarily in Westerns and as Don't Come Knocking begins he's on location in Southeastern Utah. Or rather he's supposed to be on location. No one on the set can find him and he's due for a shoot. His trailer is a mess full of party smoke and mysterious scantily clad women but Howard is nowhere to be found. That's because he's taken a horse and ridden off into the hills near Monument Valley. We don't know exactly why he's decided to take off and it quickly becomes apparent that neither does Howard. He takes a number of steps to make himself difficult to find such as trading clothes with an old ranch hand played by beloved character actor James Gammon. And those are smart moves because shortly after a representative from the film's completion bond company arrives to check up on him due to his notorious irresponsible behavior and when they discover that Howard is gone they're after him effectively like bounty hunters tracking down a criminal.Don't Come Knocking is maybe not recommendable to everyone. The pacing is relatively slow. The backstory and plot are told very gradually and mostly indirectlythe viewer has to infer or deduce much of it. But the pacing is appropriately melancholy and backstory and plot are cleverly constructed so that the viewer is taken on a parallel journey with Howardin the beginning Howard is wandering out of his previous life aimlesslyhe's not sure where he's going or why he's going there and as he progresses he must piece together his authentic life in the existential sense from unexpected disparate clues.Thematically this is a film about personal and interpersonal identity especially coming to terms with identity that has been not only deferred but effectively denied for many years. This is true for all five major characters Howard Doreen Jessica Lange Earl Gabriel Mann Sky Sarah Polley and Howard's Mother Eva Marie Saint. Howard has the most work to do on this end of course and he's the one who has taken the most blatant steps to defer and deny coming to terms with himself while Howard's Mother maybe has the least amount of work to do but she does still have work to donotice for example that she doesn't recognize Howard when she first sees him and notice that despite the fact that Howard is a movie star who was important enough to be regularly covered by the tabloids many characters who matter to the story do not recognize him from his film work. One minor but thematically significant character from the past who does immediately recognize Howard an old schoolmate Cliff Ormsby Tom Farrell is immediately denied and rudely dismissed by Howard because at that point early in the film he's still not completely ready to come to terms with himself and his past.On a technical level everything about Don't Come Knocking is exceptional including Wim Wenders' direction. I was especially fond of the locations and the fantastic cinematography as I've long been in love with the Western United States. This is a relatively little known film that gradually snuck its way around a small number of arthouse theaters for many months throughout the spring and summer of 2006. Even if you don't think it's a masterpiece exactly it deserves to be seen and it deserves some word of mouth publicity.".

I was especially fond of the locations and the fantastic cinematography as I've long been in love with the Western United States. This is a relatively little known film that gradually snuck its way around a small number of arthouse theaters for many months throughout the spring and summer of 2006. Even if you don't think it's a masterpiece exactly it deserves to be seen and it deserves some word of mouth publicity.";

The WendersShepard collaboration Paris Texas is one of my favourite movies but Don't Come Knocking doesn't come close. I love the west and found Butte Montana where much of the story takes place fascinating and beautiful when I visited last year. I was amused by recognising the locations but the film failed to engage me. It did have its moments but overall lacked atmosphere and the characters were either unbelievable or unlikeable. Sarah Polley stood out and Sam Shepard and Jessica Lange were OK. I didn't like Gabriel Mann's performance at all. It's strange to say it but this seemed like it was made by a someone who doesn't know how to direct.".

I particularly liked the song Don't touch my plums and especially when Goldie sings it to the Mormon family. Goldie Hawn is at her finest and suits the role she is playing.

It's a cross between classic Hollywood and the then more contemporary comedy stylings that were coming into vogue in the late 60s and 70s. That is to say the humor is blue and less suggestive than it is explicit yet at the same time very smart. And perhaps because of this the film's tone is probably a little misunderstood.Even though the film was shot widescreen there's a definite TV budget feel about it. There's more coverage than can be expected from a made for TV film but the shots themselves are typically those used in nontheatrical productions giving the film a kind of uneven feel.For what the film is the humor is pretty sophisticated which I think has some of the other commentators specifically those who gave negative reviews a bit confused. For a comedy that opens with a dance hall scene laden with sexual innuendo one might not expect the gags to be as sophisticated as they are. A viewer might get the impression that the humor will be blue but not just blue but explicitly blue. But that's not the case here. The humor though suggestive and occasionally profane is actually pretty smart and on that score is actually quite funny. Now if you can accept all that and like your humor with lots of wit then this film should entertain. In short the humor is smarter than one would expect. You have to approach watching this film with kind of mindset to really enjoy it  If I had one gripe with the film it'd be the ending. As climatic as it was it felt a little flat and open ended. It's also a bit implausible even for a comedy but a film like this really needs a happy ending... of sorts. On that score the ending should've been a little more plausible but it is what it is.If you like your films smart then try not to be too swayed by the negative comments and give the film a chance by renting it once. It's not a film that has a lot of big sightgags but there's enough here that should entertain.Enjoy ".

Every shot is misfired. Nuthin' but rotten eggs. And it all seems thrown together... The result is a film that's just a horrible bore. Just when you think it won't get worse there is a love scene in a boat going down a river during which the most vomitably maudlin of movie songs kicks in Lemon Drops Lollipops and Sunbeams I kid you not about that title. And if the title isn't cloying enough you should only HEAR how sickly sweet this tune is! Oi Vei!!!...to add insult to injury the song reprises itself over the end credits as if sounding once in the film wasn't punishment enough for a weary audience. When you hear it again it's like a bad smell that you thought you'd escaped only to find you've run across it again...I can't give this film low enough marks. It takes mediocrity to new lows. And that's because this film isn't even the kind of bad that's fun to watch and heckle. It's Just BAD. Painfully BAD. Hawn and Segal have both proven their merit as comic talents many many times over in various funny films Hawn in Foul Play and Segal in Where's Poppa? just to name two.

	onyx:emotionText "The 'comedy' western is a bit like a situation comedy with horses and six shooters thrown in and a bit of action in case the laughs are thin on the ground.  and in this movie the laughs and the thrills are as thin on the ground as grass in a desert.George Segal tries hard in the 'lovable rogue' lead  a sort of bargain basement 'Maverick' but he is undercut by a poor script and the millstone of Goldie Hawn  who does little beyond flash her red undies at the camera at every opportunity as if this might distract the viewer from the meagre contribution she makes to the movie.This is the West That Never Was beloved of peddlers of cliche and writers of cheap 1960's and 70's TV series with the intendedly humourously amoral lead duo pursued about a pretty landscape by the gang that couldn't shoot straight and sundry other less than menacing foes.Notable is the lack of 'name' supporting players any of whom might have upstaged Ms Hawn by showing comedic talent rather than legs.Rating  A sonorous 3 out of 10";

This film makes many of her other films look much better. I do not understand what about this script caused it to be made.Comedy Westerns had been a vehicle for many Hollywood stars and comedy teams since the 1940's. I understand for this reason why it was made. What I don't understand is why they waste Goldie Hawns Talent with a terrible script. Pee Wee's Playhouse has a better script than this.One thing though Goldie was a much sexier woman when she was young than her daughter is now. The best scenes in this movie are the ones exploiting that charisma. The rest of it is a sleeper literally.".

	schema:reviewBody "Released in 1976 and directed by Melvin Frank The Duchess and the Dirtwater Fox is a WesternComedy starring Goldie Hawn the Duchess and George Segal the Dirtwater Fox. The former is actually a saloon entertainerprostitute who desperately wants to move on to better things and masquerades as a Duchess to do so while the latter is a scammergambler desperately trying to steal  retain 40000. The two reluctantly teamup while being chased by various people including outlaws police and a group of Mormons. Then without warning romantic sparks start to fly.A lot of people have mixed feelings about this flick but I've always felt it was one of the better comedic Westerns. Goldie was 30 during filming and Segal was 41 and they both shine as the protagonists. Some critics complain that they're lowlifes and therefore it's hard to care about them but it's clear that the Duchess is willing to risk it all to escape the life of a prostitute. As for the Fox yes he's a greedy gambler but he has a likable charisma and an unshakable faith in overcoming no matter the odds. Hopefully he'll repent of his swindling ways. While Goldie looks great she's too thin in my opinion and would get more beautiful and curvy with age as witnessed in 1987's Overboard. Besides the two stars highlights include the consistently amusing situations  witty dialogues especially the great pigLatin scene in the stagecoach the awesome Colorado locations an outstanding stagecoach wreck off a high cliff and Dirtwater's intelligent and funny horse Blackjack who's one of the better horsecharacters in cinema. The film runs 103 minutes and was shot entirely in Colorado the Central City region.GRADE Borderline A or B".

Goldie lets it all hang out here if you know what I mean as long as you don't touch her plums. Her eventual partner in crime for this comedic Western is George Segal putting the dirt in Dirtwater Fox as an all around con man and enterprising card shark. After helping the notorious Bloodworth gang hold up the town bank of Dirtwater he helps himself to the loot in question a forty thousand dollar stash that's at the center of this caper film.Blueberry makes the transition to the Duchess of Swansbury after grabbing a handful of Charlie Molloy's Segal loot fitting herself out with a fashionable outfit from a showroom window. For 1882 sixty five dollars seemed like an awful lot of money for a dress suit but then again it was imported so who knows? For the record she filled it out very well.The film careens it's way through assorted scenarios involving a lecherous Mormon family head and the Bloodworth's hot on the trail of their stolen money. The picture's funniest segment is probably the stagecoach conversation between Charlie and the Duchess done in a combination of pidgin English French and German in a nonsensical jumble which for all it's goofiness is easy enough to understand.The unheralded star of the picture of course is Charlie Molloy's horse Black Jack who for some reason didn't earn a cast credit for this picture unlike his predecessors Trigger and Silver. B Western movie cowboy Allan 'Rocky' Lane also rode a horse in his pictures named Black Jack and when his on screen career was over Lane became the voice of TV's talking horse Mr. Ed. However Mr. Ed and Lane's Black Jack never had a lucky number '21' emblazoned on his rump like Charlie's horse did.".

	schema:headline " A touching and beautiful conclusion to Veber's DepardieuRichard trilogy ...";
	schema:reviewBody "The Fugitives marks Francis Veber's last collaboration with the Pierre Richard  Grard Depardieu duo and the last opus of an unofficial trilogy that started with The Goat. For information the second one ComDads earned a Csar nomination for Grard Depardieu in the Best Actor category and one for Veber for Best Screenplay. The Fugitives's screenplay was also Csarnominated so was the performance of Jean Carmet for Best Supporting Actor and if not better than The Goat the film beautifully concludes the misadventures of the oddest yet most defining duos of French Comedy.Indeed the 60's had Louis de Funs and Bourvil the hottempered middleaged man and the lovable idiot the 80's would have Pierre Richard and Grard Depardieu the likable loser and the nononsense tough guy a formula that proved to be successful in the three movies. The word 'formula' is less meant to diminish Veber 's creativity than to highlight his writing talent as he builds similar plots from totally different situations and manage to make something fresh out of a usual comical material which mostly relies on the opposition between the two leads leading to some chaotic situations but it's only from Veber's chaos that something positive can finally rise.In the first two movies Depardieu and Richard were hired to look for someone who disappeared the unlucky daughter of a rich businessman the runaway son of an exyouth's love and at the end a very precious lesson about life and acceptance predominated the resolution of the plot. In The Fugitives the plot begins with a more dramatic tone. Depardieu plays Lucas an exbank robber released from jail after a fiveyear sentence and Richard is Franois Pignon an unemployed widower and the father of a 6year old little daughter pushed by circumstances to accomplish one of the most pathetic bank robberies that ever disgraced the silver screen so he can get the money to flee otherwise his sickly daughter Jeanne would be put in an orphan. There is a strange and cleverly written parallel between Lucas and Pignon one is an excriminal who wants to go straight while the other although wellintentioned becomes a criminal. Talk about a perfect timing to meet each other.Indeed the plot reveals its clever intricacy when Pignon decides to take one hostage and of course his eyes go immediately to Lucas who only came to open an account and put the money he got from selling his gold watch. Right before the robbery we see Lucas harassed by the Police Chief who counts on another arrest for his promotion but Depardieu with a remarkable talent beautifully embodies the sincerity of a man who wants to get straight and means it. So when he's chosen as the hostage aware of the confusion it will place in the Chief's mind he gently whispers can't you take another? Of course there would have been no story if Pignon followed his advice. Naturally Pignon disobeys and what comes next confirms Lucas' fears as he's forced to play the robber for his own safety. Accidentally shooting at his leg when they try to escape Pignon puts the illfated Lucas in a situation where he will have to depend on him for a while. The story takes off.Pignon sends Lucas to Jean Carmet a doctor who happens to be more competent with animals one of the film's best moments when he talks to him as if he was a dog probably lost in translation because the word for 'bullet' is the same as 'ball' However the middle act of the film strikes by a certain dryness of gags and a storyline getting more serious and more pathetic. The name 'Pignon' doesn't epitomize the idea of the lovable loser that would become a character's trademark in most Veber movies this time the film is borderline a poignant drama. But while Pignon struggles to get the papers and ask for a corrupt individual named Lahbib to help him another storyline develops in a slow but beautiful way. Lucas lies in the doctor's bed and Jeanne takes care of film she doesn't speak a word since her mother died. Lucas' contempt for Pignon is constant during the two thirds of the film but it's compensated by the growing fondness he has on Jeanne. The little girl is convincing in the role of a sad wounded heart and plays as the perfect 'third' emotional link for the duo.And it's not surprising that she would play a very pivotal role in the evolution of Lucas and Pignon's friendlier in what seems to be a farewell scene beautifully written by Francis Veber. She found a great fatherly figure in Lucas possessing whatever is lacking in his father and she can imagine having a future with both of them. Maybe the film suffers from too much emotionality that distracts from its original comedic purpose and I might agree with that except that The Fugitives totally redeems itself in the last twenty minutes. The final act of The Fugitives is on the same level of comedic genius as The Goat even better sometimes in fact it gets funnier one scene after another with a level of slapstick and comedy of situation you wouldn't have expected after such a dramatic setup. Maybe the film got too emotional at some parts but the payoff was worth it. And at least it didn't forget to be a comedy.The Fugitives is the cinematic proof that the effect a film can have on you mostly depends on the last part that's why it should be judged till the end to be properly judged and at the end it's impossible to resist to this trio this goodhearted bear this funnylooking clown and this adorable little girl. The film beautifully balance between laughs and emotion until a magnificent finale transcended by Wladimir Cosma's score one of his best while we see the duo disappearing in the landscape for the last time.".

	schema:reviewBody "There is one thing the Americans are good at taking a perfectly good French Movie and totally stuffing it up  and they change very little in it as well. This movie is the original French version of what became Three Fugitives and this movie is by far the better.What is amazing is that the two movies are almost identical right down to the scene where the robber has a stocking over his head and when he removes a pin from a grenade the stocking melts but it is done far better in the French movie than it is done in the American.Basically the movie is about a professional bank robber who is released from gaol and happens to end up in a bank that is held up and he is taken hostage. Because the police do not trust him they accuse him of robbing the bank. The third fugitive is a little girl who has not spoken since her mother died.The basic themes of this movie is about relationships and how one's actions can destroy the lives of more than one person. Here the bank robber not only upsets his life but also the life of his little girl and the recently released convict. He believes that by doing this he will help out his little girl but in the end he ends up hurting her. It is also interesting to see that the convict has a human heart what else is he going to have?. What I mean is that he acts with a cold and mean demeanor but in truth he does care for the girl and the robber who is really just stupid.This is a cute little film especially the one made in France. The little girl is just adorable and her sad demeanor does tear your heart.".

Anyway this is a great movie that brilliantly mixes drama and comedy it's about a single father who is pushed to the limits by markets law jobless but rather to find a bluesy movie we have a funny one because this poor lad is rather unlucky! It may be the last teamup between Gerard and Pierre but it may be their best because they are in symbiosis now and above all they are really tied together by the essential link of this child she is really the heart of the movie and with few words she is nearly mute every body will understand all the joy and responsibility to be a parent. At last this movie smells good the 80s when the french cinema was popular faraway of Paris and the Bobos made with limited money but real conviction so it's a high recommendation! As it's indeed a great french movie I really wonder what the American remake looks like all the more than the cast seems appropriate with Short and Nolte".

Having to go to the airport Miguel finds himself in a traffic tieup. He decides to get off the road driving over a recently planted corn field. He is not prepares to find Sonia hiding in his vehicle.Thus this frantic comedy begins. A surprise Belgian entry it is a sort of madcap comedy with shades of a roadie. Directed with style by Stephan Vuillet the film showed recently on a French international cable channel. For its sake the frantic pace of the film works wonders as it goes from one situation to the next at breathless pace. It examines the lives of immigrants to countries where work was plentiful with good standard of living. 25 Degrees in Winter was shot in 2004 therefore it does not reflect the downturn in the economic picture of Belgium or Europe for that matter.The screenplay is a collaboration by M. Vuillet Pedro Romero and Stephane Malandron. The film is worth a look to watch Jacques Gamblin in action as Miguel. He gives an inspired performance that never stops. He is equally matched by Carmen Moura playing his mother. Ms. Moura is a pleasure to watch because her performance never goes overboard. Sweet Raphaelle Molinier is seen as Laura Miguel's daughter. Sonia is played by Lithuanian actress Ingerborga Dapkunaite.".

Vuillet Pedro Romero and Stephane Malandron. The film is worth a look to watch Jacques Gamblin in action as Miguel. He gives an inspired performance that never stops. He is equally matched by Carmen Moura playing his mother. Ms. Moura is a pleasure to watch because her performance never goes overboard. Sweet Raphaelle Molinier is seen as Laura Miguel's daughter. Sonia is played by Lithuanian actress Ingerborga Dapkunaite.";

She is so natural and human. Miguel is also a likable character amplified by his mishaps and by his carefree attitude to almost everything. His kindness is also deeply touching but probably not as realistic in modern day life. The ending is rather brutal. Sometimes the truth is not the way we want it to be. The little girl Laura's state of mind is also portrayed well and her turmoil of seeing a parallel story of her own is striking. I find this film warm and brutal at the same time.".

The Ukranian girl is the most mysterious person in the movie the only reason I wanted to keep watching was because of curiosity what would happen to her.

It really wants to be a cool and dark art house movie but succeeds only in putting you to sleep unless you buy the whole idea of the screenplay.The music is quite nice but is just repeated constantly with the same numbers played in between scenes that really doesn't do anything for the story. The music is just a relief when we see everybody's sad faces and Charlotte Gainsbourgs ass and naked body. Sadly the best scenes of the movie is two scenes with girls wiggling their sexy behinds and some cool shots of a car exploding. The camerawork is fine as well but there is not much interesting material to work with here.".

There is deep disturbing feelings from Charlotte's dad Serge Gainsbourg as he played out his role it appeared to me he did not have to act at all to be in the state he acted out also seemed to me this simple viewer he took over the scene's a number of times but Charlotte being a true actress did not give in and acted as good if not better than any 15 year old I have seen to date. Get this movie by all means! That's all I have to say bout that.Purview";

While not for everyone Loss of a teardrop diamond is a change of pace and refreshing as a breath of cool evening river wind. The story begins with the character of Fisher Willow who returns to her father's Mississippi river plantation after an education in Europe. Fisher is played by Brice Dallas Howard and is as smooth as Jack Daniels in this sultry southern role. Social troubles have plagued Fisher after her father has committed a despised act toward the southern end of the community by blowing the river levee on his property. Fisher becomes rebellious and indignant to a society who blames her for her fathers sins.For reasons unknown to the audience Fisher has developed a strong attraction to Jimmy Dobyne. It seems that Jimmy's family has seen better times. Since the years his grandfather was governor of the state his family has fallen from prominence into near poverty. Jimmy's alcoholic father finds himself dependent on employment from the Willow family.It appears Fisher's Aunt Cornelia is in control of the family and demands Fisher complete her social debut. Fisher employs Jimmy to escort her to the debutante parties that her aunt Cornelia has insisted she attend. Jimmy who feels manipulated and somewhat controlled resists Fishers advances toward him. The story while somewhat tame does contains some racy scenes that center around a Halloween party where things get out of hand. These scenes would have been tricky if not impossible to film in the fifties. No doubt from experiences in his early life and probably from places like New Orleans Williams creates a mosaic of wildly contrasting characters to illustrate this story. With the lives of so many different characters coming together the sparks begin to fly toward the end of this film.".

If you are unfamiliar with Tennessee Williams then you are better off watching A Streetcar Named Desire or Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.Admittedly this is not one of Williams' best stories. The reason the film works so well is the acting and directing.I had seen Bryce Dallas Howard in a few other films but they did not prepare me for this absolutely thrilling performance. This is not just the best performance of the year but it is the best performance in the past several years. She brings the character of Fisher Willow to life the way that Vivian Leigh did for Blanche DuBois. In many ways Fisher Willow is like a young version of Blanche. Fisher is a typical Williams' heroine. She initially comes off as a selfish self centered Southern Belle but underneath she is much more fragile than anyone suspects. Bryce Dallas Howard is able to bring this out with such complexity and nuance that we can sympathize with a character that we should not care about so much. Even in her best moments she seems as though she could shatter at any moment.This performance alone is enough reason to see this film. The story follows the familiar themes covered in other Tennessee Williams stories loneliness loss of wealth fall from grace and battling interior demons. The teardrop diamond could represent the wealth and status her family once had. It is not just a 5000 jewel. It is a symbol of what her family once was and what was once the old South.Jodie Markell does an impressive job directing. Her style is old school. She knows when to let the camera linger and when to let the scenes play out. The film does not seem rushed and it never drags. The cinematography is gorgeous with burnished orange dominating the color palette. The Loss of a Teardrop Diamond may not be one of the four best movies made from a Tennessee Williams story but it is not far behind. This is mandatory viewing for any fan of Tennessee Williams.".

I do not understand the film industry's priorities that would withhold a film for two years. The film follows Tennessee Williams' screenplay very closely except for an added first scene that sets the tone for the screenplay's first scene where the underlying conflict is discussed but not shown. For most viewers this added additional scene makes the conflict more understood rather than relying on the dialog to pick it up. It is refreshing to see a Tennessee Williams film where his screenplay is used. The majority of the screenplays for the 15 classic films were written by Gore Vidal to clean them up for audiences and censors. I will not discuss a synopsis of the film's characters and action.

	schema:headline " A delightful drama";
	schema:reviewBody "Somewhere between identifiable conventionalism and unconventional realism is the emotional tone that encompasses The Loss of a Tear Drop Diamond. It is sort of contrived but not too incredible and surprisingly heart warming. Although at times it can be equally heart chilling. Either way you enjoy the feeling without loving the movie but it makes it a descent watch.We are introduced to Fisher the spoiled selfobsessed daughter of a rich plantation owner who is locally disliked. Fisher herself is not fond of the community but she attends parties whenever she can. She is is in search of a new escort so she turns to Jimmy the son of Tennessee's former governor. A poor boy who looks after his drunk father and sick mother while Fishers only concern is to make sure she looks good with a man by her side.We come two expect two things at this point One Fisher as a character will grow up and get a heart and two she and Jimmy will fall in love. By the end it does happen but not in the spectacular fashion one might expect. Indeed one good quality The Loss of a Teardrop Diamond is that it is not predictable. This is not the product of a conventional writer or a studio voice it is the product of Tennesse William's one of America's great play writes whose script for this must have been shelved for decades collecting dust before it was embraced. Now it feels fresh as ever.The movie is not so much driven by plot as much as it is by a movie stealing fiery performance from Bryce Dallas Howard. She pulls the strings of the audience as well as any good director can. We hate her when we are supposed to hate her and we love her when we are supposed to lover her. She also does a sensational job of acting with her face which brings me to another effective quality of the movie. It is beautiful rich and luscious with every shot dressed up nicely. Even the diamonds on Fisher's dress sparkle so brilliantly you might find yourself flirting with the question of whether any digital effects were used. I've certainly never seen a sunrise as golden as it does here.If there is a problem with the movie it needs a little more time to invest in characters outside of Fisher. As a romance the movie is questionable not so much because of cheap filmaking but because of a deliberate decision to keep things a bit distant. In fact The Loss of a Teardrop Diamond when all is said and done is more of a drama than a romance like William's masterpiece A Street Car Named Desire. This one has a far happier outcome than Street Car and I will be among the few to say it but I found it more agreeable. The Loss of A Tear Drop Diamond is crafted nicely with a little room for improvement but it is easily recommendable. It is strangely delightful.".

	onyx:emotionText "Somewhere between identifiable conventionalism and unconventional realism is the emotional tone that encompasses The Loss of a Tear Drop Diamond. It is sort of contrived but not too incredible and surprisingly heart warming. Although at times it can be equally heart chilling. Either way you enjoy the feeling without loving the movie but it makes it a descent watch.We are introduced to Fisher the spoiled selfobsessed daughter of a rich plantation owner who is locally disliked. Fisher herself is not fond of the community but she attends parties whenever she can. She is is in search of a new escort so she turns to Jimmy the son of Tennessee's former governor. A poor boy who looks after his drunk father and sick mother while Fishers only concern is to make sure she looks good with a man by her side.We come two expect two things at this point One Fisher as a character will grow up and get a heart and two she and Jimmy will fall in love. By the end it does happen but not in the spectacular fashion one might expect. Indeed one good quality The Loss of a Teardrop Diamond is that it is not predictable. This is not the product of a conventional writer or a studio voice it is the product of Tennesse William's one of America's great play writes whose script for this must have been shelved for decades collecting dust before it was embraced. Now it feels fresh as ever.The movie is not so much driven by plot as much as it is by a movie stealing fiery performance from Bryce Dallas Howard.

	schema:reviewBody "LOSS OF A TEARDROP DIAMOND is a film that tries hard to be significant and important and barely keeps the viewer seated until it is over. The 'screenplay' is credited to Tennessee Williams who has been dead since 1983 having been written in 1957 a year after 'Baby Doll' and while the screenplay may have been completed by Williams it has obviously been 'touched up' by someone else Williams more than likely never planned to have the work on celluloid. The cast is adequate given the material and the direction Jodie Markell is pretty shoddy. It probably would have been best to leave this 'screenplay' by one of America's greatest playwrights on the shelf. Fisher Willlow Bryce Dallas Howard is from wealth in Tennessee but her family is disliked because of a levee built by the father that ruined the hopes of farmers in the area. She is a shallow resented needy attention hungry woman unmarried and past her Southern prime having spent her 'debut years' abroad studying in Paris and being hospitalized in Zurich for mental illness. She returns home fancies the hunky Jimmy Dobyne Chris Evans who is the grandson of the exmayor of the town but who spends his time caring for this alcoholic failure of a father Will Patton and his institutionalized mentally ill mother Barbara Garrick. Not having viable social connections Fisher invites Jimmy to be her social escort buys him tuxedos and clothes to make him look like a wealthy suitor borrows the family teardrop diamond earrings from Cornelia AnnMargaret and is off to a Halloween party hosted by Julie Mamie Gummer. On the way into the party Fisher loses one of the teardrop diamonds and flies into a panic. She is summoned upstairs by the mother of Julie  Addie Ellen Burstyn  who has had multiple strokes and longs to die. Knowing that Fisher is a headstrong woman Addie convinces Fisher to 'assist' her death by handing her what amounts to be an overdose of pills. Meanwhile downstairs Jimmy has taken up with a guest of Julie's  Vinnie Jessica Collins who has a history of being a salesclerk in a drugstore thus making her not of the same echelon as the others at the party. Apparently Jimmy and Vinnie had been friends before and passion enters seemingly binding the two social misfits. But reality steps in when Fisher discovers the developments and the social rules win out. The ending is too sanguine to mention. The elements that were the recipe for Tennessee William's highly successful plays and films are repeated here but now we have no character with whom we can empathize everyone is a plagiarized caricature of Williams' popular tropes. A shame. Grady Harp".

	schema:headline " Lost but not quite found";
	schema:reviewBody "Tennessee Williams' 'The Loss of a Teardrop Diamond' is a found screenplay that he never got to put on the stage during his lifetime so when it was discovered among some papers everyone was ecstatic. This story however is far from the classics he usually wrote. The character Fisher Willow is a dbutante and an heiress but not the usual conventional ones. She speaks her mind and does as she pleases and cares little of what others think of her and this should make her lovable to the viewers but it doesn't really. There is a dark side to her not unlike the dark sides to Blanche Dubois A Streetcar Named Desire or Brick Pollitt Cat on a Hot Tin Roof from prior Tennessee Williams' plays. Her dark side is more innocent and tender but it is not fully explored or explained. The screenplay doesn't really understand her and so the audience doesn't really understand her. And we as a society tend to dislike things we cannot understand.Her love interest Jimmy Dobyne is equally as ambiguous as she is. He is poor and his father and mother are not currently fit parents or really fit to do anything. Because of this he walks about with the weight of his family burdens on his shoulders but you can't really get a read on him either. He and Fisher are more than likely kindred spirits and it is made apparent that they've interacted before the actual story begins but it is not apparent just how long or how well they know each other. Jimmy thinks Fisher Too good for him but is this just an excuse to not be with her? He doesn't seem interested in her romantically and Fisher doesn't seem to care knowing that her money can buy her anything she wants including him.Bryce Dallas Howard tackles the role with a mysticism that delves into the human psyche in a rather private way. You get the feeling that she knows the character inside and out but she won't share that information with us. Her portrayal should have been more obvious or blatant so that we could be right there with her. Chris Evans was spotty and unsure perhaps because his character was but again we are not confident that this is the reason. Tennessee Williams' lost script was not lost but put away. It is clear to me that he wasn't finished with the story or with the characters. Some revision was necessary and a goal was needed because currently the story seems to meander about unsure where it is going to take you. That's not to say that the movie isn't good. This is a great draft of a story that promises interesting and lovable characters along with a plot that is both ridiculous and relatable. It is after all the little things that we do or that happen to us that alter our lives. 'The Loss of a Teardrop Diamond' is currently no diamond but still the rough with which the diamond is made. Not a wholly unpleasant viewing. 6.510".

	schema:headline " I love Tennessee Williams and they did a good job on this film.";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a very good presentation of a very good story. I have a bit of a love hate feeling for Tennessee Williams. The emotions are so beautiful and raw and make you truly feel. But the stories are so sad and depressing. Although there is a glimmer of hope for the most part you feel like the lives of the characters suck and are going to continue to suck and that change whether hinted at or imagined by optimistic me will be hard won.Unlike other types of movie that I like the romcom thrillers or scififantasy...where all is right in the world in the end this story is much more realistic. Life gets hard even for those of us that have it good.SPOILERS I really enjoyed how she recognized that she would always find her social interactions difficult and outright believes that no one will ever love her. She is a sweet soul but is so socially inept that she puts everyone off. I can't help but draw a parallel to Bones where the socially inept Brennan is loved by everyone she works with. Makes a good TV show but not as realistic. Although perhaps Williams is a bit on the dark side. But those dark and upsetting feelings do occur and I loved how they were portrayed so beautifully by Howard. Evans did a great job as well. This is the second time I have watched this film and this time I really felt a connection to Fisher's character. I think Tennessee William's films are lovely like that so nuanced and so many levels on which you can connect depending on your own frame of mind.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's 1923 Mississippi. A blown dam upriver kills several people and causes extensive damage. Fisher Willow Bryce Dallas Howard returns to Memphis from Europe to find her father much hated for that selfish act to save his own property. She's sassy selfobsessed and has no one to take to come out to Memphis society. She decides to clean up longtime workhand Jimmy Dobyne Chris Evans to accompany her. He's a grandson to a former governor although his father Will Patton is a drunk and his mother is in an asylum. She borrows family heirloom diamond earrings from her aunt. She is ostracized at the party. Only her friend Julie Mamie Gummer invites her to a Halloween party. Fisher loses an earring on the walk up to Julie's party. Julie's cousin Vinnie Jessica Collins takes an immediate dislike to Fisher and a liking to Jimmy. Julie's aunt Miss Addie Ellen Burstyn is bedridden from her opium use in Hong Kong. Everybody is acting bad which is fine but nobody is doing it convincingly. It's a long forgotten Tennessee Williams script and I'm not sure if it shouldn't stay that way. At least this production does nothing to enhance it. I can overlook Howard's overacting because her character is overacting. On the other hand I don't get Jimmy's harsh understanding of Fisher's question. It comes out of nowhere and he overreacts out of proportion. In the end I ship Jimmy and Vinnie far more than Jimmy and Fisher. The chemistry of JimmyVinnie is already good but JimmyFisher has several bad starts. Not every Tennessee diamond is flawless but even in this rough one there are moments of beauty.".

	schema:headline " Surprisingly good. Really.";
	schema:reviewBody "It's a delightful and lovely drama with great screenplay and outstanding performances by both leading actress and actor. I enjoyed every minute of the entire movie and maybe it's been a long time a movie fully cheers me up that much. It centers around Fisher Wallow a rich heiress who has returned from abroad only to find out that her father did some bad thing that damaged a lot of people in Memphis so now she's hated all over the area. Along with her own personality that is considered quite annoying she's very sarcastic and honestthis makes it impossible for Fisher to find an escort to go with her to social events. Fisher has always had a feeling for Jimmy a poor boy whose father works for her family and mother cannot recognize her own son and is committed to an asylum. Jimmy is however not so interested in Fisher. He is actually the grandson of a governor so everyone actually knows his name and respects his grandfather. Fisher for her crush on Jimmy hires him to escort her for the season. Jimmy eventually agrees to get the money to help his parents.After two eventful parties where Fisher took Jimmy with her the two developed some drama and chemistry together. The biggest drama is around the loss of one of the teardrop diamond earrings which cost 5000 dollars each.The plot is surprisingly and pleasantly simple but with powerful acting the movie becomes very enjoyable. I've never liked Bryce Dallas Howard  not the actress herself but the characters she played in movies I saw before. In The Help or 5050 her characters are really annoying which fooled me into thinking that's the only kind of roles she does. But that only proves she's a phenomenal actress. Her performance in this movie should have received better recognition as it deserves. Chris Evans delivers a remarkable performance too. I've always known he's a lot more capable than the superhero kindof roles he's famous for but I was even more amazed by his portrayal in this movie  very refreshing and real. The accent is however pretty much of a letdown. But that doesn't make the movie any less good.".

Very final scene with a young Robert Stack and his brother is chilling. The message of this film of standing up against adversity and what you believe in is as fresh today as in 1940 when this film was released. Cast is marvelous with a toss up between Jimmy Stewart and Frank Morgan who played the wizard in Oz the year before to who steals the film. But then everyone is good in this. Robert Young plays against type as an preppy evil Nazi. Interesting note German Ambassador to US asked Louis B Mayer to think twice about releasing this movie. Thankfully he only thought once.

I had always been curious about this film having read the book when I was young  in the 1960's  and was shocked by it ! It's not a war film and it's not the war aspect that frightened me. No its the way a happily united family can become so disunited because of politics which sent shivers up my spine !! Suddenly a peaceful and harmonious situation changes dramatically and you are obliged to take sides even fighting against your own blood. It really is awesome. Acting is firstrate and image though in black and white is more than passable for the period ! I can well imagine the film to have been a very powerful piece of antiNazi propaganda ! I'm sorry to have to complain about this again but here we have yet another film which should have been out on DVD for several years but ........ there's no sign of it !Quite honestly I found this quite unnerving to watch and felt ill at ease observing the gradual breakdown within the family. It certainly isn't a film for the faint hearted and I won't go any further than mention briefly that AWFUL final scene ........!!".

The movie is ell balanced with moments of suspense romance tension brutality and levity. The most refreshing aspect is the lack of gratuitous sex and violence. I love watching a film that conveys violence love and hatred without excessive or graphic images. It's set in a university town in the German Alps along the Austrian border. It chronicles the rise of the Nazi ethic as seen through the eyes of a Professor his children and their friends. It gives raw insight into the indoctrination of Nazi youth. It is a great story of love suffering and cruelty. You will not be disappointed.".

This is a film which makes you think and makes you angry. Yes it's melodramatic but so what? It's melodrama in the best sense of the word. This is emotion serving the cause of reason casting a shining light on darkness. This is a film which still has the power to make you sweat.I'd like to address some of the specific criticisms made in the other comments. Firstly the film is set in 1933. It opens with the rise to power of Hitler and visual references to the year 1933 appear in the film The professor's paperwork in the prison for instance is dated August 29 1933. How much time passes during the film is unclear it is certainly less than a year so escaping to Austria WAS still an option.Secondly the reason the sons could be Nazis despite the Professor being Non Aryan was that they were his stepsons the children of his wife's first marriage. I'm fairly certain that the daughter and younger son DID belong to the Professor although this is not made clear.".

I'm fairly certain that the daughter and younger son DID belong to the Professor although this is not made clear.";

	schema:reviewBody "I've often thought that the best way to see The Mortal Storm is back to back with Three Comrades. Both films are about post World War I Germany both films from MGM both films have Margaret Sullavan and Robert Young in them and both directed by Frank Borzage. Three Comrades has its story take place during the Weimar Republic with the beginning of the rise of Nazism and The Mortal Storm takes place as the Nazis are solidifying their control over Germany.Both films are about how the political changes affect some very ordinary people. This film deals with the Roth family Frank Morgan and Irene Rich their children Margaret Sullavan and Gene Reynolds and Irene's sons by a first marriage William T. Orr and Robert Stack. And of course Robert Young and James Stewart who are rivals for Sullavan.The stepsons and Young are confirmed Nazis they see Hitler's rise to power as a great thing that Germany will take her place among the first rank of nations. Morgan Stewart and Sullavan are appalled by the excesses and brutality in stamping out any contrary opinions that think the Third Reich is not a good thing.It's hard to believe but before World War II Jimmy Stewart was cast in a few roles that are foreign types. Later on Stewart was the quintessential American character and the public would never have accepted him. He played nonAmericans in Seventh Heaven The Shop Around the Corner and The Mortal Storm. The last two were done to critical and commercial success. Stewart's character of Martin Breitner a farmer who wants to be a veterinarian is as idealistic and decent as the very American Jefferson Smith. Probably why the public accepted Stewart in this role.Also because the entire cast is American with the notable exception of Maria Ouspenskaya as Stewart's mother. So no foreign speech pattern stood out.Frank Morgan was usually cast at MGM as a comic befuddled buffoon. Here in The Mortal Storm he shows his great skill as a player going completely against how he was usually typed. He's a college science professor who will not teach any Nazi pseudoscience about racial superiority of the Germans. His nonAryan read Jewish name is carefully noted several times though the word 'Jew' is never used.Margaret Sullavan once again is a tragic heroine. Considering the limited amount of films she did I think Margaret Sullavan had more screen deaths per film than any other female player. She carried an aura of tragedy about her probably a carry over from her real life. She and Stewart make a pair of tender lovers just as she did in Three Comrades with Robert Taylor. Their life and happiness together are sacrificed by a brutal political regime.Note the performances of Ward Bond as the local brownshirt storm trooper leader and Dan Dailey as the young local head of the Hitler youth. Good studies in the kind of people the regime attracted and who could rise to the top in that kind of society.The Mortal Storm still holds up well after over 60 years a great study in the early days of a regime that made the world suffer.".

This film was produced and released in 1940 before World War II was declared and was a very courageous undertaking considering the subject matter.

Freedom was replaced by the New Order and as most people know millions of people were murdered simply because they didn't fit the racial norms or accept the dictates of what the government said one should believeIt's 1933 and Professor Viktor Roth Frank Morgan lives with his wife 2 step sons daughter and young son in a comfortable home in a university town in the Alps. Although the word is never mentioned it is clear Professor Roth is Jewish and  his life becomes endangered when the Nazis take over. While his 2 stepsons join the party as does Fritz his daughter's fiance played by Robert Young his daughter and their old family friend Martin played by Jimmy Stewart defy the common tide and resist joining the party. And it is Jimmy Stewart who expresses it best  by saying freedom to believe as a person wants to is food and drink to him. And it turns out it's food and drink to Freya Roth played by Margaret Sullavan the young daughter to whom he is attracted. She breaks her engagement to Fritz and escapes  or tries to  with Martin. He had already fled to still free Austria while helping a Jewish school teacher escape.This movie says much about what we take for granted  the sacredness of the right to act believe speak and think as a person wishes to unencumbered by government dictates or threats. These gifts are precious and we have no idea just how precious until they are threatened. If God forbid that should ever happen it is only hoped we have the same courage as young Freya and Martin.This movie is compelling in a quiet way. There are no shoot 'em ups no gory prison or execution scenes no barbarity is shown. But it is there nevertheless and perhaps that is what makes the viewer keep watching. The only drawback is that it was written in 1940 so viewers back then don't really know the ending because the war had another 4 y ears to go and victory was by no means certain in 1940. The U.S. hadn't entered the war yet but word was leaking out as to what was really going on in Germany at the time. It's a shame more people didn't listen and that more people didn't pay attention to the message delivered in such a subtle way in this movie.".

Margaret Sullivan dying in Stewart's arms? Ultimately I saw that the castingeven Dan Dailey without taps made the tragedy even deeper.

We knew these people albeit through the movies but we felt their anguish all the more because we were watching the suffering of friends.Hannah Ahrendt wrote about the banality of evil...this film brings home the point.";

	schema:reviewBody "A family is divided by two sons' belief in the new Germany in The Mortal Storm a 1940 film set at the time that Hitler became Chancellor of Germany. Frank Morgan plays the Jewish though he is only referred to as nonAryan Professor Roth who has a son and a daughter Freya Margaret Sullavan with his current wife and two stepsons one of whom is the most babyfaced Robert Stack you could ever imagine. The two boys along with Frey's boyfriend Fritz Robert Young have embraced the New Germany and follow its dictates. This causes Freya to reject Fritz and turn to friend Martin Breitner James Stewart who rejects the party and has always been secretly in love with Freya. When Martin helps a teacher being pursued by the Nazis get to Austria Martin himself becomes a man pursued.This is an excellent film but first a word about accents. Here we go. I have read several comments that no one attempted an accent except of course those who already had one like Maria Ouspenskaya and this always makes it confusing for the viewer. HOWEVER the acting rule is this When a play or movie is set in a country where English is not the first language obviously the people in that country ARE NOT SPEAKING English. In this case they are speaking German not English with a German ACCENT. Therefore one does NOT use an accent. This is true for Chekhov Ibsen whomever. So the fact that James Stewart didn't even attempt an accent is because he shouldn't have had one nor should Margaret Sullivan Robert Young Frank Morgan.The movie is poignant and suspenseful with marvelous performances by this top cast particularly from Stewart Morgan and Sullavan. Sullavan a consummate stage performer until her suicide is underrated as a film actress but always gave excellent performances. In fact her screen test for Rebecca is one of the finest seen on the documentary about the search for a Mrs. DeWinter.Some interesting features  first of all I didn't actually recognize Robert Stack secondly a very young Dan Dailey has a rare dramatic turn as a Hitler youth thirdly one questions escape to Austria except that in 1933 Austria was still available to flee to. At this time in Germany artists like Billy Wilder were escaping to Berlin as well and many left the country from there. The movie talks around the subject of Jews never referring to anyone as Jewish and it does not actually refer to the Nazi party though swastikas abound. This makes The Mortal Storm all the more fascinating.The best feature of the movie is that it's about a simple happy family who live among friends in a university town in Southern Germany and how the rise of Hitler broke that family apart and changed and ruined the lives of ordinary people. One thinks of the Franks and the families like the one characterized in The Mortal Storm with hopes and dreams and ambitions. If they were among the very fortunate those hopes dreams and ambitions were put on hold for over a decade if not they were wiped out by complete evil. Hitler hated this film. Gee I wonder why.".

	schema:reviewBody "This was certainly one of the most dramatic stirring and memorable movies I have seen and I watch A LOT of movies. It cuts deep by hitting close to home...the family subtly inferring how even strong families with great values can be divided by changing ideas in politics or even religion. Before this movie I wondered how Hitler could make everyone blindly follow him SO obsessively. What magic did Hitler have over these people? We saw MILLIONS in news clips with their arm in the air claiming HEIL sp? Hitler! After seeing this movie I understand more. Not everyone agreed with Hitler's beliefs but those who didn't were ostracized imprisoned beaten or tortured. MANY WERE FORCED TO COMPLY and immediately attacked if they didn't comply with the songs the salute or even spoke against Hitler. Europeans in the 30's didn't have the opportunity to move and get away from a dangerous environment the way we do now and people then did trust the words of leaders more and follow more blindly. It was a different age a different way of thinking and someone was brave enough to make this movie to show how deep beliefs CAN tear families apart. Hitler had influence over a lot of the people but promoted ideas such as violently cleansing the country of anyone who was different or who thought differently so those who did follow Hitler bullied those who didn't. Some stayed strong with their own values and paid with their lives others stayed strong by just faking submission knowing that soon it would pass and they would live through it. There is not as much violence or other atrocities like new movies but I would say not for the emotionally tender faint of heart. It's a story of the Germans and how they were affected no scenes of the holocaust here. Maybe because in 1940 so few people realized the horrors that were really going on or maybe the filmmaker wanted to show the effect this had on the Germans since little has been produced from that angle. If we don't study history history will repeat itself and I can easily see this situation happening again with other groups of people in the next few years. I actually feel privileged to have seen it in order to understand politics and human nature and how Nazism could have affected people in WWII.".

But things would be somewhat different and for the worst for the old guy from that day on. You see January 30 1933 also happened to be the very date that Adolph Hitler would become the Chancellor and later Fuhrer of the new and dictatorial Nazi Germany. After that momentous event things would for kind sweet and nonviolent people like Professor Roth never ever be the same again.Marching into town dozens of Nazi brownshirted stormtroopers start to make life a living hell for Prof. Roth and those who refuse or aren't exactly willing to go along with their agenda. An evil agenda of superpatriotism and hatred of those who either don't conform or aren't that crazy to go along with their weird and hairbrained ideas. Soon many Germans end up being disappeared into internment and concentration camps never to heard or seen again until their released to their next of kin for after being worked over starved and tortured burial.One of those who refuses to go along with the New Order in the new Nazi Germany is farmboy and future veterinarian Martin Brehner James Stewart who's just plain old common as well as horse sense tells him that the Nazis ideology just isn't on the level or kosher. Martin for one says that he isn't going to have anything to do with it he Nazi Party even if he has to leave the country for feeling that way. Martin didn't realize how prophetic that statement or idea was as events in the movie would later have him do just that.Old man Roth is brutally beaten up and throw into a Nazi concentration camp minus his overcoat and rubbers for the unforgivable crime of being too pacifistic in his teaching to his students that love not war is the way to go. Kept in isolation for weeks on end in a cold dark cell Roth ends up dying in captivity. Roth's grieving daughter Freya Margaret Sullivan who's also Martin's girlfriend is now determined to leave the country like Martin later did by crossing the border into friendly and nonNazi Austria. This is in 1933 five years before the 1938 German takeover of that countryWe see in the movie The Mortal Storm how a foreign and frightening ideology can infect a highly cultured and progressive country like Germany by taking over the hearts minds and souls of millions of it's people and turning them into a nation of mindless zombies virtually over night. The horrors that the Nazi regime visits on the people in that small and sleepy German village that the movie takes place in is multiplied by hundreds if not thousands likewise towns villages and cities within the next six years. Thus turning that great and highly cultured and civilized country into a mindless and ruthless Frankenstein Monster that would not be satisfied until it controlled not only it's immediate neighbors but the entire world!Martin for his part is not at all that happy in being able to flee Nazi Germany without his love Freya who's kept virtually under house arrest by the local Nazis. Martin decides to go it alone and back into Nazi Germany in order to take Freya back home with him to Austria. Later making their escape the two are ambushed by a Nazi ski patrol at the Karwendel Pass on the dangerous Alps slopes of the GermanAustrian border lead by Freya's exlover and now gongho Nazi fanatic Fritz Marberg Robert Young. Freya ends up being shot and killed by Fritz's men as she and Martin refuses to turn back into Germany.

Fritz's only excuse for his action is that he was only following orders! P.S This lame excuse for committing government crimes I was only Following Orders was to become the socalled Nuremburg Defense for Nazi as well as many other nations war criminals over the last sixty or so years since the end of WWII.

	schema:reviewBody "Excellent movie! Young Jimmy Stewart is great as always with solid performances by Robert Young Father Knows Best Marcus Welby MD and a very young Robert Stack Unsolved Mysteries and a very young Dan Dailey. Ward Bond who later appeared with Stewart in It's A Wonderful Life also appears. Also watch for Frank Morgan who played the wizard in the Wizard of Oz the previous year. I think the movie really captures the mood of the times with respect to the Nazis and the fanatical hysteria they invoked when they came to power. The movie was made in 1940 one year before the US officially entered the war against Germany. At that point Nazi power was probably at its' peak. World War II had started the year before with the invasion of Poland the Battle of Britain was raging and several western European countries had already fallen to the Nazis including Belgium the Netherlands Luxembourg France and Norway. This movie came out during those very dark days and it says a lot about the what people were thinking at that time.".

In spite of the fact it is ostensibly about the rise of Nazism in Germany it is really about intolerance  and it dramatically reveals how quickly a civilized country becomes brainwashed and murderously hateful toward those who don't step in line. What a powerful statement  and a great film as well with incredibly taut performances by James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan who were so great together in The Shop Around The Corner released the same year 1940 and a superb cast of fine actors including Frank Morgan also from The Shop Around The Corner by the way as well as The Wizard of Oz etc. a young Robert Stack and Robert Young cast unusually in the role of an evil political convert. Like all great films it operates on many levels including as a tragic romance  the consequence of a world gone mad. Saying much more will give too much away but suffice it to say this film is one that should be shown regularly and appreciated for the power of its message as well as for its many brilliant aspects. Deeply moving  and super scary for it also speaks in some way to today's political turmoil and a growing fanaticism and intolerance.".

I managed to get to the first screening in the local area and even though the audience was fairly small I still counted eleven people who walked out at various points in the movie and never came back. Now either Michael Myers slashed them up on their way to the lavatories or like me they were bored stiff by this absolute CLUNKER of a flick.The plot or what little semblance there is of one is simple yet completely ludicrous. An organisation called Dangertainment headed by the entrepreneurial Freddie Harris Busta Rhymes gets together a group of six students ! to spend the night in serial killer Michael Myers' childhood home in the hope that they will find clues as to what drove Myers to kill and kill again. Quite why 25 years on from the murders they think they will achieve anything by sending a group of teenagers into a house that in the real world would probably have long been demolished is beyond me. Surely it is the job of police psychologists to dissect the minds of serial killers anyway? The film conveniently forgets the previous five sequels with the exception of H20 this gets an irrelevant reference in the gratuitous opening scenes which serve merely as an excuse to waste Jamie Lee Curtis' talents in some customary 'running around' antics and throws us almost immediately into the environment of the house where each of the six kids are given a little handycam to strap to their heads and told to go searching for clues... You with me so far? Well that's pretty much all there is to it. Needless to say Myers himself shows up at the house about 10 minutes into the movie how? why? and decides he wants to kill everybody one by one in the style we've now become accustomed to.This paperthin tale is told so badly it's almost hard to believe what you're seeing on screen and that anyone was dumb enough to spend time and money filming it. I suppose you could almost see it like a series of noisy soundbites strung together randomly. It keeps things simplistic to the point of being nonsensical presumably to avoid confusing its target audience of dribbling inbreds. I think I could've written a better more entertaining and reasonable script myself on the back of a beermat. Nothing is ever explained or justified no matter how implausible and ridiculous things get and yet bogglingly the film still seems to take itself fairly seriously. It tries desperately to shock with a series of boring but bloody knife murders nothing we haven't seen ad nauseam in any of the previous films and innumerable 'false' scares with flashlights and toys falling out of cupboards. It's all so bythebooks and donetodeath that you'd have to have never seen a single horror film in your life to find it even remotely tense or scary.I think what bugs me the most about the film is just how terribly made it is. Even forgetting the GAPING plot holes there are loads of obvious continuity errors and a sad desperate style of direction that seems to drag every scene to the point of agony in a desperate attempt to pad out the alreadyshort running time of the film. The cast do nothing to help things  all the characters are cardboard stereotypes and the ugly plastic teens seem to be having a battle to see who can be the most skincrawlingly irritating. I think it ends up as a tie between Katee Sachoff's hyperactive squeaky airhead and Bianca Kajlich's jitterbug 'heroine' who spends the entire movie simpering and screaming loudly every time someone drops a pin. Oh for the record Busta Rhymes is absolutely ATROCIOUS in this. His entire purpose in this movie seems to be to deliver the worst examples of wisecrackbynumbers dialogue I've ever heard ie Trick or treat motherfker? and he plays his role as a cross between Eddie Murphy and Vin Diesel but without the charm or charisma of either.I'd like to say John Carpenter would be ASHAMED to see such a horrible mess made out of his characters but when you consider the maestro himself is making films almost as bad as this these days he probably couldn't give a toss so long as the money keeps rolling in. I think this fact in itself proves just how much horror movies have changed since the first Halloween was made and to its credit Halloween Resurrection would be a perfect example of an of its time product you could stick in an 'early 21st century' time capsule for future generations to balk at. It is every bit as throwaway and pointless as the culture that spawned it. It is loud crass and inyourface constantly despite having absolutely nothing to say when it gets there  it's like the movie equivalent of an annoying little brat screaming at you desperate for attention. Look at me! Look at me! I'm being noisy and irritating!... I would highly advise for your sanity's sake that you don't look since like that annoying child you'll only encourage it and I for one don't think I could cope with another sequel this bad... This film is utter garbage and I fail to think of a single way in which they could've made it any worse. A resounding 0 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "What the heck was this? Seriously Halloween H20 was a perfect ending to the Halloween franchise and so help me God if this was their final sequel this was the worst way to end it. I remember seeing this in the theater and afterwards just everyone saying how much they hated this movie. First off they have Jamie Lee Curtis all crazed looking and drugged up and then they kill her off! Oh my God! How could they?! Shame on these stupid people this is a pathetic attempt of the MTV generation trying to add technology to the Halloween series. What did the very first Halloween present to us? A killer who stalks babysitters and wanted to kill his family off nothing else that's it. Very simple why do they try to crap up the story? How could you make a Halloween movie bad? Apparently this stupid director must have been drinking or doing some illegal substance because this was just a shamed attempt at giving us a few scares.Beginning three years after the events of Halloween H20 Laurie Strode has been confined to a psychiatric care facility. The Summer Glen paramedic located the body of Michael Myers in the dining hall of Laurie's school Hillcrest Academy High School. When attempting to seemingly do away with the terror from her brother once and for all she had killed an innocent man. Unable to deal with the crime and the fear of her brother Lauire was later confined to a sanitarium. Myers had earlier attacked the paramedic and forcefully switched clothing and his mask. The paramedic was rendered a mute from a crushed larynx. On the night of October 31 1998 Myers cleverly escaped once again. When Michael finally appears Laurie lures him into a trap but before she can kill him for good he turns the tables on her. In a confrontation on the sanitarium's rooftop she reaches over to pull off his mask to make certain it is actually her brother. He suddenly grabs her and pulls her over the edge with him stabbing her deep in the back. She gives him a kiss on the lips of his mask lastly telling him I'll see you in Hell. Michael releases the knife from his sister and she falls many stories below to her death. Myers finally accomplished killing his sister a pursuit twentythree years in the making. He then makes his way back home to Haddonfield Illinois. One year later on Wednesday October 30th six college students win a competition to appear on an Internet reality show in which they are to spend Halloween night in the childhood home of Michael Myers. Their mission is to find out what led him to kill. On the actual date of October 31 the investigation is done in a style reminiscent of the MTV reality show Fear. On this night through the entrepreneurial broadcast business Dangertainment it is shot live on the internet. Of course who is going to be there to ruin it? You guessed it Big Bird Happy Halloween.This is just a stupid sequel Halloween Resurrection makes the other sequels look like masterpieces. Halloween 2 started off terrific we slumped just a little nothing major things picked up majorly with Halloween H20 so how in the heck did this movie get messed up? Because the director and writer were looking to relate to today's audience which are a bunch of ignorant teens and this was just a waste of my time and it will be a waste of yours' as well I promise you you're not missing out on anything don't watch this movie. Let's just forget about it and think that H20 was the way the Halloween franchise ended oh Michael please don't ever do this again either that or kill the director or I will! Where's my butcher knife? Happy Halloween.110".

	schema:reviewBody "They don't make 'em like that anymore friends of the horror genre often remark on their web sites in reference to killer films from the late 1970s and 1980s era. They are right.It's not just that sentiments of nostalgia have turned those films into little treasures in our memories. It's because current horror films stink. Not all of them but plenty or more anyway.Ever since Dwight H. Little last captured the right Halloween spirit and atmosphere in 1988's Halloween 4 the series deteriorated into a ridiculous messy and pathetic show. I don't care how many fans of the series curse part 3 it was a pleasant watch compared to what came after part 4. Halloween 5 was a complete prank and lacked any sense of storytelling compliments to Danielle Harris who managed to perform extremely well under the circumstances. Part 6 well let's not waste any words on that one. H20 had its moments and decent acting by Jamie Lee Curtis but a Southern California private school seemed like a poor replacement for Haddonfield. The producers dedicated it to Donald Pleasance ignoring the fact that his last name was Pleasence with an E and had been spelled correctly on all earlier installments that involved his acting. So much for Moustapha Akkad's commitment to the project!Halloween Resurrection had a nice opening scene. A 1960s home movie at the Myers house with the sounds of Johnny Angel performed by Shelley Fabares. It was cut. Of course the Akkads in their infinite wisdom must have thought why bother young people with an old song from someone they have never even heard of! Let's keep the film simple and let's take a popular hip hop artist as the lead actor.But thank God Rick Rosenthal filmed one other decent scene. It involves Jamie Lee Curtis's character hospitalized in a mental institution. This actually is quite a nice scene with the actress performing wonderfully. It provides a satisfactory and surprisingly original bridge between the events at the end of H20 and the current state of affairs in Resurrection with Laurie Strode at the end of her wits and a killer still on the loose.And after this? We might as well have left. After the promising Jamie Lee Curtis opening scene there seemed no budget and more important no inspiration left to come up with something anything. It's a bore. It's a drag. The prospect of a replica of the original Myers house showing up is a joke. We're allowed one glimpse and even on that one occasion it is very unsatisfactory a big car is parked in front and taking the view as the camera briefly glances up from a low moving position. It beats me why they even bothered rebuilding it. The interior scenes can be ignored in this sense it may have been any old house that Busta Rhymes's character Freddie Harris decided to do his online reality show in. And about these characters have they ever been this flat in ANY Halloween sequel? NO! The characters in Halloween 5 or 6 were drawn brilliantly compared to what is presented to us here! Okay I realize this is actually pretty much of an achievement. Credit to Larry Brand and Sean Hood. It's amazing. The unimpressive cast I'm not counting Curtis is highlighted by 'stars' Busta Rhymes pop artist who is kindly given the chance to act and Tyra Banks model who is kindly given the chance to act. Let's suffice by saying that in this case the actors have been given the roles they deserve.Enough said. Or... We often are told one should not apply the same criteria to a horror film as the ones that apply to drama or classics. But why on earth not? I admire more than one horror movie but that does not mean I feel I should appreciate the crappy ones by the grace of the good ones. I can see when a film is made with no heart no spirit and Resurrection is the key example of that. Furthermore if these films as we are told so often by people like Moustapha Akkad are made for entertainment read cashing in purposes only and not for quality acting complex storytelling or great photography then why why why do they so vigorously renounce that one basic goal the goal of being entertaining???".

	schema:reviewBody "Halloween Resurrection starts off on the wrong foot and it's all downhill from there. Sure they found a clever way to undo the closure of Halloween H2O and make it possible to bring Mike up to his old shenanigans unfortunately that whole segment is hasty and the rest of the movie's garbage. The what really happened explanation is just a loophole for making a movie that's neither necessary nor any good and so I present to you Halloween Resurrection.I'm not going to write any spoilers about what happens to Laurie but I think anyone who loves the original Halloween and its characters will think what they did with her in this movie is crap and only put her in here for the sake of having Laurie in it.The characters are plastic. Even by the end of the movie when you get to know all of them a little bit you don't care enough about them to want to see them escape the wrath of Mike Myers. In fact you'll probably look forward to their demise at his hands. That's how flat andor despicable these characters are. Even the lead role doesn't have much personality. She's nice and smart and decent just like Laurie was in fact but somehow she doesn't have much personality. I don't think her character was developed enough otherwise she could have made a good heroine. The rest of the characters are people you pretty much hope get killed off especially the tech lady played by Tyra Banks and most of the kids that tour the haunted house. Obnoxious people hastily made characters. And Busta Rhymes plays the typical black dude with a boisterous personality. Not a bad acting job but what a typical clich character.The technology is another factor. Another case of fusing horror with the fancy gimmick of modern technology or what was modern in 2002 anyways. Just because we have things like reality shows and phonetexting nowadays does not mean it will make a horror movie any scarier or realistic or better at all. Having people emailing and playing on their phones and all in the movie takes away from the good oldfashioned terror you get from something as simple as a lurking shadow or the gleam of a butcher knife.There's a couple of notably cool things in the movie like when Freddy dresses up like Mike Myers while Mike is there in the flesh and you see two Mikes walking one behind the other. Well that was more funny than anything. The scene with the bong was funny too. And the murder scenes are alright and in typical Mike Myers fashion but otherwise Resurrection bombs as a horror film and leaves you yet again with no closure except this time you wouldn't really want to see another sequel.".

I unfortuantely was a member of that audience as I paid money to watch HALLOWEEN RESURRECTION the 8th installment of the once classic HALLOWEEN franchise.I don't even no where to start bad cast bad acting boring death scenes not to sound wierd but why else do you go see a movie like this need I go on.If you noticed that this movie is mostly made up of celebrities it is no mistake.  This is all the movie has going for it and yet it fails in that department.  The biggest mistake a horror movie can make is when it spends most of its time setting up the big death scenes and then knocks off its characters one right after another.  That is exactly what happens in RESSURECTION.  Every character wthe exception of 2 die in a consecutive chain that takes up about 20 minutes of the movie and the other hour is spent trying to gather of what little plot exists.The horror doesn't stop there.  This HALLOWEEN installment doesn't have the style that made the first two so good.  With the exception of a somewhat unexpected opening the movie is poorly put together.Clearly an attempt to make some fast cash off a dying series HALLOWEEN RESURRECTION  hopefully is the last time Micheal Myers takes the screen. Yet I am sure there will find some way to bring back the masked killer. There always is a chance that the executives in charge of this franchise will make a good decision and hang up the white mask and throw away the knife.  HALLOWEEN RESURRECTION rates as just a 210.".

There always is a chance that the executives in charge of this franchise will make a good decision and hang up the white mask and throw away the knife.  HALLOWEEN RESURRECTION rates as just a 210.";

I don't know why this movie was even made. Michael Myers was decapitated at the end of Halloween H20. The acting was terrible. there wasn't one original death. And since Laurie Strode died at the beginning of this movie there are none of the original characters remaining other than Michael Myers himself. And there are so many things that could've been better. 1. the title would've made more sense if Laurie had succeeded in killing Michael. Then he really would've resurrected for the rest of the film. 2. They should've kept the original opening with the home video of the Myers family before Michael killed Judith. 3. They should've gotten a better cast. Even Jamie Lee Curtis was bad in this one. This movie is just plain stupid. Anyway I'll be reviewing the Friday the 13th movies next. A couple of them were actually dumber than this movie as hard as it is to believe.".

No 7th or 8th film in a series is any good the 4th 5th and 6th usually aren't neither but that's ok. Actually I had some hopes for this film walking in the theater. The original Halloween was one of the best in the genre with neverdying Michael Myers entering the bigscreen in spectacular fashion. But the second in the series was already far beyond par and the rest was pure formula haven't seen any of em though. Then came H20 20 YEARS LATER which benefited again from Jamie Lee Curtis' presence. Not a good film far from being a standout in the genre but at least it had SCREAMwriter Kevin Williamson on the credits and was actually pretty enjoyable too. So I thought well maybe this new Halloween will have some suspense too maybe some surprises I'm a sucker for surprises. But what I saw...well I'm still speechless. This film was even worse than most stupid entries in this genre.First of all we get a stupid explanation for the fact that Michael is STILL alive unbelievable if you saw the previous one. Then we get Jamie Lee Curtis in the mental hospital. What happens next might show her attitude towards the series by now. The beginning has actually nothing to do with the rest of the film it isn't even a good opening to this film unlike the SCREAMintros. Then we get to see the actual film which is pretty much like one of the characters puts it Halloween meets the Osbournes or Big Brother or the German movie DAS EXPERIMENT or whatever. You put the usual bunch of irritating highschool friends in one house put some cameras on top and let Mike umm...Michael Myers do his thing. Is it thrilling? Nope it just seems Myers is doing a routine slashing in here. There's no suspense at all just people getting killed like you knew they would. Not hard to guess that the smartest will survive. Is it funny? Yeah if you can laugh at lame dialogue and the aforementioned irritating characters. If that's your thing fine shows why all these dumbheaded highschool comedies nowadays are such a success. Oh and it's so dumbminded that you can't even stop shouting at the screen Oh come on! As if...But what could you expect from a movie that was directed by the same man that directed Halloween II? It's so formula that you cannot only predict everything from the first til the last minute but it's so bad that the lastminute surprise is even more irritating than usual. It's so obvious by now that indeed Evil never dies  that it's even boring to see these people trying to put M.M. to rest without being ultimately successful. How long will they go on with this and what's the point of making another movie like this if nothing works out in the end. I'm sure Michael must be pretty tired by now. But maybe we get a Halloween 60 years later in x years time where Michael is a geriatric patient killing off his fellow patients. Maybe that would be a thriller! As far as this one is concerned it's more of a thrill finding ways to stay awake while Michael is doing his thing than watching this bore. 110".

The Halloween series is supposed to be dark scary and extremely shocking. This entry is boring lackluster and just plain dull.spoiler And why did they have kill off Laurie Strode? She survived all of Michael's attacks shouldn't she have been given a reprive?This movie sucked tho and that is thanks to Mostapha Akkad in any interview he does he jerks his thumb at the statue of Michael that is behind him and says 'As Long As This Guy Is Around We'll make money.' Sadly the production and scripts suffer due to this. Akkad won't let Michael die...and then the films will become a joke.Rick Rosenthal was ripping off his previous halloween 2 directing days. Michael appears out of the shadows a character slipping in blood and 'Dr. Mixer' a character out of H2.... sigh  Rosenthal should stick with directing TV episodes which he's done for the past 10 years. Don't direct a bad movie.John Carpenter or Kevin Williamson has to come back and write a decent script for this series! If you want to understand what really drove Michael to kill his sister read the Halloween novel by 'Curtis Richards'.

And how can a knife like Michael's cut through someones head with just a swing? If it was Jasons knife maybe. But Michael's knife is simply a big kitchen knife. The only scene which I liked was when the Julianne Moore clone got pushed on that spike. I think that was one of the deaths I never saw before.  14So STAY AWAY from this movie.

I'd love to know where he keeps his spare masks? You'd think that when he woke up in the van he would have ripped his mask off so Laurie would know that she had the wrong guy? Oh no...And thus is the beginning of a truly terrible addition to an otherwise successful franchise. We finally get closure between Laurie and Michael right at the beginning... but after all Laurie has been through I didn't think she would be stupid enough to double check she had the right guy especially when he was stalking her with a knife anyway..Weak direction. Weak script. Weak cast. Busta Rhymes is obnoxious as Freddie Price an entrepreneur of an internet web cast called Dangertainment who selects 6 high school clichs to spend a night in Myers childhood home. OF course Myers trashes the party and offs people in a way that doesn't go with the Halloween movies. In earlier movies the violence and the gore was kept to our imagination. We would see the events leading to it the flash of a knife and then we would imagine the rest. Resurrection has blood and gore like there's no tomorrow and it felt like I was watching some tacked on slasher movie not one of the many sequels to Halloween.The Halloween movies were a rare franchise that was intelligent and always had the ability to shock and entertain. The first movie sets the standards for all of todays slasher flicks. Halloween II was slightly dodgy with its story and the pace was slow but it was entertaining. Things dipped a bit in the late 80's early 90's but by H20 new life has been breathed into the series and I thought things could only get better. How wrong I was.I almost feel ashamed for watching it all the way to the end. Saying that I will watch it again. It's Halloween after all and every movie franchise has a bad turkey Phanton Menace Freddy Vs Jason Any hellraiser movie after the third... All in all as long as your pied as a fart you wont care and will gladly cheer on Micheal as he slashes his way through 90 minutes of total torture.".

	schema:reviewBody "I fully understand all of the negative reviews but in my opinion Halloween Resurrection is in fact one of the better editions to the series. Halloween took a quick dive after the first sequel the third film in the series being nearly unrelated to the rest not that I hated it in fact I quite enjoyed it and then the fourth fifth and sixth being particularly bad films on their own right even disregarding the understandable shadow of their origin material. Halloween has always had a troubled and rocky journey as one of the big grossing horror franchises to come out of the time period along with A Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th. In my humble opinion this the eighth film in the series does what none of the others did bring a lighthearted campiness to the series. Halloween H20 the preceding sequel was inordinately well done and quite unexpected but I think that by the time you reach the 8th film in the series you're expecting little other than some laughs corniness and maybe a few new and exciting kills. This is what worked so well for Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on Elm Street but what Halloween had refused to do. All throughout the series Halloween obstinately stuck to an atmosphere of seriousness always giving us a straightforward story never being jovial or satirical until now. This movie may not be the best the characters can be quite forgettable the story line is mediocre at best and the found footage cuts are of low quality and therefore unenjoyable to see on screen. Despite all of this I think that Halloween Resurrection far surpasses much of the other trash to come from this franchise. And it has Busta Rhymes in it. By the time you reach the eighth film of a horror series what more could you realistically ask for?".

Predictably he gets to kill Michael Meyers then calls him a motherfcker for about the tenth time.  Naturally his lines are all seasoned with that charming phrase whenever possible.  The very final scene was also painfully predictable and quite dismal.  After complety trashing the Michael Meyers series these idiots have the gall to suggest a sequel.  Which washed up rap singer will they recruit for the next flop?  MM?  Another thing is that mask.  Busta must have stoled the original because Michael's mask looked terrible.

Instead she has fifteen minutes if that of amazing screen time before being offed....  It seems the only reason she showed up was to set up why Michael was still alive and their reasoning was less than satisfactory  it was asinine.  It would have been interesting if as I was led to believe her neurotic character was like Linda Hamilton in T2 escaping from the asylum to hunt down her brother...but no.  Instead we're fed a BlairWitchProjectmeetsHalloween setup complete with dizzying often annoying camerawork a lot of bad jokes titshots and an assortment of onedimensional characters who you never really care about as they're being sliced and diced by the maniac in the now more detailed William Shatner mask.  H20 should have been the end.  The previous entry was made with loving care by people who obviously had respect for the original film  and more than a typical bloody sequel they were looking for a clever way to end the series. There was a plot strong characters and a purpose.  The new incarnation follows the typical bloody sequel trend pitting the badguy against a bunch of unsuspecting kids.  Yet again tons of bloodshed ensues.  And then we're left with that typical ending standard from 80s films particularly Friday the 13th where  they leave it wide open for another sequel with the corpse's eyes opening.  Yawn.  I'm a huge horror and Halloween fan but I've already seen this movie a billion times under a billion different titles with a billion different casts.I will admit that it's not all bad though the cons far outweigh the pros. There is some clever dialogue You have nice legs when do they open? as well as an amusing oncamera bong scene.  The effects are generally good. And the guy playing Michael this time did a good job mimicking Nick Castle's mannerisms.  If this were made prior to H20 I might have liked it more. But enough's enough already!  Finally what's up with the constantly evolving mask?  Not since part 2 has it even remotely looked like it did in the original.  And by the way after wasting 8 I'D like to personally stab Curtis for being involved in this one....".

The opening sequence with Jaime Lee was fun to watch  she is great in everything she does we know that but the rest of it was truly pathetic! Sadly we no longer have Donald Pleasance who practically kept the films going. Jaime Lee is done with them. So what do we do? We cast a bunch of sorry unknowns who we don't have to pay much plus a supermodel named Tyra Banks who has only a few lines plus we put an Oscar worthy rapper NOT! in it that loves using the Fword every 2 seconds. The whole idea of using the cameras and a group of stupid drunk kids at a Halloween party watching the whole thing on a pdacomputer screen was so cheesy. And what I enjoyed about the Hallowen films up to this point was that they were cheesefree. The Blair Witch Craze is over  find something fresh guys! And the head chopping scene with the butcher knife was really ridiculous. I loved all the films up to this one. I like the direction they took with H4 and H5. H6 was OK. I hated that they cast another lame unknown in the role of Jaime Lloyd and then killed her off  another dumb idea! Danielle Harris should have been paid what she wanted. Anyway John Carpenter is probably ashamed and disgusted by what they have done with this series if he watched H8 and I'm sure Donald Pleasance is rolling over in his grave. I hope H9 will be decent but if they expect to do anything like they did in 8 I will not watch it and the series will be dead. Please let them have a decent plot and some real starpower with decent acting. Whoever came up with the idiotic ideas for this film really needs a hearty slap in the face for stupidity. Give us a break.".

We cast a bunch of sorry unknowns who we don't have to pay much plus a supermodel named Tyra Banks who has only a few lines plus we put an Oscar worthy rapper NOT! in it that loves using the Fword every 2 seconds. The whole idea of using the cameras and a group of stupid drunk kids at a Halloween party watching the whole thing on a pdacomputer screen was so cheesy. And what I enjoyed about the Hallowen films up to this point was that they were cheesefree. The Blair Witch Craze is over  find something fresh guys! And the head chopping scene with the butcher knife was really ridiculous. I loved all the films up to this one. I like the direction they took with H4 and H5. H6 was OK. I hated that they cast another lame unknown in the role of Jaime Lloyd and then killed her off  another dumb idea! Danielle Harris should have been paid what she wanted. Anyway John Carpenter is probably ashamed and disgusted by what they have done with this series if he watched H8 and I'm sure Donald Pleasance is rolling over in his grave. I hope H9 will be decent but if they expect to do anything like they did in 8 I will not watch it and the series will be dead. Please let them have a decent plot and some real starpower with decent acting. Whoever came up with the idiotic ideas for this film really needs a hearty slap in the face for stupidity. Give us a break.";

	schema:reviewBody "Halloween Resurrection is one of those movies that is hard to recommend. It has a few hits but far too many misses foul balls and walks. As a real sequel it follows H20 several years later when Laurie Strode Jamie Lee Curtis is now in a mental institution. She has gone permanently crazy. Michael Myers as to no surprise shows up to finally do her in. At this point it seems Halloween Resurrection could have stopped. Not so fast. A crazy reality television producer wants a new reality show. He has several people spend the night in the home of Michael Myers in Haddonfield Illinois. This is to the chagrin of the town as well as the resident. After all this is Michael's home. In any case the bleached William Shatner mask makes its return to takeout the unwanted guests. There are a few tense moments that give us a little scare and a little suspense. Still this is not true to the Halloween myth. Even looking at Halloween 4 5 and 6 as well as the official trilogy of 1 2 and 7 Michael Myers has a vendetta against relatives. Once they are eliminated the rage should be gone. As for this one there is no reaching out to the person trapped inside the pathological methodological madness. That is what really brings this movie down to the real slasher level. There is no depth of character the Shape offers in previous roles. Worse there is no protagonist with the relationship. We had Laurie for one set and Dr. Loomis and Jamie in the other. In other words there is no real hero. Finally just as in H20 and the remake there is no guts in release date. This movie is called Halloween. So why is it released in the summer? Apparently producers had no confidence in the king of Halloween. In any case we have finally crossed into the Friday the 13th universe where mediocrity is abound. Of course I think mediocre is generous.".
