You have a reporter like Stieg Larssons trilogy and a suspected crime to solve.The story is rather simple but engaging. What really makes this movie worthwhile is the atmosphere. I love arctic snowy isolated locations and this really excels there. The Icelandic scenery huge power plant a few shots over Reykjavik windy and snowy outdoor scenes you really feel the cold and isolation.The cinematography is great altho like mentioned already it's highly stylized with very tight color scheme of bluish cold colors. Often you see this kind of choice in cinematography to make digital video look less videolike but I read here that this was actually shot on film. There is some visible grain but it doesn't really matter the images mostly look great and it's a real pleasure to watch.I don't speak Icelandic but I felt the acting was very good and natural. There were many scenes that would've looked really dumb had they been handled differently especially in the latter half.Storywise I think it was pretty similar to other Nordic crime stories and this could easily be part of a series. One thing I wasn't quite sure about the story was the supernatural element or was it supernatural you can't really be sure but there is some mystery there that isn't explained. There were also some revelations and twists in the end that I'm not sure were really needed anymore but as a whole I really enjoyed this movie.I actually recorded this movie few months ago and watched it half way until realizing it wasn't completely recorded. It was so good I ended up watching it from beginning to end on the second go few months after just for the atmosphere.".

Although the main character Ivan represents the rebellion and insolence that was associated with the young generation of the time without any restraint there was an underlying positive quality almost a purity in him that singled him out as an authentic good person of the time.A great way to describe this masked purity would be to compare Ivan with Holden Caulfield the protagonist of J.D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye. Both characters share a certain unlikeability among their elders and the older generation of the society of which they are part but their frankness is seen as a positive directional icon to their own generation. Each dropped out of school and flops around society with either a poor job or none at all but is nevertheless seen as a lost child in a dirty world and hence pitied for their genuineness. Katia enjoyed Ivan's tactless mannerisms much like Holden's friends however few enjoyed his general apathythey felt a bond with each representation of the lost generation.The movie truly made one feel for Ivan's plightit's not that he did not care it is simply that the society of which he was part was falling apart so their expectations on his behavior did not do much. It is precisely this truth this authenticity that made Ivan and the entire movie so enjoyable to watch. Finally props to Oleg Basilashvili the actor who played Katia's father to be able to switch roles so effectively from The Autumn Marathon as Bouzikin to The Messenger Boy it almost seemed like nothing had changed it is just that time has passed between the two which further adds to the truth value of this particular film.".

He must rely on these exclusively as he transitions between childhood and adulthood.These are not the only two worlds Ivan must navigate between. He fancies Katya a professor's daughter who possesses an education and lives a life of luxury and propriety. Ivan serves as the messenger transporting ideas from Katya's world of the welltodo to his own gritty reality and viceversa. This deeper metaphor present in the film's title is impossible to miss. The clash between the worlds of the poor and the rich of children and adults proves too much to handle for Katya who disenchanted rebels against her parents at a social gathering and plays Ivan's coarse and raucous tune for the roomful of adults.Unlike his father Ivan is responsible. He cares for his mother and thinks of the future. This is manifested into the form of a young man in uniform staring with eyes full of nostalgia at the gathering of children at the end of the film as Ivan stares back pondering if he would be treated to the same fate and wondering what the future will hold. All of Russia would be similarly apprehensive of what would come of Perestroika and Glasnost. I believe Ivan is Karen Shakhnazarov's answer.".

	schema:reviewBody "I imagine that Courier holds a similar place in Russian youth culture to the role John Hughes' movies hold in American culture at the very least I hope it does. Shakhnazarov's film is recognizably set in the 1980's but it also seems to be timeless besides the idiosyncratically 80's music and this is perhaps due to the selective portrayal of Moscow. The majority of cinematic depictions of the city where famous locations are shown at a remarkable landmark to frame ratio make the city so prominent that it's hard to differentiate it from human characters. In Courier however the uniformity of Soviet dwellings and buildings make the city anonymous the only obvious references to it are in name only. This adds to the universality of the film and Ivan's experiences. While Ivan frustrates with his nonchalance and frequent lying the poetic scenes that Shakhnazarov fits in the corners belie the heart of the film as well as the inner workings of Ivan's mind. Stereotypically African warriors haunt his dreams he converses with a bust of his verymuchalive father in a mausoleum. At the end of the day Ivan comes off as scared and confused at the aftermath of his parents' divorce that overshadows his mother's and his own life. The film vacillates between a gritty saturated daily life and a surreal subconscious effortlessly. By the end the viewer finds themselves sympathizing with Ivan. It is an accessible film for all ages in any era although unfortunately my own life doesn't include break dancing to heavy synthesizers as the sun sets.".

	schema:headline " CourierA meaningful Russian film by Karen Shakhnazarov which would continue to charm audiences.";
	schema:reviewBody "It is true that Russian film Courier is more than 25 years old but its emotional as well as intellectual impact continues to be astounding. Each time a viewer sees it one is reminded of the struggles for freedom which people of the past had to undergo. It is somewhat autobiographical in nature as it depicts some events which took place in Mr.Karen Shakhnazarov's life. It was directed by him in 1987 but depicts what happened to him as a youngster two decades ago in 1967. Much of the film is based on the point of view of a non conformist upper middle class youth whose views indirectly influence his girl friend too. We also get a chance to see a huge chasm in the form of generation gap. Karen Shakhnazarov maintains the balance as he gives an honest perspective of the difficulties faced by parents while raising their children.Courier has its share of comic scenes too but not they cannot be classified as slapstick comedy scenes. The best example of this film's artistic mischievousness is reflected in a scene wherein the film's protagonist claiming some lines by the great Russian poet Pushkin as his own confidently reads them to impress an influential person. It was in 1987 that film critic Lalit Rao watched Courier for the first time on India's national television network Doordarshan.This film was part of a series of award winning foreign films which were shown rather late in night. A whole generation of cinphiles in India were formed by watching such world cinema classics.".

But if you have seen others it could still be interesting but it's hard not to compare.The story is basically a road movie cross a private cozy wedding day bonanza. There are extreme close ups chest and up with hand held cameras somewhat grainy stock so if you have an issue with that it could be a problem. The dialogue ranges from casually realistic to dramatically revealing. The story unfolds as the tension and that well foreshadowing the snow ball ending  a bit more climatic for my taste but logical. There are loads of characters and they contrast well with each other. And since this is a comedy some characters are extended a bit more than normal. However well improvised in certain respects and well conceived considering shot in 7 days.The QA indicated the cast rehearsed on the history of the characters but acted on the instance of each scene. Each had to make up an secret for the character and have to decide whether to review the secret during the shoot. While this kind of sounds intriguing it is nothing new and might be too much secret culuminating for one film ? Then again we all have secrets don't we ?".

	schema:reviewBody "Fine late Italian western starring a sympathetic almost romantic Al Cliver in a world full of racism opportunism and greed. The story goes thus Al Cliver is the member of a cavalry unit that takes out some Indians which have left the reservation  mostly women and children and the old folks the handful of Indian warriors are out hunting. Cliver's character happens to be knocked out and thus doesn't take part in the massacre. When he comes to he meets the only survivor Apache Woman. He soon loses her however to a couple of ruthless tricksters and bandits who take her away to sell her into slavery  and have their fun with her. Cliver comes back for her though and the two start getting to know each other despite the language barrier. But the Apache warriors are still around taking revenge for the extermination of their tribe...The film wants to make a point about how difficult such a love racial barrier in fact proves to be each time the couple comes across other people be they Indian or white. Also it looks at the military and its purpose in a contemptuous manner obviously attacking the insanity of racism and war. There is some pretty explicit female nudity bare breasts and bottom as well as the pubic area but it is rare and never at the center of attention  though it has a bit of an exploitative feel to it especially in the attempted rape scene. Rather the movie is focusing on the love of the two protagonists how they learn to trust and understand each other.There is little shooting and the violence apart from an ax murder is never excessively gory. Instead there is a distinctive guitar soundtrack and a beautiful title song as well as some fine cinematography of not so specular landscapes. What is maybe noteworthy The western has a 'green' look not the yellow of the desert of the southern border near Mexico we see a lot of woods and even the street of the ghosttown at the end of the movie  the only 'set'  is overgrown with grass.What is perhaps most remarkable Despite the warmth of the love story at its center the film has an austere and simple feel to it conveying a certain sense of truthfulness which manages to steer clear of becoming exploitative.".

They don't trust each other they don't understand a word of the other's language but they can only survive together. Even though Apache Woman can't resist some nudity and brutality director McRoots alias Mariuzzo is known for working with zombie expert Lucio Fulci it has a lot of subtle moments too especially when the soldier and the woman have to communicate with nods and smiles. It fortunately takes the necessary time for a few peaceful moments and thus develops the characters a bit. So more than you'd expect from the advertising and one of the better films from the end of the spaghetti western era because it successfully imported elements of the depressive American postwestern when the Django avenger pose had become obsolete. Note I have watched the Italian language print running 85 minutes. It seemed to have a few censorship cuts for violence.".

The Indians then seek revenge on the Blue soldiers accused of the attack  killing eye for an eye . In the meantime  Tommy falls in love for the beautiful Apache woman Yara Kewa who spends 90 percent of the film partially naked after rescuing her from an ominous gun smuggler and general supplies deliverer named Honest Jeremy Corrado Olmi  but  a bit later on  gruesome violence ensues .

As the duo protagonists are drawn to a community of white people who are all racists  bigots  sleazebags murderers and cutthroats .This is an exciting story with tragic results about two survivors of a cavalry attack that make their way back to an army outpost  packing some good action  nasty characters  exploitation  rampage  nudism  but lots of dull spots . Gratuitously violent late Spaghettiera Old Western hits hard on racial themes . This Apache woman has an antimilitary message and dealing with hardship on racial themes by that time  as well as excessive brutality . As the main cast  Al Cliver and Clara Hopf or Yara Kewa are attacked and will have to face off deal of risks and taking on a cutthroat weapons smuggler  prospectors  revengeful Indians and a heinous family headed by a villainous preacher until a final massacre . The confrontation amongst the cavalry and the hapless Indians is thrilling and extremely violent . As the movie's central theme is the racism that Apache woman is subjected by a band of despicable people . Una Donna Chiamata Apache or Apache Woman results to be a ripoff on Blue Soldier by Ralph Nelson with Peter Strauss and Candice Bergen  this film was based on real deeds regarding Sand Creek massacre and with remembrance about Vietnam killings . Other films about this peculiar subgenre about relationship between Indianwhite man harassed by several enemies are the followings  Scalps 1987 by Bruno Mattei with Mapi Galn  Vassili Karis  Charlie Bravo  Apache Kid 1987 by Claudio Fragasso with Sebastian Harrison  Albert Farley  Lola Forner and Cry for Me Billy 1972 by William A Graham with Cliff Potts  Maria Potts and Harry Dean Stanton . The highlights of the movie are  of course  the violent attacks  they result to be strong butcheries  real slaughters  including rape and gory scenes . The climax is really bleak and pessimistic . The tragic love between soldier and his Indian squaw is portrayed with little believability and delicacy . This soso motion picture is classified R for the cruel murders and isn't apt for little boys  neither squeamish . It displays acceptable action sequences in low budget with rousing attacks  poor scenarios and spectacular struggles . Emotive musical score in Country style  including guitar sounds and catching song played by Judy Hill . This knockoff picture was regularly directed by Giorgio Mariuzzo  though he develops an extreme exploitation violence . Mariuzzo is an usual writer in several movies as Fulci's The House by the Cemetery  The Beyond Contraband  Decameroticus and directing three films only  Orazi e Curiazi  Beautiful Like Us and this Apache woman . This is 'a must see' for actionstarved Indian Western buffs with strong graphic violence who will enjoy the action and hard themes  though being very mediocre .".

Shortterm director Giorgio Mariuzzo is best known as the guy who later wrote Fulci's famous horror films including THE BEYOND.The two characters then work their way through an embittered and hostile landscape in which every supporting character is a sleazebag or criminal of some sort. Violence and degradation are the name of the game here and I found this a surprisingly suspenseful little movie in places with the bursts of intermittent violence proving a shock to the system.

	schema:headline " Low Rent Injun Atrocity Exploitation Potboiler";
	schema:reviewBody "At some point someone should compile a survey of the 1970s Injun Atrocity subgenre of adult themed Western exploitation films. A nasty lot they can usually be traced back to the unprecedented popularity of 1970s SOLDIER BLUE. Which in itself is a pretty tepid film save for the infamous scenes where the US cavalry massacres an entire Native American village in a Technicolor display of gore that probably made Sam Peckinpah blush.While that film's mixture of graphic gore and Western themes may have scandalized audiences at the time it nonetheless created an idiom unto itself where sleazebag white cowboy types would slaughter innocent unarmed and topically fashionable Native Americans ... then have their inhumanity paid back in kind usually with Injun killing tricks or some other aspect of having the battleground turned against you. While SOLDIER BLUE's inspiration was no doubt the clamor of dismay from reports Vietnam era atrocities by American soldiers the subsequent knockoff films only looked to reap the vicarious sadistic urges that SOLDIER BLUE brought to the surface.APACHE WOMAN is one such film a later era Spaghetti Western filmed on the ultracheap without any as yet then big named stars the central focus of which is a shapely Injun Squaw played by Yara Kewa the stage name for a German actress named Clara Hopf who's dusky appearance loaned itself to the role of a foxy Native American hottie who's rather smallish tribe is murdered for no apparent reason by US soldiers at the very beginning of the film. In true proprietary spirit of SOLDIER BLUE one of the soldiers future zombieexploitation specialist Al Cliver becomes disillusioned with the carnage breaks ranks and later helps the squaw to find safety while pursued by a gang of even scummier cracker hicks who's sole motivation to exist in the film is to rape and murder attractive young Native American women. Beats working for a living I guess.So this is another entry in the There Are No Good Guys Anymore kind of Western that predominated after the brilliant success of THE WILD BUNCH. Every character in the movie is a murderer a thief a rapist or just a sadistic cretin up to and including the family of a traveling minister who predictably turns out to be the most sadistic monster in the whole film. There quite simply is no safe haven for the two as they fight off all comers together saving each other's lives or virtues again and again before eventually becoming lovers. And if you have seen any pessimistic dystopian existentialist genre films that can only lead to one possible conclusion.The film is violent sleazy voyeuristic cheaply made mean spirited somewhat unpleasant and reeks of simply a chance to send audience members heart rates pumping by either the thought of the squaw being animalistically raped OR putting out voluntarily depending on the needs of the plot and for better or worse the plot does not disappoint. Though none of it is very original It's actually almost identical in plotting to a superior 1972 depression years western called APACHE MASSACRE or CRY FOR ME BILLY which at least has the distinction of a Harry Dean Stanton performance. Or Bruno Mattei's SCALPS which has the distinction of boasting the actual gore quotient that SOLDIER BLUE suggests.But it's not a bad film the locations are all gorgeously photographed in a mountainous region that doesn't look familiar. Part of my low rating may have to do with missing whatever philosophical message the film might try and weave into it's tale I have only seen it by way of a Spanish language DVD that had a great picture but no English language translation whatever nuances the plot may have are not understood by this Gringo. Not that what was going on is too hard to figure out If the film has one fault it's that it's rather simple minded which in this case is a plus. You don't need to understand what anyone is saying just be repulsed by the sleaze violence degradation and nihilism. On that level of consideration this might be a minor masterpiece of the later years of the Western craze when it apparently wasn't supposed to be fun anymore to suggest some sort of social weightiness or message. And here the message is that Injun squaws could be foxy as hell under them deerskins. How charming.410".

In true proprietary spirit of SOLDIER BLUE one of the soldiers future zombieexploitation specialist Al Cliver becomes disillusioned with the carnage breaks ranks and later helps the squaw to find safety while pursued by a gang of even scummier cracker hicks who's sole motivation to exist in the film is to rape and murder attractive young Native American women. Beats working for a living I guess.So this is another entry in the There Are No Good Guys Anymore kind of Western that predominated after the brilliant success of THE WILD BUNCH. Every character in the movie is a murderer a thief a rapist or just a sadistic cretin up to and including the family of a traveling minister who predictably turns out to be the most sadistic monster in the whole film. There quite simply is no safe haven for the two as they fight off all comers together saving each other's lives or virtues again and again before eventually becoming lovers. And if you have seen any pessimistic dystopian existentialist genre films that can only lead to one possible conclusion.The film is violent sleazy voyeuristic cheaply made mean spirited somewhat unpleasant and reeks of simply a chance to send audience members heart rates pumping by either the thought of the squaw being animalistically raped OR putting out voluntarily depending on the needs of the plot and for better or worse the plot does not disappoint. Though none of it is very original It's actually almost identical in plotting to a superior 1972 depression years western called APACHE MASSACRE or CRY FOR ME BILLY which at least has the distinction of a Harry Dean Stanton performance. Or Bruno Mattei's SCALPS which has the distinction of boasting the actual gore quotient that SOLDIER BLUE suggests.But it's not a bad film the locations are all gorgeously photographed in a mountainous region that doesn't look familiar. Part of my low rating may have to do with missing whatever philosophical message the film might try and weave into it's tale I have only seen it by way of a Spanish language DVD that had a great picture but no English language translation whatever nuances the plot may have are not understood by this Gringo. Not that what was going on is too hard to figure out If the film has one fault it's that it's rather simple minded which in this case is a plus. You don't need to understand what anyone is saying just be repulsed by the sleaze violence degradation and nihilism. On that level of consideration this might be a minor masterpiece of the later years of the Western craze when it apparently wasn't supposed to be fun anymore to suggest some sort of social weightiness or message. And here the message is that Injun squaws could be foxy as hell under them deerskins. How charming.410";

Apache Woman requires Cliver to just sort of stare at things anyway and therefore it might be the best film he's appeared in as the leading man. Al is part of a Yankee squad out to capture some Apache tribesmen who have escaped from a local reservation and by capture I mean slaughter including the women and children. These brave fellows manage to hold their own up against these unarmed mothers and kids but when the actual Apaches braves show up they hightail it leaving one dead Sargeant behind and one unconscious Al Cliver who never ever fired a shot.Some time later Al wakes up to find to everyone dead except for one lady Apache and one passing salesman who is stealing the boots and jewellery from the corpses who figures that he can sell on the squaw as a sex slave. This lady is no pushover though so when two other dodgy cowboys turn up and try and put the moves on her she headbutts one of the them and hightails it with Al.You see this is a messed up love story in a nihilistic midseventies way as Al and the Apache woman grow closer despite cultural and linguistic differences requiring Al to do a lot of staring. A love story where the protagonists realise that their forbidden love will cause them to turn their backs on their respective societies so they can stare at each other over a campfire. A love story where every single white person cannot even see a human when they look on the Apache including so called men of God. This paragraph was supposed to end on a joke but that doesn't seem so funny after all.If you're in a foul mood and want to hate the human race a little more this film will do the trick nicely. It's another twilight Spaghetti Western with a dark dark heart.".

Well directed and beautifully shot apparently in Romania and Uzbekistan and the eighth of twelve westerns from the point of view of various tribes starring and in this case cowritten by Gojko Mitic who was a star in Eastern Europe because of these films.APACHES was made in a communist country during the cold war and it's easy to see what the angle may have been how the white eyes villains could represent capitalism especially during a scene in which the Apache steal the water and horses from a band of travelers leaving them stranded in the desert then sit back and watch as they kill each other off. They are selfcentered and greedy thus unable to cooperate long enough to survive a bad situation. The indigenous tribes known for boundless generosity to those not their enemies not having a concept of private property could easily fit the socialist ideal. Not the reality mind you but the ideal.What's really funny though is that this movie by the standards of what we know today really doesn't play like propaganda. It feels much more authentic than any Spaghetti Western I've seen on the subjectNAVAJO JOE immediately comes to mindand at times even plays like Blood Meridian from the point of view of the Indians. It was supposedly based on research of a reallife massacre that occurred at the beginning of the MexicanAmerican war.The costumes and production design are great and the action scenes are great and despite all my prattling about sociopolitical context it's an entertaining western which I'm sure is what it was intended to be. The villain looks a lot like the Italian actor Piero Lulli smokes a giant cigar and uses a whip. The music sometimes reminds me of Spaghetti Westerns especially Stelvio Cipriani's score for THE UGLY ONES but ultimately has a style all its own.The First Run DVD has a tenminute trailer featuring scenes from this and other East German westerns that ends by announcing All this material will be restaurated soon. I'm definitely anxious to find out how soon.".

	schema:reviewBody "Late to the cultural ball as usual the East German film industry took note of the 'political spaghetti western' trend of late '60s Italian cinema and tried to shoehorn their own brand of antiimperialist MarxismLeninism into the genre. The results are mixed. Crudely directed by Gottfried Kolditz the film tells the story of Ulzana sauerkraut western veteran Gojko Mitic an Apache chief who has reached a rapprochement with the local Mexican population and generously extends it to whites who travel through the territory. His people have become inured to the treacherous ways of the white man however and are now reliant on them for booze 'relief flour' and beef steak. They also haven't counted on the mendacity and greed of 'Amerikanishe gangsters' such as Mr. Johnson Milan Beli who could care less about treaties or gentleman's agreements and simply wants to get his capitalist mitts on the local copper deposits. Though the film is not particularly well made it is well acted and the story is a disturbingly accurate rendering of the lengths to which we have gone to steal the land and birthright of indigenous peoples across the world. Whether in the rain forests of Central and South America the jungles of Irian Jaya or the Old West we've done a tiptop job of raping the earth and killing those who get in the way of 'progress'. Alas Apachen also relies on some of the laziest stereotypes of the noble savage sapping much of its potential as an educational tool and rendering it barely a step or two ahead of an Old Shatterhand picture. Recently deceased Polish actor Leon Niemcyzk here looking a lot thinner and gaunter than in Knife in the Water pops up as a Mexican miner and there's a decent if derivative score from HansDieter Hosalla. On balance it's a fascinating take on the genre and will entertain anyone with a penchant for Eurowesterns. While it's politically astute however the need to toe an ideological line leaves it in some regards counterintuitively less radical than some of the angry films of Sollima and Parolinifilms produced in the belly of the capitalist beast.".

His people have become inured to the treacherous ways of the white man however and are now reliant on them for booze 'relief flour' and beef steak. They also haven't counted on the mendacity and greed of 'Amerikanishe gangsters' such as Mr. Johnson Milan Beli who could care less about treaties or gentleman's agreements and simply wants to get his capitalist mitts on the local copper deposits. Though the film is not particularly well made it is well acted and the story is a disturbingly accurate rendering of the lengths to which we have gone to steal the land and birthright of indigenous peoples across the world. Whether in the rain forests of Central and South America the jungles of Irian Jaya or the Old West we've done a tiptop job of raping the earth and killing those who get in the way of 'progress'. Alas Apachen also relies on some of the laziest stereotypes of the noble savage sapping much of its potential as an educational tool and rendering it barely a step or two ahead of an Old Shatterhand picture. Recently deceased Polish actor Leon Niemcyzk here looking a lot thinner and gaunter than in Knife in the Water pops up as a Mexican miner and there's a decent if derivative score from HansDieter Hosalla. On balance it's a fascinating take on the genre and will entertain anyone with a penchant for Eurowesterns. While it's politically astute however the need to toe an ideological line leaves it in some regards counterintuitively less radical than some of the angry films of Sollima and Parolinifilms produced in the belly of the capitalist beast.";

I reckoned not to write lately at all because of my sight failure age connected I presume but anyway let's proceed.Who is Gojko Mitic and is there such thing as Macho Legacy coming from the Balkans for those who lack geographical orientation this is part of Eastern Europe running from the Alps to the Bosphorus with Istanbul and sometimes historically was first time called Europe. Gojko Mitic comes from a small town in Eastern Serbia near the Bulgarian border. He has the looks of a typical Shopi from the region. Other famous figures from the region are nowadays Bulgarian Premier Bojko Borisov etc.Hell I forgot my point. Mitic's films as a rule made by resemblance with spaghetti western were shot in the mid1960s to mid1970s and after that he lost significance as Movie Star for reasons I am not well aware. But in this 15 years period he was really something on the Big Screen while I remember the full saloons from that time and it was always difficult to get tickets for his movies. In Eastern Europe Gojko Mitic was an action star with caliber and popularity of the great French actors of the adventure cinema such as Alain Delon JeanPaul Belmondo Jean Marais Lino Ventura etc.The westerns themselves were produced by Deutsche Film DEFA of Eastern Germany and shot respectively at different locations in Eastern Europe but mainly in former Yugoslavia not as someone mentioned in far eastern Uzbekistan. Gojko Mitic get noticed in some small appearances at the Winnetou franchise series and then was offered the leading role in the DEFA westerns. Whomever it concerns and because I am staunch physiognomy reader here in Apachen 1973 and its sequel Ulzana 1974 the tandem Gojko Mitic and Colea Rautu Romanian actor playing an aging whiskey drinking Indian look much alike another odd couple from a most remembered Hollywood movie  i.e. Rocky 1976 with Sylvester Stallone and Burgess Meredith an aging boxing trainer. So be it!Lastly there was a very popular song in Bulgaria from the 1990s about Gojko Mitic with trailer from his movies. Enjoy your time!".

I do not agree with the general acclaim and I believe that some of them are pretty badly written and deliver little in terms of memorable values referring to political content or character elaborations and relationships. But I do believe that Apachen an east German film from almost 45 years ago succeeds with basically everything it attempts. The characters are okay the action scenes aren't bad for German standards sometimes even fun to watch. And most of all this film has some nice shades. My huge problem with the Winnetou films is that the characters are either 100 bad or 100 good but this is not the case here. This makes them seem a lot more realistic and also unlike the Winnetou films this movie here has Indians who offer more than being perfect in every regard and babbling pretentious quotes from start to finish. The plot was solid could have been better could have been worse. As a whole I recommend this Gojko Mitic quite a star back then appeared in many more films movie to everybody who likes westerns about cowboys and Indians. It is certainly very different compared to what America did in terms of western films around that time but it is just a different kind of good. Thumbs up and there is a sequel too if you liked this one.".

If you've ever been to a job interview with multiple applicants or even to one of those assessment centres big companies have you will recognize a lot of things in this movie.The Method starts off with an engaging splitscreen title sequence reminiscent of the TV series 24 which introduces the characters and the events around them The story takes place on the day of the annual IMF  World Bank meetings and a huge antiglobalization protest is mounting that is threatening to shut down the city. This however belies what will follow in the next two hours.Seven applicants for an executive position at a large company are more or less locked up inside a room and put through a novel mysterious selection process called The Grnholm Method which is supposed to determine the one applicant who is most fit for the job. The limited setting of the movie works perfectly and allows the audience to concentrate on and engage with the characters and the clever dialogue. Adapted from a theatre play the script takes the characters through little insidious games aimed at eliminating one applicant after the other. The movie quickly gets into a state of heightened reality amping up the tension as everything gets more and more psychologically violent. Without giving anything away all I can say is that there's no backing down it gets pretty hardcore and you can expect quite a few twists! After a particularly intense round in The Grnholm Method the audience is suddenly assaulted by the sound of the violent riots going on in the streets below while the camera remains focused on the actors. This moment is pure Haneke and through the contrast of nondiegetic sound perfectly illustrates the violence behind the ruthless shootfirstorbeshot modern day job world.Watching this movie carefully while giving it your full attention pays off since the plot twists are carefully build up and you can have a lot of fun and gratification in correctly predicting them. Also if you're a cynical bastard like me you will find a lot of laughs in the dialogue.Highly recommended!".

After a particularly intense round in The Grnholm Method the audience is suddenly assaulted by the sound of the violent riots going on in the streets below while the camera remains focused on the actors. This moment is pure Haneke and through the contrast of nondiegetic sound perfectly illustrates the violence behind the ruthless shootfirstorbeshot modern day job world.Watching this movie carefully while giving it your full attention pays off since the plot twists are carefully build up and you can have a lot of fun and gratification in correctly predicting them. Also if you're a cynical bastard like me you will find a lot of laughs in the dialogue.Highly recommended!";

	schema:reviewBody "This movie tells us about a group of people that are gathered at the premises of a company in order to take part in a selection process for an executive job. Soon they will realise that they're not attending a conventional groupinterview.One of the assets of this movie is the cast with a bunch of the best actors and actresses of the moment in Spain and Argentina. They had a good movie to show their talents and they have done it. Particularly surprising was the acting of Eduard Fernndez. Although with a good acting record he was a complete unknown to me. However his incarnation of the disgusting 'macho ibrico' was extremely realistic and natural. Ernesto Alterio shows us once more that he's able to convincingly play any role. One just have to compare his Antonio in 'Das de Ftbol' Football Days with the nervous Enrique of this movie. Outstanding I think. On the other hand I dislike Noriega and Verbeke.The movie as a whole is developed coherently and in a dynamic line it will catch your interest from the beginning. Only two negative points however. Although I'm not a puritan at all I think that the sex scenes were unnecessary. I also disliked the final sight of the street I think it was completely exaggerated but that's just a detail.".

The movie throws in elements from such wideranging and eclectic sources as And Then There Were None 1984 To Tell the Truth and Survivor as well.Seven highpowered job applicants all vying for a single position in a prestigious company arrive at a high rise office building in downtown Madrid. As a part of the selection process the seven are immediately put into a room and subjected to a battery of bizarre psychological tests designed to pit the applicants against one another until only one of them  the default winner and future employee  is left.Predictably the stress of the ordeal brings out the worst in the applicants leading to personal betrayals the exposing of secrets and a cutthroat jockeying for power. Part of the fun of the movie is in seeing just how long it takes for the veneer of civilized behavior to be stripped away exposing the ruthless animalistic nature within. For this is how the natural law of survival of the fittest is played out in the modern world  no longer with clubs bows and arrows but with duplicity deviousness and carefully chosen words.However the individuals are not the only ones to come under the scathing censure of the filmmakers. The movie also attacks the Big Brother aspects of corporations in their insistence on total allegiance to the company in exchange for job security and their willingness to drain their employees of their humanity to secure that allegiance. Yet just outside this bleak stark and sterile office building where civilized people are subtlety tearing each other apart for corporate advancement masses of people are marching in protest against the World Bank and the IMF who are holding a conference in the city.Mateo Gil and Marcelo Pineyro have written a sharp thoughtful screenplay that gets to the heart of the human condition while as a director Pineyro manages to keep the action fluid despite the singleset restriction of the conceit the film has been derived from the play by Jordi Calceran. The acting is uniformly excellent with each performer given his or her moment to shine as well as the chance to be an indispensable part of an extraordinary acting ensemble.The Method may be derivative of other works at times but the view of human nature it reveals to us is often unnerving and chilling in its honesty and precision.".

During IMF  World Bank Summit and demonstrations which upset Madrid like other big cities  seven candidates report for a job interview . Protesters rise up in public protest in the street over the IMFWorld Bank Summit attempting globalization of workers unions . As the group interview begins high above in a corporate meeting room where are the applicants for the difficult competition . Major corporation Dekia holds interviews a lot of applicants  these are the followings  Eduardo Noriega as Carlos  Najwa Nimri as Nieves  Eduard Fernndez as Fernando  Pablo Echarri as Ricardo  Ernesto Alterio as Enrique  Carmelo Gmez as Julio and Adriana Ozores as Ana . Their doubts begin when they must sign a clause accepting the Grnholm method which nobody ever heard .

The hilarity begins right away with Natalia Verbeke's irresistible charisma. The focus of the movie centers around the one personality that is required to succeed in the corporate realm. It's interesting to analyze each personality of the candidates and understand why others were eliminated while only one was selected.

The Method which involves a group of relative strangers who are all vying for the same position at some strange company screams the theatre and that's not a complaint.Despite the actually good  at times  dialogue and the wildly original idea and presentation what I would like to complain about is how incredibly dull this movie really is. And it had so much potential.I mean this movie is about a group of menwomen who want desperately to be hired but they MUST pass some psychological tests to gain employment. They raise the tension and suspense in who gets eliminated from the running for one open position but they're always acting like someone will die or lose a million dollars such as the similar Survivor reality show. It's really not that big of a deal but I suppose we're supposed to care nonetheless.Also this movie's been compared to 12 Angry Men or In the Company of Men. Phooey! Both are superior movies and while 12 Angry Men involve a much deeper outcome In the Company of Men had wit charm and actual tension that The Method couldn't match.So here's the synopsis we have candidates with various backgrounds who have filled out several of the same applications and they're all segregated into a room hosted by a beautiful secretary Montse Verbeke and they must pass tests and vote off their peers so only one is left standing. All the while there's a huge and seemingly irrelevant World Bank protest taking place many stories below where they're held. Far be it from me heehee to criticize a movie for not catching the meaning of the protests  and they show its aftermath in the closing but I just didn't get it. At any rate I guess it was to foretell the economy's not good and these individuals really do need to gain employment here.During this interviewing process we'll learn more about people either by their body language speeches or ahhem bathroom breaks that involve sex and masturbation from both sexes. Also most of them will work at deceiving the others to get hired much like those fakereality shows.I will say this the acting's good the dialogue's fine  if you don't mind fastreading subtitles and though it was not a greatly paced movie at least they continuously attempted to step the game up to move the elimination process along. And the finale with the final two contestants was actually well written and full of suspense even when you know who the final two will be from about minute one. I would recommend with strong reservations. It's not an exciting movie but at least it's watchable.".

There are no new tricks being attempted here no important message to be delivered in fact when the movie gets serious about the situation of the world economy or when it drifts into love relationships between some characters it losses its rhythm. The juice is in the method of the title the Gronholm Method something companies apparently do select a person for a vacant working position. In a wide spaced room we meet Julio Carmelo Gmez Ana Adriana Ozores Enrique Ernesto Alterio Ricardo Pablo Echarri Fernando Eduard Fernndez Nieves Najwa Nimri and Carlos Eduardo Noriega seven individuals who are applying for the same position. Montse Natalia Verbeke a secretary receives them kindly but once they are inside that room they're completely on their own.And it becomes like a jungle like the definition Darwin once expressed as 'natural selection' where the most apt will prevail. The humans that instantly turn into animals device their strategy and start playing the game. They follow instructions that are given by texts written in computers but always wander off and end up talking about some deeper than company responsibilities moral issues survival issues romantic and sexual issues and the economic situation that's always present. To describe each of the characters separately has no point. I can merely say that Ernesto Alterio takes the biggest round of applause as he expresses an initial enthusiasm with the strange situation that gradually turns into insecurity and desperation. Carmelo Gmez is also especially good in representing exactly the opposite. Echarri playing a wiseass is something we've seen a lot of times and it does him no good because it's hard to believe anything he says while Verbeke delivers a perfect secretary that shows an excess of sweetness so that it becomes impossible to trust her. Three years after Kamchatka Marcelo Pieyro's major achievement is the decision of taking the renowned play the movie's based on to the big screen. The people I know including myself watch more movies than plays and I love plays and The Method gives them and everyone the possibility of experiencing something that has to be experienced. I wanted to see the play but never did. Pieyro with a necessary respect for silence and the correct use of incidental music that comes from the secretary's office next to the room in which everything takes place embraces the tension that the play represents and by using ferocious closeups and keeping his actors focused and under control makes us feel we're there watching these people closely.And the play is play no more. It's a movie now called The Method that doesn't transcend the merely theatrical but provides us a timeless document that shows a powerful and shocking experience we can grab and watch any time we feel like it.".

Pieyro with a necessary respect for silence and the correct use of incidental music that comes from the secretary's office next to the room in which everything takes place embraces the tension that the play represents and by using ferocious closeups and keeping his actors focused and under control makes us feel we're there watching these people closely.And the play is play no more. It's a movie now called The Method that doesn't transcend the merely theatrical but provides us a timeless document that shows a powerful and shocking experience we can grab and watch any time we feel like it.";

	schema:reviewBody "The Method Before I begin my review I think I should clear up that the Gronholm Method is an obscure method of interviewing someone for a job. It involves gathering up a number of candidates eligible for a position but rather than openly interviewing them as a process of discovering their usefulness and weaknesses there technically is no interviewer. In the film the candidates are placed in a room with six laptops one for each contender to receive notes and they are forced to psychologically analyze each other to discover a winner. They are issued a series of challenges and hypothetical situations in which they are forced to pick out the weakest of their group. There is always the lingering plausibility that any one of these contestants can be the true interviewer or perhaps there could be multiple interviewers? Maybe there is only one true contestant or maybe they are all roleplaying in a method to promote a staff member in the company? Any of these explanations are reasonable because when we're discussing a method as cynical as the film's depiction it's almost superficial to narrow it down to one solution.I'm not entirely sure about the historical authenticity of the Gronholm Method or if it even exists a Google search sent me to the film's IMDb  Wikipedia page but I can almost assure if the film were a multinational boxoffice success small businesses would begin to experiment and possibly adapt the assumed fictional method. I personally wouldn't mind being an interviewee of such a system for it allows me to challenge my intellectual abilities in an intense competition. As for the film itself when its narrative followed the characters as they explored each other's limitations and the film analyzed their credulity and startling enthusiasm to such a sport it was an intensely riveting experience. The characters were developed with careful and relentlessly strengthening threedimensional traits and the methods of interviewing grew more severe and brooding to reveal the true nature of man. The first 50 minutes of this film were pure exhilaration a haunting psychological depiction of cat  mouse. To me it was almost a nostalgic resemblance of the superfluous anxiety found in 12 ANGRY MEN as I'd never felt so absorbed by longrunning dialogue since.After several characters are eliminated from the process I'm not about to explain who why or how the film takes a break from its intense onslaught of psychosomatic progression. This veers the film offcourse and unfortunately causes it to wane off a bit. Greed is replaced by hormones as one character randomly feels like having sex with one of the remaining interviewees. Although a bit absurd it also fits the animalistic desperation the contestants must be feeling by this point. They've been stripped bare from social courtesy and are now physically fighting one another no longer caring for outer appearance. I'm not sure if it justifies going as far as it does but it would've been totally implausible to remain as a restrained and gracious drama.A romantic subplot also develops between two interviewees. They had once been lovers but one betrayed the other and neither had ever forgotten. They still longed to be together but the hostile circumstances made it impossible for them. The subplot does reach startling poignancy at one point but does the film ever get back on track? Does it ever reenter its initial excitement? Unfortunately the writer didn't trust his sardonic examination would make for a fully satisfying viewing. His decision to switch gears was more detrimental than refreshing and that may be the only aspect of the film that inhibited greatness. It still makes for a relentlessly entertaining viewing one that not only provokes thought but questions human morality in a time of conflict. Cynical but excellent.".

It tells the story of Negar a young woman who works as a clerk office. One night when she returns from work her mother asks her to go sleep at a friends place because she expects a guest. This is where the movie starts. Negar unable to locate her boyfriend she decides to walk through the streets of Teheran and accepts three rides doing so. During each ride the male driver tells about their life they confess things to her. The third confession turns out to be rather chocking...Each confession focussed on relationships and the position of women in Iran gives a good insight in the way of living and thinking in Teheran. The movie moves at a rather slow pace and is very minimal especially in the end. The three cars in the movies and the streets of Teheran are the main locations in this movie that is very dark since it is shot at night.Personally I absolutely adored this movie I thought it was one of the better ones of the 18 movies I saw at the Gent filmfestival in '05 and even one of the best of 2005.Iran is consistently producing superb movies. 'Yek Shab' 'One Night' seems highly influenced by Abbas Kariostami especially his acclaimed movie 'Ten'.If you like minimal or would like to know more about the society in Iran then don't miss this when U have the chance to see this fascinating movie. Niki Karimi a female director which is not easy in the MiddleEast is undoubtedly highly talented. Shooting this movie was all but trouble free without a permit. 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "Benjamin Twist Will Hay is a different kind of schoolteacher he teaches the pupils very little of worth. That is except gambling and bluffing a way thru life. When grumpy Colonel WilloughbyGore visits the class he is mortified to find the boys have learnt next to nothing of value in Twist's class. Seeking to get Twist fired Gore calls on the school board to fire him. But wanting to be fair the board suggest that Twist and eight of is class enter the interschool examinations in London. Where if they make the grade Twist will save his job. Oh dear! Not only is his job in the hands of a bunch of gambling smoking dunces but trouble comes in the form of Arty Jones an escaped convict and father to one of Twist's boys. There's a robbery in the pipeline and Twist and his class are going to be right in the middle of it.To all intents and purposes Good Morning Boys is structurally a remake of Will Hay's frothy entertainer Boys Will Be Boys from 1935. Much like the 35 film this film sees Hay as a bumbling teacher surrounded by roguish boys and with shifty crooks on the horizon. There's still an affluent lady who's on Twist's side a gruff Colonel who's out to get Twist and a crooked father of one of the boys after a priceless item. However in spite of the obvious similarities there's more such as the Watt is a unit of electricity replacing the how high is a Chinaman? skit the quality of writing and direction is considerably better.This was the first of eight films that Marcel Varnel directed Hay in of which it's fair to say contain half a dozen of them that are Hay's best pictures. Correctly suggesting that both men were comfortable working with each other. The other first of note is that this was the film that saw Hay bring Dr Benjamin Twist to the screen he would reprise the character twice more in Convict 99 1938 and Hey! Hey! USA also 1938. Here the plot contains plenty of zip to it as teacher and boys end up in Paris where the Louvre and a certain Mona Lisa painting provide scope for plenty of laughs. Of which Hay and his colleagues are only too happy to deliver the goods. Prior to this we have indulged in cheeky cheating search party fun patrol and a bookies blackboard skit that's purely joyous in its writing. But it's with the Paris set finale that it hits its mark acrobats and punch ups are merely the start of the fun on its way.Joining Hay on the cast list is the integral to his career Graham Moffatt as Albert Brown a character Moffatt played 7 times with Hay. With notable performances also coming from Martita Hunt Peter Gawthorne Fewlass Llewellyn Mark Daly Lilli Palmer who sings the delightful Baby Whatcha Gonna Do Tonight? and look out for a young Charles Hawtrey as a posh class swot. It may be missing the considerable comic excellence of Hay's other important career sidekick Moore Marriott but it's still one of the better Hay movies to forever enjoy and savour. 810".

	onyx:emotionText "Benjamin Twist Will Hay is a different kind of schoolteacher he teaches the pupils very little of worth. That is except gambling and bluffing a way thru life. When grumpy Colonel WilloughbyGore visits the class he is mortified to find the boys have learnt next to nothing of value in Twist's class. Seeking to get Twist fired Gore calls on the school board to fire him. But wanting to be fair the board suggest that Twist and eight of is class enter the interschool examinations in London. Where if they make the grade Twist will save his job. Oh dear! Not only is his job in the hands of a bunch of gambling smoking dunces but trouble comes in the form of Arty Jones an escaped convict and father to one of Twist's boys. There's a robbery in the pipeline and Twist and his class are going to be right in the middle of it.To all intents and purposes Good Morning Boys is structurally a remake of Will Hay's frothy entertainer Boys Will Be Boys from 1935. Much like the 35 film this film sees Hay as a bumbling teacher surrounded by roguish boys and with shifty crooks on the horizon. There's still an affluent lady who's on Twist's side a gruff Colonel who's out to get Twist and a crooked father of one of the boys after a priceless item. However in spite of the obvious similarities there's more such as the Watt is a unit of electricity replacing the how high is a Chinaman? skit the quality of writing and direction is considerably better.This was the first of eight films that Marcel Varnel directed Hay in of which it's fair to say contain half a dozen of them that are Hay's best pictures. Correctly suggesting that both men were comfortable working with each other. The other first of note is that this was the film that saw Hay bring Dr Benjamin Twist to the screen he would reprise the character twice more in Convict 99 1938 and Hey! Hey! USA also 1938. Here the plot contains plenty of zip to it as teacher and boys end up in Paris where the Louvre and a certain Mona Lisa painting provide scope for plenty of laughs. Of which Hay and his colleagues are only too happy to deliver the goods. Prior to this we have indulged in cheeky cheating search party fun patrol and a bookies blackboard skit that's purely joyous in its writing. But it's with the Paris set finale that it hits its mark acrobats and punch ups are merely the start of the fun on its way.Joining Hay on the cast list is the integral to his career Graham Moffatt as Albert Brown a character Moffatt played 7 times with Hay. With notable performances also coming from Martita Hunt Peter Gawthorne Fewlass Llewellyn Mark Daly Lilli Palmer who sings the delightful Baby Whatcha Gonna Do Tonight? and look out for a young Charles Hawtrey as a posh class swot. It may be missing the considerable comic excellence of Hay's other important career sidekick Moore Marriott but it's still one of the better Hay movies to forever enjoy and savour. 810";

	schema:reviewBody "Good Morning Boys is a wonderful early English comedy. When one considers the picture Americans have of the stiff upper lip of the British a comedy of this nature in the 1930s is a surprise. More so because of the stern upbringing of boys across the pond shown by most films of the period. But here is proof of the comedy offerings of early British cinema. And it is a hilarious delight. Will Hay stars as Dr. Benjamin Twist. He seems more intent on teaching his boys about things in life than any formal education. The plot itself is a zany one. It contains equal doses of witty dialog goofy lines and crazy antics. Dr. Twist prattles on about one subject after another with the dean and Lady Bogshott an admirer of Twist. They are played admirably by Fewlass Llewellyn and Martita Hunt respectively. This is all to the consternation of the new school board chairman Col. WilloughyGore played by Peter Gawthorne. The cast of boys is hilarious. Graham Moffatt is the leader as Albert Brown. At one point the Colonel calls Twist's prattling dialog a Twisterism. The script truly has some nonsensical lines that are sure to bring a smile  if not loud laughter from any viewer. This is a very funny and entertaining film. One other reviewer said it compares favorably with early American slapstick and buffoonery such as that of Abbott and Costello and the Marx Brothers. However I would caution parents who have troubles disciplining teenagers. You may not want them to see the shenanigans of boys from almost a century ago that this film shows. One of my favorite Twisterisms is when Twist appears before the school board to defend the learning of his boys. A board member addresses him The colonel claims that the boys couldn't answer the questions. Why couldn't they? Twist replies Well possibly he didn't ask them the right ones. When all's said and done the boys can't answer questions for which they don't know the answers can they?".

It's all very silly and if you try to think too much about the plot it will make your brain explodebut it is fun.The film begins with a short prologue with some crooks. However this quickly stops and the setting is a boys schools in England. Will Hay runs the place and is a complete moronsort of like the blind leading the blind. As for the illeducated kids they're mostly a bunch of junior delinquentsspending much of their time gambling and doing anything but studying. When the school receives a surprise visit from the superintendent it sure looks like Hay will be fired and the kids sent to real schools. Well none of them wanted this and the hope is that if the kids I say 'kids' but some of them look as old as 30 do well they'll let Hay keep his school. So they only do what any ordinary group of school kids would do in this situationthey cheat. Unfortunately they do so well on the exam that they are invited to go to Paris for a big award ceremonywhere people are sure to realize that the kids and Hay are all a bunch of boobs. However where the film goes next is quite a surpriseand like all Hay films something things turn out just swell at the end.The film compares well to the goofy comedies of Hollywood from the erasuch as the Marx Brothers or Abbott  Costello. It also helps that Hay had the support of Graham Moffatt as the leader of his school of miscreants. Good writing and a lot of fun.Oh and if you care older paintings are almost always on wood panelnever on canvas. See the film you'll know what I mean.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'd be lying if I didn't admit this is yet another patterned Bruce Willis flick. The kind where he plays the hard boiled cop with a colorful past but I gave it a chance. This one finds Willis as Tom Hardy. A cop from a family of cops and things aren't going too well. First off he's just ratted out his violent partner Robert Pastorelli at an official police inquiry and that doesn't win him any fans in the department. Then his depressed former partner jumps off a bridge killing himself. What a load to carry. All of the while there's this killer on the loose and when his father is murdered by him he lets it be known he thinks the killer is a cop and suddenly he's reassigned to River Patrol.This movie succeeds on a basic level  it's entertaining. Sure the story is loose and the film's surprises are somewhat stale but it's all in good fun. Willis gets to look aptly serious and hunt for the killer on the waters and there's just enough suspense to sustain interest and the minor twists of the story keep things at a good pace. Meanwhile the rounded supporting cast keeps things lively and keeps the viewer going Where have I seen him before? or Hey that's such and such.I've read on here how people think this is stupid dumb and lacks any suspense or thrills. Like any of the Die Hard movies had exceptionally smart stories you didn't know what was gonna happen next or how it would all end. Of course not. For a entry level Bruce Willis flick this one satisfies. Now if only I could get the Little Red Riding Hood Song out of my mind...!".

First off he's just ratted out his violent partner Robert Pastorelli at an official police inquiry and that doesn't win him any fans in the department. Then his depressed former partner jumps off a bridge killing himself. What a load to carry. All of the while there's this killer on the loose and when his father is murdered by him he lets it be known he thinks the killer is a cop and suddenly he's reassigned to River Patrol.This movie succeeds on a basic level  it's entertaining. Sure the story is loose and the film's surprises are somewhat stale but it's all in good fun. Willis gets to look aptly serious and hunt for the killer on the waters and there's just enough suspense to sustain interest and the minor twists of the story keep things at a good pace. Meanwhile the rounded supporting cast keeps things lively and keeps the viewer going Where have I seen him before? or Hey that's such and such.I've read on here how people think this is stupid dumb and lacks any suspense or thrills. Like any of the Die Hard movies had exceptionally smart stories you didn't know what was gonna happen next or how it would all end. Of course not. For a entry level Bruce Willis flick this one satisfies. Now if only I could get the Little Red Riding Hood Song out of my mind...!";

The scenery is different and excellent the photography is great even spectacular in places and the action is on a par with some of the best action films ever including Bullitt.

That alone is worth taking a look at this movie.I do not usually care much for Bruce Willis. I thought he was very well cast in this movie however and Sara Jessica Parker added extra special chemistry. The cast is much better than average overall and includes such outstanding actors as Andre Braugher of the outstanding tv series Homicide. I thought that the casting in general as well as the photography location and action very adequately made up for any possible deficiencies in the plot itself.I would warn that there is extensive foul language in this film more than is necessary even for a film of this genre in my opinion and probably it's biggest drawback. I would still say that the film is well worth watching when your in the mood for some escapist fun and action fare. As I said earlier I think the film deserves higher ratings than it's gotten so far.

A serial killer returns after a twoyear absence and bodies of beautiful women start turning up in the river all women whom Hardy used to date! Sarah Jessica Parker is on hand as Hardy's partner on the river Jo Christman.The movie has a bad reputation. Roger Ebert tore it to pieces basically saying it was too derivative and bythenumbers and Willis himself said he hated it. I can understand criticism to a point. The story has a melodramatic comicbook vibe which is obvious in the opening act almost like a TV production except with a superior cast and action scenes. But and this is an important but I found myself drawn into the story  the characters and greatly enjoyed the rare Pittsburgh locations as well as the melodrama and thrills. In other words the movie is entertaining and entertainment is the name of the game.This is a cop thriller in the manner of the Dirty Harry series especially The Dead Pool 1988 except it's more comic booky and taking place in Pittsburgh rather than San Francisco. It's also reminiscent of films like The General's Daughter 1999. Although not technically as good as the Dirty Harry movies or The General's Daughter due to its cartoonishness Striking Distance nevertheless pulled me into the lives of the characters and for the most part furnished the requisite thrills.The genericallynamed movie also akin to the Dirty Harry franchise was originally called Three Rivers a much better title simply because it's more specific but was changed at the last minute because the marketing department feared people would think it was a sports movie due to Three Rivers Stadium so they switched it to Striking Distance. Why Striking Distance? The first hint is at the beginning of the movie when the title card shows two electrical bolts coming out from either side of the title. Later we observe the mysterious killer using a stun gun before killing his victims and with a stun gun you must of course be within... striking distance!Speaking of the killer one element of the plot I haven't mentioned is that this is a whodunit. Someone is charged with being the killer early on but Hardy knows it's the wrong guy he and others are sure it's a cop or excop doing the killings. There are a few suspects including Hardy himself but I honestly was unable to guess the right person. There's another twist late in the story that also took me by surprise.Striking Distance may not be exceptional and is marred by cartoonish exaggeration but it entertains as a cop thriller and that's what's most important when it comes to these types of flicks. Plus it was shot in Pittsburgh a refreshing change.THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour 42 minutes. ADDITIONAL WRITER Martin Kaplan.GRADE CB".

Fortunately Willis and Sarah Jessica Parker manage to do just that.This film is highly underrated and underappreciated and wrongly so. The performances by even the supporting cast actors who are known for lesser films and lesser performances are wonderful.

It is a bit reminiscent of the Zodiac killer but only a bit. The truth is only a big star like Willis could pull this one out of the 1 bin and set it upon the eyelevel shelves. Fortunately Willis and Sarah Jessica Parker manage to do just that.This film is highly underrated and underappreciated and wrongly so. The performances by even the supporting cast actors who are known for lesser films and lesser performances are wonderful. No I'm not trying to say this film is Oscarworthy but it IS highly entertaining. It properly generates atmosphere and delivers upon generation.All in all? I found this work entertaining and enjoyable.It rates an 8.310 from...the Fiend .";

	schema:reviewBody "Striking Distance is set in Pittsburgh where Tom Hardy Bruce Willis has just had to testify against his partner  cousin Jimmy Detillo Robert Pastorelli on his way to a policeman's ball with his father Vincent John Mahoney they get a call to say that a wanted murderer is being pursued. The two Hardy's decide to help out  give chase but end up crashing their car when Tom regains consciousness he finds the murder suspect gone  his father dead. Two years later  Tom has been forced to take a job as a river patrol man as he has become an alcoholic loser suddenly dead bodies begin to be found in the rivers around Pittsburgh that Tom patrol. Tom is convinced the killer is back but discovers that officially the new murders have no connection to the earlier ones Tom is sure that a big coverup is going on  that the killer is targeting him personally...Written  directed by Rowdy Herrington there doesn't seem to be much love for this much maligned action thriller with even star Bruce Willis saying 'it sucked' while on a chatshow in 2004 hey Bruce I have news for you Striking Distance is nowhere near the worst film you have appeared in. Hudson Hawk 1991 Color of Night 1994  Cop Out 2010 anyone? Anyway Striking Distance was known under the title Three Rivers during production  is a decent enough action thriller. One suspects that maybe Willis was trying to star in another Die Hard 1988 but his character here is much less likable or quotable. The script is nothing more than a string of cop film clichs stringed together around a fairly basic murder mystery plot  every so often there's a big action setpiece. As it is I quite liked Striking Distance there are a few decent oneliners the character's although clichd are given life by a good cast or pro's  there's enough action here to satisfy most. There's a particularly good car chase at the start. As I said the clichs come thick  fast a disgraced alcoholic cop a coverup a killer who taunts the cops feelings of guilt  remorse  loss honour  family connections. At just under 100 minutes maybe it's a little long but there's enough going on to keep ones interest even if the murder mystery may be a little easy to figure out  a bit too improbable to take seriously. Also the ending features a little overkill when it comes to the villain dying as he comes back from apparently being dead at least four times in ten minutes!There are some good action setpieces here including a great car chase with one of my personal favourite moments from any chase from any film when the cars start jumping over those humps  shoot up in the air one behind the other. There are boat chases shootouts fights  a bit of suspense as a mystery killer stalks  kills a few people too. Nicely enough shot there's not much style here but it looks alright.With a supposed budget of about 30000000 this has the usual glossy Hollywood production values  is well made. There's a very good cast here including Bruce Willis Dennis Farina Tom Sizemore Brion James  Tom Atkins with the only weak link the ever awful Sarah Jessica Parker in an early role.Striking Distance is a pretty good action thriller it has a reasonable murder mystery some clichd cop drama  some good action scenes. It's certainly no worse than a lot of routine Hollywood action thrillers you could do a lot worse.".

Well not when your area has a ton of killings going on and the bodies dumped in the river for the poor river patrol who are used to just cruising around have to pick up the bodies.  This movie is great keeping the villain secret until the end they certainly fooled me!  This movie got an 810 on my scale probably a 210 on my moms.  I give it that for great suspense mystery and thrills.  I lowered it due to how it was a bit against women. This movie is definitely rated R and shouldn't be viewed by children or young teens for strong violence and language and also some sex.  It is pretty good while maybe offensive to women maybe not.".

	schema:reviewBody "Like John Q Striking Distance is another film that leaves me in an enigma of how panned it was. This is just as good as a lot of other Willis actioners. Most of Willis's films I like and this is no exception. It's really a very well plotted revenge thriller with a great car chase I might add which left this flick playing over a couple of months in Adelaide. I like the family angle to it. Willis like his father John Mahoney before Frasier and years after Code Of Silence which he made a brief appearance in is a Pittsburgh cop. So is his Uncle Dennis Farina and his two other sons one of them who's on trial for battery where Willis gone up against him telling the court the real version much to the bitter dislike of his fellow officers. Like Willis's character Tom Hardy catchy says Look where telling the truth's got me. Sadly at the end of the chase things went awry where Mahoney is executed. There's a bigger picture to this story and I'm not gonna spoil it for ya. Soon after Farina's bad cop son where things are not looking to good for him threatens to jump off the bridge saying Cops don't go to prison. I'm not going. Well bad cops do. Well he jumps. His body's never recovered. Cut to a couple of years later disgraced cop Willis now drowning his sorrows in alcohol and making the best of his stinking situation now works as a river cop. Everything's just dandy. He lives on a houseboat has a cat even gets a surprise visit later from Farina's other out of control boozing son now ex cop Tom Sizemore quite impressive here who like the other cops initially had it in for Hardy too. Things are looking up when he's partnered with Jo new to the job. But now things are about to become a living hell where for Hardy his haunted past returns though he's always been haunted since those tragic events years prior. A score of dead young women start surfacing on the river waters all of who have been sexually involved with Willis. He's convinced this is the work of the same killer responsible for his father's execution. So here's a great thriller ride for you. Too as an added treat we have an unrelated action scene on a houseboat where some hijackers have taken it over so it's good ol Bruce to the rescue. Too near the end in it's horrifying revelation where the killer comes into light we really learn about family and loyalty where again to finish the killer off a cattle crod is used that instantly had me remembering that scene in The Last Boy Scout. And like the end of Cobra Willis gets to punch out the loud mouthed cop. See this film has everything including a bit of romance and a nice after ending. For Willis fans specially. Check out the classic opening with the remote control car cool like the rest of the film.".

A down on his luck cop who kicks ass as hard as he hits the bottle.Bruce stars as Tom Hardy a Pittsburgh city cop who gets busted down to working on a police pursuit boat as he testified against his partner. His ex girlfriends keep getting murdered and dumped in the river  he knows that someone is doing this to frame him but who? This movie has an excellent car chase and some cool lines from Bruce plus some very good set piece action scenes. There are also some very good supporting performances from Tom Sizemore and a very crazy Robert Pastorelli.I picked this up on DVD from ebay and was surprised by how good it looked on a large widescreen TV  I was only a kid when this was released so never saw it at the cinema. Good cinematography of the rushing river and the bridge. Definitely worth checking out.Who's the best cop now Jimmy??".

There is no reason why anyone would not enjoy this underrated treasure. The music is also great especially the eerie little Red Riding Hood. I loved the fact that it was set on a river it is quite original in that regard. Sure Bruce played basically the role as he did in many of his films such as Die Hard and The Last Boy Scout both excellent films but I say if its not broke don't fix it.

By tradition she is unceremoniously left at a bare and impoverished widows' ashram beside the Ganges during monsoon season. The ashram's leader pimps out Kalyani a young and beautiful widow for household funds. Narayan a follower of Gandhi falls in love with her. Can she break with tradition and religious teaching to marry him? The ashram's moral center is Shakuntala deeply religious but conflicted about her fate. Can she protect Kalyani or Chuyia? Amid all this water is rebirth possible or does tradition drown all?";

	schema:reviewBody "This beautiful and poignant film also packs quite a punch the sorry plight of Hindu widows in traditional Indian society is made evident. Deepa Mehta has clearly set out to make a film with a message but she lets the story carry the message and she does not demonize the supporters of ancient oppressive practices some of whom are motivated by faith rather than selfinterest. Strangely the film's beauty undercuts to some extent the political message I can imagine a devout Hindu seeing it as supporting the traditional view.As explained in the film according to ancient texts a Hindu widow had three choices she could join her husband on his funeral pyre she could marry his younger brother if available or she could go into an Ashram refuge with other widows and live a life of selfdenial to atone for the sin of having lost her husband.. It is the third option Chuyia Sarala takes on the death of her husband in 1938. Chuyia however is only nine years old and scarcely remembers getting married.The Ashram is a poor place selfsupported by the proceeds of begging and prostitution but there is camaraderie amongst the women who are of all ages and Chuyia initially is not badly treated. The focus shifts to Kalyani Lisa Ray the Ashram's jewel who becomes involved with a young political activist Narayana John Abraham a supporter of Gandhi.The film is not so much an attack on religion as on particular beliefs. I've no doubt one could live the life of a devout Hindu without believing that widows are responsible for their husband's deaths just as one can be a devout Christian without believing in slavery or that the earth is flat or was created in 4004BC. Although the film is set just prior to World War 2 there are undoubtedly many supporters of the ancient texts still out there  Mehta was prevented from filming in India by some of them and Water was eventually filmed in Sri Lanka. I find it impossible to have any sympathy for their position because it really amounts to using the practices of a society which has long passed away to defend an economic interest or rather to excuse the abandonment by her family of a woman who has had the illluck to lose her husband. As Chuyia asks where is the Ashram for the widowers? Also whatever could be said for child marriage on social or economic grounds 2000 years ago there is no possible justification for it now.It's a great pity the film was banned in India and Pakistan  it is a film for the citizens of those countries rather than me but it is striking to watch and I suspect not easy to forget.".

It was AWED SILENCE people! Every woman was bawling her eyes out and the men without exception were scrunched down into their collars staring intently holding back tears. This is Deepa's finest hour. She can retire now knowing she has made a worthy film. I would have voted 10 but there were a few technical glitches such as one moment were the colorlighting changed for about 3 seconds in an important scene and then snapped back. No blame to Deepa though. I have sent several to see the film and all have raved about it Can hardly wait to buy the DVD and see it again. The criticisms were political and should not be considered. Any film that criticizes aspects of a religion gets blasted from fundamentalists. This film is NOT a political statement. It is entertainment based on a political statement. It should not be missed.

	schema:headline " The Water of Life Echoes of Baran";
	schema:reviewBody "In 2001 wellregarded Iranian director Majid Majidi came out with Baran a film about a young girl forced to pretend to be a boy in order to bring money to her immigrant Afghani family living illegally in Iran and not permitted to work. Baran means 'rain' in Farsi and the allegory of water was a very important one thematically within the film. Baran was later thematically pilfered by a less successful film Osama which dealt with the harsh reality of an antifeminist Taliban in Afghanistan where a girl is caught pretending to be a boy by the Taliban regime and the horrible consequences of her actions  only committed for the purpose of survival.Water is similar to both of these films on several thematic levels. Deepa Mehta finishes he trilogy on a powerful note. She gives us the story of two women each trying to discover a sense of selfworth and purpose while trapped in a seemingly endless life of forced confinement. she also gives us the story of a woman who is not only trying to keep her faith but understand it and a man who is looking for change in a world of stagnation and traditionalism.The feminist ideal is a prominent one as is survival against the harshest of odds. Inhumanity on one level contrasted against the theme of renewal both physically and spiritually  the essence of water the evermoving indispersable and essential aspect of life itself. But Water succeeds on the level of Baran  unlike Osama which preaches incessantly hitting you over the head with its point until your concussed with what the director has to say. Water like Baran is subtle preferring to let the human side of the story tell you what you need to know and showing us the necessity for change for hope for unbroken faith without holding our hands through the process.Mehta has given us a very successful film. What struck me most about this film was that the subject matter is one that the Western world would likely exclaim as being incomprehensible  that of widows being thought of as untouchable and spiritual pollution as though it was their will that their husbands die on them...  and yet so much of the Western World exists in this film. This is not merely an Eastern film that we should look at and cluck our tongues saying 'those crazy Indians!' These issues exist in our back yards  the ill treatment of foreigners of neighbours of our own peoples. This film is very heavy but there is a light side to it  the message of Ghandi and the promise of renewal of spirit. That faith is not something to twist to your own beliefs but something for your beliefs to be twisted to. We are constantly reminded of Ghandi's teachings  but we are never preached to. Instead Ghandi could almost be an absent narrator  his voice is only heard for a brief instant near the end of the film  instead we hear his voice through the voice of Narayan who is the avatar of Ghandi in the film and the avatar of change.Water teaches us that problems exist and that many are rooted in our own traditions and beliefs  often misinterpreted or twisted by us to fit our agendas. The British can't be scapegoats for THIS set of issues though they were responsible for plenty of others. Change is hard to come by but the one thing that is eternal is Water. Sure there are a few moments of unsubtle prodding in the film but the fine acting and smart writing overcame any moments of forced drama. And the heartwrenching twists within the story were surprising in their finality and not Disneyesque tearjerking moments. Our faith and not necessarily religious faith must be like water  for without either we cannot hope to survive. 9.510.".

In every frame I can envision a beautiful photograph which can be composed from it.The score was also very good and added to the mood of the film.Go see it if you have the opportunity you will not be disappointed oh might want to bring some Kleenex tho'.oh and since it was at TIFF Deepa spoke a few words she appears to be very down to earth and sincere and the cast was also present John Abraham and Lisa Ray are absolutely gorgeous but very modest and subtle.

It seems impossible to believe that some of the things in this movie could have actually happened and that perhaps today there are women widows living in similar circumstances. The characters in this movie are easy to identify with to love and to despise. Despite the bleak conditions portrayed in the movie there are moments of wonder and comedy and great love.

Oprah has said that we are lucky just to be born in North America. All the women in this movie were strong willful characters like many Indian women they accepted their fate BUT they still made choices. Lisa Ray's character still fell in love despite her destiny. Despite her circumstances she was so mentally spiritually emotionally and overall more evolved than John's character.One even feels empathy towards him as a man he is so out of touch with reality...he lives life according to his idealism. This is how he copes with struggles in his life. He choices are also constrained by circumstance From an outsiders point of view John's character seems to have it all respect a sweet mom Waheeda. I loved WR in Guide that is one of my favorites. His world shatters when he learns of his fathers secrets...Lisa's character knows her fate yet she takes the initiative to follow her heart. As a Canadian I am really proud of WATER I usually do not watch these kinds of movies but sometimes a wake up call is necessary especially when we are wrapped up in our own selfish needs. Water is masterpiece...I am proud of Lisa Ray for taking the time and actually learning about the craft of acting.".

When he dies we watch as Chuyia's bangles are broken with a stone from her wrist by her mother and her head is shaved. The next thing we witness is Chuyia arriving at a house where she has been placed to be among other widows a curse in that culture.Chuyia an impish child of great vitality is the youngest among all the women that occupy that unhappy home. Shakuntala who appears to be in charge of the house likes the girl but she wants to impress the child in what is expected of her. Chuyia also meets the beautiful Kalyani a ravishing creature who spends most of her time by herself in a room on the second floor. Kalyani and Chuyia bond because both have experienced the same fate as the older girl came to the house also when she was young.Kalyani is also the one that is bringing some money into the house because she is being exploited by the older women as a prostitute. Kalyani is taken at night for trysts with local wealthy men. When Narayan the young handsome man from a rich family discovers the beautiful Kalyani it's love at first sight. Kalyani also experiences for the first time a kind of love she never knew existed. Unfortunately their love is doomed from the start. Changes are coming to India quickly by way of the great work of Ghandi who is the inspiration for the liberation of the country.Deepa Mehta the director of Water has created a film of exquisite beauty that is not afraid to tackle the hypocrisy of how widows are treated cruelly by their society. Even though the action took place as India was being liberated from the British it appears not much has changed since this practice is still exists. Ms. Mehta's film deals with the injustice in ways that surprise us. Other film makers wouldn't dare to go where Ms. Mehta goes perhaps with the exception of Mira Nair another Indian director whose films take a different approach to their culture.The best thing in the film is young Sarala who as Chuyia steals our hearts. We respond to her plight because to our way of thinking it's inconceivable to subject a young girl to be banished from her family in the way this girl does. It's cruel to allow these children to be married when they would be better off being children and stealing a childhood from them.The lovely Lisa Ray plays Kalyani a woman of such radiant beauty that she sticks out like a sore thumb from the company of these unfortunate dwellers of that unhappy house. John Abraham is perfect as Narayan with his handsome looks. Seema Biswas is also effective as the only woman who is kind to the young Chuyia.Deepa Mehta shows again she is not afraid to explore any subjects that are deemed taboo in her culture. Ms. Mehta continues to surprise with each new movie.".

In it it creates widows out of girls who are purportedly the reincarnations of wives whose husband died and because of this must life a life in abject poverty incommunicado with the outside world maltreated by people in general. Why this occurs can be blamed on the people who abused such laws and decided to use them for their benefits two of the characters in WATER a film that vibrates not only color but passions just underneath the surface will question that in their own ways. Shakuntala Didi a woman who at first seems hovering on only onenote  bitterness  and Narayana the heir of a wealthy family who has met Mohandas Gandhi the movie is set in 1938 and has taken in his liberal approach that widows too must experience love  the postulate of tolerance.While Shakuntala and Narayana meet furtively early in the movie they don't interact until much later and the catalyst for this to happen is a little girl named Chuyia who has been brought to the ashram to live as a widow. She cannot comprehend the scope of the kind of life that awaits her and to see her getting her long hair shaved and her spirits progressively crushed even when she openly defies the prison that surrounds her is painful. Even so her presence lights up the ashram in more ways than one. Without knowing she upsets the ordinance of the ashram and suggests the spirit of unrest and dissatisfaction that must be in the minds of people who can't understand why do they have to be the forgotten ones.Chuyia forges a quick friendship with a young woman named Kalyani and by accident both meet Narayana who is taken with Kalyani. What he doesn't know is that she is being pimped to other men who will pay for her services and keep the ashram running by the monstrous Manorma who runs the ashram like a brothel while preaching the laws of Manu. It's the doublestandard of life in the ashram where the story denounces the atrocity of this law it forces women into a segregated society while the prettier ones are laid out as bait for those who will pay money for them. He and Kalyani do fall in love but her situation is a barrier more to her than to him because she feels like damaged goods even when in an emotional scene he lets her know she is the one he loves.But the legacy of abuse is strong and it now threatens to hover over Chuyia. Shakuntala who throughout the movie experiences the most character change while barely emoting over her smooth face dovetails her storyline with Narayana and in a moment of rebellion underlying a subtle feminism takes action to ensure that if not for herself at least for the new generation there might be some hope. WATER touches some very delicate subject matter at this point but it's done with so much taste that the horror becomes more real. More so when realizing that this practice still occurs today in the 21st Century and that even though times apparently have changed they haven't. Even so WATER is an important film that through its overwhelming beauty and lush setting expresses the casual horror of religious abuse  a cry against this ultimately inhumane system.".

But I do not remember my widowed aunts grandmothers or cousins being treated in the way depicted in this movie. None of them was banished to live in an 'ashram'. They stayed at home and led a quite but dignified life. A cousin of mine who lost her husband in an accident was remarried by her parents! I am not an ultrarightist.

But I do not remember my widowed aunts grandmothers or cousins being treated in the way depicted in this movie. None of them was banished to live in an 'ashram'. They stayed at home and led a quite but dignified life. A cousin of mine who lost her husband in an accident was remarried by her parents! I am not an ultrarightist. I too deplore the harassment Deepa Mehta faced while shooting in Varanasi. But through this review I wanted to give a balanced picture especially to the western movie goers.";

	schema:reviewBody "OK so Water didn't win the Oscar. Neither did Lagaan Salaam Bombay or Mother India. Doesn't matter. Deepa Mehta's third installment in the trilogy on the elemental series after Fire and Earth if you could ignore the formulaic Bollywood Hollywood is a superlative cinematic experience. Its sheer sanctity and authenticity bowls you over.Water is an extraordinary film for several reasons. Firstly being its stark theme and its virgin treatment. Water is the same film that Deepa Mehta started in the year 2000 with Akshay Kumar and Shabana Azmi for which Shabana even shaved her head. The film was later stalled due to political interference by the moral police. The film was restarted with John Abraham and Seema Biswas in 2004 and subsequently shot in Sri Lanka with a fake title of 'Full Moon' to avoid any more attention and interference. The film is set in India in the preindependence era of 1940s but primarily talks about the plight of widows in the country then.The film shocks in its first frame itself where it reads the laws for widows from the sacred scriptures that says 'A widow should either burn in the pyre of her husband or marry her husband's younger brother or lead a life of selfrestraint and be long suffering until death'. Cut in to a scene when an endearing 7year old girl is told that she has turned a widow. If childmarriage was not an issue enough she will now be forced to shave off her head and lead her entire life with selfrestraint in an ashram for no fault of hers.This ashram is headed by Madhumati Manorama where widows of all ages are abandoned by their families. 7yearold Chuyia Sarla is one such unfortunate innocent child. Over here she forms a bond with Shakuntala Seema Biswas. Kalyani Lisa Ray is the only widow from the ashram who is allowed to keep her hair as her beauty and body is set on sale to obtain funds to run the ashram. Narayan John Abraham a follower of Gandhian principles who lives in the same village falls in love with Kalyani. Going against her mother's Waheeda Rehman wish he decides to marry Kalyani. But in a strange turn of incident life changes for him.One element that adds authenticity to Water is its choice of Hindi language. The director despite being from Canada doesn't get carried away by other filmmakers in the league who make movies for an international audience and use English language in a complete Hindi setting that looks both forced and fake. Add to it Anurag Kashyup's chaste Hindi dialogues that enriches the feel of the film. The art direction of the film with the setting of the 40s is simply impeccable. One hasn't seen a more credible ambiance than this created in a film since Mira Nair's Kama Sutra. A.R.Rahman's music does justice to the film. No musician can strike a chord with the period setting of the film like Rahman.Deepa Mehta's welletched screenplay and strongly defined characters makes you live every scene every moment in the film. Just for example you feel remorse for a 90yearold widow played by Vidula Javalgekar in the film who craves for sweets throughout the film and the last time she remembers she had had them was during her marriage at the age of 7.A highpoint of the film is its climax. While many filmmakers start their narratives strongly and grab your attention they tend to lose focus towards the climax and are unable to handle it skillfully. Deepa Mehta maintains a consistency in her film and gives a good culmination to the plot with a connection to Mahatma Gandhi.You are simply amazed by the vision of Deepa Mehta for casting a mainstream commercial actor like John Abraham who is a youth icon in jeans and glares in a dhoticlad role of a Gandhi follower in 1938. And whatever the critics have to say about him John does justice to his character. You heart goes out for the charming Lisa Ray as an unfortunate widow trapped by her ill fate. With this film one wonders why don't we get to see more of this actress who has tremendous potential if tapped appropriately. Seema Biswas brings as much conviction to her character as much she does to her role by shaving off her head for the film. This is perhaps her best performance since Bandit Queen. Raghubir Yadav as the eunuch is as dependable as always.But the highlight of the film are two players. If you don't have a keen eye perhaps you won't recognize Manorama the vamp of yesteryear films who makes her return with this film. The gaudy actress known for her boisterous roles in the 70s arguably gives her career's best performance till date. Her body language dialect and vicious command as the madam of the house are outstanding. And last but not the least is the child actress Sarla. If you thought Ayesha Kapoor of Black was the best child artist you ever witnessed on screen check Sarla and you will know how naturally she seeps into the character of Chuyia. The young girl almost lives her part without any inhibitions or ambiguity whatsoever.Ironically Water is one of the most undiluted films of all times. Take a divine dip and you might perhaps get rinsed of all your cinematic sins.".

Among them is a young beautiful and rather European looking widow. There is a love story with a handsome idealistic man who is willing to break taboos to marry a widow. Set in 1938 the film tries to portray the conflict with old traditions and modernity. Gandhi even gets a cameo.

Knowing the labour of love and courage it was for Deepa Mehta her sets were burned down in protest on location in India and she had to eventually move everything to Sri Lanka makes it also extremely poignant. I was at a showing where there was a deep shocked silence at the end of it all when we realized that 31 million Hindi widows in India are kept in appalling circumstances such as those depicted on screen. Their families no longer want to keep them and some of these widows have been 'married' as very young children. As one of the characters says in the movie it is all about the money in fundamentalism. Faith and truth and God are made more compassionate in the emerging era of Ghandi the film takes place in the 30'sand some of the old beliefs are being swept away when Ghandi states that God is not truth but Truth is God. The leads are well cast though a little whited up for North American audiences. Some of the scenes are joyful and the use of colour is stunning. There wasn't a dry eye in the screening I was at and I won't introduce spoilers as this is a film that should be seen without any plot insight. The locations are beautiful and so is the supporting cast. The powerful message here is that all fundamentalism is intrinsically about the control of a few who interpret their Holy Books to suit their purposes while millions struggle in degradation and powerlessness. 9 out of 10. Why is this not even nominated for Best Foreign Film? Brava Deepa!!".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a poignant and beautiful movie. Although filmed in Sri Lanka the venue is Varanasi a holy city in India. The use of water throughout as river rain and other ways and the cinematography are exquisite. We see the plight of widows in 1938 in this part of India through the eyes of an 8 year old child widow Chuiya. All the characters  the other widows where Chuiya is sent to spend the rest of her life and the others in the society including Narayan a young man who falls in love with a young widow Kalyani his family and friends and the Hindu priest who acts as a glue between the scriptures and the masses are well done. The acting is subtle and sensitive. The relationship between Kalyani and Narayan is shown beautifully and with restraint as are the relationships between the different widows. Even a sad movie like this has its lighter moments the humor is used well. Deepa Mehta has done a great job as a director.I have a couple of complaints although minor ones. First Lisa Ray who acts as the young widow Kalyani was the wrong choice for this role. She does not look Indian even though she learned the gestures and body language of rural Indian widows. Ray is a Canadian with an Indian born parent and she does a fine job with the Hindi language. However she does not look 'Kalyani' an Indian woman.The second problem I have with this movie is that it creates an impression that all widows in India are treated like the characters in this movie and that the situation has not changed since 1938 I doubt that the situation was like this in ALL parts of India even in the 1930's.Child marriages were made illegal several decades ago soon after India became independent. One has to remember that this movie shows a certain segment of a society in a small geographical region of the country. Unfortunately the tendency of viewers is to generalize about the whole country and that is the only major negative I see about this movie. The other part is about the Hindu religion itself. Every religion has its abusers and we see some of them in this movie. It can create a wrong and biased picture of the religion. May be the resistance to the making of this movie in India had something to do with it. I understand that it was eventually released in India. I don't know what the reaction upon viewing the movie was.As a work of art as a story this is a beautifully made movie. I would highly recommend it but I warn the viewer not to generalize about a country or a culture or a religion based on this one movie. Just enjoy the unfolding of the story on the screen.".

The movie starts with a verse from an ancient hindu 'granth' scripture manu and shows how widowed womens are left to die by their families where they survive in some 'sarai'rented house reciting 'ramnaam' devoid of all the worldly pleasures. The only hope for them is to die and get freed from this vicious circle of life and death ?? The movie brilliantly portrays the characters of these women. Through the character of Chuhiya meaning rat in Hindi the director shows how these little girls are first married at this tender age and when their husbands die they are left on themselves in one of these sarai. The character of Chuhiya is most touching of all portraying her initial hope that one day her 'amma' mummmy will come and take her out of that hell and then how she matures and starts to understand that the sarai and white clothes were her fate now. While the character of Chuhiya portrays the initial days of a widow in this new world of their own the character of Patiraji portrays the final days of a widow waiting for the 'yamaraj' god of death to come and free her and so is another touching character. I would recommend this movie for the brilliant direction and novel story. See for yourself the truth dont know how much ...".

The third film in a trilogy that explores religious hypocrisy Canadian filmmaker Deepak Mehta's Water is an eloquent protest against the maltreatment of Indian widows some as young as seven years old who are condemned to live a life of penitence and deprivation. The shooting of Water in India was interrupted in 2000 by Hindu fundamentalists who staged protests destroyed sets and forced the production to shut down and move to Sri Lanka.Set in India in 1938 along the River Ganges Water chronicles the lives of several widows against the backdrop of the rise to prominence of Mahatma Gandhi and his nonviolent campaign for liberation. Recently widowed 8year old Chuyia played by the outstanding Sri Lankan actress Sarala is sent by her family to a house for widows where her head is shaved and she must wear a white sari to let others know of her status. Chuyia meets the overbearing Madhumati Manorma the mother figure who raises money for the ashram by sending young girls across the River Ganges to be prostitutes. She is gently opposed by Shakuntala Seema Biswas who tries to protect the girls without openly denying the traditions.Kalyani Lisa Ray is one of the girls used by Madhumati but she still manages to maintain a youthful innocence and beauty. Chuyia and Kalyani become friends and while walking in the village accidentally meet Narayana a young law student John Abraham who is active in the movement for Indian liberation. He fiercely opposes the hypocrisy involved in isolating widows and condemning them as untouchables. He tells Kalyani that the issue is one not of religion but of money One less mouth to feed he says four less saris and a free corner in the house. Disguised as religion it's just about money Narayana and Kalyani fall in love and he asks her to marry him in spite of the opposition of his family and society a situation that leads to unfortunate consequences.In Water Mehta employs the humanist tradition of Satyajit Ray with expressive Indian music enhancing the emotions of the characters but also bodily lifts the character of Auntie from Pather Panchali and the movie struggles for an original style. While Water is beautiful to look at and embodies an important message it is ultimately defeated by a very conventional style a clichd and manipulative plot and some larger than life characters who never come alive as real human beings.".

	schema:headline " A different side to Anna Sten";
	schema:reviewBody "Ukrainianborn Anna Sten was brought to Hollywood by Samuel Goldwyn to be the next Greta Garbo but her career didn't quite pan out that way. I'd seen WE LIVE AGAIN 1934 an Anna Sten vehicle adapted from a Tolstoy epic and I didn't care much for it. I hadn't heard great things about NANA 1934 Sten's Hollywood debut and was hesitant to check it out. But NANA's not too bad and it's easy to see Anna Sten's appeal.NANA is a period piece based on the novel by Emile Zola. Sten plays a Parisian streetwalker who is discovered by a theatrical impresario and becomes a stage success before falling in love with a soldier and running afoul of his protective older brother. Anna Sten does alright in the lead role. She's a beautiful girl and her hardboiled performance is much different than her turn in WE LIVE AGAIN. Part Garbo part Marlene Dietrich she even talksings through a stage number smoking a cigarette.Sten has a noticeable accent like many other foreign imports but her acting isn't as bad as some people say. Sten's character is a selfconfident prostitute at ease with her place in Paris society. It's a lowenergy role. All she's really required to do is effortlessly seduce every man who looks at her and she seems to pull it off. She's certainly very attractive. The scene where she teases her new admirers in her dressing room has a sexy edge. Perhaps Anna Sten came off as too much of a DietrichGarbo standin without a style of her own.Lionel Atwill plays his usual antagonistic aristocrat though the fortyeightyearold Atwill is improbably cast as the older brother to twentysixyearold Phillips Holmes who plays the young soldier who falls in love with Sten. The cast also includes Jessie Ralph as Sten's personal maid Richard Bennett as the great impresario and Reginald Owen as his assistant. The film does suffer from a lack of star power with no Fredric March or Gary Cooper to shoulder some of the weight. Anna Sten gets the spotlight to herself in what is meant to be a starmaking role but her name alone wouldn't be enough to draw an audience.Mae Clarke one of my favorite actresses from the 1930s was a big reason I gave NANA a shot. She plays one of Sten's prostitute buddies along with Muriel Kirkland. Clarke does a good job but it's a minor role. Her performances in several early1930s films are refreshingly naturalistic but she was eventually reduced to oftenuncredited bit parts. Viewers may know Mae Clarke from THE PUBLIC ENEMY 1931 or FRANKENSTEIN 1931 but I'd also recommend her work in WATERLOO BRIDGE 1931 THREE WISE GIRLS 1932 THE MAN WITH TWO FACES 1934 PENGUIN POOL MURDER 1932 and LADY KILLER 1933.NANA was directed by Dorothy Arzner the only female director working in Hollywood at the time. Set in 1860s Paris it's a decent period piece. Good production values nice costumes and a tragic romance. Better than I expected and a pretty good showcase for Goldwyn's exotic new discovery Anna Sten. Unfortunately audiences in 1934 didn't take to NANA or Sten and she never achieved stardom.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film has gone down in history as one of the great turkeys of all time and to a certain extent that reputation is justified. Anna Sten the migr Russian starlet Samuel Goldwyn tried to build up as the next Garbo was a beautiful woman and her English diction wasn't as bad as it's made to be. The problem is that there was no way Hollywood in 1934 could do justice to Emile Zola's scathing account of sexual debauchery in Second Empire Paris. The nudity is gone most of the lovers are gone the lesbian relationship with Satin Mae Clarke is barely hinted at. Nana as played by Sten is a far more sympathetic character than she is in the book. She shoots herself rather than rotting to death from smallpox a euphemism for syphilis? No mention is made of her illegitimate child or the path of death and destruction she leaves in her wake. The film is an interesting if dated curio worth watching at least once but proof that not every film from Hollywood's Golden Age is a gem.".

Of course what comes to mind is the opera La Traviata by Verdi which in turn was based on Alexandre Dumas the younger's novel La Dame aux Camelias and I daresay the story has been told many times of illfated deception of too many lovers.Anna whose spontaneous manner reminded me of Miriam Hopkins' strong style of delivery is true to life and far more believable than Garbo whose acting came across as stilted. There are traces of Dietrich mannerisms in Anna's facial expressions but her beautiful features are truly awesome a real beauty that I never tire of seeing.This is a movie that I can look forward to viewing several times and not get tired of it.

	schema:headline " Forget Zola and Garbo. Think protofeminist film by 1st female director starring prettier actress with a light accent.";
	schema:reviewBody "Fascinating period piece both in terms of the Setting of the film and when it was made. It's a rather early talky made by the only female director of the time. The original director began his career as a French art director and was fired and replaced by Arzner. Maybe he is responsible for the grand production values. Dorothy Arzner had been a film editor and even a cinematographer before becoming the first female member of the Film Directors Guild. She uses some great camera movements and segues that were very innovative for the era.The music is very good. There is a great use of drums to create and build tension.I didn't even think of Zola's Nana so it's loose connection didn't bother me. Anna Sten is gorgeous. There are some references to homosexuality between the women. But it's very subtle to modern viewers as required in 1930s when it might have been unheard of to the majority of viewers.This Nana is quite a feminist for the 1930s. She's gay in the original meaning of the word and refuses to exist in her preordained social class. She is an independent woman who has affairs with different men throughout the picture without necessarily loving them. She gets drunk. She works hard. She parties. What woman today hasn't done that? But in the 1930s? Scandalous! And the men all blame her for their bad choices because she doesn't fall in with them or obey them. One of Nana's lovers forbids her to drink more alcohol and she says You what!!?? He has to soft pedal it.She constantly takes insults and keeps going. The old men in the picture want to ruin her for loving outside her class. She gives it right back to them. She tells one old fart You made me? Well I paid you! Meaning she paid him with her youth beauty and sex. And his price was expensive the wrinkly old dick. It is a much more sympathetic view of Nana than the self righteous and sexist Zola could have dreamed of. So many men just can't believe that a woman might just enjoy life outside of marrying and having children. Arzner knew a woman could. I think Sten's accent and acting was criticized heavily when the film first came out because the acting in the silent era was so different and critics weren't used to the new style in talkies. Also foreign accents were initially not well received. Garbo had been a silent film star and was accepted as a transitional star. Sten didn't have that to carry her into the new medium. Viewed without any bias over Garbo Sten is very good and in some ways seems to have a more modern style comparable more to Olivia de Haviland. Her eyes are super sexy.".

I have to admit that I thought about turning it off a few times too but it never was quite bad enough to merit thisthough it sure came close!! In light of the general view that the film was a major debacle when it debuted I was actually surprised to see one reviewer gave it a 9.As for the plot and how it differs from the novel by Emile Zola I'll leave you to read over tracyfigueira's excellent review. I haven't read the book but knew enough about it to realize that the plot was dramatically different from Zola's. One of the reasons is that although they never say it it's very obvious that Nana was a prostitute and had slept with half of Paris! And her friends were also common prostitutes as well. Yet Sam Goldwyn insisted that Nana be played like a combination of Marlene Dietrich and the Singing Nun! Oy.When the tale of this trollop with a heart of gold debuted in 1934 critics howled at the horrible acting of newcomer Anna Sten and the public avoided this bloated epic like the plague. In fact for years consensus was that Sten was a horrible actress and her performance convinced me that the people of the 30s were very astuteshe was a terrible actress. Her accent was difficult to cut through and her acting was amateurish throughout. However I also feel that to blame the picture's demise squarely on her was unfair. Even if Ms. Sten had been competent and I remind you she was NOT the writing was just awful and anyone uttering such claptrap would look ridiculous! Plus Goldwyn's insistence that Sten be treated like an even more bewitching creature than Dietrich and Garbo was silly and destined to failureand making Sten look even more ridiculous as she tried in vain to act that alluring. Heck when Sten sang if you can call it that before she even finished this godawful number the men in the audience who had previously never even heard of her all began behaving like a Tex Avery cartoon wolf! No one is THAT sexy and desirable!! In addition to all this silliness and bad acting the film also suffers from bad acting by many of the costarsparticularly Nana's hooker friends. And to make things worse the film is also dreadfully dull and derivativelooking like a knockoff of several of Garbo's and Dietrich's films especially CAMILLE and BLONDE VENUS. See this film if you are curious about Stenotherwise avoid it like the plague.By the way and I know this will sound VERY catty but in watching this film I kept asking myself if perhaps Ms. Sten and Mr. Goldwyn have some other vested interest in each other. I know this sounds petty but his insistence on a huge publicity campaign to create an American career and three failed big budget US films does make you wonder why he brought her to this country to begin with or kept her here after her performance in NANA.".

Although DeNiro is great and in certain scenes definitely shows his superiority as an actor Penn overall gives the better performance. With a more complex character yet simple he is very simpleminded but a complex character his performance is very good. Although Demi Moore really didn't have a big role she was convincing as a local woman in the small town. John C.

	schema:headline " A pleasant comedy with fine acting and an occasionally laughoutloud script by David Mamet. I think its rating deserves to be between 6.0 and 6.6 stars.";
	schema:reviewBody "Some movies become forgotten over the years and We're No Angels is one of them. It's not a great comedy but it's not a bad one either. It's far more serious and moralistic than I had ever imagined and Robert De Niro and Sean Penn essentially run around posing funny faces for the camera throughout whilst the Catholic religion is used as a structural backdrop. It's a very different sort of role for De Niro whose comedy is usually a bit more sophisticated. Here he barely talks at all and when he does it's usually harsh barking or screaming or frustrated whispers. It's not De Niro's most memorable role but it's certainly an unusual one.A lot of the movie focuses on mishaps and misconceptions as all of the movies from this genre do. It bears resemblance to last year's School of Rock about a loser who was mistaken for a teacher. This time the loser is equal to a pair of two escaped convicts and the teacher position is likewise that of priests.The story all begins with Ned De Niro and Jimmy Penn escaping from a northern jail circa 1930. After heading for the Canadian border they find themselves pursued by a ruthless jail warden and a town of dogooders. Luckily for the duo right before they come to the Canadian border they are mistaken for two longlost Catholic priests Fathers Brown Penn and O'Reilly De Niro. After given an introduction to the area by a fellow priest Hoyt Axton they decide to hide out for a while using their new personas. No one would ever suspect a priest right?The problem is that Fathers Brown and O'Reilly are supposed to be two of the smartest priests alive having written a controversial book about the true meaning of the chapter Revelations in the Bible. So you can imagine the fear that Jimmy experiences when he is asked to lead the church in a pray prior to a meal.Meanwhile the mandatory romance is inserted into the movie using Demi Moore's single rough overprotective mother as the love angle for De Niro's character. Demi spits out an unconvincing northern accent as De Niro stares at her a lot with critical eyes and tries to get her into bed. The romance is not necessary but it seems a lot more worthwhile than most of the romances in some of these films.The movie is one of the most forgotten I have ever seen I'd never really heard of it prior to purchasing the newlyissued DVD. But I figured De Niro and Penn couldn't be that bad and I was right.I think part of the reason so many people like to ignore it is that it doesn't poke fun at religion. It doesn't make the clergymen out to be strange idiots. Rather it makes the two escaped convicts seem outofplace in a heartwarming place. The spirituality affects Penn's character Jimmy and his final decision on the bridge that separates Canada from America is one that we have sensed was long coming since his fascination in the church grew.De Niro and Penn have two of the best faces in Hollywood and a movie like We're No Angels uses this to its advantage. Making up for the long gaps of laughter the director Neil Jordan focuses more on his two lead actors and their reactions to situations. Most of the time throughout the film De Niro shrugs his shoulders a lot and emits low agreeable groans from his throat in response to questions while Penn looks confused and bewildered. There's a great scene where an eagertoplease clergyman John C. Reilly asks Father Brown something about his book and Penn sort of stares at him for a few moments with searching eyes trying to find a way out of the situation. For some reason the mistaken identities setup has been a longtime fascination for Hollywood. Just look at Some Like it Hot Tootsie Nuns on the Run Sister Act School of Rock etc. I think it's because we can all relate to a lot of the situations that the characters go through and a lot of the embarrassment they suffer. We like to watch them ease their way out of dangerous areas and lie through their teeth.We're No Angels is one of the better examples of this formula executed quite well. It's not a terrific movie but the actors are and the script by David Mamet comes up with its own occasionally hilarious segments that make the movie uneven but a lot more fun than you might expect. No it's not great but it's just funny  and sweet  enough to recommend.3.55 stars.John Ulmer".

What it really is about is how the Power Of God can improve the lives of four people who really needed him. Ned Robert DeNiro Jim Sean Penn Molly Demi Moore and her daughter.

This led him down a path that God had planned for him which is learning how to become a Priest and influence others in his new identity as Father Brown. Ned gains the least of the four Although getting Demi Moore is not bad but his role is the most important because he is the one who jumps in and tries to save the little girl and the presence of the statute of the Virgin Mary saves both of them. My favorite part of the film is where the girl speaks to The Translator Wallace Shawn and says they are conv... before going to sleep and he thought they were converts not convicts. He said is this true? Ned says don't good works count for anything? When he said converts instead of convicts Ned said we were born Lutherans and The Translator said God Forgives You. That part followed by the ending where Ned and Molly go to Canada and he hints to her about plans and she says what plans? And he says all in good time while Ned remains behind to become a monk. It shows the different paths that Ned and Jim will take while still being free. 1010 Stars.".

However it's easy to overlook the fact that six of his first ten pictures were comedies often soso farces like The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight.After reaching his zenith as an actor and performing his most famous roles Taxi Driver Raging Bull Deer Hunter et al it was the dark comedies of The King of Comedy and Brazil that led him back into the genre. The decent but unremarkable Midnight Run followed then this.We're No Angels has a title reminiscent of some Cagneyesque piece indeed it was based on a play and previously made in 1955 with Bogart yet also sounds like the kind of vehicle you could imagine Laurel and Hardy starring in. Fittingly it's set in the 1930s and Penn's simpleminded expressions especially in the final scene are almost Laurelesque. But even Laurel and Hardy couldn't string an amusing featurelength picture out of two escaped convicts as the less than great Pardon Us would attest so De Niro and Penn are on a hiding to nothing.We're No Angels is well acted well directed and pretty well written. But it's a comedy with no laughs. A dramady if you will. Yet after years of reading about this as De Niro's nadir then... it's not that bad. Sure he does mug a little too often in the vague approximation of a comic performance but never enough to really grate. It's charming at times engaging at others and all the cast work well. Just don't expect to crack your face.".

	schema:reviewBody "We're No Angels 1989  out of 4 Remake of the 1955 film has Robert DeNiro and Sean Penn playing escaped convicts who hide out as priests in a small town where they try to sneak across the border into Canada. Most of the reviews you read for this film will probably be negative but I've always enjoyed what the movie has to offer even though there's no way of denying that it could have and should have been a lot better than it turned out. I think the biggest problem with the film is the direction of Jordan who just wasn't right for the material. This is suppose to be a comedy yet you wouldn't know it because Jordan handles the material so dark that it's rather hard to get many laughs. We've get some rather strong tones on religion and even some strong violence which just doesn't sit too well in a comedy. Even the entire atmosphere of the film is rather dark which is a staple of Jordan but again that wasn't really needed in this film. What does work are the performances by DeNiro and Penn who are excellent together. Playing dumb is never an easy thing but both men pull this off remarkably well which is very important since most of the laughs come from them not understanding anything to do with religion yet they're suppose to be priests. The two men's facial expressions is what works the best because the look on their faces when they're put on the spot are just flawless as is their constant begging and pleading for various things throughout the movie. Demi Moore has a supporting role which brings in more darkness that really isn't needed but Bruno Kirby and John C. Reilly turn in nice supporting performances with Reilly really standing out as another priest obsessed with Penn. The laughs throughout the film are certainly minor but to me the film still works well thanks to the terrific performances. You really don't expect to see DeNiro and Penn in a movie like this but they both pull it off very well and make it worth viewing.".

I have to admit that WERE NO ANGELS isnt a career highlight for the man who starred in TAXI DRIVER  THE DEER HUNTER  RAGING BULL and ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA but hes by no means bad . Neither is Sean Penn  who at the time was better known as a B movie actor who was previously married to Madonna and who liked to punch journalists who took his photo without asking . The only two performances I can describe as bad are Demi Moore whos even more unconvincing here than she usually is because shes playing a character that requires acting  and veteran Irish award winning actor Ray McNally who is playing a sadistic caricture of a prison warder . WERE NO ANGELS suffers from being a comedy where director Neil Jordan and screenwriter David Mamets bring far too much dark oppresive atmosphere to the proceedings . The film opens with an execution and a rather violent gunbattle where people dont simply fall down dead but leap about with blood splattering everywhere which seems out of place in a comedy . Mind you as comedies go DeNiro has appeared in a lot worse since".

Sean Penn is little better using a wideeyed lostlittleboy expression throughout the film in an attempt to convey his character's wisesimpleton persona. Demi Moore can't act  period. The characters played by Wallace Shawn and Ken Buhay are completely superfluous to the story and so on. Ray McAnally and John C.

They both underplayed their roles as dimwitted convicts and to me  that hurt the picture immensely. I'm so use to seeing them completely annihilate a role with their raw intensity that seeing them barely acting or acting not in their norm just ruined it for me.Still it was great to see these two legends act together. Demi Moore as Molly was a little better. As a tough singlemom trying to make a living for her and her deafmute child. She over acted but it was okay. She was a little more believable than De Niro in their scenes. Had De Niro acted like he should have he would have blown away Moore in their scenes. Another thing that for me didn't ring through was Moore's and De Niro's socalled chemistry. There wasn't any! No sparks no nothing! A big yawn! So the ending does not ring through at all for me.Hoyt Axton as Father Levesque was great casting. He looked the part and his scenes rang true with me. The late Bruno Kirby as a guiltridden deputy was a little amusing. Again I found it hard to believe he and Demi were getting it on It was more amusing to me to see Kirby and De Niro in the same scene and envisioned them from way back in The GodfatherPart 21974 as Young Corleone and young Clemenza.The late Ray McNally who by the way this film is dedicated to in memory did a great small role as the warden. He was intense and no BS in his pursuit of the escaped cons. James Russo as 'Bobby' the main badguy convict was brilliant. He oozed evil personified. Reminded me of James Remar's Ganz from 48Hrs 1982 Yes he over acted but it was necessary since both De Niro  Penn were so underplaying it.And last but least Wallace Shawn as the translator and John C. Reilly as the young monk entranced and impressed with Penn's 'Father Brown' were excellent. So all in all these bit character actors made the film better than the main stars! What a shame because had Sean and Robert act the way they naturally do they would have blown away everyone and stolen the picture. Oh well...there is always the original with BogartRay and Ustinov.".

The SergeantMajor who runs things at the camp Harry Andrews has a novel theory about rehabilitation  break down the wills of the inmates by repeatedly running them up and down a sandy hill built in the middle of the compound then rebuild them as model soldiers.  Despite the martinettype attitude Connery and each of his fellow inmates begins to rebel against Andrews and his new sadistic assistant Ian Hendry culminating in the death of one of the inmates and the consequent attempt to cover up the incident.In blackandwhite Lumet has done a remarkable job of giving the location the feel of hellonearth and his noted ability to work with actors is visible here.  Connery is excellent in the secondbest performance of his career the best was his 1973 performance in The Offence also with Lumet directing as a career soldier whose not all that certain that the Army's outdated discipline is worth anything.  Equally good performances are turned in by Davis as a West Indian soldier who takes the racist barbs of his jailers and rebels in his own unique way Watson as a brutish inmate who begins to develop a conscience Ian Bannen as a sympathetic guard Lynch as a sensitive man not meant for the army or jail Andrews and Michael Redgrave as the ineffectual doctor who finds courage at the crucial moment.Probably the best performance however is turned in by Hendry as the deeply insecure sadistic loose cannon of a guard who truly sets events in motion. At once his performance is villanous but with an edge of immaturity that makes it almost difficult to hate him  until the end when the other characters really begin to appreciate just how dangerous he is.Unfortunately this film was ignored by the Oscars  a tragedy especially from some actors who havehad generally been ignored by the Academy and other awards groups i.e. Connery Hendry Andrews Davis.  It did however win an award at the Cannes Film Festival for Ray Rigby's superb screenplay.You may need to listen close to pick up some of the dialogue but by all means see it if you get the chance.".

	schema:reviewBody "I can't think of a film less appreciated than this one.  The tragedy of THE HILL began with its horribly botched release in 1965  a textbook example of studio stupidity.  On the other side of the equation film purists who were worshipping at the alter of goofs like Godard's Alphaville turned up their noses at this movie because it starred the lightweight commercial actor Sean Connery.  Jesus wept.It is absolutely amazing that this movie is so uncompromisingly British while being directed by the socalled New York director Sidney Lumet.  The man's a genius.  And less you wonder I lived for three years in England 196669 and am a World War II buff so I have reason to testify to its authenticity.  And for Sean Connery at the height of his popularity He was the Number One box office draw the year this movie came out to play the character of SGT. Joe Roberts sans toupee and without the typical movie star out for his character  see the movie and compare it to THE LAST CASTLE and you'll know what I mean  is nothing short of stunning.Can you tell I love this movie?  There's not a false moment in it.  And the acting!  Besides Connery there are great performances by Harry Andrews Ian Bannen Ian Hendry Ossie Davis...and oh yeah every other person in the cast.  Is it hard to understand the accents sometimes?  Sure.  But it's nothing that can't be overcome by simply paying attention when you watch this film.And what does this movie say about the military mindset the lust for power racism the duality of heroism and cowardice the dangers of unquestioning loyalty and more?

	onyx:emotionText "I can't think of a film less appreciated than this one.  The tragedy of THE HILL began with its horribly botched release in 1965  a textbook example of studio stupidity.  On the other side of the equation film purists who were worshipping at the alter of goofs like Godard's Alphaville turned up their noses at this movie because it starred the lightweight commercial actor Sean Connery.  Jesus wept.It is absolutely amazing that this movie is so uncompromisingly British while being directed by the socalled New York director Sidney Lumet.  The man's a genius.  And less you wonder I lived for three years in England 196669 and am a World War II buff so I have reason to testify to its authenticity.  And for Sean Connery at the height of his popularity He was the Number One box office draw the year this movie came out to play the character of SGT. Joe Roberts sans toupee and without the typical movie star out for his character  see the movie and compare it to THE LAST CASTLE and you'll know what I mean  is nothing short of stunning.Can you tell I love this movie?  There's not a false moment in it.  And the acting!  Besides Connery there are great performances by Harry Andrews Ian Bannen Ian Hendry Ossie Davis...and oh yeah every other person in the cast.  Is it hard to understand the accents sometimes?  Sure.  But it's nothing that can't be overcome by simply paying attention when you watch this film.And what does this movie say about the military mindset the lust for power racism the duality of heroism and cowardice the dangers of unquestioning loyalty and more?  A whole helluva lot more than 99 of the other movies  and theatrical plays  that you'll ever see.I'll just finish by saying you are missing so much if you don't see this movie.  You'll come out of it seeing things a little differently than you ever did before.  And that's all you can possibly ask from a movie.Come on people.  Let's get in the votes on THE HILL to get it into the IMDB Top 250 movie list.  My vote  a 10.";

	schema:reviewBody "The Hill is obviously a movie that would interest former military personal WWII movie buffs and Sean Connery fans. However anybody interested to see some fine British character actors would not be disappointed with this too. There is Harry Andrews who is in his element playing a strutting disciplinarian SergeantMajor in a British Military prison during WWII. Ian Hendry who probably never played a more nasty role Ian Bannen as Staff Sgt Harris Ossie Davis Alfred Lynch Roy Kinnear Michael Redgrave and Jack Watson all in support.We are introduced to Sgt Major Bert Wilson played by Harry Andrews a tough as nails squared jawed career army man who takes pride in straightening out soldiers who have got out of line. A few months in his stockade and he will make new men of you fit to be in his majesties armythis is clear from the debriefing he gives to two soldiers about to be discharged from his custody. Also he does not care for the commandant at the camp who he regards as a desk jockey and nothing but a symbolic position. He is really in charge of what goes on in the camp he's respected by many of the inmates as tough but fair this is made clear later in the film. However with the intake of trooper Roberts a busted down Sgt Major disobeyed a direct order and struck a superior officer and a black soldier he lets his personal feelings and racial prejudice get the better of him. Wilson does things by the book and loathes Roberts also a career soldier who he thinks lets down everybody and undermines everything the army stands for. Jako King is a colored soldier who he thinks is not fit to were the uniform of a British soldier uncivilized etc. He makes it clear that he plans to break and humiliate Roberts and make him pay so he passes them over to the supervision of Staff Sgt Williams to drill Roberts King and the others over a huge man made hill of sand.Staff Sgt Williams is a sadist who revels in dishing out the indignities to the men now under his supervision. He also takes exception to Roberts who would normally be barking out orders so Williams takes the opportunity to stick it to a former superior officer. He's a bully and a coward too because he can't deal with people on equal terms but only when the odds are heavily stacked in his favor i.e. the beating he hands out to Roberts while two other staffs are holding him down and his persistent tormenting of Stevens who unlike Roberts is too frightened to stand up to him. Pvt Stevens who perhaps reminds him of his own shortcomings is weak and totally unsuited to the army. He is way over his head in a military stockade and so Williams singles him out in particular. There is a scene at night when the conditions are coolerStaff Williams stripped to the waist can only manage run up the hill 3 times before finding it all too much. Despite his obvious physical inadequacies he still drives the prisoners up and down again and again during the midday heat with them wearing full kit and battle fatigues until they are on the verge of exhaustion and heat stroke. Also there is Staff Sgt Harris who despises Williams and his methods but can't do anything because he is considered too soft by SgtMajor Wilson. Lastly the chief medical officer played by Michael Redgrave. Often in military or prison movies the medical officer either is respected and prepared to confront a superior officer on medical grounds or alternatively they are weak and useless. In this film he leans to the later as his medical is  turn you head and cough  OK fit for punishment!. He opts for the quiet life and really couldn't be bothered! Things had got well out of control before he started to assert himself and even then he was trying to save his own skin. In movies such as TAKE THE HIGH GROUND FULL METAL JACKET and OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN Richard Widmark J. Lee Emery and Louis Gossett Jr's characters respectively were mean SOB's who may have singled people out and even crossed the line but they did what they did for a reason not because they liked seeing people suffer.In the famous STANFORD EXPERIMENT in the 1970's after a few days it was called off because the jailers started to enjoy giving orders as well as punishing the prisoners. Jailers need a chain of command and close supervision too in this movie it's an interesting character study of when things get out of hand. Although there is no doubt that some real hard cases and rotten apples pass through these camps and probably deserve a difficult time the staff supervising have to be disciplined too. Once they bring in their personal feelings or else start to enjoy their work too much things start to break down. In addition it raises the spectacle that if personal grudges are held the jailers certainly have the upper hand!In this case we have sympathy with the inmates who seem to be nothing but malcontents misfits and chancers and we are led very quickly to have sympathy for Roberts who felt justified in his disobedience as his unit that he refused to lead was massacred. Also the stress of war time conditions back in WWII on individuals that led to AOL desertion or cowardice could now be described as post pneumatic stress disorder.The black and white print gives it a cold harsh WWII feel and a claustrophobic setting as much of the dialog was inside. It's well written with good directing great camera angles and close up shots too. I'd certainly recommend this movie!".

Unfortunately the movie going public wanted more James Bond and less Sean Connery at this point.The Hill is close to a perfect masterpiece of characterization and cinematography. Director Sidney Lumet opted for black and white in making The Hill and I think it enhances the stark surroundings of the British military stockade in North Africa. These are really the forgotten people of World War II.If Sean Connery could have gotten a chance for a Dirty Dozen type mission from the British army he would have taken it. His character is very similar to Charles Bronson's from that film. Bronson was an officer Connery a sergeant major Bronson shot Connery struck a superior with extremely good cause but their respective armies didn't see it that way.So now Sean is in a cell with four other prisoners all of varying character Roy Kinnear Ossie Davis Jack Watson and Alfred Lynch. Norman Bird is the commandant but the camp is really run as in all armies by the SergeantMajor Harry Andrews. Andrews has a special punishment for the prisoners called The Hill a specially constructed mound of sand about 200 feet high where they have to run up and down it with field pack in the desert heat.Andrews has the assistance of Staff Sergeant Ian Hendry who has his own sadistic bent quite apart from military punishment. When one of Connery's cellmates dies from punishment all hell threatens to break loose. One of the things that attracted Sean Connery to this film according to the Citadel Film series book on his work was the fact that it was unlike James Bond no glamorous locations no fancy wardrobe and absolutely no romance. This would give him the chance to show he could be something other than James Bond.Connery got rave reviews for playing former Sergeant Major Joe Roberts in The Hill and the rest of the cast Sidney Lumet assembled did likewise. Unfortunately the film failed at the box office. Connery remarked that without his name on it this would have been an art house special limited release type of work. But the public only wanted to see James Bond and it wasn't until The Anderson Tapes that Sean Connery finally got great reviews in a film that did well at the box office as well as the critics.Over 40 years after it was released The Hill now is considered a cinema masterpiece. Besides Connery my favorite performances are from Michael Redgrave as the medical officer who's not a strong man but steps to the plate when his duty is clear and from Ossie Davis as a cynical black soldier who finally grows tired of the institutional racism he finds and 'leaves' the army. You won't forget them Connery or The Hill once you see it.".

	schema:reviewBody "This was one of the most poinant lines of the film neatly summarising the general mood and feeling of the characters.A lot of people think that this is an antiwar film which to some degree it is. More accurately however it could be labelled an antiarmy film. Interestingly enough both views could be maintained without there being any real warfare displayed on the screen. This is a measure of how powerful the film is. The fighting which we see is actually between the various prison officers and convicts. The film does not simply divide them into opposing groups but rather explores the differences and tensions between the people who are in power and those who are subject to it.Like 'Full Metal Jacket' many years later this movie is a condemnation of the dehumanising process soldiers are forced to go through in order to survive the army. Military prison as we learn is a further step down into the merciless and brutal world of the army.If 'The Hill' was made today the violence we see would undoubtedly be more explicit and obvious. However this does not take away anything from the original  as it is the mental torture more than the physical suffering which is portrayed so well in Lumet's work. It has aged fairly well mainly due to the accomplished and original way the film is shot and the script is written. Camera angles to induce feelings of dominance claustrophobia and pressure are utilised perfectly as are the varying degrees of light and dark contrast which accentuates the blazing sun. Every actor is well cast and gives well judged performances most career bests. Those that stand out are Bannen Hendry Connery and Andrews.At the core of the film is the struggle between Andrews and Bannen's respective characters for ultimate authority in the prison. The bittersweet ending shows that Andrews' charcter although shaken will still reign in the hellhouse of a military prison.Superb thought provoking film that rewards the viewer for staying with it as the powerful ending is reached.".

More accurately however it could be labelled an antiarmy film. Interestingly enough both views could be maintained without there being any real warfare displayed on the screen. This is a measure of how powerful the film is. The fighting which we see is actually between the various prison officers and convicts. The film does not simply divide them into opposing groups but rather explores the differences and tensions between the people who are in power and those who are subject to it.Like 'Full Metal Jacket' many years later this movie is a condemnation of the dehumanising process soldiers are forced to go through in order to survive the army. Military prison as we learn is a further step down into the merciless and brutal world of the army.If 'The Hill' was made today the violence we see would undoubtedly be more explicit and obvious. However this does not take away anything from the original  as it is the mental torture more than the physical suffering which is portrayed so well in Lumet's work. It has aged fairly well mainly due to the accomplished and original way the film is shot and the script is written. Camera angles to induce feelings of dominance claustrophobia and pressure are utilised perfectly as are the varying degrees of light and dark contrast which accentuates the blazing sun. Every actor is well cast and gives well judged performances most career bests. Those that stand out are Bannen Hendry Connery and Andrews.At the core of the film is the struggle between Andrews and Bannen's respective characters for ultimate authority in the prison. The bittersweet ending shows that Andrews' charcter although shaken will still reign in the hellhouse of a military prison.Superb thought provoking film that rewards the viewer for staying with it as the powerful ending is reached.";

	schema:reviewBody "In which Connery doesn't get to cop off with the customary harem of beach babes doesn't get to save the world and more importantly gets his butt kicked by Ian Hendry! Sidney Lumet seasons Ray Rigby's claustrophobic screenplay with some stunning black and white cinematography reminiscent of his earlier masterpiece '12 Angry Men' and then bakes it in about 6 million degrees of scorching desert sun. The story of five squaddies holed up in a military stockade at the tail end of WW11 is as preoccupied with examining political conflict within British society through the interactions of the microcosmic cell mates as it is with presenting a taut compelling psychodrama. The allegorical tone of the movie is never clumsy or heavy handed though and Lumet keeps the narrative on the rails every step of the way. The dialogue crackles with blunt barrack room banter and black humour throughout perfectly offsetting the grim circumstances the prisoners find themselves in. Roy Kinnear Ossie Davis and Ian Hendry as a deranged martinet of a prison guard all deserve special mention but the film surely belongs to Connery who stumbles 'bruised battered and scarred but hard' through to the bitter climax with an extraordinary kind of dignity as he rails against the brutal injustices of 'the system'! It is a truly unmissable picture if only for Connerys' star turn but don't take my word for it.  Check it out now.".

	schema:reviewBody "Just a few short moments ago my life was changed. There is something to be said of plays brought to the silver screen because when they are done well they bring an aura and energy that regular films just don't have. Lumet was someone who understood this and it is very clear how he cherishes the energy of the stage. Not only does Lumet transfer this energy to the silver screen but he does it without losing any of it. The two mediums of film and theater are very different in that one is quite literally alive and has actions that are never repeated the exact same way twice while the other medium perhaps has the comfort of monotony and repetitious energy. Take a moment to consider this.Sidney Lumet's The Hill is absolutely riveting and I'm finding it very hard to type. Quite honestly I am still shaking from the stunning and sheer horrifying matter that I have just laid eyes upon. The Hill is a gritty warprison film that'll have you invested in no time. Some scenes will have you frustrated others will have your heart pumping. You will feel trapped like the characters. Heck! Take it from Connery who says Even the screws are doing time.Sidney Lumet has created one of the greatest climactic sequences between the morality of man and the amazing struggle for one's freedom against all odds. Harry Andrews and Ian Hendry are the epitome of terrifying brutality while Ian Bannen is fantastic as the sympathetic other. It is a shame as to why this film is not better known because it really should be. The Hill deserved and still deserves so much more recognition.Mr. Lumet who many filmgoers never seem to talk about beyond his 45 classics and seem to always have under the shadow of Scorsese has given the world another masterpiece. The Hill without a doubt belongs in the category of 'best films ever made' along with his most well known classic 12 Angry Men. Everything down to the acting and intense claustrophobia of the setting makes this an unforgettable experience.EDIT Just watched it again...Holy moly. The entire ensemble deserves a standing ovation. I am still dumbfounded as to why this diamond of diamonds was never recognized by the awards. But who needs the awards? This film is a masterpiece. Hands down.".

	schema:reviewBody "Life in a British Military prison somewhere in the Lybian desert at a time when national service conscription in the UK was still in force up until the mid 60s.A superb film from Lumet that involves all sorts of political social  personal issues. Clearly the most defined is one of Social Class between the officers  the grunts on the ground. Although Lumet doesn't make this distinction blatently obvious he makes up for it with subtle hints that are made known between Connery  Andrews in particular.Of course another issue is one of national identity. Britain was no longer the superpower it was by the 60s and  her empire was being lost through independence. Meaning that the British forces and the army in particular was losing its place in the world of Service  honour to the Throne.Andrews represents a man of tradition honour breeding  standing. He is the unofficial overlord of the camp where he tries hard to reinforce those rules not only to the prisoners but also to his fellow officers.While Connery represents the other side of the coin a working class man with principles but also a more objective man who can see the world has changed and that Britain is out of touch and is sickened by what he sees inside Andrews' camp.But again Lumet doesn't insult our intelligence by marking these distinctions with over the top violence. It is all cleverly interwoven throughout the film with a quality ending.Connery has never been better with the exception of perhaps The Untouchables and The Name of the Rose. Andrews just takes the plaudits as the Sergeant caught in a timewarp seeing his own little empire of Rules  Regulations crumble around him and his efforts to maintain order at any cost.In addition there is remarkable support from Ian Bannen another Sergeant but younger and more human than his superior. Bannen is excellent as he tries to help the prisoners from Andrews' sadism but he too is soon found wanting.Finally there's Ossie Davis who is a black prisoner proud to fight for his Queen  Country and yet gets treated far worse by Andrews'  co simply because he is black.Although Davis gives a very good performance I'm always concerned that quite a few of his movie roles represent the racial aspect and how he deals with it. But nevertheless he is excellent here.A good film then on a par with Full Metal Jacket. Tough sweaty loud gripping!".

	schema:reviewBody "Sidney Lumet's The Hill is a stark uncompromising look at the inside of a British military prison in North Africa during WW II. The allmale film based on Ray Rigby's autobiographical play is about the brutal mistreatment of prisoners by the screws at a stockade for courtmartialed British soldiers.The titular 'hill' is a monstrous manmade pile of sand seared by the blazing sun to be used as a means of punishment in the blistering heat. A sadistic martinet Major Bert Wilson Harry Andrews runs the show here with an aim to break the soldierprisoners down and then build them up to return as soldiers. His fascist method of discipline is to have the inmates clambering with full kit in the heat up and down the dreaded hill even if they are exhausted as part of a punishment designed more to break a man's spirit rather than provide corrective treatment. The screenplay puts the spotlight on a new bunch of five new prisoners one of whom is the hardmouthed tankman Roberts Sean Connery. Together they form an eclectic mix but all have one thing in common they are terrorized by Sergeant Williams Ian Hendry a particularly sadistic new guard chosen by Major Wilson who relishes the task of marching the men up and down the hill and watching them suffer. When Williams goes too far and causes the death of on the five men due to heat stroke it sparks off a mutiny and Roberts decides to lodge a charge of murder against Williams. The stage is thus set for a dramatic and riveting confrontation thrusting the drama to its bruising ironic end.In this long and unrelenting documentation of life in a military stockade Sidney Lumet comes up with the sobering revelation that inhumanity is not unique with the enemy in his own inimitable style. The cinematography is superlative as Oswald Morris shoots the film in monochromatic hues making you feel parched from minute one. The acting is also topnotch. Harry Andrews is devastating as the sergeant major that runs the camp  a taut controlled administrator who is a professional military man and Ian Hendry is brilliantly sinister as the evil sergeant who precipitates the crisis. Connery tears up the screen as the rebellious inmate giving an intelligently restrained performance carefully avoiding forced histrionics. Ossie Davis gets some of the best scenes and plays them superbly.'The Hill' is a harsh sadistic and brutal entertainment made without any concessions to officialdom  among the best of the subgenre has to offer.".

When Williams goes too far and causes the death of on the five men due to heat stroke it sparks off a mutiny and Roberts decides to lodge a charge of murder against Williams. The stage is thus set for a dramatic and riveting confrontation thrusting the drama to its bruising ironic end.In this long and unrelenting documentation of life in a military stockade Sidney Lumet comes up with the sobering revelation that inhumanity is not unique with the enemy in his own inimitable style. The cinematography is superlative as Oswald Morris shoots the film in monochromatic hues making you feel parched from minute one. The acting is also topnotch. Harry Andrews is devastating as the sergeant major that runs the camp  a taut controlled administrator who is a professional military man and Ian Hendry is brilliantly sinister as the evil sergeant who precipitates the crisis. Connery tears up the screen as the rebellious inmate giving an intelligently restrained performance carefully avoiding forced histrionics. Ossie Davis gets some of the best scenes and plays them superbly.'The Hill' is a harsh sadistic and brutal entertainment made without any concessions to officialdom  among the best of the subgenre has to offer.";

It stars a relatively young Sean Connery as he attempts to avoid being typecast as James Bond and features recognizable British actors in support.

Roberts is tossed in a cell with fellow cons George Stevens Alfred Lynch Jacko King Ossie Davis Monty Bartlett Roy Kinnear and Jock McGrath Jack Watson who alternately resent and respect Roberts' actions.The hill of the title is a steep sandy incline in the middle of the Sahara where the camp's located.

The hill is used as a way for RSM Wilson Andrews to break them to make them into real soldiers again.Trouble arises when Wilson's second in command Staff Sergeant Williams Ian Hendry badgers one of the convicts so relentlessly that the man dies thus kicking the battle of wits between prisoner and gatekeeper to an entirely new level. And this is where we really begin to see the unvarnished war of man versus man as Wilson and Williams strain to break not only Roberts but also his cellmates.Connery is really fantastic as the strongwilled Roberts and Wilson  who played plenty of authoritarian stiffbacked British characters is his equal. It's good to see Connery in a movie that transcends his sex appeal and his association with a certain superspy. Filmed in stark black and white as black and white tends to be The Hill is near the apex of psychological war films.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Hill is one of Sidney Lumet's lesser known films lesser compared to Network and Dog Day Afternoon anyway but it's pretty close to being a classic POW movie. Rather it's not exactly POW's it's about British soldiers who are taken to a stockade they've broken some crimes or other i.e theft insubordination not following orders on the front lines and are dealt with very harsh cards of punishment. The harshest is a long repetitive run up a giant dirt hill in the middle of this North African desert setting where the overbearing heat is a huge factor for their undoing which according to director Lumet wasn't just good acting. And the story follows a group of soldiers Sean Connery Ossie Davis Alfred Lynch Roy Kinnear who go through this hideous regiment under such conditions that are close to torture and how one of them Stevens Lynch literally drops dead from the pressure.Lumet's direction for the first half mostly goes between big wide expansive shots of the soldiers toiling up and down that hill and extreme almost claustrophobic closeups with the soldiers faces both prisoners and guards. His cameraman the great Oswald Morris is a pro at using black and white in a crisp clean manner but using movement to illustrate the craziness and sort of horror of the situation at hand. There's barely a flaw with this aspect and displays the firm level of craftsmanship Lumet had achieved by then with style I don't want to press too much on that aspect except that here as in the Pawnbroker it fits the subject matter to a T. The lack of music by the way is a big plus to add to the realism however theatrical it was based on a stage play by the screenwriter.And most notably the acting is showstopping. Connery has rarely been better as a hero who tries to stand up to the monsters like Williams Ian Hendry in a very scary calmbutmad performance and Wilson Harry Andrews barking like a dog in the kind of angry bravura only the British can pull off Davis and Stevens deliver some strong work in their supporting roles basically everyone even Sir Michael Redgrave who isn't on screen for long all work full tilt for the material. While there are moments when the screenplay made by and for British audiences is delivered by the actors in that British tone of voice and speak that may need some subtitles most of the time it all comes through clear as crystal. It's a searing portrait of a littleknown facet of WW2 of the horrors capable in people with too much power who are intolerant and use the rules only so far as they need to in this regard Connery IS the real hero past being a simple badass. It's the sleeper of 1965. 9.510".

Less a war film and more a prison drama 'The Hill' of the title is based at a military prison in the deserts of Libya. It is used as a disciplinary tool. Do what you're told or you'll march up and down the hill in full gear until you become more ... pliable to the orders of the guards. I won't give anything away but when the marching becomes too much for a group of new prisoners the film really picks up and a tragic set of events begin to unfold.The cast is tremendous with great performances from Sean Connery Ossie Davis excellent! Harry Andrews Ian Hendry and Ian Bannen. I'm a great fan of Ian Bannen's and he has rarely been better than he is in 'The Hill.' The same could be said for the rest of the actors I've named.The depth of the film is impressive and it considers the quality and characteristics of leadership among its many themes. What makes a good leader? Is it more effective to yell and then yell louder or to win hearts and minds in order to get what you want? This is a film with great application to everyday life for anyone who is trying to manmanage anything be you Donald Trump a small business owner or the head of a household. Not to be missed!".

I miraculously caught it in a theater on a Quarter Night showing in college. Now it has finally gotten an excellent quality release on DVD. Since the main valuation of a film is based on directing writing acting photography and for myself how much it promotes introspective thought long after the screen has gone dark this film like the also underrated Elmer Gantry same time period scores a 10 in every single category. Sean Connery is at an Academy Award accomplishing level of performance as is everyone else in the cast but Harry Andrews should have taken the award for Best Supporting Actor in a Foreign Film for 1965 and in the end its really his movie and his story. Ossie Davis and Ian Bannen demonstrate clearly that they are destined for acting greatness Waking Ned Divine is the second most favorite of Bannen's films this film being the top dog. giving us some of the best ever of British film story telling  and with this DVD the worst element for an American audience the dialect can be overcome by merely programming English subtitles.When the prison nearly riots over the death of Private George Stevens a likable and kind young man ill suited to front line actionhe is coming from a desk job and had gone AWOL in hopes of seeing his wife Harry Andrews becomes a marvel of military efficiency telling the guards to let the prisoners out of their cells where he takes full command with merely himself his voice and a copy of the KR The King's Rules. Andrew's character represent the rigidity of the British social structure but he is fair within his selfperspective view and never steps over the thin line into brutality that the sadistic Williams Ian Hendry constantly straddles. When the prisoners seem just seconds from bolting out of control Andrews thunders that he'll have all of the ringleaders up on charges of treason and as an anonymous voice asks who those might be he tells them with an authoritative boom Every third man! The prisoners slink slowly back to their cells as they realize they don't even know where he may start counting. Yet in the next moment the Master Sargeant has them singing patriotically an army again. It is a true moment of memorable directing acting and writing dramatic achievement as is every other acting performance in the film not one single weak glitch exists. What more could one want from a movie? On the other hand this should never ever be confused with a Disney film or something for the entire family. Not a curse word in it but a little too harsh for the kiddies.".

	schema:reviewBody "I remembered seeing THE HILL a couple of times since childhood and have enjoyed it immensely . It is quiet rightly regarded as Connery's best ever performance as Joe Roberts . There is a train of thought that Connery's star status begins and ends with Bond . This is slightly unfair . One can imagine Connery wanting to do everything he can to escape the Bond mantle which unfortunately led to him appearing in some bizarre film choices over the years . But if anyone thinks Connery is not worth watching in anything apart from a Bond movie this film along with THE OFFENCE also directed by Sidney Lumet and featuring Ian Bannen in a supporting role might change their minds It's certainly a product of its time . Set in a military prison in North Africa during the war it would have struck a cord with its contemporary audience . National service was abolished in Britain in 1960 which meant any male older than their mid 20s would have recognised the strict military discipline on show . Likewise a middle aged man in his mid 40s would have been a participant in the war . This doesn't necessarily date the film but it does have a rather 1960s zeitgeist to it where social and political barriers were being broken down in Western civilisation . This was after all the decade where people became more and more questioning about every institution on Earth Where the film does succeed is as an acting tour de force for the entire cast . Everyone is good but the two stand out performances are by Harry Andrews as RSM Wilson who spends the entire film barking out orders which is not a criticism and is to British cinema what Gunnery Sgt Hartman is to American cinema  and yes I know FULL METAL JACKET is often classed as a  British Film  but you know what I mean . The other stand out is Ian Bannen as Sgt Harris a firm but fair NCO who some people on this page would consider being a latent homosexual but this probably reading too much in to his character . It is certainly a multi layered performance After seeing THE HILL again recently I have noticed where the film doesn't succeed  and it is a very big fault  is that the characterisation often trips itself up especially when it leads to the climax . There's very little incitement for Jock McGrath to side with Roberts especially with the consequences involved . The climax itself becomes over wrought with melodrama where Roberts may or may not be transferred to hospital but everything is written  directed and acted as if the fate of the entire universe is at stake which makes for an implausible and disappointing ending".

	schema:reviewBody "It's easy to understand the dilemma of this movie. Although it was produced and written by German veteran Bernd Eichinger and directed by Uli Edel who brought us 'Wir Kinder vom Bahnhof Zoo' the fact that it is with and about German rapper Bushido kills off their momentum.In fact I assume that all efforts of making an 8milelike biopic about Bushido are simply moneyrelated. This movie and the upcoming Bushido album are supposed to create a synergy that equals a cash printing license.This alone would be business but the problem is as I mentioned Bushido himself. To make a biopic about someone that someone needs to have an interesting story. And quite frankly Bushido or Anis does not. The overall ark about his father problems is way too thin to hold all of it together and where Eminem was living in a real sht hole in 8 Mile Bushido had a caring mother a relatively stable youth and no real back story why he became what he is today.To link 911 with his initial decision to begin with rap is in case it is just storytelling very dumb. If it is actually true it proves my point that his story is not worth making a movie about.Given the basics of Bushidos relatively uninspired life the script can't be good  Eichinger tried as hard as he could to give the film some structure but it doesn't work out. That leads to uninspired performances by all German veteran actors in Zeiten ndern dich like Hannelore Elsner and Moritz Bleibtreu.And than there is Bushidos own acting. The final scene with his father that is supposed to show some sense of forgiveness is a perfect example for it He just doesn't deliver. It should have been the most important bit of the movie but it lacks emotion and... yes acting abilities.110 is my vote for this one. Not because it is a real 110 maybe it would be up to 2 or 3. It's because it has a crew and cast who could have easily delivered a really good film  one that had a real story to tell. Eichinger produced the Oscarnominated Downfall and now it comes to this... a all time low in his career.".

Gangsta stands for social ghettos in the big cities where the immigrant youth lives in relative financial and socialsecuritywise comfort and have nothing better to do than to imagine the rundown neighborhoods to be real ghettos like they have them in the States.

In other words these kids wouldn't last 24 hours in a real ghetto be it in Britain or the slums surrounding Paris let alone the real deal in the US.As to the music I'm not the biggest fan of Hip Hop but understand the appeal it has to the audience and find myself intrigued by the often poetic lyrical content.

But I guess it's kind of telling where the money ranks in the overall scheme.

And since I've been interested in the beginning of Bushidos rap career also his personal backgrounds I were pretty curious about this film.Unfortunately i had to observe that the movie regardlessly skips several important events and persons which contributed a lot to pave the way for Bushido's success. And these are not the only aspects which Bushido obviously liked to cut out. The whole movie seems to be like a commercial for Anis Mohamed Youssef Ferchichi. But the problem about commercials is their missing story. The film consists of a succession of petty scenes which are unrelated to the title and the purposed intension. The only thing that changed over time is the relation between the protagonist and his father and I strongly doubt this is worth making a movie about it.The extremely poor acting by Bushido and his colleagues even affects the performances of other the other actors which are usually very good. Most of the scenes are totally affected and superfluous.. as for instance the one in which some random guy is looking for his fiance which is gangbanged in a tour bus.The major problem about 'Zeiten ndern dich' is that the movie is clearly a fairy tale although it's not meant to be one. Even though I'd assume every scene really happened as shown most of them are simply insignificant and not relevant for the story.Bushido want's to tell a story but all that remains are phrases like 'Respekt war schon immer eine Sache die wichtig war fr mich.' He wants to tell how he finally grew up but leaves us with a feeling that he still didn't.".

I don't think he will gain new fans with the movie ... But decide for yourself if you're brave enough";

I love this movie it has a really great message at the end. Bushido's acting wasn't all that bad people keep saying how terrible of an actor he was in this film but he wasn't he did an alright job and it shouldn't really matter because he's a rapper not a big time actor he wasn't any worse then Eminem in 8Mile and everybody is saying how great that movie was. I would definitely recommend watching this movie it'll be a need experience to see the life of a German Rapper who is actually one of my favorite rappers in Germany. If you live in the United States I know it's hard to find this movie but there are ways but I can't promise you English subtitles for it is not Dubbed so hopefully you'll know a little German so you can understand and even if you can't you can still tell what is going on in the movie just by watching it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Zeiten ndern Dich or Time You Change is a German movie from 2010 that runs for slightly under 90 minutes without credits and you can basically call it a biopic about the German rap musician Bushido. The film is based on his biography and he also played himself in here mostly in the second half. It is also based on Bushido's biography. The screenplay is by the late Bernd Eichinger a bit of a legend here in Germany still even if he also produced a lot of garbage. The director is Uli Edel and same description fits him too even if he probably gets even less respect than Eichinger. Now about the movie itself First of all if you look at the cast this is really pretty impressive Elsner Bleibtreu Blob Schuch M'Barek Ochsenknecht Flint Tander and Semmelrogge are names that German film buffs will recognize immediately. And they are also the reason why the movie works out pretty nicely overall. Yes here and there we see a moment of weak line delivery but sometimes it is not even Bushido not a trained actor at all who brings these. Actually I thought he held his own very well for the most part against these experienced actors. I was positively surprised. His voiceover narration may have been on the weak side on some occasions perhaps but not in a way that it breaks the film either.The story is rocksolid too. Of course you can ask yourself if Bushido is a man who deserves a biopic but honestly he was on top here in Germany in what he did for a long time and I think less deserving people got one so why not. The story he tells here about his family his girlfriends about drugs about his buddies and of course about his music was interesting to watch at most of the time. Sure here and there they may have added stuff for dramatic purposes but this is the case in every biographical movie I believe. So no problem here either. And honestly the final performance by Karel Gott and Bushido gave me goose bumps at times. Nice closure here for sure. This review comes from somebody who is not a fan of Bushido's music in general at all but we should not close our minds to what we don't appreciate and still give it a chance. That's why I ended up enjoying these 1.5 hours quite a bit for sure. It's never boring never fake and never weakly crafted in opinion. I think that the quantity of haters is immense here looking at the rating but this is actually a good movie and I recommend checking it out. It does not deserve to be anywhere near the likes of Kartoffelsalat or Bruder vor Luder 2 very recent very crappy German films as well who deserve a 1 or 2 on the left side of the rating. This one here is far far superior and it is actually closer to a 4 out of 5 than to a 2 out of 5. Go see it. Don't get distracted by all the people giving this a 1 because 90 or more of these certainly have not even watched it but voted because of their personal dislike of Bushido. Their loss.".

I think the low score is a result of audience not coping w the fact that a father indeed can ruin a family's life because feeling as an outcast in a foreign country. This German viewers could not take. More to that Arafat and Bushido's relationship w crime families whatsoever made him a very bad press also. I do not care about that neither. The movies mood and the German reality in real life comes through and that's enough for me to give it 8 stars. Performances are solid dialogues are sometimes weak but please take into consideration that this is a movie about a singer who rocked German media and basically changed the rules Germans are looking to immigrants.".

I would only recommend it to Bushido fans and to anyone who would like to get a taste of how good German rap has become. On a more optimistic note please take the time and buy at least one of Bushido's major albums 7 Heavy Metal Payback Zeiten ndern Dich and you'll see why I've been praising his music so much.".

And I found myself very entertained.I was impressed with Gary Oldman's performance.  It's nice to see him portray someone who isn't a psychotic ham and he did admirably well.  Demi Moore suprised me with her acting and apart from a few stilted scenes and discomfort with the dialogue I think she pulled it off pretty well.  I found myself caring about her character and her relationship with Dimmesdale.  Perhaps the bathing scene was a little too gratuitous  c'mon Demi do you need to show it all?  but it was only a few minutes out of 135.I wish that Pearl could have been given more screen time and character development and the woman who did her voiceover throughout the story left much to be desired.  As did Robert Duvall's performance.  I didn't much like his acting in this movie at all.The supporting cast was excellent Joan Plowright Edward Hardwicke and others.  The locations and set design were exquisite and the costumes were gorgeous.Overall I thought it was a very good way to spend a couple hours.  You see some early colonial atmosphere something which is almost extinct in movies nowadays and adequate and sometimes inspired acting.  Just don't expect to see Hawthorne's novel on the screen.  If you want to see the unhappy ending in all its selfmutilating glory see Lillian Gish's silent version that is sometimes aired on Turner Classic Movies.  610".

Is Demi Moore so illiterrate she comments see trivia section that it was okay to change the ending of the book from sad to happy because not many people read the book? Unbelievable. The Scarlett 'A' imagery has been permanently etched in American culture. Take classic literature and try shoving it through the Hollywood formula mill and this movie is the result a faceless emotionless and forgettable movie. Try sayign that about the book".

I hear the ads for this movie say its based 'freely and liberally' on the book. Well this is an insult to the book. Is Demi Moore so illiterrate she comments see trivia section that it was okay to change the ending of the book from sad to happy because not many people read the book? Unbelievable. The Scarlett 'A' imagery has been permanently etched in American culture. Take classic literature and try shoving it through the Hollywood formula mill and this movie is the result a faceless emotionless and forgettable movie. Try sayign that about the book";

But as a film...This work stands alone as it will not bear up under scrutiny when compared against Hawthorne but aside from that this based on work is a fabulous dramatization of Hawthorne's story. I have to say the performances are marvelous the story is captivating and the emotion of the portrayals is wrenching.I highly enjoyed this bastardization and rate it at a 7.610 from...the Fiend .".

It is sad that some people will think that this is the real Scarlet Letter. The names of characters are the same as the book but it rapidly departs from the book beyond that  and for the worse.You will read commentaries here about what a wonderful film this was with discussions of the beautiful cinematography and great acting. They will also say how it is loosely adapted from Hawthornes' book. These are all true statements and the loose in loosely should be especially emphasized. I even agree that normally an adaption might be judged on its own merits. So why did I give this a low score? Because it is titled The Scarlet Letter. That is a classical book with some very deep moral messages. The very term Scarlet Letter has taken on a special meaning in our language and culture. But if someone recognizes what Hawthorne was trying to do with his book they will immediately see this as a rottentothecore script. Consider the Scarlet Letter a central theme in the book and holding so much meaning is just a minor prop in this movie that almost gets in the way.In Hawthorne's book the heroine by her actions through life turned the Scarlet Letter from meaning Adulteress to meaning Angel  it became an emblem of her inner beauty redeemed through her strength integrity and good heart. In our own time people often find themselves labeled or identified in some way as bad or as a loser. What a great thing it is to have messages that say You can rise above that!. This movie completely and totally misses that opportunity. It is one of the great messages that can be given to others in this life and it is abandoned in this movie.And what is it traded for? Feminism rebellion and justifications of immorality. Edgy? Groundbreaking? Incisive? No. So shallow its like cliff diving in a birdbath compared with what Hawthorne brought. In this adaptation Hester the heroine claims to not know if what she did was wrong  or sometimes suggesting it was right. From that high moral ground Hester almost becomes a feminist warrior or icon leading an insurrection of women against men. That rebellion is ridiculous historically but worse it completely guts the morality of the book. And the Scarlet Letter? From what I can tell the movie Hester seems to finally throw it away when she gets her freedom. It has no meaning other than as a talisman for oppression.That is a different message than the book gave out. But the Movie is still called The Scarlet Letter. If the screenwriter wanted to send out a different moral message then he should have retitled the movie. Something like Hester's Anachronistic and Pointless Rebellion would have been good. Then it would be truth in advertising.The actors and technicians did a great job but after reading the script they should have dropped the project. I suppose they needed the money. Beautifully shot well acted great score ... it still gets a 1 for being an egregious lie.".

While watching in class I noted only three major lines taken from the book two of which were out of context. In a deranged cinematic nightmare the movie added a nonsensical prologue that Hawthorne never would have included in his wildest dreams. Also added into the movie was an Indian plot line. This was never even slightly mentioned in the book. The battles and gore were a figment of the imagination of Hollywood and a horrendous attempt as well. The most offensive part of the movie for me personally was the changed ending. Not only did it not make any sense but it undermined the entire point of the story. The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne was not supposed to have a happy ending in North Carolina. It was absolutely scandalous of the writers of this movie to allow that to happen. Demi Moore reportedly said it was okay with her to make the ending happy because not many people have read the book httpwww.imdb.comtitlett0114345.Besides creating a bastardization of a classic American novel Joff created a generally horrible film. The acting was unrealistic the sex and violence utterly unnecessary and the symbolism offensively overdone. The unsubtle tacky symbolism was an insult to anyone over the age of four. In one pathetically obtuse moment Hester chases a red bird into the forest a place of evil doers and eats the forbidden fruit off of a tree. Clearly the American public did not appreciate this terrible movie either according to www.boxofficemojo.com it cost 46 million dollars in production and earned a surprisingly high 10.3 million dollars equaling a net loss of over 36 million dollars.

	schema:reviewBody "I feel a bit generous giving this movie a 5 out of 10 but my score is based on the way little Pearl's scarlet and gold dress looked and I did picture Demi Moore as Hester when I read the book. This movie is more like the Choose Your Own Adventure books from my childhood with Nathaniel Hawthorne thrown in. Demi has said not a lot of people have read the book even though it was published over one hundred years ago by one of America's greatest writers and has been a staple in high schools since time in memorial! Everyone who has read the book knows the meaning of the scarlet letter A for adultery changed to Able or Angel in regards to Hester because she helped out the people of her town when she was needed. The choice of the ending is an Indian attack with Hester and Pearl leaving with Rev. Arthur Dimmesdale goes against what Nathaniel Hawthorne had in mind. I wonder if his grandchildren and greatgrandchildren were offended by this Hollywoodized version of their grandfather's story? The language in the book is beautiful and Pearl had more of a role in the book than this movie! Nepotism shows up because Demi has cast daughters Scout and Tallulah as Pearl and they don't really say anything! Robert Duvall and Gary Oldman do their best as Roger Chillingsworth and Rev. Dimmesdale. Do what Olive from Easy A says in regards to this story watch the original story and not the one with Demi Moore as Hester taking a lot of baths and talking with a fake English accent!".

In the basic sense it follows the book but I think the movie went much further in exploring the love two people shared almost at first sight. I read the trivia in this website about this movie and noticed that Demi Moore had approved the ending of the movie. I am glad they went a different route and made the audience feel comfortable with the way things made out rather than to leave the theater or shut off your TV set feeling like something was missing. It's unsatisfying. This movie is far from unsatisfying. If you would like an excellent love story with a great twist see this movie. Gary Oldman is for the first time sexy and this movie has now made me a permanent fan of his brilliant acting.".

Duvall's character is actually captured by the Algonquian tribe and forced to live among them. He then vents his wrath on his wife who is expecting a child from her affair with her lover.Very good acting and wonderful scenery. I did not mind the two plus hours length of this romantic drama. There is some nudity just enough to spice things up...but the violence is bloody and harsh. I found this version of THE SCARLET LETTER to be sensuous interesting and very entertaining. Moore Oldman and Duvall were excellent. Notable in support are Joan Plowright Robert Prosky and Edward Hardwicke. This is worth your effort to watch.".

Written by Nathaniel Hawthorne in the 1800's the book has been considered one of the greatest piece of American literature ever. But when Hollywood caught hold of it in 1995 the story was changed. I'm not a fan of the novel it was boring to me but this movie brought a new sense of hope for me.Hester Prynne Demi Moore is the wife of a British man and has been sent to Massachusetts to secure a house for him. Hester is quiet woman and lives on a coastal beach house just outside town. She quickly makes friends with locals including Harriet Hibbons Joan Plowright and becomes a little to close with the local Reverend Dimmesdale Gary Oldman.Soon Hester and Dimmesdale have done youknowwhat and Hester is pregnant! This is strictly forbidden and she is placed on trial. Instead of pointing right at Dimmesdale she hides the father's name. Hester is forced to wear a scarlet letter 'A' standing for adulteress and shame is cast upon her. But soon a new figure arrives. It is Roger Chillingworth Robert Duvall who is seeking to find the father and destroy the relationship already known by him between Hester and Dimmesdale.Instead of the boring book of magical happenings and devil worship the film version offers a believable account and actual human suffering as seen through the eyes of two that are in love. The book has little to do with the film except for the characters and the story. None of the background stories are placed into the film like Hester in jail or visiting the governor's house. Instead screenwriter Douglas Day Stewart brings out a new story and a bit more attractive.I wouldn't necessarily recommend this film for it was boring at times and some nudity present was unneeded. Demi Moore is average as Hester but Gary Oldman is fantastic as the suffering Rev. Dimmesdale. The score to the film was very well done and helped capture the suffering of the characters.As I said before do not watch this if you're a big fan of the book or one of those diehard book nuts.The Scarlet Letter.

Again I was stunned by merely the ability of playing roles like these by the actorsnot only Demi Moore and Gary Oldmangood acting for it is a movie adapted indeedfreely from a novel that plays in 1666!!.Especially the English phrasing is brought well by all actors although Demi Moore failed to imitate the known British accent of that time. Gary Oldman performs better in this especially in the sermon as a Minister shortly after he returned from the woods having helped Hester.Very heartfelt and wellplayed. An original though somewhat exposing movie in the sense of the extreme strict puritanEnglish rules imposed upon a community in that time. Robert Duvall's role is underestimated since he only was present in onethird of the movie.Maybe he did not get all the possibilities to act as he normally does because of the shortage of time. The movie is long but never boring and very original although some other viewers  who have read the novel as well might find it a typically Hollywood adaptation.But that is movieland! For me a plus and a favorite.".

Again I was stunned by merely the ability of playing roles like these by the actorsnot only Demi Moore and Gary Oldmangood acting for it is a movie adapted indeedfreely from a novel that plays in 1666!!.Especially the English phrasing is brought well by all actors although Demi Moore failed to imitate the known British accent of that time. Gary Oldman performs better in this especially in the sermon as a Minister shortly after he returned from the woods having helped Hester.Very heartfelt and wellplayed. An original though somewhat exposing movie in the sense of the extreme strict puritanEnglish rules imposed upon a community in that time. Robert Duvall's role is underestimated since he only was present in onethird of the movie.Maybe he did not get all the possibilities to act as he normally does because of the shortage of time. The movie is long but never boring and very original although some other viewers  who have read the novel as well might find it a typically Hollywood adaptation.But that is movieland! For me a plus and a favorite.";

Although Demi Moore's voice was slightly annoying I can easily say that her performance was totally believable and included a good character portrayal. There is naught to say about Gary Oldman except for that his performance was perfectly enjoyable.

	schema:reviewBody "This certainly ranks among the Top Ten of What Were They Thinking? films ever made. The production is sumptuously photographed has a more than qualified director in Oscar nominee Roland Joffe a recognizable supporting cast of Oscar luminaries featuring Gary Oldman Robert Duvall and Joan Plowright and a thenbankable leading lady in Demi Moore. Factor in the pedigree associated with Nathaniel Hawthorne's legendary novel and something far more worthwhile should have been the end result.Moore is cast as Hester Prynne a proper Puritan wife sent ahead to the colonies to prepare a home for she and her husband. Emboldened by the new responsibilities thrust upon her and some of the new relationships she starts Hester gives in to an attraction to the righteous Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale Oldman when it is believed that her husband has perished in an Indian massacre. Hester's peccadillo and her subsequent illegitimate pregnancy cause her to become persona non grata in the colony and she is forced to wear the scarlet letter of the title brandishing her an adulterer.Anyone who made it through high school is familiar with the tale of Hester Prynne but given the issues inherent in the material and how it still remains pertinent in today's society with women's right being trampled on its cinematic adaptations have been amazingly rare. So it is doubly unfortunate that Joffe and company have so succinctly bungled this effort.Moore is pretty as a picture but entirely too contemporary a presence to convince as Hester. She provides neither the insight nor the range to make Hester's plight palpable. Oldman is solid and provides a titillating full frontal voyeuristic skinnydip but his role is beyond ridiculous more on that later. Robert Duvall as Hester's wacko husband shows up later in the film and gives the worst performance of his career. This is so bad it is akin to the work Nick Nolte contributed in Hulk. And pretty much everyone is outacted by a bird that seems to be chirping for sexual freedom.The film's biggest problem and the result of its failure is that it fails to have respect or even understand the entire point of the source. No one feels that Joffe needs to be slavishly faithful to Hawthorne's prose. And sexing the material up for modern audiences is also not an unwise call.However what is absurd is basically castrating the story of its core. Joffe and company take the window dressing of the Scarlett Letter but abandon its entire reason for being. Hawthorne's story was an indictment of Puritanism and the hypocrisy of Christianity in that Reverend Dimmesdale was a selfrighteous blowhard stirring up his foolish flock and leading the charge against Hester by day while being her lover at night and demanding she keep their secret. If anything he is the villain of the piece yet the film version somehow reimagines him as a worthwhile misunderstood romantic figure! Instead of Dimmesdale being depicted justly as a craven cowardly monument of hypocrisy we instead get Dimmesdale as the Puritan answer to Fabio and Duvall gets to usurp the villain role as Hester's wildeyed madman hubby. This shift in narrative plus changes in the latter half of the film including the ending completely abandons the entire purpose of Hawthorne's tale. Joffe instead throws in Indian attacks and nonsense sound and fury to distract from the fact that there is no longer anything at the center of his film. As such the film does not conclude so much as implode under its own rubbish pretensions.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film hasn't lost any of its bitter bite since it debuted in 1959. Laurence Harvey plays an ambitious young man who leaves a squalid industrial town somewhere in England for a good job in a nicer city. He immediately makes friends in the office and joins an amateur theater group when he learns that a pretty rich girl Heather Sears is a member. He also meets an older French woman Simone Signoret who is also a member.He starts an affair with the older woman while he blatantly pursues the rich girl much to the dismay of her parents. Her father is a coarse but selfmade man the mother is a snooty society woman. The girl has a sort of boyfriend who constantly uses his wealthy upbringing and schooling to put Harvey in his place. Even in postWorld War II England the class system is very evident. Harvey's attempts at being upwardly mobile are constantly shot down.The girl is sent to France in an attempt to get her away from Harvey and he falls into a torrid affair with Signoret. But he cannot get the girl and her money out of his head. Months go by before he runs into the girl and renews his pursuit. Of course she gets pregnant and the family relents rushing her into marriage an act that has bitter and surprising consequences for all involved.Signoret won the bestactress Oscar and just about every acting award that year for her work here and she is magnificent. She is worldly and sad yet is not about to accept her fate. Harvey Oscar nominated gives his best performance as the blatant social climber. His angry young man is at once despicable and sympathetic. Sears scores as the nave young woman who tries to balance her life and her parents' wishes.Hermione Baddeley also Oscar nominated has a great scene toward the end of the film. She plays Signoret's friend the one who enables their affair by lending them her apartment. Donald Wolfit is excellent as the girl's father. Ambrosine Phillpotts is good as the mother. Donald Houston Raymond Huntley Wilfrid Lawson Beatrice Varley and April Olrich are all good in smaller roles.".

And that something  Simone Signoret  is the main reason to see and to cherish Room At The Top. She is very believable as the slightly shady older woman with whom he has a romance. And her eyes! Her eyes suggesting wisdom and great depths of sadness will break you heart. It seems like a simple performance and it is uncluttered stark. But it is flawless. I can think of almost no other performance by a woman in an Englishlanguage movie that compares to Signoret's.".

And that something  Simone Signoret  is the main reason to see and to cherish Room At The Top. She is very believable as the slightly shady older woman with whom he has a romance. And her eyes! Her eyes suggesting wisdom and great depths of sadness will break you heart. It seems like a simple performance and it is uncluttered stark. But it is flawless. I can think of almost no other performance by a woman in an Englishlanguage movie that compares to Signoret's.";

	schema:reviewBody "I recently viewed this film from 1959 and was totally riveted to it. It is a timeless love story set in postwar Britain with the incomparable Simone Signoret and Laurence Harvey at the centre of the storm. The background highlights the struggle between class and ambition in 1950's Britain. Laurence Harvey plays Joe Lampton the angry young man who is motivated to make something of himself in a world that he is not comfortable with. Harvey portrays a new kid on the block who has taken a job at city hall where he works with other young men like himself. He and his buddies remind us of randy high school students discovering the world and women all at once.While Joe shows all the aptitudes necessary for advancement he is a man of principle who inherits the hostility of the working class that flares up when provoked by snide remarks about where he came from. He has trouble playing the game but no trouble attracting the attention of the ladies. At first attracted to the daughter of a local tycoon he knows that he is an outsider and seeks the advice and friendship of an older woman  the genuine and magnetic Signoret who plays the lovelorn wife of a local businessman and philanderer. Over time he falls deeply in love with the older woman and the time they spend alone provides some of the most compelling scenes you are likely to find in the cinema of the 1950's. After successfully wooing her he runs headlong into the realities of life leading to a gutwrenching climax which you won't forget.".

The story has a lot to say about individual sacrifice.The film's naturalistic BW lighting is fine. Background music is nondescript and unimportant. The most significant element of the film perhaps is the high quality of acting. Both Donald Wolfit and Hermione Baddeley give really fine performances in support roles. But of course the real reason to see Room At The Top is to marvel at the outstanding performance of Simone Signoret who won the Oscar for Best Actress in a lead role.Although this is not my kind of film it is very well made.

	schema:reviewBody "Room At The Top filmed in 1959 takes place some ten years earlier in post war Great Britain as veteran Laurence Harvey takes it in his mind to rise from his lower class origins by any means possible. He's a devilishly attractive fellow and if that's what it takes to do it than so be it. Not like it hasn't been done before on either side of the pond.Harvey's got no family so to speak his parents were killed in his small town when a German bomb hit their house. He's rootless now and has a crying need to belong somewhere.The similarities in character to novelist John Braine's Joe Lampton and Theodore Dreiser's George Eastman are too obvious to overlook. However unlike Eastman Lampton as played by Harvey is courting two very different kinds of women. Boss Donald Wolfit's daughter Heather Sears is a young and somewhat inexperienced young lady who's easy prey for Harvey. Wolfit and his wife Ambrosine Phillpotts see what's happening with their daughter but can't ultimately do anything.But while they're trying Harvey falls in with the unhappily married Simone Signoret. She's married to Allan Cuthbertson who's a cheating dog himself. She's got a lot of passion left in her and even though Harvey's ten years younger she knows how to show him one real good time. Being French she has a different moral view of things than the folks of her adopted country and she thinks Harvey does as well. He does but Harvey has his priorities.Room At The Top was something that still couldn't be made in America because of the Code but at least it was shown here. What Makes Sammy Run a work by Budd Schulberg never had a big screen adaption and it had similar themes to Room At The Top Still it got great critical acclaim and two Academy Awards and other nominations.Simone Signoret got one of those Oscars for Best Actress in 1959. It's a very subtle part she undertakes in fact she's not the main character Harvey is. Still when she's on the screen even Harvey's flashier character of Joe Lampton takes a back seat. Signoret is just fabulous as the older and still attractive woman trapped in a loveless marriage will touch you dearly. She's one of the most beautiful and tragic figures ever done on screen.Harvey was up for Best Actor but he and the film itself were running in the year of BenHur. He and the picture itself lost to Charlton Heston and the noble character he created on screen. Hermione Baddely who had a role similar to Thelma Ritter's in All About Eve was up for Best Supporting Actress but she lost to Shelley Winters for The Diary Of Anne Frank.Room At The Top with its brutally frank talk of sex mixed with ambition has become a classic and Joe Lampton became Laurence Harvey's signature role. Two sequels with Joe Lampton Life At The Top and Man At the Top were spawned from the original the latter with Lampton played by Kenneth Haigh as Harvey had died by then. It's an enduring classic of the British nay the English language cinema and should not be missed.".

	schema:headline " A savage story of lust and ambition";
	schema:reviewBody "This underseen British classic is like a breath of fresh air. Try as it might prior to the 1960s and the American New Wave Hollywood could never accomplish an effective sense of realism. Across the Atlantic the story was an altogether different one much of their shooting took place onlocation in the breathtaking British countryside or otherwise in the the shabby slums of the lowerclass successfully identifying audiences with the common man. This realism is clearly evident in many of the Ealing comedies of the late 1940s and 1950s but with 'Room at the Top 1959' British filmmaking reached a new peak of maturity. A frank and uncompromising treatment of sexuality and class prejudices Jack Clayton's extraordinary featurelength debut was a seminal work in the development of adultthemed cinema a commercial and critical success despite being branded with an Xrating in the UK. The brilliance of this film coupled with that of 'The Innocents 1961' two years later leads me to wonder why I don't hear of this director with much greater frequency.Joe Lampton Laurence Harvey is an ambitious young government accountant proud of his lowerclass heritage but determined to ascend the social ladder. Though he loathes the pretension and prejudices of Britain's wealthy upperclass he is nonetheless determined to become one of them a hypocrisy that triggers with in him an indescribable innertorment. With this goal in mind Lampton sets his sights on the innocent virginal Susan Brown Heather Sears daughter of the most powerful man in town. He tries vainly to justify his advances through the pretext of love all the while knowing that his intentions are strictly opportunistic. Alice Aisgill Simone Signoret a married French woman ten years his senior proves Lampton's greatest obstacle to wealth for he soon finds himself falling in love with her for real this time.

	onyx:emotionText "This underseen British classic is like a breath of fresh air. Try as it might prior to the 1960s and the American New Wave Hollywood could never accomplish an effective sense of realism. Across the Atlantic the story was an altogether different one much of their shooting took place onlocation in the breathtaking British countryside or otherwise in the the shabby slums of the lowerclass successfully identifying audiences with the common man. This realism is clearly evident in many of the Ealing comedies of the late 1940s and 1950s but with 'Room at the Top 1959' British filmmaking reached a new peak of maturity. A frank and uncompromising treatment of sexuality and class prejudices Jack Clayton's extraordinary featurelength debut was a seminal work in the development of adultthemed cinema a commercial and critical success despite being branded with an Xrating in the UK. The brilliance of this film coupled with that of 'The Innocents 1961' two years later leads me to wonder why I don't hear of this director with much greater frequency.Joe Lampton Laurence Harvey is an ambitious young government accountant proud of his lowerclass heritage but determined to ascend the social ladder. Though he loathes the pretension and prejudices of Britain's wealthy upperclass he is nonetheless determined to become one of them a hypocrisy that triggers with in him an indescribable innertorment. With this goal in mind Lampton sets his sights on the innocent virginal Susan Brown Heather Sears daughter of the most powerful man in town. He tries vainly to justify his advances through the pretext of love all the while knowing that his intentions are strictly opportunistic. Alice Aisgill Simone Signoret a married French woman ten years his senior proves Lampton's greatest obstacle to wealth for he soon finds himself falling in love with her for real this time. Torn between his affection for Alice and his ambitions towards prosperity and respectability Lampton must eventually choose between the two the consequences of his decision leaving an empty void where once there had been a bright fresh and conscientious young man.Impeccably shot in crisp blackandwhite by Freddie Francis 'Room at the Top' is a refreshing dose of mature drama and occasionally an angry scathing assault on the British class system.

It hardly matters except for setting up a situation where no one really knows what they want in relationships. But massive commitment goes into the striving.What this has going for it today are three things.One is the performance of the jilted woman who serves as our onscreen observer because she seems to understand more than anyone else. Part of the wonder of this is how interestingly her part is written. She seems to have a perspective others do not. But of course this is false and presented as merely her French manner. At the time before the French new wave this would have registered. The interplay of how much she cares and how much she seems to is at the root of the drama. She won an Oscar for her Frenchness.A second element of the structure is how this selfobservation is annotated in the thing. Its all about how we see what our love and urges are about and how we see THEM. So we have a folded narrative in an amateur theater company in the film. Though not much is overtly made of this its where the tone of playing and observation are introduced and our place in what we see. A token from this continues throughout the film in a friend of Simone's character who watches and judges.While the effectiveness of those two devices has faded with time the final element of this is much sharper. Its the depiction of the two English cities as incredibly dirty messy derelict. Freddie Francis's eye has been used by several director's to emphasize the importance of context. Lynch actually built an entire film Straight Story around him. What the man has done here is find enough incidental glimpses of cities that barely exist to convey the need to escape that drives our main character.It works. It all works. Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jack Clayton directed a handful of movies a total of 10 beginning in 1944 and ending in 1992. He's perhaps best known if at all for three The Pumpkin Eater The Innocents and this film Room at the Top. It's remembered nowadays primarily and justifiably due to the extraordinarily rich earthy performance of Simone Signoret.Room at the Top was a critical and box office success due in part to what was at the time some fairly straight forward dialog about sex. Seen from the vantage point of 50 years later much of that dialog is quaint and square. There are several films of this time period like Pillow Talk and Jack Clayton's followup to Room at the Top his adaptation of Lawrence's Sons and Lovers that pushed the boundaries of accepted tastes and reaped box office success from it. One could argue that without it these films would not have been successful. Room at the Top probably would have ended up in this category were it not for Simone Signoret. Signoret's performance feels full bodied rich and real. She's the heart and soul of the film and she's years ahead of her time. She acts the way Glenda Jackson Jane Fonda Ellen Burstyn and Meryl Streep would act later on in the 70s. It's astonishing to me that the Academy managed to recognize this and awarded her the Best Actress award in 1959. I suspect it helped that she spoke English as it is easier for a wider audience to easily understand and react to. When the films pivotal tragedy strikes it's impact is completely understandable because of her. The rest of the film is extremely well made but no other character in it has the depth and honest charm of Signoret. SPOILER My sole quibble is not with Signoret's performance but with her characters design. To me it didn't make complete sense that a woman of such earthy charm and self knowledge would or could fall apart the way she does when Joe Lampton is forced to abandon her. In the scene where she tells Lampton about how she once posed nude for an artist she comes across as a woman with an independent mind and spirit who despite the heartbreak could and would recover from such abandonment. Her end seems more of a contrived plot driver than a realist outcome.".

The reviews I read before I bought the DVD set up preconceived notions of a film about business and ambition.  This is actually a small part of the film.  I saw it as a love triangle story more than anything. Laurence Harvey's character does state at the beginning of the film that he wants to marry for position in business but his heart really isn't in it. He falls truly in love with the Simone Signoret character Alice and the only reason he gets back together with the bosses daughter is because of chance.  I saw his character as sensitive and real.  I think he would have stayed with Alice in the end if he could have. Its the bosses daughter who is simple and shallow.  How could she think he really liked her?  It was so obvious that he didn't. This film has all the cliches but it doesn't cheapen it.   Great acting and script.  A must see!".

Simone Signoret shows big presence and mysterious sex appeals.  But the main character Joe Lampton performed by Laurence Harvey was strange and difficult for me to understand.  He is very ambitious and audacious and even tries to challenge his targeted girl's parents and expected fiance who belong to the upper class in the party of upper class.  But he suddenly becomes depressed and feels guilty blames himself for deserting his older mistress.  Maybe he is honest and direct.  Still I enjoyed the scenery of England after the World War II and was impressed with the last scene symbolizing that a person will rise to the upper class in return of real love.".

	schema:headline " One of the most important films of its time";
	schema:reviewBody "This film won an Oscar as did Simone Signoret for best actress and the screenwriter Neil Paterson for best screenplay. It made a huge hit when it was released and it had a major social impact in Britain as well. Based on the bestselling novel by John Braine the film dealt with the aspirations of the working class to rise in the world and the intimidation they felt from the rich upper middle class in this case a Yorkshire millowner played with ruthless honesty and typical Yorkshire bluntness by Donald Wolfit. The hero or I should really say antihero of the story is Joe Lampton played by Lawrence Harvey. His desire to get on in life is allconsuming and he is desperate to escape the row cottage in the small Yorkshire mill town where he has grown up with his widowed mother. He was in the RAF in the War but was only a sergeant and spent most of the War as a POW. It is 1947 and he has now returned to civilian life and has to decide what to do. So he moves to a larger mill town which is not an entirely working class location and gets a job in the offices of the local textile mill. On his very first day he sees the pretty young daughter of the mill owner and decides he is going to 'get' her both because he wants her and as a means of advancement. He is brutally frank about wanting to 'marry a million pounds'. He wants to get to the 'top'. Wolfits daughter is played by the young Heather Sears. It is a great pity that she did not appear in the sequel film LIFE AT THE TOP 1965 see my next review and that she was replaced with Jean Simmons who was not right for the part and the difference in tone destroyed much of the continuity. Heather Sears was absolutely perfect. She played the daughter as a sweet dreamy but spoilt and wilful creature lost in her romantic notions. She is completely dazzled by Larry Harvey and in love with him and keeps saying to him as things work out for them 'Isn't it wonderful?' For her she is living out a romantic dream. But she is far from a passionate creature in the carnal sense which is essential to the story. For that side of things Harvey has his own passionate love affair with the woman who is to be the one true love of his life played by Simone Signoret with overwhelming soulful intensity. Signoret could say more with her bedroom eyes than almost any actress one can think of. You can see her thinking and what is more you can see her feeling. That takes some doing in moments without dialogue. She certainly deserved her Oscar. Larry Harvey's performance is wonderful and dominates the film as indeed it should. The film is magnificently directed by Jack Clayton and is one of his finest achievements. The cinematography by Ossie Morris is even better than his usual superb standard with Brian West as operator. I knew at a later date not when this was made so many people connected with this film not least Larry and Jack. Alas I never met Signoret. That would have been something. This film is a real classic powerful emotional upsetting compulsive viewing and deeply tragic. It is what can be called without hesitation 'the real thing'.".

Whole alliances among the village's women teeter and threaten to topple.

The resolution will probably tear you up it has brought moisture to the eyes of everyone I've seen it with but it represents enormous changes in Japanese society  the collapse of patriarchal authority the invasion of foreign culture and especially Englishlanguage culture and the inexorable rise of that great leveler of aesthetics television.

The situation and the characters are all straightforward yet Ozu's expert eye sees plenty of things worth considering and each simple story development has a purpose. If the material remains generally lightweight when compared to some of his other movies it still has the same thoughtful lowkey touch and genuinely human characters.The young boys drive much of the story in this one and they are very believable whether in their petulant responses to parental authority or in their schoolboy fads. Some of the latter can be slightly offputting at times but then such things do rather ring true with the nature of boys at that stage of their lives.The cast is quite large so that none of the characters gets a lot more screen time than any of the others yet somehow all of them not only come alive but get some defining moments. Most of the adult characters are simple yet easy to care about and there are several good performances. The grandmother character and the aunt of the two brothers are probably the most interesting of the characters yet all of them have a purpose.As is usually the case with Ozu's movies you can watch it a second time and see additional detail in the characters' relationships and dialogue. This time the issues involved are not as significant as usual yet the simple plot provides some insights into the ways that families and neighbors communicate with one another and understand one another. It's probably more entertaining than enlightening but yet there is some substance as well.".

The grandmother character and the aunt of the two brothers are probably the most interesting of the characters yet all of them have a purpose.As is usually the case with Ozu's movies you can watch it a second time and see additional detail in the characters' relationships and dialogue. This time the issues involved are not as significant as usual yet the simple plot provides some insights into the ways that families and neighbors communicate with one another and understand one another. It's probably more entertaining than enlightening but yet there is some substance as well.";

The situation of the retired people is magnificently pictured through the desperate men looking for a job the domination of the USA in Japan is represented through the need of private English classes for the two brothers and the translation of documents to English superfluous consume of the American society is represented through the importance of the useless television for the younger generation while their parents are concerned with have some savings for their retirement. The destructive little gossips the difficulties of communication and many other problems of relationship are also shown in this little gem.

This all comes out thanks to two boys that really want a TV. They enter into a vow of silence until their TV comes. This silence is misconstrued by the neighbours who think their mother is angry at them. They begin to gossip amongst themselves and rumors soon start. Meanwhile the young boys' aunt and teacher are attracted but fail to act on their emotions. This is a lovely little film filled with some great humor. Though I must admit there was a bit too much focus on the poofarts jokes. The two boys especially the youngest are very cute and make their efforts to get a TV seem less brattish. It's really sweet to see how dedicated the parents are and even though the kids are kind of mean they do appreciate the gift in the end. There's no escaping Ozu's look at the clashes between old and new with the TV looming over all procedures as something that will change life. A little gem if not one of Ozu's classics.".

GOOD MORNING'S gas jokes are gentle and clever the young boys fart on command a minor character works for the gas company while a husband farts in one room and a wife answers etc. The film's famous static shots center around a gleaming refinery. One of the film's delights comes from watching the visual and thematic elements weave together and so effortlessly that it's thrilling to see it develop. This is my personal favorite Ozu film if only because it perfectly balances drama and comedy metaphor and visuals. GOOD MORNING is the kind of movie you can see repeatedly as there are always new things to discover. It certainly doesn't hurt that it's also a technically refined work up to Ozu's highest standards.".

Emotions are pitchperfect and lucid  to the audience if not always to the characters. Conflicts and passions are tempered by characters' realistic selfperceptions and their practicality with consequently no implausible hysterics.Ozu's dramatic best such as Floating Weeds or Late Spring compares quite well with the best of Chekhov's plays and stories. In moralizing mode Tokyo Story Ozu descends to melodrama with good characters being very very sensitive and altruistic and bad characters crudely selfish cf. Chekhov's The Darling which is even worse Tolstoy's idiosyncratic enthusiasm notwithstanding. Although this would be uninteresting in isolation such types do exist in life and in the context of Ozu's other movies it is a worthwhile sample of human variety.Which brings us to Ohayo. Reasonably categorized as a comedy it also resembles Chekhov's comedies with similar strengths and weaknesses. The movie meanders around a couple plots  children's conniving to get their parents to buy a television and a suspected case of embezzling. Though the latter is potentially extremely serious Ozu follows these conflicts and misunderstandings and detours into his characters' other doings with a light unforced sometimes quizzical amusement and compassion.

In a Japanese suburb in the late 1950s two Japanese tykes one about 10 years old the other about 6 decide not to talk to anybody any more until their parents buy them a television set this film was made in an era where many people in Japan were buying their first TVs.Shot in his traditional transcendental style this charming comedy shows a more modern Japan than in other Ozu films of that era at the same time the cultural attitudes the movie reflects make it very much a film of the fifties. This was probably one of the first movies made anywhere to deal with life in the suburbs  even if it is set in a very Japanese suburbia all the houses are very close to each other and its residents constantly interact with each other. There is also constant gossiping around among the housewives. In many ways Good Morning is a movie about the many changes brought by the modernization and Americanization of Japanese society after World War II Surprisingly for an Ozu film this has even a number of gags involving human flatulence.A triumph for Ozu even if it is probably not as moving as Tokyo Story Late Spring or Early Summer. The ensemble of actors certainly helps.".

The father with his ups and downs at work and having to attend to his children's demands and give them proper education prepares himself for a new day. His wife worried about complications that domestic life brings and about how to save and handle money properly is as well one of the family members attempting to live quietly and happily in an otherwise rather boring community. The main characters the kids which are obsessed with having a television back then it was an innovative device agree to remain silent until their parents indulge their caprice.One aspect that I liked in this film was the misinterpretation of the kids' silence by one of the neighbors the woman who lives in the community thought their gesture meant their mother was angry at her and other neighbors for having had the idea of her keeping the rent payments for herself. This leads everybody to think of her as a resentful woman and they decide to return the favors she had once done for them so that they wouldn't be owing her anymore favors. This is relevant even to today's standards people often misjudge you by the slightest gesture even though you didn't intend to be interpreted that way.Other amusing aspect to point out would be the constant farting there appears to be an ability to produce farts by swallowing some powder whose name I don't remember as of now. The kids keep on doing it throughout the whole film.This is one of the easiest films to digest in Ozu's filmography which means that this is an excellent option for people unfamiliar with this magnificent director. I for one consider this film one of his best efforts and it obviously ranks up there in the top of my personal favorite Japanese films.My score 9.310".

Kids who make life so uncomfortable for their parents with all their pouting and tantruming that parents will give them just about anything just to get them to behave for half a second. This is an old movie from 1959but it just proves that kids have always been little brats. The film is set in small town Japan. It's one of those little isolated places that's known for its stereotypically catty gossipy women and uninterested emotionally distant husbands. With all the adults paying attention to their own petty problems children are left to run wild. And this story stars a pair of particularly stubborn yet adorable little schoolaged brothers. These little hellions are used to getting what they want and this time their campaign of terror is directed toward forcing their parents to buy one of those newfangled TV sets. You know like the one the bachelor nextdoor and that loose woman he's shacking up with let them watch after school gotta love those 1950s morals don't you?. Well these boys have learned a thing or two from past experience so they know that if they hold out long enough they'll be able to wear down their parents' resolve. It's a war of attrition and these kids have nothing but time and energy. Plus they don't have those pesky consciences to make them feel bad about any of this. They're willing to make their parents' lives holy hell until they get that TV set.The film is done in Technicolor so it's got that awesome retro look. Somehow that limited color palette breeds nostalgia making the past seem a little better than it probably really was. Even these little stinkers seem a little bit cute with their selfindulgent antics for a little while anyway. But it's also kinda fun to see what Japan was like in the late 50s. I already had an idea what the United States was like but I hadn't really seen or learned that much about contemporary culture in other countries. It seems like a lot of the clothing fashions were the same as here in the US. But each country is going to have its own distinct social structures at play. I'm glad I watched this one. It's not the most amusing movie ever made and it does stretch pretty long. It claims to run only ninetythree minutes but it's actually an hour longer at onehundred fifty. That's kind of a big problem. But I think it's still worthwhile.".

That essential silent film from Ozu is about two brothers who are bullied and wonder about their status in life. This film is about the two boys wanting a television and their parents refusing. So after screaming about it and the parents telling them they talk too much they take on a vow of silence that extends to the neighbors in this suburban town in Japan and even in school. They can only watch TV at a young couple's house with the other neighborhood kids. They just want a television. This Ozu film is a slice of mostly a by gone era when kids were able to just run around the neighbors freely visit each other without calling first and values were much simpler. The acting is great but what do you expect it has Chisyu Ryu and Haruko Sugimura in it two of Ozu's best actors. I would have liked to have seen Setsuko Hara as one of the housewives but I guess she was not available. The acting by the kids especially the brothers played by Koji Shidara and Masahiko Shimazu is spot on. I wanted some things growing up and nagged my parents who hasn't? Its a fun film about wanting something you don't have. Enjoy it its another highly watchable Ozu film.".

	schema:headline " This is an adorable little film by a master if just shy of a masterpiece";
	schema:reviewBody "I'll start off saying something about Good Morning that will sound like I'm putting it down but I'm really not the ingredients of the story or stories if you want to get technical there are sort of three running plotlines here with characters all centered around several houses right below one of Ozu's quintessential small hills in a lot of other's less imaginative or more hackneyed sensibilities could have made for a sitcom. The stuff here isn't complicated and as it starts it all feels so... simple. All one is doing is seeing... a few kids two of them brothers who live ordinary lives and their parents deal with ordinary problems like... well did this person pay the dues owed to that other person and did the other woman use that money to get a washing machine? Good heavens the scandal! That's the way I always come to Ozu's films where it starts off and for at least the first twenty minutes to nearly half an hour it feels like nothing is happening but that's only because of expectations that come from seeing decades of movies where incident is supposed to happen drama is supposed to escalate quickly and those pesky lessons from screen writing classes get jammed down our throats. Good Morning doesn't do that this is the kind of story where what would seem to be a moment of high dramatic conflict comes when the doortodoor salesman hocking his wares of rubber bands and pencils yes pencils drops by and makes the mother of the two boys a little uncomfortable saying We don't need anything. As it turns out he's probably one of the nicest salesmen in the history of cinema.But I hope you can see what I mean if you watch this or even read the synopsis how the stuff of this story could have been used as parts for a sitcom type of scenario Leave it to Beaver mayhap? While it should go without saying that the idea of you know buying a television being the central conflict and driving force of the two boys who decide to stage a hungerandortalking strike farts are okay though may appear dated in a world where if one finds a home that does not have a TV or a decent laptop or home projection system or who knows what else the idea of encroaching technology is something that is universal. Certainly the parents are fine with them going to the movies if they do that never comes up or something that's easy to take for granted like you know electricity who why the problem with the TV? The distraction is part of it maybe the key part for the mother when will those pesky kids do their English homework?! but it's also something a little deeper than that.Ozu's mastery here is to take parts that again I must stress seem not only like nothing extraordinary but precisely the stuff that families deal with day in and day out  down to one of those life's little observation things a standup like Seinfeld might point out as in why people use those good morning nice weather observations as a way of masking how one really feels say to the woman that's a crush  but gives it a depth of feeling and subtlety that you grow to appreciate. Like with Tokyo Story and a few others by this director it suddenly hits you about half an hour in what Ozu is really trying to do here for me it's when the kids throw their tantrum and decide to go on their speakingstrike but again the farts are okay and it becomes a richer experience one that has a uniqueness despite seeming on the surface to be the stuff that people deal with day in and day out.That the movie is also funny is a plus but it's not like a 'LOL' sort of scenario you're not going to bust a gut exactly through this though I found some hearty laughs with the kid the son of that actress who is in a lot of Ozu movies as the bitchiest of the characters I believe the more ungrateful daughter on Tokyo Story actually. No this is a gentle comedy that relies a lot on behavior a little repetition like the little very cute brother repeating everything his older brother does and what are perceptive touches of social satire. It's such a realistically drawn film even down to yes I must stress again the fart jokes that it may be lost on some like those who would be fine with a typical sitcom for families that there is commentary about how we live and adapt to changes and the resistance is just as natural as the gradual acceptance of the change and how we use language which I used to watch a lot I'm not kidding this feels like something that could've been on Full House!".

	onyx:emotionText "I'll start off saying something about Good Morning that will sound like I'm putting it down but I'm really not the ingredients of the story or stories if you want to get technical there are sort of three running plotlines here with characters all centered around several houses right below one of Ozu's quintessential small hills in a lot of other's less imaginative or more hackneyed sensibilities could have made for a sitcom. The stuff here isn't complicated and as it starts it all feels so... simple. All one is doing is seeing... a few kids two of them brothers who live ordinary lives and their parents deal with ordinary problems like... well did this person pay the dues owed to that other person and did the other woman use that money to get a washing machine? Good heavens the scandal! That's the way I always come to Ozu's films where it starts off and for at least the first twenty minutes to nearly half an hour it feels like nothing is happening but that's only because of expectations that come from seeing decades of movies where incident is supposed to happen drama is supposed to escalate quickly and those pesky lessons from screen writing classes get jammed down our throats. Good Morning doesn't do that this is the kind of story where what would seem to be a moment of high dramatic conflict comes when the doortodoor salesman hocking his wares of rubber bands and pencils yes pencils drops by and makes the mother of the two boys a little uncomfortable saying We don't need anything. As it turns out he's probably one of the nicest salesmen in the history of cinema.But I hope you can see what I mean if you watch this or even read the synopsis how the stuff of this story could have been used as parts for a sitcom type of scenario Leave it to Beaver mayhap? While it should go without saying that the idea of you know buying a television being the central conflict and driving force of the two boys who decide to stage a hungerandortalking strike farts are okay though may appear dated in a world where if one finds a home that does not have a TV or a decent laptop or home projection system or who knows what else the idea of encroaching technology is something that is universal. Certainly the parents are fine with them going to the movies if they do that never comes up or something that's easy to take for granted like you know electricity who why the problem with the TV?

	schema:reviewBody "Natalia Verbeke gives a good performance showing a driven professional who goes after the truth despite sometimes experiencing personal fear. She has two nice showcase moments in the film where she proves she really got into her character's skin in the cafeteria before Ariza's deposition and at the paper after a threatening call is received. Jordi Molla on the other hand underacts in light of the character he is playing. A military man in such a position would certainly show a great deal more arrogance and violent character and we all know Molla is capable of showing it after his performance in BLOW. Ana Alvarez is memorable as the submissive girlfriend but none of the rest of the cast really stand out. There isn't any real character development to make the audience sympathise with any of the main characters beyond mentions in passing that one of the journalists is divorced and the other about to get married.The real problem with this film however is that the actors aren't really given much to work with. The basis of the story is explained in a manner approaching docudrama but without sufficient detail to really justify such stilted plot development. The scenes of GAL members doing horrible acts to the tune of American rock music is a teeny bit surreal as clearly it is meant to show GAL was working nonstop committing crimes of all sorts but the movie doesn't get into the nitty gritty of what they actually did except to show one car bomb and one botched kidnapping. The musical choice makes me wonder if the person who did the soundtrack is at all aware of the music scene in Spain in the 80's and what the characters would likely have been listening to. In any case the use of flashback at certain parts of the film is supported by the interview technique but doesn't add anything in the way of suspense. Rather it gives the film a sloppy and disjointed feel.All in all the film views like a propaganda film the likes of those shown to troops before wars to get them convinced of how they should feel without explaining too much lest they think for themselves. Frankly the story this movie covers is a very important one in the history of a country that went from the fascist rule of a dictatorship to democracy without condemning the hierarchy of the previous government for their abuses. Clearly that caused problems in the transition to democracy and arguably those problems are still present today. There are so many historical political and social issues involved that they cannot easily be treated in 111 minutes. However that is no excuse for producing a film lacking in focus and development... unless the objective is solely to get the audience worked up.Perhaps a remake will do a better job. Perhaps a subsequent treatment will be worth watching. Aside from Natalia Verbeke's 5 minutes this one sure is not.".

The actresses have stunning beauty. Although I hate Hollywoodian closeups I loved to study the faces men's and women's here. They are not too short and not too long...just right as in Goldilocks. I admire the courage shown here by the newspapermen. I admired the courage shown in LOBO by the topo mole and others. I hope Melchor Mirailles is gathering material for a third film. Read between the lines. I enjoyed the scenery taken from a far and especially noticed a waterfront scene with night lights to the left and a huge depositcontainer to the right. I hope my note of 8 raises the note of the picture.".

The actresses have stunning beauty. Although I hate Hollywoodian closeups I loved to study the faces men's and women's here. They are not too short and not too long...just right as in Goldilocks. I admire the courage shown here by the newspapermen. I admired the courage shown in LOBO by the topo mole and others. I hope Melchor Mirailles is gathering material for a third film. Read between the lines. I enjoyed the scenery taken from a far and especially noticed a waterfront scene with night lights to the left and a huge depositcontainer to the right. I hope my note of 8 raises the note of the picture.";

Charles Brub may be the bikers' legal representative but his conscience is giving him such a bad time that he looks ready to betray his clients to the forces of law and order. Jacques and Marc go undercover to get up close and personal with their target. Will they gain Brub's trust? Will they coax him into baring his troubled conscience and all the information it contains?

I had seen some previews and interviews on TV with the main actors but I must say that whatever I had seen or heard did not compare at all with the film itself. Firstly the titles are very imaginative and quite different. The musical track is very interesting. Even if there are no catching musical pieces it is just to the point without being too much. Now for the story itself the beginning of the film is quite interesting as a police movie and as good and ever better than some I've seen. When you get into the plot itself you never stop laughing and even to the tears sometimes. The actors are fantastic and LouisJos Houde is amazing in his first important role. Those who have seen him in his oneman show will find he is quite natural with some of the same mimics we are used to. Michel Ct is once more incredible as usual. You will discover a great actor in Patrick Drolet as well as all of the others actors. The pictures especially when they are in therapy in the woods are quite spectacular. I heard some not so good comments coming out of the theater but they came from what I would call older frustrated men who cannot relate to the new way with parents and children.".

Rmy Girard is a wonderful actor but here seems to go through the motion and repeat his character from Les Boys. Finally the very pretty Caroline Dhavernas is totally lacking any credibility as a cop and annoys us with her wooden acting. Her lack of chemistry with Houde also kills their romance.The actual crime plot and story? Completely ludicrous and clich. The writing and direction fails to engage the viewers at any point in the story. In most movies of the genre it is good to remember we often know how it's going to end the point of these films is to make the ride enjoyable by creating cool action scenes poignant moments and of course making us laugh at times. This film fails. And if it wasn't a local product the rating would be closer to the 5 it deserves.

	schema:reviewBody "As a bilingual speaker living in a French Community I get to see both American and FrenchCanadian movies. I'm more of a comedy and action addict and most movies my province releases are dramas who most of the time are pointless or are comedies that sometimes don't make us laugh at all. The main problem with that is that our filmmakers have a tendency to overstretch a recipe that made us laugh once but after a few pointless sequels don't make us laugh anymore. But since I'm more into big visual effects I don't go watch most of my province's movies and if I do it happens around once a year which is not a lot considering the fact I go to the movies every two weeks.To tell you the truth when I first saw the trailer for this movie at the theaterswhen I was about to watch The International I wasn't at all sure whether I was going to see it or not. Then I saw the trailers over and over again and when it came out I heard positive reviews from my grandparents My grandpa has a lot of trouble watching a whole movie and my parents and before I knew it I dragged my friend along to the movies. And I'll tell you I enjoyed LouisJos Houde and Michel Cot in this movie. Their chemistry seemed to work perfectly and for a FrenchCanadian movie it was awesome. Some scenes make you smile while others make you laugh out loud. The story was very well elaborated and the script itself very well written. I have no flaws to tell you about this movie except perhaps the fact that it probably won't be released in the United States though there is an English version available but I don't know if it is dubbed or subtitled. All in all a person living in Qubec should absolutely see this movie and for the people who aren't living in Qubec look for a film called ''Father and Guns'' the English version. Two thumbs way up and this is a film that all FrenchCanadian directors should take example on.".

And it's for sure that you can't really innovate such a genre so it's for sure that some things are repetitive but because of its FrenchCanadian charme and the call of the wild in the movie all other movies of the genre play almost entirely in cities this one is almost unique.The story is quite simple In the opening scene a young police officer who had an under cover job to do inside a criminal biker gang in Montreal gets caught and the biker gang wants to exchange him against one of their members who is actually in prison. The police sees no chance to find someone who would have the courage to infiltrate the biker gang again or to say or work against them at the courtyard. The only person who knows everything about all the crimes that the biker gang did is their lawyer a tough guy and a real professional. But he has a big problem His son hates him because they have no close relationship he takes drugs and is in depression and close to suicide. That's why the lawyer's wife decides to make her husband and his son participate for one week in a psychological fatherson experience in the nature that may calm down the conflicts and approach them. The police sees this occasion as their only chance and two police officer father and son at the same job with a lot of problems and a lack of sensibility and healthy communication go there and the father wants to approach to the lawyer and offer him finally police security and a new identity if he would reveal the place where is caught the kidnapped police officer and give proofs for some terrible crimes which the biker gang has done. But of course the bikers will also send some of their members to put their lawyer under surveillance.The movie lives from two main things First the little details around the main story. There are some really funny strange and emotive events that happen in the Canadian forests between all those fathers and sons and it is interesting to see all the characters changing and developing. Second there are a few really great actors in the movie especially Michel Ct who plays better than in his usual series and is really convincing as the tough father and police officer and who was a rough charme and edgy kind of humour and there is also Rmy Girard who plays the convincing role of the lawyer.But the weakest point of this movie are some other actors First of all there is LouisJos Houde he is not convincing at all as a police officer and his childish jokes just look really poor next to the brilliant acting of Michel Ct. Houde is more a comedian and has a lot of fans because of his standup comedy shows but as a main actor he is not like a Patrick Huard and although he is doing his best it is not really enough to convince. And than there is the boring love story with the actor Caroline Dhavernas in the movie that is just annoying and filled with clichs. The worst is not that Dhavernas also does a bad acting and has nothing of a charming and beautiful woman but that there is not chemistry between her an Houde and their love story is lacking any credibility and not really profound.So with this movie you've got a solid and entertaining action comedy movie with an interesting setting and an irresistible FrenchCanadian charm and a few really great actors. But there is no surprising element in the story nothing new and also some weaker actors. All in all it's an easy to watch movie for a DVD night with your friends and a good choice for those who like the genre or the Quebecker cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "I only just saw this film yesterday after picking it up from a charity shop. The cover which showed one of the really coollooking APEX robots from the film caught my attention immediately. When I watched the picture I was not let down. In some ways I guess the plot could be seen as a bit of a TERMINATOR rip off but there's more to it than that. Time travel is a reality in a Utopian future but only robots known as APEX units are sent to avoid messing up the time line. But when one APEX sterilisation unit nearly kills a family in 1973 a guy called Nicholas Sinclair travels back to stop it.The alternate future that Sinclair returns to after accidentally altering the past is truly hellish. An unknown virus has decimated the population and to cap it all the surviving humans have to battle with the APEX robots. People infected with the virus are shown no compassion whatsoever. Soldiers infected with it are sent on suicide missions. This particularly rattles Sinclair as the woman who was his wife in his own time line is such a person.Sinclair struggles to set things right while facing hostility from some troop members and attacks from the robots. For a low budget scifi movie this picture is very good. The action scenes are handled brilliantly and the acting from the ensemble group is very good and the robots are a very menacing threat.There were no real big names in the cast but the cast that the film does have are great in their roles. I don't like how much of a jerk they made black soldier Taylor troop leader Shepherd is forever telling him to shut up but I guess no film is completely perfect. I intend to try and see some more of Mr. Phillip J. Roth's films to see what they're like. I must say though that I am glad to have APEX in my possession.".

The idea and the low budget presentation are intriguing. I do not believe that every science fiction film can or will have a huge budget and expensive special effects. I enjoyed the actors the acting and the adventure. I was able to immerse myself in the characters and flow right through the film with them. A.P.E.X has a strong plot excellent continuity good science adventure suspense and lots of excitement. The director did an excellent job of creating a world on the verge of extinction hanging onto its humanity by slender threads.   The only elements I did not care for at all were the extremely foul language that pervaded the entire film and the degrading stereotyping of the black soldier. He was a good actor and had a lot more to offer than that of a modern day ghetto brute.  His character could have been rough and crude without being completely obscene. All they had to do was leave out all the bad language.  The actor did a fine job with his role anyway. I enjoyed his rendition of his character.  I often think that some day in a more enlightened cultural time frame we are going to be completely ashamed of the foul language that currently pervades and debases even our finest films. There will possibly be an effort to clean up the old films and a debate will rage as to whether this is akin to colorization and destroys the artistic intent of the films. Let us hope.At any rate A.P.E.X. is an enjoyable science fiction experience even with the obscenities intact. I recommend it for mature science fiction fans.".

He's recently been having nightmares about his wife disappearing by way of a cheap editing trick. This gives him a nasty case of Must Narrate Everything in spite of the fact that with two exceptions what he says we already know.

Perhaps you've already realized that this script wasn't authored by someone holding a Ph.d. It's pretty straightforward and the paradoxes don't hold up to scrutiny. Yes the AI's aim sucks when it needs to. No the characters are stereotypical. Yes the lead being in love with this universe's version of his spousewho resembles her by appearance only means he's really superficial. However if you watched The Terminator and spent the whole time wishing the entire thing was set in the future... well this is a fix for you. This is 96 minutes sans credits and most of it is in a post apocalyptic dystopian future with plenty of explosions shooting and... well attempts at tension. The acting is decent. There is lot of bloody violence and disturbing content and a sex scenenot graphic in this. I recommend this to those that just want to unwind with something like this. 510".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm sick of reading how bad this film is I really enjoy it every time I watch it. I first saw this film by accident on late night Channel 4 and to my horror I forgot what it was called. Years later in a used video shop I saw one that caught my eye. The spine had a strange looking robot and I picked it up read the synopsis and to my sheer delight it was the film! The film is about a scientist who sends robots back in time to explore the past. One time the experiment goes wrong and the robot encounters some humans which the robot tries to exterminate so as not to pollute the time line. Nicholas Sinclair goes back in time to stop the death and inadvertently causes a virus to mutate into a disease and gives it to everyone. He goes back to his own time and finds everything different. In this reality robots are being sent to clean the time line thus kill everyone and we follow Sinclair's attempts to stop this from ever happening. I loved the narration during the film. it creates a depressing apocalyptic atmosphere throughout the film and I only saw a couple of bits with bad acting. These were done by the black man who was playing a stereotype. Others found the stereotype offensive I found it refreshing to see the black man as you'd expect and not some sort of hero. The group of soldiers are good together and it was a nice touch not to have them like each other but still under the command of Shepherd. I always think he would make a great Duke Nukem. The robots did look a little cheap and nasty but are still scary and quite believable. The whole apocalyptic feel is done particularly well with the cities and landscape adding to the pretence that the world is in ruins. The final twenty minutes are gripping. I was on the edge of my seat waiting to see what would happen. I loved the bits where the people vanished from reality especially Taylor. The last scene with Shepherd and Sinclair was epic and made excellent cinema and the sound made the film eerie and atmospheric at the end when Sinclair sees himself save the world by stopping the units being sent in the first place. The whole film is thoroughly enjoyable with the fight scenes dialogue and sets seem too good for a madetoTV movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "I first saw A.P.E.X. a long long while back I couldn't have been more than about 10 years old at the time and my understanding of it was negligible. All I really remembered was cool robots and a complicated story involving time travel and a plague which was about enough to convince me to give it a second shot when it appeared on TV since the passage of years has given early 90's straight to video science fiction of this sort a curious fascination for me that actually outstrips the excitement that they originally induced. Remarkably A.P.E.X. actually repaid my interest its certainly no classic but as far as its genre goes it certainly ain't too bad. The key is the plot the film deals in a pretty interesting science fiction concept with a neat emotional hook for its main character. Basically a mishap involving an exploratory time travelling robot results in our hero landing in a parallel reality that has branched off from his own confronting him with his greatest fear that of losing his beloved wife. The film tries to deal with post apocalyptic themes parallel worlds and the consequences of paradoxes upon the time line and though it can't quite keep itself together its imaginative and intriguing stuff. The plot actually holds up better than a number of reviews here would suggest although there are one or two notable holes and clear contrivances. Despite problems the ambition is laudable it's just a shame that the same ambition didn't carry over to the action which mostly consists of repetitious shoots outs with robots. The pyrotechnics budget was clearly decent so there are plenty of explosions plus the robots are pretty cool shining golden creates with ridge plated armour and both shoulder and hand cannons. But the action gets dull pretty quickly and neither the robots nor humans have realistic or interesting tactics. Acting turns do a better than expected job of sustaining interest though nobody is much more than merely there certain of the cast do convey a certain sympathy and interest. Richard Keats for example as the hero he can't put across much reaction to the situation but is likable enough Lisa Anne Russell has a sullen attractiveness Marcus Aurelius appropriately grating as the token ahole character it's all fair enough for this level of film. Some of the writing works some doesn't and while I appreciated that the film wasn't bogged down with technobabble it could have done with a bit more explanation. The direction from Philip J. Roth who turned out to be a low budget sci fi regular and also wrote the film is occasionally stylish in its use of lighting with green red and dark moments put to good effect he has a fair handling on atmosphere but I wish he had put more flair into the action. Altogether I thought this was a fair enough film. Only likely to appeal to sci fi buffs and they'll probably have a field day tearing it apart but I had a reasonable enough time. 510 from me then.".

Having said that the story is actually alright  the whole time travel killer robots thing has been done before but that doesn't make it less interesting.  It doesn't go anywhere unexpected but it is not as bad as you suspect it might be.What does let the story down a little is the rest of the production. Produced by Talaat Captan strangely no Oscar nominations yet! it seems his biggest input was to get his son cast in one of the roles.  The whole thing has a TVM feel  despite the swearing and violence.  The special effects are cheap and very reminiscent of a straight to video scifi the locations are good if basic  only the  occasional interior shot looks like cardboard. But really you can see the budget constraints up there on screen.The tight budget goes through to the cast  they aren't great and aren't helped by some poor dialogue.  Keats Cox Russell etc are all TVM actors but they do actually do alright considering.  The APEX units themselves are mixed  they look cheap at first but then you forget that they look cheap. But then after a while you realise that they're rubbish  they can't shoot straight at all while the humans just need one powerful hit to get them or even a music CD!.  This takes away from the tension of the film  at least with Arnie you knew without a doubt that he was one mean mother who wasn't going to miss!Overall this has some entertaining moments but is really a TVM with attitude  catch it now on the bottom shelf of your video store.".

He must work out how to right the present to change the past and his solution is interesting. This is a good film for those who like time travel and the complexities that go with it.";

There is a curious use of colour in some shots where the whole set is lit in pure red or green or cyan with lots of deep shadows. It looks very peculiar.

I could go on and on but most of these are from in between 1989 to 94. All are foul daft crap and abysmal pieces to add to film history but and lets get this right they are fan favourites and are held as the best of the worst.

So if you cant remember any of these SERIOUSLY don't watch A.P.E.X because it falls on SIMILAR category but is actually better in some places.Now to start if you know these films and know them as being bad but you love them like puppies wearing sign saying  i need a hug then please read on if not there is not a soul within your cracking husk of a torso merely a rock on string swinging loosely in a draft. A.P.E.X is actually fairly decent because it sets out to tell what it damn well says it will. A robot travels through time decides to kill innocents in the 1970's the man who made the robot goes back to stop it creates a super virus and an altered future by the paradox created by the robot and the man being discovered the family is safe by the way. Yeah Yeah all bread and butter sci fi a bit like Terminator so far but the fun comes out of the bad sets the big breasts the hammy acting the black guy dies robots are about as bright as pond scum you know all the crap all the time type stuff out of memory i remember one set is just a crummy futuristic office with a big fan and a light shinning through it with lots of people coughing and red lighting everywhere. Also the virus is great its greenblack oatmeal stuff that looks like a bad tattoo well thats what its supposed to be like futuristic leprosy Classic!. When things go this bad you have to at least appreciate the nadgers to continue and make it actually work which it does its fun film and it ends happily why not get drunk and give it a go.If you like the sound of a semi alright film give it a shot if this makes you want to put forks in the maker of this film then quite simply don't.

I liked the fact that it was TERRIBLE!There was nothing brilliant about this movie if anything i just wanted to turn it off and go back to sleep but there was something so terrible about it i just couldn't help but watch!!!The storyline is rather crap but i'm not sure if a dodgy paradox is the correct word. There IS a possiblity that more than one tau line can exist therefore meaning the A.P.E.X units from one timeline could be sent to another since both tau lines could exist. Its all very complex and i don't thing the film producers actually understand this.They don't seem to understand that if the different timelines were to remain seperate and at the same time they would interact somebody in the first timeline would still be able to do something about the units going back!

And why would the people in the first timeline shrink away into nothing if another timeline was created!! Its all very odd.The A.P.E.X units were very dodgy i didn't like the fact that they looked like simple bits of plastic thrown on together with some sticky tape keeping all the bits together!The acting was below anything i've ever seen before i didn't like most of the soliders and the scene in which the two soliders the big black dude and the small white one have a bloody conversation in the middle of a battle with shots going on in the background!? ARGH! LOLDon't watch this unless drunk stoned or just plain bored. Its something that you wouldn't watch unless u've got nothing else to watch i wouldn't recommend it otherwise...".

I liked the fact that it was TERRIBLE!There was nothing brilliant about this movie if anything i just wanted to turn it off and go back to sleep but there was something so terrible about it i just couldn't help but watch!!!The storyline is rather crap but i'm not sure if a dodgy paradox is the correct word. There IS a possiblity that more than one tau line can exist therefore meaning the A.P.E.X units from one timeline could be sent to another since both tau lines could exist. Its all very complex and i don't thing the film producers actually understand this.They don't seem to understand that if the different timelines were to remain seperate and at the same time they would interact somebody in the first timeline would still be able to do something about the units going back!

The motion picture was professionally directed by Jaime Chavarri  a good professional who has directed good films .

	schema:reviewBody "Agustina of Aragn was a Spanish heroine who defended Spain during the Spanish War of Independence  first as a civilian and later as a professional officer in the Spanish Army . Known as the Spanish Joan of Arc  considered to be the saviour of Zaragoza  she has been the subject of much folklore  mythology  and artwork  including sketches by Francisco de Goya and the poetry of Lord Byron . Narrated in a long flash black in which Agustina arrives in the Royal Palace accompanied by General Torres Jess Tordesillas . It starts with Napoleon Guillermo Marin orders his Generals to invade Spain but then occur insurrection in Mostoles  Bruch and Valencia . While Agustina Aurora Bautista goes out of Barcelona to Zaragoza to marry her fianc Luis Montana Eduardo Fajardo who results to be an Afrancesado . But a pursued man accompanies her in the stagecoach . Before dying at a confrontation with a sadistic French lieutenant Jos Bdalo  he gives to her an important document she has to deliver to Lorenzo El Pastor Fernando Rey . Thanks to a brave Guerrillero called Juan Virgilio Texeira  she gets to arrive in her destination . Later on  the Zaragoza siege takes place and Agustina becomes a leader in the resistance . Then  the city of Zaragoza is really besieged by French troops and Spanish forces under General Palafox Fernando Rey are scarce . By the time of the siege  French army choked with vast numbers of refugees fleeing the advancing Grande Arme . In early June 1808  the French began to advance on Zaragoza which had not seen war for about 450 years and was held by a tiny provincial force under Jos de Palafox  whose heroism would come to rival Agustina's .This is a remake to original film titled Agustina De Aragon 1929 by Florian Rey . The picture is divided in two parts  The first one is the best  being developed as an adventure movie and plenty of action and suspense . The second part deals with the Zaragoza siege  filled with successive battles and fights and it is packed with strong ideological charge . As in the fifties Spain was isolated from other other countries  suffering starvation and shortages similarly to the besieged people . The flick is marred by overacting  most of them play similarly to stage actors  as the influence of the theater in players results to be extreme and embarrassing  specially by Aurora Bautista who gives a ridiculous and histrionic performance . The settings Sevilla studios are acceptable though mostly made in CartonPiedra stone as well as mattepainting . Very good cinematography in black and white by Ted Pahle . And atmospheric score by Jun Quintero  including evocative songs and Aragon Jotas . The film is dedicated to The sons of the Spanish Independence . The motion picture was lavishly produced by CIFESA  the most known production company during Francoist period  that often financed these false but breathtaking historical spectacles  being professionally directed by Jun De Ordua at his best . With director Florian Rey formed the production company Goya Films . Jun adapted to cinema famous novels such as Zalacan El Aventurero  Caas Y Barro  El Frente De Los Suspiros  Nobleza Baturra  Lola Se Va a Los Huertos  being especially known for his historical renditions such as Teresa De Jesus  Alba De Amrica  La Leona De Castilla  Agustina De Aragn and Locura De Amor . His most successful picture was El Ultimo Cuple with Sara Montiel . The picture is based on historical events  As valiant Agustina March 4 1786  May 29 1857 uprising against the French and doesn't hesitate to lead the battle and even fire a cannon to stop the invaders when others escape . On June 15 1808 the French army stormed the Portillo an ancient gateway into the city defended by a hodgepodge battery of old cannons and a heavily outnumbered volunteer unit. Agustina arriving on the ramparts with a basket of apples to feed the gunners watched the nearby defenders fall to French bayonets. The Spanish troops broke ranks having suffered heavy casualties and abandoned their posts. With the French troops a few yards away Agustina herself ran forward loaded a cannon and lit the fuse shredding a wave of attackers at point blank range. The sight of a lone woman bravely manning the cannons inspired the fleeing Spanish troops and other volunteers to return and assist her. After a bloody struggle the French gave up the assault on Zaragosa and abandoned their siege for a few short weeks before returning to fight their way into the city housebyhouse. With the human cost proving truly terrible on both sides and the city's defences hopelessly compromised Palafox finally accepted the inevitable and was forced to surrender the city to the French. Despite the eventual defeat Agustina's action became an inspiration to those opposing the French. After being captured she was imprisoned and saw Eugenio die at the hands of her French guards. She subsequently mounted a daring escape and became a lowlevel rebel leader for the guerrilleros helping to organise raids and attacks that harassed the French. As the strategic situation deteriorated for the French Army her role became increasingly orthodox as supplies and training were covertly provided by the Duke of Wellington. Agustina began to fight for the allied forces as Wellington's only female officer and ultimately rose to the rank of Captain . According to some sources on June 21 1813 she acted as a front line battery commander at the Battle of Vitoria under the command of Major Cairncross who reported directly to Wellington himself.".

	schema:reviewBody "Having myself lived in an Andalusian pueblo for the better part of a year albeit in 2004 I found myself amused by some of the similarities between my own modern experiences and those of Geraldo in this lighthearted romantic comedy  particularly the dumbstruck way in which he initially blunders about in a world that is in many ways completely alien to him. Also quite familiar was the tightness of the community the openness the love of the art of conversation the desire as embodied in the character of Paco to find any reason to throw a party and of course the wonderful passionate Flamenco.The village characters less than fully fleshedout individuals but more than stereotypes are in some ways archetypes of the times. Much of Andalusia was impoverished in that time period another familiarity to me having grown up in a small poor rural town in the US  and yes as in all such places there are the machinations for dominance in the village the matrimonial plotting of the town matriarchs and even the mystique embodied however clumsily by the gangly English foreigner Geraldo who has arrived looking only inspiration but finds himself rather lost and quickly swept away by the engines of fate.Far from being a serious film this comedy depicts well the clash of Geraldo's naive artistic intentions with what life in this poor Andalusian town to which he is so completely new actually provides him. The film serves as a metaphor of more modern times in Andalusia as well with so many Britons and other northerners having relocated to the Spanish Mediterranean  bringing with them the twoedged sword of wealth and development which has lifted much of Andalusia out of poverty in recent decades but subverted a good deal of passionate tradition as well. Little pueblos evolve into bedroom communities for British Dutch and German retirees and wealthy vacationers and new golf resorts spring up like weeds. The transformation of Andalusiua depicted in a simplistic way in the film continues.".

	schema:reviewBody "This beautiful film is based upon a memoir of Gerald Brenan who was a member of England's Bloomsbury Group. It is the story of a randy young man who completely immerses himself in the lives and culture of a small Spanish town shortly after WWI. Brenan throughout his long life was an adventurer and traveler who seemed to have had the enviable ability to absorb and learn from all of his varied experiences.The movie begins with Brenan trooping through the Spanish countryside to reach a small town where he has obtained a house. His greeting from the locals cannot be considered warm but still not hostile. His intent is to read write and absorb the culture of this town that is somewhat of a throwback to the previous century  not something really unusual considering this is rural Spain in the 1920's. As time passes he becomes more of a member of the community but is still seen as a curious oddity by many of the residents.Brenan's fascination and admiration of the people and their culture was clearly evident. He and his writings became admired by the Spanish people and recognized by the Spanish government.This film is particularly enjoyable because it is evocative of the unique period in Europe between the wars when so many artists shed the constraining straitjacket of Victorianism for an enlightened erotic freedom of expression. Matthew Goode who plays Brenan is perfect as a young man freed from the oppression of war and the oppression of society to explore all the educational and erotic pleasures available. He is supported by an excellent cast of Spanish actors  the men portraying character and strength the women exemplifying emotion and dark sensuous passion.I may be a bit prejudiced in my liking for this film. If I could pick another time and place to live my life I would choose that time between the wars in Europe so I tend to lap up any book or film depicting that period. Even if you are not as enamored as I am of that time I think you will find Al sur de Granada worthwhile entertainment.".

	schema:headline " Pleasant and decent Spanish comedy along with some drama elements  being efficiently directed by expert comedian director Fernando Colomo";

This comedydrama contains a romantic love story  social habits  humor  entertainment and including some nudism with strong love scenes . This is a slightly funny film with entertaining events  giggles  emotion  an enjoyable love story and touching scenes at its final part . The film moves in fits and starts most of which would be desirable  with more traps the viewer resists any kind and some moments of enjoyment and others quite a few embarrassing with some absurdities and implausibilities . The flick gives a short description about rural lives of lowclasses in the twenties . This is a typical Spanish comedy from the 2000s with the usual ingredients such as agreeable humor  villagers customs  relationships among people . The roles in this film are all lovable despite being rather pathetic and unfortunate . Our starring Gerald must sort out his feelings and face down the machinations of the village's women  who map a future he doesn't want . The picture also explores the complex relationship among known Brit artists such as Ralph Partridge Laurence Fox  Dora Carrington Jessica Kate Meyer  Lytton Strachey James Fleet  issue formerly dealt in the film Carrington . The flick attempts to spread optimism about the events of life  friendship and love  with its amusing sides but also including some risks . The film deals with the relationship between Spanish and Anglo Saxon youth  including language problems  a topic also treated by the director in other films such as Linea Del Cielo  Efecto Mariposa and Los Aos Barbaros  . Sympathetic performances from protagonist duo who provides a considerable boost to the result  such as Matthew Goode as the subsequent famous author Gerald Brennan and Veronica Sanchez  a teen beauty who's the daughter of a witch . Likable support cast gives good acting such as Guillermo Toledo  Bebe  Consuelo Trujillo  Mariano Pea  ngela Molina  Mariana Cordero  Antonio Resines  among others . A well acted so so crafted movie that should be considered as a return in form to the typical Spanish comedy of yesteryear . The picture achieved Goya prizes for Best Original Score  Juan Bardem  and nominated for Best Production Supervision Goya Best New Actress  Vernica Snchez  and Best Cinematography  Jos Luis Alcaine and Best Special Effects  Reyes Abades. Atmospheric and appropriate musical score by the notorious Juan Bardem  a magnificent composer who has composed a lot of films . Furthermore  a colorful and evocative cinematography by Jose Luis Alcaine who was first cinematographer to use fluorescent tube as key lightning and deemed to be one of the best Spanish cameramen . Alcaine frequently works with Pedro Almodvar  Bigas Luna and Vicente Aranda  as he has photographed The skin I live in  The bad education  Volver  Women in the verge of a nervous breakdown among others . Here he shows splendidly the impressive landscapes from Alpujarras . The motion picture was professionally written and directed Fernando Colomo .

There are some disappointments too social issues such as the great divide between rich and poor the consequences of the religious protestant reform failure in Spain and the emigration dream in this case to Argentine are just touched but never fully explored. Fernando Colomo is an Alist director of the Spanish film industry and he has attracted a star studded cast to this movie. Great names like Antonio Resines and Angela Molina are happy to take on what they are really minor roles... The acting in general is quite good.

Of course he finally falls in love and all these things. Unfortunately this is not a Meg Ryan's film so the story is not well told to us nor the crash of cultures and nothing.

The film also shows the child as the victim of a tyrannical father who tries to fulfill his own desires through his son. To escape the pressure of his father Albniz fled his home first to South America and then to the United States. The musician's personal life was marked by tumultuous romances. Albniz returned to Spain but received a scholarship at the Brussels Conservatory awarded by King Alfonso XII but once again the focus of his attention was on women rather than on music.

	schema:headline " Along with 'The Wizard of Oz' the supreme film about the longing for home.";
	schema:reviewBody "To see how beautiful moving exciting and astonishing Melville's 'Le Samourai' is to recognise it as one of the greatest films ever made arguably the most perfect it is necessary to forget everything you've been told about it.  If you've been told nothing than you are very lucky the first time I saw I knew nothing either and it was a revelation  I came out of the cinema with huge goggle eyes  cinema can do THAT?!  I absorbed every Melville film I could find they are VERY hard to get and read every article or book about him.  My love grew to uncontrollable passion.  But a lot cliches and received truths have grown up around his work and this sublime miracle especially.The most obvious is the director's obsession with American cinema.  That his films are mere tributes to American cinema or stern deconstructions of them.  It is true that Jef Costello wears the classic film noir garb of mac and derby but so do at least 400 men in Paris.  And it is true that Melville rigorously exposes the myth of the gangster but most importantly of masculinity and its power.  Elaborate theories of psychoanalysis are usually brought in here the idea that Jef begins the film 'whole' looking at the mirror during the course of the narrative he loses this selfsufficient image cracking up as it fragments split by mirrors trapped behind bars although the halved banknotes he consciously plays with at the beginning might qualify this.Others comment on the film less as a gangster film than a dramatisation of particular philosophies.  Some see Jef as an example of existentialist man a man who does not exist except through his acts  the film patiently records endless scenes of Jef walking staring preparing for his jobs etc. His final ritual is a preparation for his death as existentialism suggests friends social purpose etc. fall away and one is left alone with one's fate.  Or as an expression of fatalistic Orientalist ethics the film IS called 'Le Samourai' concerning solitude and the inevitability of death.  Melville himself offered two possible interpretations  as a study in schizophrenia and as an allegory of Man Jef pursued by Destiny the Inspector into the arms of Death Valerie the pianist.All of these of course are valid interpretations.  I am more sympathetic to those who see 'Samourai' as a dream a study in solitude or a portrait of mental breakdown.  The film's action takes place largely at night there is a frequently oneiric tone to Melville's style the endless walking the silence the deliberate  paring down of the miseenscene to nearmonochrome.  Jef's impassivity is comparable to that of a somnambulist walking mechanically down countless corridors.  As in a dream whole sequences are repeated in exactly the same way.  We keep returning to the same few locales.  The film opens with Jef lying smoking in bed in the dark one powerful scene is Jef waking up after he has bandaged his wounded arm  has he had a nightmare or is it the sound of a passing truck?'Samourai' is also much more moving as a story of solitude than Antonioni's entire oeuvre put together.  The only sure thing in this strange and enigmatic film is Jef's loneliness living with his only friend a caged bullfinch usually a symbol of female entrapment in a dismally rundown sparse grey bedsit prey to any intruders.  Although he is constantly forced into the centre of the city by work and the police he is safer on the margins in anonymous streets abandoned railway yards disused buildings. Or at least he was before all the trouble started.  He is defined against the grim geometric anonymity of modern life his milieu as soulless and constricting as the plot he moves in the elevator shafts that imprison him.  He is the image of man in a surveillance society an innocent man until proven guilty having his every move followed by a police happy to use morality as a threat many people see Melville's films as sublimated allegories of France under the Occupation. His only contact with people is in the preparation of death his is a sterile selfnegating existence ascetic as a monk his uniform as ritual vestments.  That Jef is a tragically lonely man is undoubted.  There are two heartbreaking moments in this cool austere film when emotion breaks Alain Delon's astonishing performance the most beautiful man in the movies letting slip just like the stills moving in 'La Jetee' when he goes back to the scene of the crime and looks at the pianist his face for a brief second seems absolutely distraught helpless a child looking for a mother to reassure him this is the key to the film I believe Jef the lonely wanderer searching for home the second after the celebrated Metro chase in the stolen car his face for a moment betraying hearbeating terror. At these moments allegories and theories simply break down.Jef's mental breakdown is of course linked to all this.  Over the credits Jef smokes alone in his bedroom barely visible  the two bright windows look like eyes as in Beckett's 'End Game' a figure for the mind a mind at the end of its tether as seen by Melville's horizontal use of Hitchcock's famous 'Vertigo' shot contracting and constricting the room to breaking point revealing the instability of this 'safe' haven and Jef's image of himself.  Mental deterioration is usually a subject of horror movies  the score features frequent bursts of chilling organ when Jef goes to collect his car and gun for the contract his accomplice lit by a lamp looks like a terrifying spirit.  Jef is a trapped character in his room identity plot by the police and the gangsters by geography shadows corridors by the loop of time that forces him to return again and again to the same point  he is in hell the only way out is self extinction.It is important not to see Melville as  child of Sartre which limits him but of Nabokov whose complex procedures of ludic expression find a cinematic equivalent in his work  it is vitally important not to take him at face value.  Jef's shooting of Rey  impossible magical  is pure Nabokov.  I could go on  the Benjaminian idea of the flaneur and Paris the extraordinary nearfuturistic sets the comedy e.g. see who Jef rides with in the police van answering to the same description its remarkable analysis of the gaze the brilliance of its action and suspense mechanics the running motif of the theatre performing acting in both senses  Jef's costume the lineup in a theatrelike space the closing 'show is over' drumroll.  Everything about this film as John Woo noted is perfect but there is one sequence breaking with Melville's calm distant style throughout that I would list on my ten best ever  as Jef goes to collect the cash and is instead faced with a gun  firstly he faces the audience we could be no closer.  Then just as the struggle begins Melville cuts away his camera manically panning away from the action behind bridge grills following Jef as he runs and ineffectually chases his assailant's car.  It is a heartstopping moment in a film still too little known.  I've just watched it twice in two days I really must watch it again.".

Take for example the 'chase' scene through the Metro. Practically nothing happens there are no gunfights no combat sequences perhaps just a small chase. But it is Melville's camera and Delon's inimitable performance that keep the audience mesmerized all the way.The camera practically flirts with the audience throughout the whole movie picking the most interesting angles and achieving so much practically without any effort. Delon's character changes his expression only once or twice during the movie shoots faster than even Leone's gunslingers and never forgets to feed his canary. To me one of the most accomplished antiheroes of the whole genre.The dialogue is barely there but when it is then it's something you'd probably wish you would have come up with yourself. It is a minimalist work that achieves the absolute maximum. Simply put one of the best crime noirs ever made.".

To me one of the most accomplished antiheroes of the whole genre.The dialogue is barely there but when it is then it's something you'd probably wish you would have come up with yourself. It is a minimalist work that achieves the absolute maximum. Simply put one of the best crime noirs ever made.";

This film can be summed up with a single word minimalism.This is a work of true cinema. Hollywood tends to forget that cinema is first and foremost a visual art. Le Samurai is a film that could've been made as a silent movie. The director establishes meaning not with dialog but with the best tools available to a director editing mise en scenes cinematography and composition. There is a constant feeling of solitude and isolation. Even when the protagonist finds himself in large groups his face is pale his eyes are cast downward and he is still a constant outsider.On another note the film looks surprisingly modern. There's none of the graininess of many other 60s and 70s films. Rather the lighting and the whole visual aesthetic is pitch perfect from the black and white nightclub dualism to the sparse gray apartment to the subterranean eeriness of the Paris subway.Personally I would not recommend this film to people not interested in real cinema people who like 'movies' rather than 'film' simply because there's a strong possibility it will seem extremely annoying and boring to you. On the other hand if you're a fan of serious cinema do yourself a favor and watch this film.".

The feel the sounds the streets the noise it's all hauntingly cold and distant but at the same time he makes Paris seem like the coolest city in the world. In the beginning of the film Melville uses a beautiful static shot of over 4 minutes to establish the audience with a seemingly empty room then we see smoke circling upwards. There must be someone in the room but it's practically impossible to determine where the smoke is coming from. Finally Jeff Costello gets up from his bed which wasn't recognizable as such in the first place and appears on screen. The whole setup is more reminiscent of a moving replica of a painting by the surrealist Paul Delvaux than anything else in modern cinema. Another surreal set piece is when after his first hit all possible suspects are brought in at a police station including Delon himself. Not one by one but all of 'em at the same time. In the next scene we see at least a hundred gangsters all wearing trench coats and hats in a large hall where they will be interrogated en plein public. Genuinely strange procedures but handled with such care and stylishness that it becomes completely believable. It gives the somewhat humorous suggestion that the streets of Paris are populated by hundreds even thousands of trenchcoatwearing gangsters all loners only seeing each other at card games and occasions like this.Alain Delon is the perfect embodiment of gangster coolness in this careerdefining role as a hitman in Paris a modernday samura.

	schema:reviewBody "I'm going to go ahead and suggest in my meager way some reasons as to why JeanPierre Melville's Le Samourai is one of the greatest movies ever made but it's far far better for you to experience the film for yourself. You now have no more excuses Criterion has just released it on DVD  though puzzlingly this film doesn't get the deluxe doubledisc treatment that the somewhat inferior Le Cercle Rouge received. Whatever  I'll take it.Simply put Le Samourai justifies  beyond argument  the auteur theory in cinema which states more or less that the most artistically rich movies are authored by their directors. And how much more enjoyable it is for the viewer that the author in this case Melville is mostly concerned with entertaining you! Those who dread the prospect of a French film from the Sixties can rest assured no Godardian slapdash crosscutting here no lolling around in bed with a girl smoking cigarettes and spouting toughguy Marxism no confusing backandforth displacement of narrative time a la Resnais. Oh Melville was a New Wave director to be sure but he was NEVER an experimentalist in terms of narrative. Take a film by Godard even his most famous film Breathless you have to meet Godard on his own terms or get left behind your loss! But Melville pours his stories into your glass neat no ice no intellectual mixer. Le Samourai is about a gunforhire named Jef Costello Alain Delon. His job is to eliminate a nightclub owner. He does so but is witnessed leaving the scene of the crime by the club's piano player Cathy Rosier. Later that night during the police roundup he's taken in as one of 400 or more potential suspects. The cops can't make it stick to Costello but the superintendent Francois Perier isn't fooled by Costello or his airtight alibi. And thus Costello finds himself under police surveillance and meanwhile his criminal bosses want to rub him out in case he squeals to le flics. In other words the actual story is simplicity itself and is frankly ripped off from all the Bmovie American noirs that Melville loved so much.But none of this explains the stark originality of the movie. Of course Melville gets some help. Let it be said that Delon is so good as the hunted hitman that it almost defies description let alone praise. Reportedly he took the part after Melville had read to him the first 7 or 8 pages of the script. I have no dialog for the first 10 minutes. I love it  when can we start? Delon is supposed to have said. Luckily for Melville he found a kindred spirit in Delon who in any case must have recognized the potentially iconic performance he could pull off if sympathetically directed. And boy did he pull it off NO ONE in ANY movie has ever been cooler than Delon's Costello. The movie was released in 1967  the Summer of Love  but here's Delon anachronistically dressed in a singlebreasted suit and a fedora and getting away with it. Well okay everyone else is wearing a hat too but this IS a Melville picture. As for the performance itself it bears comparison to Dirk Bogarde's Aschenbach in Visconti's Death in Venice both roles are virtually silent yet must convey multitudes in a glance in a movement in a slight widening of the eyes. This is acting at its most meticulous most physical and most compact. Costello hardly ever says anything but we're totally compelled by him thanks to Delon's tight control. The influence of this character and Delon's performance has been nothing less than torrential Pacino's Michael in The Godfather may serve as an obvious example.But much of this owes to Melville's original conception as well. If Shakespeare needs good actors to carry his plays over then good actors need Shakespeareanlevel material to reach their best performances. Melville as always flavors his pulpy stews with his own fevered artistic ingredients the foremost of which is own idea of masculinity taken to the insane extreme. Tainted with Japanese samurai films American gangster films and westerns as well Melville concocts a character whose every act is an expression of pure existentialism. The ultimate result is that frisson of sublime strangeness we as an audience encounter whenever we come facetoface with a deeply considered and unique artistic vision. The best art is really weird yet recognizable and unforgettable. Le Samourai is among the best art.10 stars out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "JeanPierre Melville took the idea of the lone gunman perhaps more akin to the western genre than the crime genre and created a film with star Alain Delon as a ultracalm smoothoperating contract killer Jeff Costello in Paris who may be at least a little insane. The result is a blend of stylistic and thematic excellence a suspense film where sometimes that aspect has to take a backseat to the psychological drama of the killer and the sidestory of the police procedural headed by 'Superintendant' played by Francois Perier. The film carries very little dialog with a couple of exceptions which gives Melville a chance to perfect his storytelling technique. Deleon as well was a very fit choice for the role of Costello. It's actually fascinating that Melville made this character mostly a night owl with a look that's usually cold and hard boiled like some neohood from the 30's the protagonist. There's also the look of the film provided in part by Henri Decae who would later lens Melville's epic Le Cercle Rouge. In the opening shot were given the feeling of distortion on Costello's uniquely blank oneroom apartment. Is this to bring us inside of Costello's frayed consciousness or is it just one of those style moves done by directors in the 60's? I might go for the psychological part but what I noticed about Le Samourai adding to the appeal of it was the theme of Costello's mindset is put forth subtlety. This is a pro put into tight circumstances getting heat from his employers as well as the police so who is there for him to go to? Just an on  off again girlfriend Nathalie Delon a little bird in his apartment and a witness to one of his contracts the late Cathy Rosier in a performance of some note despite the onesidedness of her part. When the action comes it's not as bloody as in the films it later inspired most obvious of which are John Woo's The Killer and Jim Jarmusch's Ghost Dog yet that too just adds on to the emotions provoked by the settings and the misenscene.So would I recommend Le Samourai to fans of crime films? Well it may not to those who sole obsession are the crime films that pack all the high octane juice and gore such as in a John Woo or HongKong action film or to the Tarantino fans that may not appreciate the patience Melville has the deliberate pace and silences as opposed to laughs and ultraviolence. I'd guess that Le Samourai is most successful and why it is one of the best films I will ever see because it is heavy on the nuance and detail doesn't skimp on keeping the genre characters believable and leaves the gunplay as true surprises even on repeat viewings however this is the kind of film to be watched maybe once every year or once ever few years so that it keeps fresh when seen again. Aside from delivering the goods in terms of the story and as a drama for the audience it seeks out it's highly absorbing and an example of subtlety in cinematic grammar. It's not a crime or police movie for the mainstream and I'm sure some will seek this out from the underground buzz start watching and say oh man this stuff's in subtitles? I can't bear to watch. Really it's appeal will hold more to fans of the french newwave which Melville set off with Bob le Flambeur filmgeeks and for those looking for a dosage of atmosphere and cool bravura directors can't seem to latch onto in recent times. For me it is one of the truly sublime timecapsule of what the gangsternoir genremood can produce.".

	schema:reviewBody "Le Samourai 1967  The film opens to the semiannoying sound of a small birds chirp in a dull grey room that appears to be empty. After a moment we realize the room is not empty  a man lights a cigarette lying on his bed. Meet Jef Costello played by french pretty boy Alain Delon. The opening shot sets the pace for the rest of movie. There are no high speed chases or wild action sequences and the star barely speaks a word. Costello is one of the coolest characters in film history. Delon plays his character to perfection. If one did not know anything about him it was likely you would not realize he was a pretty boy. His face is expressionless throughout almost the entire movie  it is a tribute to Delon that he can express emotion on only a couple occasions while still remaining facially expressionless.Costello is a hitman loyal to his boss himself. The title of the film Le Samourai suggests of course that Costello is a student of the Samourai code. But is he really? The movie also opens with a quote There is no solitude greater than the Samurai's except for that of a tiger in the jungle. Unless perhaps it be that of the tiger in the jungle. This supposedly comes from the Book of the Samurai which as it turns out was an invention of director JeanPierre Melville.The story plays out as Jef completes a hit on night club owner after setting up an almost too perfect alibi but on his way out the door is seen by a the beautiful piano player. The police round up a number of people who look fit the description Costello happens to be rounded up while at a card game. His alibi is strong and mysteriously the piano player claims that this is definitely not the man she saw another man who watched Costello walk out of the club also said with certainty that this is not the man.

	onyx:emotionText "Le Samourai 1967  The film opens to the semiannoying sound of a small birds chirp in a dull grey room that appears to be empty. After a moment we realize the room is not empty  a man lights a cigarette lying on his bed. Meet Jef Costello played by french pretty boy Alain Delon. The opening shot sets the pace for the rest of movie. There are no high speed chases or wild action sequences and the star barely speaks a word. Costello is one of the coolest characters in film history. Delon plays his character to perfection. If one did not know anything about him it was likely you would not realize he was a pretty boy. His face is expressionless throughout almost the entire movie  it is a tribute to Delon that he can express emotion on only a couple occasions while still remaining facially expressionless.Costello is a hitman loyal to his boss himself. The title of the film Le Samourai suggests of course that Costello is a student of the Samourai code. But is he really? The movie also opens with a quote There is no solitude greater than the Samurai's except for that of a tiger in the jungle. Unless perhaps it be that of the tiger in the jungle. This supposedly comes from the Book of the Samurai which as it turns out was an invention of director JeanPierre Melville.The story plays out as Jef completes a hit on night club owner after setting up an almost too perfect alibi but on his way out the door is seen by a the beautiful piano player. The police round up a number of people who look fit the description Costello happens to be rounded up while at a card game. His alibi is strong and mysteriously the piano player claims that this is definitely not the man she saw another man who watched Costello walk out of the club also said with certainty that this is not the man. Another club patron claims that he saw this man at the club at the time of the murder and claims this is the culprit. The remaining two witnesses aren't sure but don't think this was the killer. We know its Costello the third man believes it is him but why do the two who had the best look claim that this is not the man they saw?

	schema:reviewBody "This film has concerns other than mere narrative and there is an influence that other critics never seem to have mentioned but which struck me right away and that is in the visual style of the film. No the film's cinematography by Henri Deca is not influenced so much by other films even the aforementioned 1930s gangster films but by the paintings of Edward Hopper. The film is rife with images of lonely people staring offscreen or gazing out of windows or into the darkness. Even more so is that Hopper's character's zombielike eyes often sans pupils is mirrored by the ubiquitous vacancies most of Melville's characters furnish especially Delon's robotic steel blue eyes even when brandishing weapons or engaged with each other. It is almost like a shadow play a Platonic Cave entertainment. And this is only further enhanced by the sparse dialogue throughout the film. And then there is the fact that Japanese samurai were not assassins for hire but warriors who fought for honor which suggests that not only is this film a shadow play but perhaps a looking glass one as well. Kudos must be doled out to Melville for the adapted screenplay though because despite the film's miss at greatness it achieves what it does which is considerable a nice twist on a very tired genre with aplomb. As the film was adapted from a Joan McLeod novel called The Ronin but I do not know how much of the book made it into the final film.The Criterion Collection DVD unfortunately lacks an audio commentary but has two visual essaysinterviews with Melville scholars Rui Nogueira and Ginette Vincendeau. There is the requisite fellatio of course but also some valuable insights into the film Then there is arcvhival footage of interviews with Melville Delon and others in the cast as well as the original theatrical trailer. The booklet has selections about Melville and pieces by filmmaker John Woo and film critic David Thomson. The transfer is fine in a 1.851 aspect ratio but there is no English language track only the usual standard Criterion white subtitles. As the film is in color this presents none of the problems such subtitles do with black and white films. All in all not the best extras package from Criterion but far from their worst.Le Samourai is not a masterpiece a term too often bandied about by enthusiasts of any work of art but it is an interesting experiment that works far more than it fails. It also reminded me of Jim Jarmusch's 1999 film Ghost Dog The Way Of The Samurai. The major difference between the films is that Ghost Dog contains some of the most realistic depictions of gangsters on screen stylized realism granted not romanticized ala Francis Ford Coppola not glorified ala Martin Scorsese but real. One need not have a working knowledge of the 1960s era French Underworld to know that Le Samourai is in no way realistic. All the situations are too phony all the characters too dumb and all the action to contrived telegraphed and choreographed for that to be claimed. But as a violent ballet it is a marvelous entertainment and I have spent many a worse hour and fortyfive minutes of my existence for sure. While Melville's film does not rise to the existential and intellectual levels of the best I've seen from Clouzot it does transcend most of that offered by Hitchcock while retaining the technical grace and alacrity that the 'Master Of Suspense' developed. Melville's film thus scores somewhere in between the two and if one's work is to be so sandwiched there certainly is worse bread to be buttered. Trust me they were many of the worse hour and fortyfive minutes of my existence.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jef Costello is a contract killer a lone wolf living in Paris in 1967. He is vocally inert a modern day samurai who emulates the intensity and devotion of an old school samurai. Costello finds himself arrested for a murder that he is guilty of. He is taken to a lineup and identified by a select few who saw him leave the scene of the crime. Amazingly he gets away with it this might be the only niggling thing in the movie you feel it is impossible for a man to come so close with the law and not get charged. Alas he is a free man. The rest of the film focuses on the police trying to bring him down to crack his alibis to catch him in the act. The final scene I can not comment on without spoiling. Melville certainly delivers on his statement that he likes to leave the audience confused. However you interpret the ending is the true meaning to you. It may frustrate some but personally I think it is the most well executed ending I have seen in a long time.This film radiates that dark brooding look that only European movies portray well. The simplistic yet striking sets make streets and the most mundane objects look like works of art. The audacious use of pop culture in the form of art and artifacts adds to the overall tone of the film. The mash up of elements the sassy colors of the 60's the sophisticated noir qualities and the undercurrent of Japanese cinema makes this film so remarkable. It sounds as if it would clash violently and it does but it works. You feel very detached watching this movie free to interpret it how you want there is little dialog which I would like to see more in movies. It is so suggestive this film caters to those who do not like condescending films that spell out what is going on as if you are watching an episode of Sesame Street. This film is simply epic. One that I am going to insist upon watching monthly.Further more Criterion really know who to spoil connoisseurs of film. I recommend you invest in buying the criterion collection edition of Le Samourai. It comes with a 32 page booklet including excerpts from Melville on Melville and essays by David Thomson and filmmaker John Woo as well as 6 interview clips with various actors from the film and an interview with Jean Pierre Melville.".

The copy on the back of the DVD would have me believe that this is the COOLEST MOVIE EVER. So the backs of DVDs wax hyperbolic sometimes OK I get that. But never have my expectations for a movie been so excruciatingly disproportionate with the movie that I ended up watching.The assassin is not even that cool. Let's start there. He goofs the only assignment we ever see him do and spends the next half hour of the movie in a police station switching coats and hats with some of the other 400 suspects police have rounded up apparently this is the only crime happening in Paris entangled in all manner of bureaucratic nonsense. What kind of ultracool assassin gets entangled in such bureaucratic nonsense? What I mean to say is that the pacing inasmuch as it exists is totally wonky. I realize that this is not a traditional Hollywood movie. I realize that. And I like films like The Master or Eyes Wide Shut or The Exterminating Angel just as much as the next critic or snobbish cinephile. I liked the other flick I saw by JeanPierre Melville too Army of Shadows. That one was slow but its scenes each built to something it had something definite underneath its style. I don't mind if a movie isn't going to entertain me in the manner that I've been conditioned by Hollywood to expect but I'd like it to at least given something worth contemplating while I fail to be entertained. Le Samourai gives me nothing. It gives me a halfassed assassin some halfassed gangsters a halfassed police department and nowhere near enough style to make it all worth watching.The only way I knew that this guy was a master assassin was because the back of the DVD told me so. In the movie we get nothing to draw this conclusion from. He botches the job and gets arrested. If the movie were really so stylish it might have started by showing us the assassin doing right by a job killing a guy ice cold leaving without a trace then flubbing the next job. Instead the movie gives us right from the start the worst lamest assassin ever. And then later the most boring chase scene ever. Also the police go to bug his apartment and they put in the worst bug ever. It's not even a bug. It's more like the size of a mouse. Jesus Christ.I don't normally write reviews or comment on the internet but in this case I felt morally obligated to given how much praise I've seen lavished on this movie. Where is this praise coming from? Why why why? The movie is a waste of time. It's not a good movie and it's not a good bad movie either. It's nothing but a tedious bore.".

I'm afraid this is one of those movies that's all about mood and atmosphere and an intangible sense of cool  it certainly isn't about characters and it doesn't feature much of a story to speak of. The only interesting person in the film in my view is the police inspector but even he doesn't have much by way of character development or interior life.Mainly the film consists of Alain Delon wandering around various urban settings in his cool hat and cool trenchcoat. The pacing is purely glacial and oftentimes I really didn't care about where he was going or what he was up to. To make matters worse he's a singularly incompetent hitman who's about as subtle and stealthy as the KoolAid Man.Perhaps I'm being too harsh on this film because I don't normally like movies about criminals. It sort of offends me to be honest that so many films glamorize gangsters hitmen and other forms of gutter life. What's so intrinsically fascinating about crooks anyway? Are we all so repressed and violent that we need to get vicarious jollies by rooting for onscreen killers? And yet I do like some movies about criminals. In Get Carter the central character at least has a strong motivation and a personality to go with it. Kind Hearts and Coronets meanwhile features a killer who's quite smart and witty. Le Samourai on the other hand is about a killer with no real motivation personality smarts or wit. I can't find anything to admire about him anything to latch on to.At best this movie can be judged a cold masterpiece. But in my perhaps crass view it's a cold turkey. Some foreign films are masterpieces that put Hollywood to shame while others are just plain dull and pretentious. I think this falls into the latter camp.".

	schema:reviewBody "Alain Delon has had it. It's 1967 he's sitting on the hot seat of France's famed movie series Monsieur Cinma and he's promoting Le Samoura. We have the great pleasure of welcoming Alain Delon to our show the host says looking in his guest's direction. Alain Delon is in the spotlight because 'Le Samoura' is opening this week. But the ambiance doesn't feel like a respected Inside the Actors Studio precursor it feels more like a talk show and Delon isn't in a good mood. He's been better known for his looks than his talents for his entire career. He's proud of the work he has done in acclaimed works like Purple Noon and The Leopard but he finds himself taken less seriously than he'd like to be simply because he resembles a suave Dolce  Gabbana model. The Male Bardot they call him. But he's 32. He doesn't want to be labeled as a pretty boy who somehow gets enviable parts any longer. So instead of saying thank you to his host's polite but slightly condescending introduction he elaborates on the date of the film's opening. It's this Wednesday he smirks. Aware of his guest's snarky mood the host tries to pick himself back up. The posters are all over Paris and they're very striking. 'Le Samoura' in big black letters.Red Delon interrupts before his interviewer can even say letters. He's seen it all before the host who actually knows nothing about the film but pretends to love it the host who puts on a grin in order to appease disinterested viewers. Maybe he would have let this fly in the past but Le Samoura is far too important to him. He believes it to be a turning point in his undermined career. This isn't just some fluffy movie audiences hear about on a television program like it's Dean Martin's newest vehicle this is a work of art he puts it. A true auteur film in every aspect.He goes on to discuss the insandouts of the film with the watchful eye of an obsessed movie buff and it's unlike anything we've seen Delon do before personally or professionally. He's always been the confident kid that whisks by with a hint of danger an exotic woman by his side. This image along with the entire introduction of this review may or may not be dramatized speculation on my part but when I picture Delon I picture him as the guy from L'Eclisse fiendishly charismatic but in a tugofwar between boyhood and the idea of an adulthood in which being taken seriously is everything.JeanPierre Melville uses Delon in a way most directors would be afraid to attempt. Before Delon's charm was his selling point but in Le Samoura his allure is snatched from him. Melville takes away any ounce of precious dialogue in favor of a more nuanced approach forcing Delon to embody a particularly cryptic character mostly through body language. In the past actors in gangster films have been able to mangle the script and somehow spike their delivery to sound more menacing than usual. But Delon has to do something even harder having to exude invincibility all the while keeping an icy exterior. People turn towards scenerychewing performances when thinking about characterizations that moved them in contrast Delon has done something masterful with subtlety undoubtedly more impressive than the booming Shakespearian actors that began to creep out during the 1960s.We see Costello go through his daily rituals putting on his trench coat and fedora with strange precision keying a car to get some extra loot later pulling a job at a nightclub. Throughout the film he doesn't show the slightest smidgen of a feeling. Is he numb? In denial? Truthfully it doesn't matter. Though the storyline sees his normally smooth routine being interrupted by an investigation he doesn't seem worried about the government closing in on his every move. He is so far into a life of crime that dying for his cause doesn't seem all that bad.This is probably why the film is called Le Samoura as the samurais in all those Asian epics were more than willing to lose their lives in order to appease their reputations and their peers. Unlike Melville's earlier projects Le Samoura doesn't have the same blatant criminal romanticism. It's slick and crystalline yes but every frame carries enough tension to suggest that Dolph Lundgren might come out of the shadows and Machine Gun Kelly everyone to death. A tragic ending is a given. Silence is cherished in the film along with Delon's moodless characterization the facsimile of scenic solitude is furthered. The greyedout style Melville's intricate direction and of course Delon's performance work together with astonishing virtuosity.The only complaint I ever find myself having with Melville films is how untouchable they are. They feel miles apart from us detached so stylish that we grow to be more appreciative than adoring. But there is no denying how great a filmmaker Melville is. He's the greatest director I've had the good fortune pleasure and honor to work with up to this point Delon dryly gushes later on in the Monsieur Cinma interview. It sounds dramatic but sometimes melodrama can be true. Melville is not just a guy with a dream he's a visionary a poet of style. Read more reviews at petersonreviews.com".

	schema:reviewBody "With perhaps no other film do we see such marked lines of demarcationa veritable clash of opinion divided into opposing critical campsthan in JeanPierre Melville's 'Le Samourai'. What it really comes down to is a civil war between film aficionados who set a sharp dividing line between style and substance. From the outset I must confess I am firmly ensconced in the 'substance' camp and for me Le Samourai in the end fails precisely because it's practically all 'style' and of little 'substance'. Today we have Tarantino who like Melville is a film buff and draws upon his vast knowledge of Hollywood films of yesteryear to create his own new brand of films a creative amalgam of past and present styles. Both Melville and Tarantino have made films where they are devoted to paying tribute to past classics particularly in the gangster genre.Melville perhaps is strongest when he puts his quirky original imprint on what on the surface appears to be an ordinary gangster picture. I'm thinking about the early scene where he has his protagonist Jef Costello go through the assortment of keys one of which will start the car he has stolen or as it's pointed out in the DVD extras how Melville cleverly suggests that Jef has outdrawn the nightclub owner by immediately cutting from the owner drawing the pistol to Jef firing his gun with no footage in between the struggle at the train station shot from the odd angle gazing through the bridge grills and of course the excellent closing scene so nicely choreographed with Melville detailing how his hero accomplishes his preplanned 'suicide by cop'.While I'm perfectly willing to concede Melville has his stylistic 'moments' I part company with the style camp on a number of fronts. While the 'stylistas' argue that the languid pacing of the movie adds to the overall impact of the narrative I would argue the opposite. Why must we sit through minutes of the static opening shot of Jef's apartment? Why do 12 minutes go by before anything of any import actually happens Jef stealing the car? Why all the mundane shots of Jef walking through the streets and driving his car? Having his license plates switched twice!? An enormously long scene of police interrogations and lineup? An unnecessarily long scene of inept cops planting a bug in Jef's apartment? It goes on and on. Perhaps with some judicious editing Le Samourai could have moved quicker and hence not put some of us to sleep.Le Samourai fails on a much deeper level in that its characters lack depth. Deleon's 'Jef' is perhaps the best example of this lack of character development. His grim countenance becomes tedious throughout the film and we really find out next to nothing about him. I'm not surprised that Madonna wrote a song about Deleon 'Beautiful Killer' and his performance undoubtedly many women were attracted to Deleon's 'pretty boy' looks please look at pictures of him nowtime has not been kind to once heralded media darling. Jef's death does conform to the Hollywood code to atone for their sins a person who has committed evil acts must sacrifice himself before the audience can look at him in a good light.The 'Le Samourai' has little to recommend in terms of plot. It's a simple story about a contract killer who murders a man with no back story. The men who are behind the murder are also complete ciphers. Only the chief detective played by noted stage actor Franois Prier proves to have a role of some substance as he actually comes off as a real police detective. I also liked the late Cathy Rosier the pianist who brings grace to a limited part. At a certain point near the end of the story Jef allows the man who initially attempted to kill him off the hook after accepting payment of another large amount of money for another contract killing. Why didn't Jef a contract killer kill this man? Again an improbable code of honor posited by Mr. Melville. Of course if Jef is a somnambulist as one internet poster has suggested and the whole story is a fantastic dream then how can anybody have the audacity to question the character's verisimilitude? For those hypnotized by the film's style it is certain that you will never convince them otherwise that 'Le Samourai' is a certified masterpiece.".

The pace is slow the frustratingly enigmatic plot raises more questions than it answers for starters why does the hitman allow himself to be arrested and put in a police lineup after he's performed a very public shooting in the nightclub?.  The title is just typical French neonoir pretentiousness. The quotation from the Bushido is fictional and the attempt to forge a connection between a gangland hitman and a Japanese samourai is tenuous at best.  I rewound this tape and watched certain key scenes again just to see if I could make any more sense of the at times nonsensical story I couldn't.  Many scenes seem to be mindless padding e.g. the police take up 5 minutes of running time just bugging the killer's room with an absurdly conspicuous listening device that seems to be designed to be found in about two minutes.  Allinall borrrring!".

I rewound this tape and watched certain key scenes again just to see if I could make any more sense of the at times nonsensical story I couldn't.  Many scenes seem to be mindless padding e.g. the police take up 5 minutes of running time just bugging the killer's room with an absurdly conspicuous listening device that seems to be designed to be found in about two minutes.  Allinall borrrring!";

	schema:reviewBody "Le Samourai is directed by JeanPierre Melville and stars Alain Delon as Jef Costello an assassin working for criminal elements in Paris France. Jef is a lone wolf and a perfectionist calm and cool in any situation. As the title suggests Costello places unsaid faith into Bushido which advocates selfcontrol and mastery honour and obedience.The film itself revolves around Costello's lonely existence. He spends most of his time alone with a small bird in a rundown and empty apartment as he waits for his next assignment. When it arrives he meticulously and ruthlessly pulls off the job trying to remain hidden and anonymous while carrying out his task.The plot of the film develops when Costello bumps into a young singer at a club directly after he pulls off a job. Things begin to unravel for him as the police tighten their net his employers become suspicious and his meticulous plans start to fray. Costello himself seems to develop as the plot does. His warriors mask begins to crack and he shows more strain more fear and panic albeit very subtly.Le Samourai is quite masterful. Carefully and meticulously shot itself the film has little in the way of downsides. The plot is brooding and atmospheric as Costello navigates the streets and metros of Paris to evade his pursuers. The score is haunting and appropriate. The acting is superb. The plot is deep and defined. Le Samourai was a blast. It is a neonoir film of the highest order and well encompasses filmnoir aspects from Frances cinematic history. It is an excellent film to watch and I can't wait to watch it again.".

It is not as though it didn't give me any clues along the way like the opening sequence which is just him lying on a bed smoking a cigarette for about 10 minutes interspersed with a caged bird twittering. Anonymous people with minimal dialogue he interacts with and they remain anonymous. Twice he visits a lock up garage with a car he has stolen  drives straight in  has the number plates changed and is given paperwork before driving straight out again without any acknowledgement or words exchanged. It brings to mind a Scottish television reporter of my youth called Fyfe Robertson who was called upon to do a review on 60's culture and he came up with this succinct explanation.

Quite how they got this impression is beyond me as having sat through 105 minutes of utter tedium I can honestly say this is one of the most boring films I've ever seen. Come to think of it maybe that's why it's so celebrated high brow movie critics seem to worship anything that moves painfully slowly and would be dismissed by the rest of us as little more than a cure for insomnia.The story what little of it there is follows Alain Delon's hitman Jeff Costello over the course of two days as he carries out a successful hit on a club owner only to be arrested by the police force afterwards. Thanks to the unreliable witnesses however they cannot convict him so set him loose with the intention of trailing his every move. The mob panics and decide to remove Jeff in the most final way you can imagine rather than pay him backing the man into a corner and setting him on a collision course with both the authorities and his former employers.If this sounds familiar then it's not surprising as it was a significant influence on John Woo's seminal movie The Killer. But where the Hong Kong film was a balls out action melodrama that moved with the frantic pace of a Gazelle with an adrenaline implant Le Samourai moves slowly. Painfully slowly. There are lots of shots of characters doing mundane activities for what feels like an eternity plenty of scenes where the lead simply walks up and down streets along with lots of lingering close ups of Delon's expressionless face.To make matters worse there is zero characterisation whatsoever. Delon has one facial expression for the whole movie. He never indicates any sign of emotion and rarely speaks and come the end of the movie hasn't developed one iota since we first saw him. Everybody else moves about with blank expressions and where there should be feeling and connection there is just a void. The police pursuit of Jeff seems not so much halfassed as quarterassed and when people stare down the barrels of guns they do so with nothing more than a ho hum look about them.You can prattle on about psychology paeans to loneliness ethics and existentialism all you like. This is a boring movie filled with blank spaces where there should be characters and saddled with a pace that moves slower than a Tortoise with some very heavy shopping. And as for it being 'cool?' Forget about it. Unless you wear a beret I'd avoid it at all costs.".

For one thing there is Armand Assante and what most likely is the role of his career even if its a supporting one and he gets only a couple scene stealers. He demonstrates how great he can be if given the right part. And his role is very interesting an archcriminal with feelings brought out by a woman who may not even love him.Jenny Lumet was also good in her role although I missed more interaction between her and Assante's character. Timothy Hutton although overshadowed by Nolte and Assante in turns inevitable really proves again that he is a solid actor.His performance is not spectacularas the role doesn't allow it but its worthwhile. Another great presence by Patrick O'Neal as the sly and cunning district attorney with a criminal past and ties to Bobby TexadorAssante.Sidney Lumet is the master of sociopolitical dramacomedythriller.

	schema:headline " New York Confidential";
	schema:reviewBody "Guess the film from the following description of its characters. A young man investigating misdeeds in the police force motivated by the memory of his father a legendary policeman but also by the pain of having lost the affections of a woman he loves to another player in the drama. A renegade cop rampaging violently through the city but revered on the force for standing up to the scum on the streets. And the renegade's boss who protects him partly because he himself is on oldschool Irish policeman but partly because he appreciates having his own private bagman especially in his dealings with organised crime. Throw in some prostitutes for a little background colour and it sounds like a perfect description of 'L.A. Confidential'. But it also describes this tough and underrated movie made by Sidney Lumet some years before Curtis Hanson's film.Whereas Hanson's film was stylised and glamorised violence provided the cause was just Lumet has gone for a more realist approach and his bad cop played mesmerisingly by Nick Nolte is completely rotten in fact resembling Harvey Kietel's 'Bad Liutennant' in Abel Fererra's movie. The film is dated by its ghastly electronic soundtrack and more interestingly by its portrait of New York at a time when the city was at its lowest ebb. But it's a very well assembled thriller exploring issues of race mixed loyalties and the meaning of good policing without flinching from a grim picture of life on the margins of law abiding society. Lumet has had a long career but this is one of his better films and ultimately more truthful than Hanson's stylish charade. Each are good in their own way why is only one so appreciated?".

	onyx:emotionText "Guess the film from the following description of its characters. A young man investigating misdeeds in the police force motivated by the memory of his father a legendary policeman but also by the pain of having lost the affections of a woman he loves to another player in the drama. A renegade cop rampaging violently through the city but revered on the force for standing up to the scum on the streets. And the renegade's boss who protects him partly because he himself is on oldschool Irish policeman but partly because he appreciates having his own private bagman especially in his dealings with organised crime. Throw in some prostitutes for a little background colour and it sounds like a perfect description of 'L.A. Confidential'. But it also describes this tough and underrated movie made by Sidney Lumet some years before Curtis Hanson's film.Whereas Hanson's film was stylised and glamorised violence provided the cause was just Lumet has gone for a more realist approach and his bad cop played mesmerisingly by Nick Nolte is completely rotten in fact resembling Harvey Kietel's 'Bad Liutennant' in Abel Fererra's movie. The film is dated by its ghastly electronic soundtrack and more interestingly by its portrait of New York at a time when the city was at its lowest ebb. But it's a very well assembled thriller exploring issues of race mixed loyalties and the meaning of good policing without flinching from a grim picture of life on the margins of law abiding society. Lumet has had a long career but this is one of his better films and ultimately more truthful than Hanson's stylish charade. Each are good in their own way why is only one so appreciated?";

	schema:headline " In Defense of Jenny Lumet";
	schema:reviewBody "Many reviews here have trashed Jenny Lumet's acting in this film and I want to go on record saying that I thought she gave an above average performance. I know she's the director's daughter but I think she more than holds her own opposite the likes of Timothy Hutton and Armand Assante she doesn't have any scenes with Nolte.Lumet plays a girlfriend from Reilly's Hutton past.  Reilly dated her when he was a beat cop and has since risen to Assistant DA.  When the film begins it has been 6 years since their breakup and she strolls into a tense interview session on the arm of notorious drug czar Bobby Texador Armand Assante.  Obviously shaken by her involvement in the case Reilly attempts to talk with her about their past.  I think Lumet is quite convincing in her scenes with Hutton wrenched emotionally as she kicks him out of her mother's apartment and touching as she discusses their failed relationship. She's no Meryl Streep but she effectively conveys the anguish of a young woman forced to revisit her painful past.Nolte is incredibly powerful as rogue cop Mike Brennan a brooding unstoppable evil force unlike any other character Nolte has played.  His Mike Brennan is a distant cousin to Denzel Washington's Oscarwinning performance in Training Day.  Assante is nearly perfect as the menacingyetphilosophical drug lord Bobby Texador.  One of my favorite aspects of this script is the multifaceted nature of Assante's character. Audiences aren't usually asked to identify with drug dealers but Lumet's script and Assante's performance make Texador into more than just a one note crook.  Both he and Nolte were Oscarworthy yet neither was even nominated Jeremy Irons and Joe Pesci took home the male acting Oscars in 1990.My only criticism of the film is the way racial and ethnic stereotypes are forced into almost every scene the harddrinking Irish cop the Italian mobsters the shyster Jewish lawyer the streetbrawling Puerto Rican gang members.  Maybe Lumet had a point to make by concentrating so obsessively on his characters' ethnic origins but it seems like overkill.  Despite this flaw QA is still an absorbing and powerful film.".

	schema:reviewBody "QA is ostensibly about an investigation into an incident during which a small time drug dealer was shot and killed outside a nightclub by a street cop. In fact though the movie's about something far more profound as it portrays New York City and its justice system as being inherently racist on every level and also asserts that the type of justice dispensed is determined predominantly by the ethnicity and corrupt interests of the people involved on both sides of the line.Homicide Bureau Chief Kevin Quinn Patrick O'Neal appoints Assistant D.A. Al Reilly Timothy Hutton to head up an investigation into the shooting of a Puerto Rican by NYPD detective Lieutenant Mike Brennan Nick Nolte. Quinn makes it clear that Reilly only needs to collect some witness statements and then present them to the Grand Jury because in his opinion the case is so straightforward that it doesn't merit any greater attention especially as he regards Brennan as an excellent cop who gets results. Things get complicated and dangerous however when Reilly and his fellow investigators start to unearth evidence of corruption and suspect that Brennan may not be blameless for what happened.Reilly is young inexperienced and eager to do well in his career but nevertheless despite the steer he was given by Quinn feels duty bound to pursue his inquiries thoroughly to discover what actually happened on the night of the shooting. It's soon revealed that the drug dealer was working for a major operator called Bobby Trexador Armand Assante who has Mafia connections and Reilly is surprised to find that the girl who was the love of his life is now involved in a relationship with Texador.Reilly meets Nancy Bosch Jenny Lumet on her own and wants to get back with her but it emerges that they had separated after Nancy had seen the expression on Reilly's face when he discovered that her father was black and despite every explanation he'd given her since Nancy had been haunted by the experience and couldn't consider a reconciliation under any circumstance.The investigation doesn't go in the way that Quinn had ordered but also ends unsatisfactorily from Reilly's point of view. The experience brings the young investigator into contact with a whole range of people from a variety of different ethnic groups and also culminates in him becoming considerably less naive than he was at the start of the process.Nick Nolte's portrayal of Brennan who is corrupt bigoted and extremely threatening is incredibly powerful as he looks physically imposing and capable of extreme brutality. Brennan is coarse and very dangerous because he operates by his own rules and is especially adept at covering up his wrongdoings. In situations where his superiors become suspicious of his methods they quickly decide not to take any action because in a city where the threat of crime getting out of control is always present his methods at least provide good results.Patrick O'Neal is perfect as the autocratic smooth and calculating Quinn who doesn't intend to let principles or regulations get in the way of his political ambitions and Assante is impressive as Trexador who's a very nonstereotypical crime boss. Timothy Hutton also does well in conveying the idealism and gullibility of a young man who like Quinn and Brennan is an Irish American.QA is extremely thought provoking as it provides an uncompromising depiction of a situation in which any efforts to control crime and corruption especially by orthodox methods are inevitably hampered by the deleterious effects of rampant racism. This problem is portrayed as being intractable with no potential solutions being readily available.".

The plot is a little convoluted and the movie could have perhaps used a little better screen writing but the great performances by the magnificent cast more than makes this movie work.What I really think the movie does best is capture NYC as it was then. The dark side the corruption of the political judicial and law enforcement divisions. The notso subtle racial divisiveness. It's all amazingly real and being a born and bred New Yorkerit was scary to watch yet all too believable. I loved that all the characters in this movie are flawed and human. There is no real right or wrong in this movie  just shades of gray. This has been done many times in movies before and is nothing new particularly with Sidney Lumet films but I can't think of a movie that has done it better.I saw one user post a criticism for the last five minutes I can't think of a better ending for this movie. Spoiler alert. When Bloomey tells Francis Reilly that it's all over and they're going to do nothing about his investigation but file it away and gives him the hard knock explanations as to why and how the world really works. I was just as floored by this scene the first time I watched it as Francis Reilly is in the movie. I just love this ending. The short epilogue with Jenny Lumet's character is OK and serves to sort of tie up a last loose end in the film.By the way to that other commentator about the cheesy Rueben Blades theme song. Don't double cross the ones you love. Your not the only one who can't get that cheesy song out of your head whenever you watch this movie.Perhaps Blades should pursue a career as a jingle songwriter instead he seems to have a lot of potential talent for it.".

	schema:reviewBody "The last and least of Sidney Lumet's three stories of more or less innocents trying to uncover police corruption and blow the whistle on the guilty and the only fictional story. There's nothing wrong with the acting of the principals. Nolte is brutish and tall in an overthetop performance. He always looks larger on screen than in person. His New York accent however is clearly superimposed on an unregional Omaha set of phonemes. Jenny Lumet looks splendid but has the same problem with her accent and her scenes are too long as part of a mixedup romantic subplot that doesn't hold together well. Timothy Hutton has less of a notable problem with his speech and he is really quite good as the innocentlooking but by no means weak investigating attorney. He even looks pretty Irish. O'Neal is the smoothly villainous and murderous head of the investigation and a very good villain he is as usual. Guzman and Dutton provide excellent supporting roles. And Armand Assante seems built for the part of the ironeating PR drug dealer who has made the decision a thoroughly rational one to get out and live in the Caribbean sunshine. His body movements provide a language unto themselves his smallest gestures are magnetic. They draw so much attention to themselves that they are almost the selfparody that they were in his hilarious spoof of detective movies. He's an exceptional actor. The movie's plot however leaves a good deal to be desired. Its fictional skeleton shows through. You've never seen so much ethnicity on the screen before and it's misplaced. It's easy enough to believe that racial insults are offhandedly traded among ingroup members but difficult to believe that every conversational exchange no matter how casual or intense must include one. And at the very time when some of these barriers are beginning to weaken judging from the rising rates of intermarriage. Serpico's story was relatively simple. Prince of the City far more complex and realistically tragic. This one is simply hard to follow as well as hard to believe. Boats turn into fireballs in unlikely ways as they do in quickie action movies. Characters fly back and forth from San Juan to New York and some are killed and it's difficult to keep track of what's what and who's who. It isn't that Lumet has lost his touch.When a character is shot in the neck man does he bleed out. But the director is working with less compelling material here and in any case this kind of narrative is running out of steam. All of that notwithstanding this is still a notch above most of the junk polluting the multiplex screens today.".

	schema:reviewBody "I liked this film a lot. It had some uneven moments in it mostly Sidney Lumet's daughter's attempt at acting. However Nolte and Assante are GREAT! This is gritty and realistic movie making. One sympathizes with the somewhat idealistic assistant district attorney Timothy Hutton as he tries to do the right thing with so many thing in his way. The language of the movie is raw with many memorable quotes. However after viewing the movie you will find yourself remembering the roles of Nolte Frank Brennan and Armand Assante Bobby Texador. Nolte is a cross between John Wayne and Ted Bundy. He is the first cop through the door and the first to pull out his weapon. He gets the job done but he also breaks the law whenever he sees fit. Hutton like many admire Nolte but the more they find out about the guy the more they see that he might be the real threat to society. Bobby Tex is the very charismatic drug dealer that honestly wants to get out of the business alive. It is rare that the character that you root for the most is a drug dealer but this movie maybe the one exception. He is better than the murdering cop.

	onyx:emotionText "I liked this film a lot. It had some uneven moments in it mostly Sidney Lumet's daughter's attempt at acting. However Nolte and Assante are GREAT! This is gritty and realistic movie making. One sympathizes with the somewhat idealistic assistant district attorney Timothy Hutton as he tries to do the right thing with so many thing in his way. The language of the movie is raw with many memorable quotes. However after viewing the movie you will find yourself remembering the roles of Nolte Frank Brennan and Armand Assante Bobby Texador. Nolte is a cross between John Wayne and Ted Bundy. He is the first cop through the door and the first to pull out his weapon. He gets the job done but he also breaks the law whenever he sees fit. Hutton like many admire Nolte but the more they find out about the guy the more they see that he might be the real threat to society. Bobby Tex is the very charismatic drug dealer that honestly wants to get out of the business alive. It is rare that the character that you root for the most is a drug dealer but this movie maybe the one exception. He is better than the murdering cop. Hutton plays the straight guy in between these two forces of nature. Hutton has personal demons and real demons standing in way of doing the right thing. Good solid story that you will enjoy. No Hollywood ending here. This movie is RAW!";

	schema:headline " Engaging and interesting with dynamite performances and a great script.";
	schema:reviewBody "The one thing Q  A has going for it the entire time is in the form of its atmosphere it's utterly utterly effective atmosphere that is very much present due to one thing we know exactly what the character of Brennan Nolte has done but Reilly Hutton who is supposed to find out exactly what the situation is doesn't. This is an interesting idea and a bit of a spin to put on the pretty bogstandard situation of your standard 1980s to early 1990s internal affairs cop thriller. What works is that we the audience have a position of power that the characters in the film do not thus the hero Reilly has to work things out but we don't however we will be with him all the way to see if he is able to crack it. Alternatively what the audience do know is exactly what Brennan knows which perhaps lures the audience into false identification.I think director Lumet who is certainly well accomplished most definitely by the time this was made wanted to make a bit of a noir out of this idea. He shoots the film in such a way that has the hero go on his own personal quest of discovery even if that discovery is one he might not even want to discover given the truth behind it Lumet also injects several different types of characters into the story the hard bodied cop in Brennan who is harder than the hero himself an interesting spin on things a South American drug baron and his bodyguards an old flame who is somehow connected to the baron a homosexual singerperformer and some allies to the upstanding hero two of whom are 'Chappie' Chapman Dutton and Luis Valentin Guzmn. Q  A works as a noircomeinternal affairs crime story because it combines things we're familiar with but injects them with arguably an auteur's own personal approach. Reilly as a hero seems venerable but smart given his history with the female character now connected with the drug baron and the script consistently pumps out quality oneliners the majority of which are spouted by Brennan.Adding to the noir pointers it rains a lot in the film but it's significant as to when it rains. Reilly's reunification in the car with his old flame happens after the baron has threatened him to stay away from her thus creating tension he has done something he shouldn't have after someone of a superior rank has told him not to. But the meeting in the car although very well placed given the inclusion of the rain allows us to see deeper into the past of said couple's relationship. It turns out the flame mistook or perhaps she didn't a look Reilly gave her father upon seeing he was black something that obviously points to bigotry. But then again the film is racist without ever really demeaning any race religion or ethnic group. Certainly the level of racism in the dialogue is rather high but when one of Reilly's friend's is in the bar telling him how much of a 'great man' the chief of homicide is the element of hate is built up through the script and our opinions of a character alternate without him even being on screen. It's also worth saying that when you have a film which contains a character both black and homosexual one of which is also physically weak the majority of people will have a field day going up in arms over it but I felt the film steered away from any sort of stereotyping and thus does its best to create a realistic character without any aim to offend. It's worth saying here that director Lumet directed 12 Angry Men a film that was all about fighting for what's right whether black SpanishAmerican or whatever.So Q  A is a courtroom drama set outside the court a noir that it in colour and made in the 1990s your not so average everyday cop thriller from the 1980s90s and your entertaining compelling detective novel stretched across 130 minutes complete with colourful characters hate love regret and humorous oneliners and insults. Brennon is perhaps the star but given the audience know exactly what he knows throughout several of the scenes it's almost as if he's the star. Yes he's mean and spiteful yes he intimidates and goes below the belt but if anything I read people saying 'watch it for Nolte'. Good call he's almost the hero given what we know and Reilly doesn't but that's the apparent genius of Q  A you have your detective cordon your love cordon and your hard bodied bully cordon. I could recommend Q  A for a number of things including a rewatch just to clarify a few things but do not let a complicated plot at all put you off seeing it.".

They are passing through the lobby being tailed by Nolte and you can see a tree being held by pieces of wood. They saved a very old tree from garden of the lobby. To anyone that questions movies about being fake and unbelievable let me tell you every scene that is shot in Puerto Rico is accurate even to the locations where the characters move and live. The Caribe Hilton is ten minutes from the Cangrejos Yacht Club where Roger the Dodger Bobby Tex and one of the cuban hit men are blown up. I got to say I learned a lot when I saw this movie. Imagine a movie about a Chinese guy a Brazilian and an American. And the American is played by a British south African or an irish actor. You feel a little weird and question Why not hire an American actor to play an American right? Well all that went out the window when I saw Assante play the Puertorican drug lord. I couldn't believe my eyes or my ears. Assante IS one of us in that role. Everything was authentic in that performance. Also Luis Guzman surprised me in this film with his bravura acting confronting Assante in the interrogation scene. I met him in 1993 at the premiere of the movie Carlitos Way which is another movie based on the novels by the Puertorrican Judge and author Edwin Torres. It was a film festival and Guzman and Torres talked a little bit in a podium. Later I spoke with the judge and he was great. I talked to him about QA and how I enjoyed his work. Finally I went to Guzman and he behaved like a little ass. Maybe he was in a bad mood or something. I shook his hand and he never spoke and kept looking at the horizon or something behind you. Maybe he thought I was gonna scream and jump on his back yelling Hollywood. I don't know I still like him and there are few of us out there working with the best to be fighting each other. Back in 1990 i believed there were gonna be a least two nominations in this movie one for Assante and one for Nolte. Nolte continues to do great things but I get mad when I see Assante working in crap. It is such a shame that nobody uses him for something good. Tarantino should call him. And yes that song is by Ruben Blades and I cant get it out of my head. Dont double cross the ones you love HAHAHA. It is so cheesy and yet I cant help it but sing it every time I see the film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sidney Lumet does what he does best. Tell a story about law and order in New York and look into police corruption.Timothy Hutton plays Reilly a young former cop turned assistant district attorney asked by the police commissioner Patrick O'Neal to look into the shooting of a Puerto Rican criminal by detective Brennan Nick Nolte who claims it was self defence. The commissioner tells him that its an open and shut case and also tells him that if its not in the QA then it did not happen.However Hutton is determined and finds flaws in Brennan's story and the case leads him to a charismatic Puerto Rican crime boss called Bobby Tex Armand Assante whose wife was once Hutton's girlfriend until he discovered she was mixed race.It looks like Brennan is an out of control cop who is trying to get rid of some select criminals on behalf of someone at the top. The commissioner turns out to be a hypocrite as he later tells Hutton that he is taking the QA too seriously.Nolte gives a larger than live performance as the foul mouthed racist homophobic brutish cop who is a legend in the department. The first one through the door and is willing to break the law if necessary. His fellow cops know better to cross him and have to put up with his jibes. However he does not run away with the acting stakes as he is matched by Assante and Hutton.Assante gives a scene stealing performance as the drug dealer who just wants to get out of the business alive. He knows Brennan is dangerous and frankly he knows too much hence why he wants out. This was an era when Assante looked to have broken through and had a good run of films in the early 1990s.Timothy Hutton could had been a brat packer in the early 1980s. He was a contemporary of Tom Cruise Sean Penn but separated from them early on for the simple reason by 1981 he was a best supporting actor Oscar winner. Since then Hutton decided to work with acclaimed directors or make interesting even offbeat films. The result is he might not be as well known today to cinema audiences but he has had a varied filmography.Here Hutton plays the earnest ADA who is out to cross swords with Brennan but he himself is flawed. His father was a cop and might had been on the take. His treatment of his former girlfriend suggests he might also be a racist himself.This is a moderately budget moody noir thriller. Ruben Blades matches the mood with his soundtrack. Director Sidney Lumet was in the twilight of his career and this was maybe his last great film. Of course he was probably jaded with the criminal justice system by then and you always sense the film has a cynical and depressed air about it. That the system is rotten to the core and cannot be fixed.Lumet gets his actors to pull out top performances and even some of the minor characters make their mark.".

The commissioner turns out to be a hypocrite as he later tells Hutton that he is taking the QA too seriously.Nolte gives a larger than live performance as the foul mouthed racist homophobic brutish cop who is a legend in the department. The first one through the door and is willing to break the law if necessary. His fellow cops know better to cross him and have to put up with his jibes. However he does not run away with the acting stakes as he is matched by Assante and Hutton.Assante gives a scene stealing performance as the drug dealer who just wants to get out of the business alive. He knows Brennan is dangerous and frankly he knows too much hence why he wants out. This was an era when Assante looked to have broken through and had a good run of films in the early 1990s.Timothy Hutton could had been a brat packer in the early 1980s. He was a contemporary of Tom Cruise Sean Penn but separated from them early on for the simple reason by 1981 he was a best supporting actor Oscar winner. Since then Hutton decided to work with acclaimed directors or make interesting even offbeat films. The result is he might not be as well known today to cinema audiences but he has had a varied filmography.Here Hutton plays the earnest ADA who is out to cross swords with Brennan but he himself is flawed. His father was a cop and might had been on the take. His treatment of his former girlfriend suggests he might also be a racist himself.This is a moderately budget moody noir thriller. Ruben Blades matches the mood with his soundtrack. Director Sidney Lumet was in the twilight of his career and this was maybe his last great film. Of course he was probably jaded with the criminal justice system by then and you always sense the film has a cynical and depressed air about it. That the system is rotten to the core and cannot be fixed.Lumet gets his actors to pull out top performances and even some of the minor characters make their mark.";

	schema:reviewBody "Q  A is one of the most enigmatic films I've seen. It veers drastically between exceptionally good and oddly clunky and sometimes threatens to be pretty poor  and not necessarily in that order. It follows an investigation into a shooting by Michael Brennan an experienced and ferociously tough police officer played magnificently by Nick Nolte in his pomp. The investigation is conducted by Timothy Hutton who is a true revelation to me at least as an almost equally tough but mostly nonviolent lawyer. The situation is muddied by a shady drugrunner Armand Assante and a manipulative senior officer Patrick O'Neal.The introduction to Nolte's character is fabulous scenesetting as he holds court with fellow officers regarding some previous roughhousing of a suspect. The Brennan profile is deep and somewhat mysterious  we like him we hate him we are disgusted by him.and we want to see more of him. Speaking of which the film could have benefited from more interplay between Nolte and Hutton. Hutton's brilliantly understated resilience to the aggression of Nolte and Assante is a surprise and adds a true edginess to the film. Unfortunately the same can't be said of the very clunky love interest Hutton has with Assante's mistress  we discover they are former lovers who split up over some fairly tenuous business about her father being black. The continued revisiting of this strained relationship is weak and uses time that one feels could be better served building the Brennan character or at least promoting the NolteHutton feud.Other questionable points in the film concern the various plot turns that are almost casually thrown in and whilst we don't lose track of proceedings one feels we could have been given a better idea of how the characters arrive in certain situations. In short by occasionally rushing things Q  A often has you wondering if it's a bad film.But there are some moments that are truly great  various scenes with Nolte and a short office tantrum by Hutton towards the end. You certainly feel that if this film featured more high profile actors it would be considered much more significant than it is currently. I would recommend Q  A to anyone simply for the performances of Nolte and Hutton  and obviously to fans of gritty cop dramas who will love it anyway.".

Bobby Tex's beautiful Puerto Rican's wife was once dating Hutton's character where old history is rekindled. Hutton in one parked car scene with her I'll always remember explains about how his white breed parents weren't understanding and accepting of her. It's great to have a scene like this unrelated to the plot as it makes for a tender moment away from the inanity of Nolte's out of control actions. Hutton's past involvement with her too puts the wind up Assante a much earlier scene near the start of the film Hutton sets him straight on a threat he makes by use of Assante's own pen. Paul Caulderon too is great as a transvestite and Assante's bitch. Like State Of Grace Q and A is just one of those just over two hour films that's just exciting from start to finish with the right energy. It too has quite an ugly twist involving betrayal that slaps you in the face with a wet fish or stings you bad. Nolte and Assante must be commended on their top floor performance and any fan of either of these actors this is a must see but the movie is a must see regardless of that fact. Hutton is good but has nothing on the other two. How can a director who made so many good entertaining movies in constant leave us. But remember this his gift he left was the movies he made.

	schema:reviewBody "Lieutenant Michael Brennan has a tough reputation as an oldstyle cop that breaks balls but gets the job done. However had someone seen Brennan hiding in a dark alley outside a club until his suspect came out for a p1ss only for Brennan to shoot him dead and plant a gun that had been used in other murders then that reputation may not do him much good. On this occasion Assistant DA Al Francis is brought in to do the investigation  one that is sold to him as a formality to get him started. The Q  A's go well but Francis is given enough to doubt that the shooting was as clean as Brennan tells it  however Brennan is not the type you easily square up to and soon the stakes are high.Opening with a sudden moment of violence this film leaves you in no doubt that Brennan is not a rough cop so much as a cop operating above the law on his own agenda. Like The Shield has done recently this drama puts us in the complex world of the grey areas and invites us to consider the pay off between doing things by the book or taking hard action and getting results. It doesn't do this to a great extent though  just enough to be add layers to the character but clearly corrupt enough to be the evil heart of the story. The narrative builds a dark drama involving the police investigation into Brennan on one side with the criminal awareness of Brennan's murders on the other. It isn't really a character piece about Brennan so much as it is a straight crime drama but it works very well for what it is. I have no idea why it is so underrated on IMDb because it is an effective thriller with an enjoyably tough edge to it from start to nearfinish. I say nearfinish because the film concludes by tying up the story with Francis' relationships and soul  neither of which are that well done across the film and thus I didn't care as much as I should have done.Lumet's direction is good and captures the depressing feel of New York at its lowest point. However the choice of music has two detrimental effects. Firstly it dates the film really badly which is maybe a problem that can be forgiven as part of time going by. The second impact is less forgivable and must have been a problem at the time and this is how the music fits with the drama. For example several key scenes are played out under the chirpy tune Don't DoubleCross the Ones you Love it is as grating and clunky as it sounds and it is a stupid effect that happens several times with the same result.The cast are mostly very good though. Nolte chews the scenery and steals every scene with a character so monstrous that even his absurd handlebar moustache cannot take away from it. Hutton is good enough to do the job but sadly his character isn't as convincing as it needed to be the script tries to make him more interesting than a choir boy but it doesn't do it very well. Assante is a little OTT at times but he works well in his character and fills the gap left by Nolte's absence. Minor support is good and features a cast that got starry with time  Guzmn Dutton Chianese Finkel and others. Lumet tries hard but her part of the narrative is weak and thus her task is a rather thankless one.Despite the problems though this is still a solid and dark cop drama that holds the interest well. Some of the performances may verge on ham the music may be mostly awful and some elements of the narrative fall flat but for what it does well it is certainly worth a look.".

Like The Shield has done recently this drama puts us in the complex world of the grey areas and invites us to consider the pay off between doing things by the book or taking hard action and getting results. It doesn't do this to a great extent though  just enough to be add layers to the character but clearly corrupt enough to be the evil heart of the story. The narrative builds a dark drama involving the police investigation into Brennan on one side with the criminal awareness of Brennan's murders on the other. It isn't really a character piece about Brennan so much as it is a straight crime drama but it works very well for what it is. I have no idea why it is so underrated on IMDb because it is an effective thriller with an enjoyably tough edge to it from start to nearfinish. I say nearfinish because the film concludes by tying up the story with Francis' relationships and soul  neither of which are that well done across the film and thus I didn't care as much as I should have done.Lumet's direction is good and captures the depressing feel of New York at its lowest point. However the choice of music has two detrimental effects. Firstly it dates the film really badly which is maybe a problem that can be forgiven as part of time going by. The second impact is less forgivable and must have been a problem at the time and this is how the music fits with the drama. For example several key scenes are played out under the chirpy tune Don't DoubleCross the Ones you Love it is as grating and clunky as it sounds and it is a stupid effect that happens several times with the same result.The cast are mostly very good though. Nolte chews the scenery and steals every scene with a character so monstrous that even his absurd handlebar moustache cannot take away from it. Hutton is good enough to do the job but sadly his character isn't as convincing as it needed to be the script tries to make him more interesting than a choir boy but it doesn't do it very well. Assante is a little OTT at times but he works well in his character and fills the gap left by Nolte's absence. Minor support is good and features a cast that got starry with time  Guzmn Dutton Chianese Finkel and others. Lumet tries hard but her part of the narrative is weak and thus her task is a rather thankless one.Despite the problems though this is still a solid and dark cop drama that holds the interest well. Some of the performances may verge on ham the music may be mostly awful and some elements of the narrative fall flat but for what it does well it is certainly worth a look.";

But the romance is doomed when the nobility rises up with Isabella to end the affair. Director Derek Jarman's adaptation is one of those rare films that succeeds set in a time other than in its original setting. He moves the setting and action of the movie to the modern era and this serves as a more timely backdrop for the movie's progay stance which seems to me to be its central theme. I really liked Steven Waddington who was very very good.

His lack of historical settings and staging the film among the bare walls as well as including many anachronisms such as modern clothes and cigarette smoking gave the old story timeless feel.

The sets are mostly pueblostyle interiors giving the impression that this is a middleclass household not the palace of a king. There are no extras and the scenes are bare of people again reinforcing the idea that this is a private rather than a public story.  The nobles are treated as tourists who are out of place in the life of the king.  Our attention is focussed constantly on the intimate relations between individuals Edward and Gaveston Edward and Isobel Isobel and Mortimer.Edward whose whole life was dominated by his obsessive love for Gaveston just count how many times he says my Gaveston in the play saw his world in just this way everything anyone did was measured against how it affected his romance and everything he did was to further it.  When Isobel abandons him she loses her humanity and becomes in his eyes a grotesque vampire. Indeed one wonders how much of what we see as reality in the film is Edward's fantasies and imaginings as he becomes increasingly deranged.An intriguing approach perhaps but the problem is that Edward's onetrack mind makes for a onetrack monochromatic presentation and quite frankly it becomes so superficial as to be tedious after a bit.  Without the depth provided by an objective viewpoint we lose interest.Scenes of unnamed naked men making love or playing rugby without a ball must have been put in for the titillation of gay viewers.  They added nothing to the story.  On the other hand  the love between Edward and Gaveston was sincerely and persuasively played and a good thing too because that's about all you get here.Waddington's performance is splendid and gives a lot of life to what might otherwise have been a total yawn it's worth the trouble of watching this just to see him.  Tilda Swinton's performance is overrated she delivers her best monologue as slowly and tonelessly as possible and it doesn't take long to start wondering when she's going to show some emotion.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've watched this movie at least half a dozen times while adapting and directing my own stage version of this brilliant but somewhat longwinded and unfocused Marlowe play. That said and my bias revealed I have to admit that I don't care much for this film though I do admit it has some strengths namely the visual elements which reflect the director's background as a painter he knows how to frame and arrange a shot and he picks beautiful lines and colors to illustrate his story. Tilda Swenton's performance is amazing has she ever been bad? and provides the emotional thrust of the movie we believe she wants Edward so badly that she's willing to kill him so no one else will have him. Unfortuneately Gaveston just comes off as a twisted psychotic and Waddington's performance as Edward renders the king weaker than Marlowe writes him and yet devoid of the inner vulnerability that ultimately makes the King sympathetic I never once believe they really love each other let alone madly enough to topple a whole nation. But plot and character don't seem to be a priority of the film as much as statements about gay rights and strange arty and really heavyhanded intrusions. Too bad really. There's so much to be dug out of the script and some of those gems DO appear in this film... but so many seem not only undiscovered but lost in a lot of camp confusion violence and raw unerotic sex. Don't get me wrong the film is worth seeing... I just hope that one day I get to make a new interpretation.".

And after Edwards' lover is killed the film slows down and gets very repetitious and boring. Still it's worth seeing for excellent performances by the entire cast Swinton especially interesting costumes Swinton has a different outfit in every scene! getting members of the gay British version of Queer Nation Outrage in the film and it visually looks gorgeous. And the appearance of Annie Lenox is a definite highlight. So if you can stand the archaic language this is worth watching.".

The film was shot on a stage but the screenplay is very unpleasant and I could not wait for the end of the movie. I was attracted by the names of Tilda Swinton John Lynch and Annie Lennox and in the end only the Lennox singing Cole Porter's Every Time We Say Goodbye was worthwhile. The DVD released in Brazil is unbelievably dubbed in Spanish i.e. a British movie dubbed in Spanish to make it worse. In my opinion Edward II might be mainly recommended for gay and very specific audiences. I had the displeasure of watching this flick on DVD on 27 August 2005.

All the sets look the same most of the actors aren't young and glamorous and everyone speaks Elizabethan English even though it takes place in 1991.    There were times that I felt I just wasn't getting it. But after a while I realized I was getting it  it's just that I wasn't offered very much to begin with.    This movie is so completely visually dull with its dirt floors and bare concrete walls did I mention this takes place in 1991? that I felt my eyes getting heavy. Would I have missed much if I had closed them? Well a couple of softcore manonman sex scenes did I mention that the actors aren't young and glamorous? but other than that looking at the inside of my eyelids wouldn't have been much less interesting.    Edward II's script is also quite lacking. I don't know if this is the case with the play the only Marlowe play I've ever actually read is Dr. Faust but in any case I see no sense in making a movie from the script. I can't imagine someone reading the script and saying this looks good. The characters are all so coldly obsessed with whining about their own petty problems that there's no way someone could really care about them. Even their bratty children have their own agendas. Anytime someone was killed I wasn't sure whether to be glad a character I hated was gone or to be unhappy that another character I also hated had succeeded.    My only praise for this movie is the acting. Given what these actors had to work with I think they made a good attempt. Unfortunately this was not enough to make this particular movie worth watching.".

	schema:headline " Historical betrayal in cinematographic beauty";
	schema:reviewBody "The film has both little to do with the play and yet is quite close to it. ...Derek Jarman goes a lot farther since he erases the political dimension of the last scene in which Edward III has Mortimer executed in the most violent but legal way for the killing of his father and his mother imprisoned pending her trial as an accomplice to this murder. The young king in the film dances to some music from his MP3 reader on the cage containing Mortimer and his mother covered in waste. Edward III is wearing his mother's earrings a fact that was also used in the previous scene when his own mother bit his uncle Edward II's brother at the jugular and drinks his blood like a vampire till death ensues. These earrings are the sign of the dependence of the child on the mother and become at the end with the mother in the cage a symbol of the continuation of the curse in this family that does not seem to clearly differentiate male from female and that is not only a question of sexual orientation. In a way that erases the feudal crime of Mortimer who seizes power or at least tries to by having himself appointed protector of the realm till the new king is of age to reign though the protector should have been the uncle....Jarman creates a very dark and menacing atmosphere by having many scenes in the underground foundations of some airless and lightless dungeons in a castle and some of these scenes show the King imprisoned in such underground dump in which all wasted water grey and black alike are rejected in a pool that covers the whole ground and in which the king is supposed to live while he is prevented from sleeping by constant drumming day and night. These prison scenes interspersed in the whole film make the plot very awkward since there is no plot any more with these flashforwards that tell the end before it ever could be envisaged. And this dark subterranean world is invaded and dominated by all kinds of military personnel in modern attire and equipment. We deal here with one characteristic of Derek Jarman's cinematographic art the art of anachronistic references. From the very start we have cigarettes then Big Ben's chimes then those modern uniforms then modern weapons then the prince is playing with robots. There is no end to such anachronistic elements or props The intended meaning is that nothing has ever changed. ...In fact the political dimension including gay rights is totally erased or veiled or hidden by the dark tortuous perverted world we are given to see the people at all levels and all of them are perverted including the King who forgets who he is and his responsibilities towards the peers his family his wife his son the church etc. He is a perverse feudal ruler. Including Gaveston who forgets who and what he is. He is from France from the lower levels of feudal society trying to dominate and get some revenge from the top layers of the English feudal society and thus he becomes a perverted social climber. Spencer in a way is more respectable because he does not want anything from the King. He is at the King's service and provides the King with the care he needs. Including all the peers church people and nobles alike who are all perverted because they want to defend their privileges their power their social position without taking into account anyone else they only speak of themselves and never of the people without whom they would be nothing. They are perverted feudal barons who have forgotten they are the protectors and the providers of their serfs and villains. Including of course the church who rants and raves about some kind of fictitious power of God or the church itself. Gaveston on that point is right when he rejects the See of Rome and calls it the See of Hell. ...In other words Jarman is overdoing it.The transformation of the Prince from a discreet and invisible voyeur who can see things without being seen into a mother's child wearing her hat her earrings and even her shoes on the cage at the end is pathetic and deeply unfaithful to Marlowe. This Edward III should be the restoration of order law and order authority the expulsion of the perverted and rotten fruits or eggs from the basket. From the capricious authoritarian love affairs of Edward II we shift here to a childish whimsical tyrannical brothel of sorts in which the perverse sexual desires of Edward III will be totally assumed and satisfied. The realm is falling one full subterranean hellscraper down with this Edward III. ... As a song says in the film Jarman has changed history and Marlowe's play from major to minor but here not every time we say goodbye rather from the very start and till the very end. The film is in minor tone and as such misses the multitonal music of today.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU".

These prison scenes interspersed in the whole film make the plot very awkward since there is no plot any more with these flashforwards that tell the end before it ever could be envisaged. And this dark subterranean world is invaded and dominated by all kinds of military personnel in modern attire and equipment. We deal here with one characteristic of Derek Jarman's cinematographic art the art of anachronistic references. From the very start we have cigarettes then Big Ben's chimes then those modern uniforms then modern weapons then the prince is playing with robots. There is no end to such anachronistic elements or props The intended meaning is that nothing has ever changed. ...In fact the political dimension including gay rights is totally erased or veiled or hidden by the dark tortuous perverted world we are given to see the people at all levels and all of them are perverted including the King who forgets who he is and his responsibilities towards the peers his family his wife his son the church etc. He is a perverse feudal ruler. Including Gaveston who forgets who and what he is. He is from France from the lower levels of feudal society trying to dominate and get some revenge from the top layers of the English feudal society and thus he becomes a perverted social climber. Spencer in a way is more respectable because he does not want anything from the King. He is at the King's service and provides the King with the care he needs. Including all the peers church people and nobles alike who are all perverted because they want to defend their privileges their power their social position without taking into account anyone else they only speak of themselves and never of the people without whom they would be nothing. They are perverted feudal barons who have forgotten they are the protectors and the providers of their serfs and villains. Including of course the church who rants and raves about some kind of fictitious power of God or the church itself. Gaveston on that point is right when he rejects the See of Rome and calls it the See of Hell. ...In other words Jarman is overdoing it.The transformation of the Prince from a discreet and invisible voyeur who can see things without being seen into a mother's child wearing her hat her earrings and even her shoes on the cage at the end is pathetic and deeply unfaithful to Marlowe. This Edward III should be the restoration of order law and order authority the expulsion of the perverted and rotten fruits or eggs from the basket. From the capricious authoritarian love affairs of Edward II we shift here to a childish whimsical tyrannical brothel of sorts in which the perverse sexual desires of Edward III will be totally assumed and satisfied. The realm is falling one full subterranean hellscraper down with this Edward III. ... As a song says in the film Jarman has changed history and Marlowe's play from major to minor but here not every time we say goodbye rather from the very start and till the very end. The film is in minor tone and as such misses the multitonal music of today.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU";

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is based upon a play written by Christopher Marlowe. Marlowe lived in the 16th century 1500's while the events in the play took place in the 14th Century 1300's thus there is approximately a 200 year difference between the events the play depicts and its writing. This means that Marlowe could have been making a political comment at the time but using a king from the past so as not to make it too controversial.The play is about the King of England Edward Plantagenat II who ascends the throne after the death of his father Edward I. Edward is a homosexual and within the first couple of scenes seeks and finds a lover in a peasant named Galveston. Edward uses his kingly powers to raise this peasant to nobility and proclaims him chancellor of the realm Duke of Cornwell and King of the Isle of Mann. Edward does this because he loves this man but he does not understand tradition. He as a king has no right to bestow such titles on peasants. This angers the nobility especially the general.His wife on the other hand is frustrated because he find no interest in her. She would rather see him rid of Galveston and return to her but when Galveston is exiled through pressure from the nobles she discovers that he is even less interested in her and instead pines for the return of Galveston. Thus throughout the play we discover that his wife Isabella becomes ever more alienated from her husband and becomes closer to the general who becomes Regent of England until her child Edward III becomes old enough to take the throne.Marlowe lived in a rather turbulent time in English history namely during the reformation when England was being pulled between Protestantism and Catholicism. King Henry had broken away from Rome and had set himself up as the head of the church. There were going to be repercussions to this action and I think this is possibly what the play represents. Edward makes a peasant his second in command and the repercussions was that he alienated himself from his nobles thrust the country into civil war and in the end he was executed. In real history Edward was removed from the throne by an act of parliament and a regent set in place to rule until Edward III was old enough to rule. The turmoil that resulted from the events with Galvaston reflect what might happen with the break from the church though there is little that I can comfortably say without knowing too much about the dates of the play.The film itself was done in a very abstract style. The clothing was modern day but the scenes were very abstract. The film closed with Edward III standing on top of a cage in which queen Isabella and the general were frozen. Edward III did finally master Isabella and the regent when he burst into their room and slew them. After that he turned his attention to France.The question in my mind is the film pro or antihomosexual. There are a lot of men kissing men in the film and in my mind the film probably is designed to be prohomosexual. Obviously considering the topic. The play I don't think so. I think the play possibly serves a different purpose. I don't think homosexuality was the issue then that it is today. The film confronts us with it and tries to show us that there is nothing wrong with it yet the play flares out about how unnatural it is. Maybe the director is trying to confront us with the images for shock value for the play does not come out for or against. The king is executed along with Galveston who is also exiled and spat upon during the play.I thought the play was brilliant but generally literature from that time was of a very high quality. The movie annoyed me with the homosexual images but I was able to look past that to the play itself in which a very powerful and violent story was unfolding.".

Genius cinematographer Ernest Haller was behind the camera bringing the vivid Art Direction of Robert Hass to life and the masterful direction was in the safe hands of William Wyler.A splendid sense of time and place is immediately established at the very beginning with the 1852 setting in antebellum Louisanna. Bette Davis is Julie Marsden the high spirited southern socialite who toys playfully with the feelings of her male suitors especially her young banker fianc Preston Dillard Henry Fonda. But he tires of her controlling personality and her irritating misdeeds such as storming into his bank demanding to see him on a trivial matter as he attends an important board meeting and then her insistence on wearing a RED dress to the Olympus Ball much to the chagrin of those who adhere to the strict tradition to only wear white You can't wear red to the Olympus Ball! asserts an astonished Pres. But wear it she does in defiance! However the Ball is a sensational sequence as Julie and Pres become a spectacle when all in attendance stand around and stare in disbelief as they waltz alone in the middle of the floor. Later during their uneven relationship Pres has to go North on business. He returns after about a year but he is not alone. He is now accompanied by a new woman in his life....... his wife. Counting the days for Pres's return Julie is in utter shock when he introduces Amy Margret Lindsay to her as his wife.You're funnin'! A horrified Julie exclaims  Hardly! responds a sheepish Pres. The picture climaxes with the dreaded Yellow Jack fever breaking out across the South and Pres being struck down with the deadly disease. In a brilliant confrontation with Amy Julie manages to convince her that it must be her and not his wife who should accompany Pres to the fever death camp. The picture ends in an extraordinary and harrowing final scene as Julie comforts the dying Pres on one of the many wagons in the caravan heading out of the city to the fever camp.The acting throughout is superb from all concerned topped with a blistering Acadamy Award winning performance from Davis she was assigned the role so as to allay any disappointment she might harbour with Warners for not loaning her out to play Scarlet O'Hara  a part she dearly wanted to play. Excellent too is the young Henry Fonda Fay Bainter in her best supporting Award winning role as the gentle and anxious Aunt Belle and George Brent is impressive as always as the illfated rival Buck Cantrell. The movie's atmosphere is quite stunning with the stark black  white cinematography the vibrant looking sets and the supreme nominated score by Max Steiner. The composer's main theme is beautifully arranged as a beguiling waltz for the infamous ballroom scene. And in the final sequence his prowess as film's great dramatist is powerfully demonstrated in the chilling dirgelike march he wrote complete with spirited female chorus for the fever wagons with their cargo of dead and dying as they struggle through the streets of New Orleans on their way to their grisly destination. JEZEBEL was one of 18 scores the great composer wrote for Bette Davis' films which included The Old Maid1939 Dark Victory 1939 The Letter1940 and most memorably Now Voyager 1942 which brought the composer the second of his three Acadamy Awards. The great actress once remarked of the composer At Warner Bros. Max knew more about drama than any of us.Max Steiner's music William Wyler's adroit direction Ernest Haller's stunning cinematography and of course Bette Davis's riveting performance all jell to make JEZEBEL one of Hollywood's outstanding and unforgettable motion pictures of all time.".

	schema:reviewBody "Bette Davis is a legend. I'd always heard that growing up but felt some disconnect from it . When I became aware of her it was late in her career after she had developed into a boozy smoke belching caricature of her on screen persona's. So if the Bette DavisLegend concept rings a little hollow with you as it did me watch this film. I just saw Jezebel for the first time on DVD. Wow! I haven't seen a lot of movies from the 1930's but I'm pretty sure that no one else was doing then what Bette Davis was doing. It is an acting style and skill level that isn't seen often. She is brilliant throughout but one scene in particular made the hair stand up on the back of my neck. It happens in the scene where Henry Fonda escorts Jezebel home after the ball and breaks off their engagement. When he tells her goodbye and not goodnight a look of puzzlement and humiliation comes over her face. She starts to turn away to leave but decides instead to extend her hand in Southern feminine cordiality to wish him well. As she does this something inside her wells up. Her expression changes and as they say if looks could kill... With the speed of a cobra and unable to restrain herself she slaps him in the face. Unlike a cobra however which recoils after it strikes she lurches slightly closer and you think she might just rip his throat out. William Wyler lets the camera linger on her and it's a powerful and slightly disturbing moment. I don't think anyone else could have pulled it off like Davis did. The film is great although the depictions of slavery as a genteel Southern quirk are more than a little cringe worthy. To see this movie though is to understand how Bette Davis became a legend. And to see this movie is to see one of the most powerful screen performances ever. Who knew... After all 1938 was a long time ago and I've been busy with other stuff.".

	schema:reviewBody "This was the film about deep Southern attitudes vs Northern attitudes that came out before Gone With the Wind and left Davis out of the running for the role of Scarlet O'Hara. It was the second film she made with director William Wyler and the best of the three. She also won her second Academy Award for the role. Davis' character Julie is not all that unlike Scarlet. She is very headstrong and full of bad decisions but this is what makes the film work so well. Her character is compelling in that you feel like you are watching a train wreck in action. It's horrible but you can't look away. This is the earliest of the films I watched from Davis' Golden Era and she is quite young very attractive with an array of beautiful costumes to wear. Plus the cinematography and sets are thick with atmosphere.Jezebel does have the somewhat same patronizing attitude towards blacks that Gone With the Wind had but at least it wasn't as objectionable as it was in Little Foxes Davis' next and final collaboration with Wyler. Aside from Davis who really does give a great performance Henry Fonda is quite memorable. Yet on top of everything the ending is so unusual for a film of this period that it just made my jaw drop. Of all the Bette Davis films I've seen from this period of her career I rate this one the highest. It's a classic for sure and is far more than just a Bette Davis film certainly well worth experiencing.".

	schema:reviewBody "After winning the Oscar for best actress in 1936 for Dangerous' Bette Davis began to complain that Warner Brothers was not giving her scripts that were worthy of her talent.  In 1936 Warner suspended her without pay for turning down a role.  She then went to England in violation of her contract with the intention of starring in a movie without Warner Brothers' approval.  The studio stopped her telling her that if she didn't work for them she wouldn't work anywhere.  In defiance she sued to break her contract.  Although she lost the lawsuit Warner Brothers began to take her more seriously and even paid her legal expenses.  The part in Jezebel' was thought to be an olive leaf offered by the studio to mollify her.About that time Davis made it known that she wanted the lead in David O. Selznick's upcoming production of Gone With the Wind'.  She was actually considered for the role but Warner told Selznick that they wouldn't agree to loan her out unless he also took Errol Flynn for the part of Rhett Butler.  Davis refused to work with Flynn and angrily turned down the part although Selznick did not intend to agree to Flynn regardless.  Many believed that Warner Brothers purposely created an impossible deal to punish Davis for the lawsuit while making it appear they were trying to help her. It isn't clear whether Jezebel' was offered to her before or after the negotiations for GWTW.  Clearly it didn't matter because Bette Davis went out and gave one of the best performances of her career and won her second Oscar for best actress.This film is GWTW without Yankees.  Instead the enemy is yellow fever.  The story takes place in New Orleans in the 1850's.  Although there are references to the abolitionists and the prospect of war the entire story takes place prewar.  This story focuses on the southern lifestyle of the period and in this way it is very similar to its more famous counterpart. It also follows the life and times of one very spirited woman named Julie Marsden Bette Davis who could have been Scarlet O'Hara's soul mate.Julie shocks New Orleans society when she insolently comes to a ball wearing a red dress when it is the custom for all proper southern girls to wear white.  A production note of interest The famous red' dress was actually black satin which was used because red didn't produce enough contrast in the black and white film causing it not to stand out enough.  As a result her beau Preston Dillard a youthful Henry Fonda is mortified and he breaks off their engagement.  Included in the story are a couple of duels over points of honor a stark depiction of the yellow fever epidemic and the noble resurrection of a contrite Julie Marsden upon Preston's return.As always director William Wyler with whom Bette Davis was romantically linked does a fantastic job at direction giving the film a genuine southern flavor and period feel.  The black and white cinematography in this film is tremendous and procured the film one of its five Oscar nominations.The acting is superb all around.  This is certainly one of Bette Davis' best and most memorable performances and it helped secure her place in movie history as one of Hollywood's greatest stars.  Though she never won another Oscar she went on to be nominated eight more times with five straight nominations between 1939 and 1943.  Ironically in 1940 she lost to Vivien Leigh who won in the role Davis turned down.Fay Bainter is marvelous as Aunt Belle Bogardus garnering a best supporting actress Oscar.  Henry Fonda shows a hint of his future greatness in a fabulous portrayal of Julie's nononsense beau.  George Brent with whom Davis also was rumored to have had an affair also turns in a strong performance as Buck the honorable gentleman who duels his best friend to defend Julie's honor.This is a wonderful film with great acting and directing.  Though not the epic that GWTW became it contains certain elements that Selznick undoubtedly incorporated at Tara since the similarities between the films are striking at times.  I rated this film a 1010.  For anyone interested in seeing why Bette Davis is considered one of the great actresses of the Studio era this film is a must.".

Davis plays her role so well that it is hard to determine whether you want to support her or marginalize her as a spoiled brat. I think that even when the film was made 1938 the lines were still blurred as to how many freedoms and how much freethinking should be afforded to women. It is easy for me to say that Julie's red dress was much ado about nothing but then again this is the millennium when nothing is overtly shocking anymore. The mere fact that I thought so much about a classic film which generally has throwaway plots is a true testament to Davis' performance and the writing under William Wyler's direction. Jezebel is essentially Gone with the Wind without the budget or the color and was made the year before that film was released. Most of the characters are fairly throwaway but the subject is Julie and her development is amazing and very believable despite the melodramatic genre. This is a film that most classic film lovers have seen I'm sure I am apparently a late bloomer in regard to this film but if you are one and you haven't seen it or are a Bette Davis fan see this movie. Most of her late 30's to 1950 films are so spectacular just because of her performance if the rest is good it's gravy and this is one of her best known performances. 710 Shelly".

Unfortunately Preston isn't at the party because he is hammering out business at his family's bank when they are married he and Julie will be moving north an almost sacrilegious action during this time. Buck Cantrell George Brent is Julie's former beau who remains a family friend and still defends Julie's honor. One day when Preston doesn't drop everything to attend a dress fitting for Julie that he had originally promised to attend she defiantly insists that she purchase a red dress breaking the white dress only tradition for the ball they were attending. Despite the protestations of everyone she knows including Preston she wears the dress to the ball causing her to be ostracized and the official break up of her engagement to Preston when he realizes that he cannot deal with her headstrong attitude.

	schema:reviewBody "After winning the Oscar for best actress in 1936 for Dangerous Bette Davis began to complain that Warner Brothers was not giving her scripts that were worthy of her talent. In 1936 Warner suspended her without pay for turning down a role. She then went to England in violation of her contract with the intention of starring in a movie without Warner Brothers' approval. The studio stopped her telling her that if she didn't work for them she wouldn't work anywhere. In defiance she sued to break her contract. Although she lost the lawsuit Warner Brothers began to take her more seriously and even paid her legal expenses. The part in Jezebel was thought to be an olive leaf offered by the studio to mollify her.About that time Davis made it known that she wanted the lead in David O. Selznick's upcoming production of Gone With the Wind. She was actually considered for the role but Warner told Selznick that they wouldn't agree to loan her out unless he also took Errol Flynn for the part of Rhett Butler. Davis refused to work with Flynn and angrily turned down the part although Selznick did not intend to agree to Flynn regardless. Many believed that Warner Brothers purposely created an impossible deal to punish Davis for the lawsuit while making it appear they were trying to help her. It isn't clear whether Jezebel was offered to her before or after the negotiations for GWTW. Clearly it didn't matter because Bette Davis went out and gave one of the best performances of her career and won her second Oscar for best actress.This film is GWTW without Yankees. Instead the enemy is yellow fever. The story takes place in New Orleans in the 1850's. Although there are references to the abolitionists and the prospect of war the entire story takes place prewar. This story focuses on the southern lifestyle of the period and in this way it is very similar to its more famous counterpart. It also follows the life and times of one very spirited woman named Julie Marsden Bette Davis who could have been Scarlet O'Hara's soul mate.Julie shocks New Orleans society when she insolently comes to a ball wearing a red dress when it is the custom for all proper southern girls to wear white. A production note of interest The famous red dress was actually black satin which was used because red didn't produce enough contrast in the black and white film causing it not to stand out enough. As a result her beau Preston Dillard a youthful Henry Fonda is mortified and he breaks off their engagement. Included in the story are a couple of duels over points of honor a stark depiction of the yellow fever epidemic and the noble resurrection of a contrite Julie Marsden upon Preston's return.As always director William Wyler with whom Bette Davis was romantically linked does a fantastic job at direction giving the film a genuine southern flavor and period feel. The black and white cinematography in this film is tremendous and procured the film one of its five Oscar nominations.The acting is superb all around. This is certainly one of Bette Davis' best and most memorable performances and it helped secure her place in movie history as one of Hollywood's greatest stars. Though she never won another Oscar she went on to be nominated eight more times with five straight nominations between 1939 and 1943. Ironically in 1940 she lost to the beautiful and exceptional Vivien Leigh who won in the role Davis turned down.Fay Bainter is marvelous as Aunt Belle Bogardus garnering a best supporting actress Oscar. Henry Fonda shows a hint of his future greatness in a fabulous portrayal of Julie's nononsense beau. George Brent with whom Davis also was rumored to have had an affair also turns in a strong performance as Buck the honorable gentleman who duels his best friend to defend Julie's honor.This is a wonderful film with great acting and directing. Though not the epic that GWTW became it contains certain elements that Selznick undoubtedly incorporated at Tara since the similarities between the films are striking at times. I rated this film a 1010. For anyone interested in seeing why Bette Davis is considered one of the great actresses of the Studio era this film is a must. 10101938 138 minutes CC.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jezebel was Bette Davis's consolation prize for losing the Scarlett O'Hara sweepstakes. Considering the sacrifice that the title character makes in this film it is fitting and proper that Davis got this role because she could have had Scarlett but she wouldn't make Gone With the Wind if it included Errol Flynn as Rhett Butler.Julie Marsden is as willful and and spiteful a southern belle as Scarlett O'Hara ever could be. But Scarlett would never deliberately violate the code the way Julie does and wear that red dress to a cotillion. Just simply not done in the best families.Bette Davis is Julie and while she's going to be married to the very proper Henry Fonda she likes the idea that she can still turn the head of every young blade in New Orleans. Especially George Brent's head as the dashing Buck Cantrell.When Fonda doesn't jump at her beck and call he prefers doing business to catering to her whims she decides on a daring move. This is a woman who cannot stand not being the center of attention. She wears a red dress to a cotillion when polite society dictates that all the unmarried young ladies wear white. When she does New Orleans society shuns her as effectively as the Amish can and Davis retreats to her plantation upriver.Fonda goes north and returns after a while to New Orleans with Margaret Lindsay who he is now married to. An insult our southern belle won't put up with. Davis sets in motion a string of events that results in a lot of tragedy.I have to say that just a description of the plot seems a bit ridiculous at times but Bette Davis does make this whole thing quite believable. She won her second Oscar for Best Actress in this film and as her aunt who occasionally gives her a reality check every now and then Fay Bainter was named Best Supporting Actress of 1938.Fonda and Brent are fine in their parts but they are in support of Bette Davis in a Bette Davis film. Another performance I liked is that of Donald Crisp as the doctor who fights a lot of prejudice and ignorance in New Orleans in trying to deal with yellow fever.Looming over all of the film is the knowledge we have that this society will come crashing down in another eight years or so in events so well told in Gone With the Wind. This film should be seen back to back with Gone With the Wind as a view of southern society.This was Bette Davis's first film with director William Wyler who she admired above all other directors. Davis was not generous with praise for colleagues so any kind words towards one are really something. Apparently Wyler did have the magic touch in handling Bette.Jezebel is one of Bette Davis's finest films maybe not the finest but definitely right up there. Unlike Davis's first Oscar for Dangerous which she said was a consolation for not winning for Of Human Bondage this one she was proud of. And we're proud of it too.".

There is no denying it that this is a great movie.It features a strong dramatic story in which Bette Davis plays the central character. It's a strong and independent woman for her time the movie is set in the 1850's yet also spoiled and stubborn who of course eventually has to pay for her deeds.Bette Davis plays a role in which she could had easily gone overthetop with since its a very stubborn and spoiled character but instead she plays her role more humane and realistic which also keeps her likable. She even won an Oscar for her role in this movie. Western expert actor Henry Fonda also plays one fine role and I especially liked the work he did with the accent within this movie. The movie further more among others also features the always great Donald Crisp. Donald Crisp was never an actor who played the main lead in a movie but he always played small and humble but great roles which also should be a reason why he got cast in so many fine and well known movies throughout his career. The same somewhat also goes for George Brent who plays Buck Cantrell in this movie. It's a well cast movie with fine acting performances which mostly also carries the movie.Max Steiner also delivers one fine Oscar nominated musical score for this movie. Steiner was one of the big composers from the early days of filmmaking for a good reason.Like basically every period movie at the time it's a fine looking movie with some impressive sets and costumes. It's often being compared to Gone with the Wind due to its story themes time period the movie is set in and it got shot around the same time but this really ain't fair in my opinion. Jezebel isn't even nowhere close in the same league and epic proportions as Gone with the Wind and Jezebel is a more light and less complicated one that has a totally different style and breaths a total different atmosphere not in the least also since Gone with the Wind is a movie in color of course.A fine multiple Oscar nominated and winning movie from William Wyler.810httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

But Julie is strongwilled independent and impetuous traits considered unwomanly by that era's Southern aristocracy. Against Preston's wishes Julie wears a red dress instead of the customary white to a gala ball. This event sets up the rest of the story.While the support cast in Jezebel is fine especially Fay Bainter the film would not be the same without Bette Davis. I just can't see anyone else in the role of Julie. Davis' performance and the film's setting are what make this film so memorable. The costumes the production design the cinematography and the music combine to convey a genuine sense of the antebellum South with its stately manners that conceal narrowmindedness and barbaric chivalry.Normally I don't care for films whose subject matter is long ago history. But Jezebel is an exception because it is so well made. I guess it is the tone of the film that really got my attention. The stately beauty of that time and place masks an underlying sadness as a prelude to tragedy. Some might call it melodrama. But to me that's just good drama.".

	schema:headline " Very good Wyler drama with an excellent Davis";
	schema:reviewBody "Bette Davis gives an excellent performance in this entertaining character study set in the Old South in the 1850's. She plays flighty flirty selfish Southern belle Julie Marsden who delights in shocking both her fiance Preston Dillard Henry Fonda and New Orleans society by wearing a scandalous red dress to a ball. Fonda leaves her and comes back a year later with a Northerner wife Margaret Lindsay. An outbreak of the dreaded yellow fever hits the city and Davis finally realising the damage she has caused after she has lost her lover and caused the death of old friend Buck Cantrell George Brent has a chance to atone and try to save the life of a stricken Fonda.A very good film that still holds up well today. Wyler contributes some particularly welldirected scenes with Davis' entry to the ball most memorable. The terror of the yellow fever is also excellently conveyed and the images of countless bodies being carted away is still very powerful. Davis is wonderful as Julie giving one of her best early performances although I can't see what she sees in Fonda's Pres Dillard! Davis had far better chemistry with George Brent and Fonda is just boring. Fay Bainter gives a great supporting performance. I found the ending good but maybe a little unsatisfying. I like ambiguity and I don't need thing spelled out to me but is Davis heading towards certain death with her true love or is she going to nurse him then give him up to Lindsay? Perhaps that is the film's enduring mystery.".

She soon loses him for what appears to be the second time when she wears a red dress to a ball where all the women are in white. Press goes to the north and returns with a wife Margaret Lindsay.

The period is the 1850s the place is Louisiana where there is an outbreak of the dreaded yellow fever.Although the film is similar to GWTW it stands on its own. It doesn't have the sweeping scope of GWTW. It's the story of one woman's love for a man and the effect it has on those around her. There are some striking scenes the dance sequence when Press and Julia are the only ones on the dance floor due to her being in red and the end is very striking.Bette Davis is great in the title role. Under William Wyler's direction it's a restrained performance. It's a good thing because she's appearing opposite the master of underplaying Henry Fonda. All of the women look stunning in their gowns Davis in particular. As with Scarlett and Ashley we don't really know what the attraction is between Julia and Press and the script doesn't tell us. Fonda seems a little on the dull side for a lively girl like Julia.Donald Crisp turns in a powerful performance as Dr. Livingstone and George Brent is very good as the elegant Buck Cantrell.Highly recommended.

She plays a spoiled Southern belle whose fianc Henry Fonda leaves her after a socially embarrassing event. As he leaves her she swears that he will return as he has in the past. And he does one year later with his new Northern wife in tow. The film does wonders with its historical setting New Orleans a short while before the Civil War. A year before Gone with the Wind cooed over the fancy lives and manners of the Ante Bellum South Jezebel was exploring them in more detail and with a more intelligent eye. Also lurking about is the threat of Yellow Fever which devastated New Orleans in the 1830s and is starting to grow rampant again. Another thing I really liked about Jezebel was its ending. Perhaps when it was released in 1938 there would be a feeling that Davis' character has turned a corner and has become more selfless but to me her motives seemed awfully suspicious. That ambiguity is fascinating. Along with the leads Donald Crisp and George Brent give fine supporting performances and Max Steiner's score is one of the best of its era. 910.".

	schema:reviewBody "I recently saw this magnificent film after not having seen it in quite a number of years. William Wyler's extraordinary direction makes this movie a classic that will live forever.Mr. Wyler had at his disposal the best of what his studio could give him. In this film based on the play by Owen Davis he was at the top of his form. With the help of the great cinematographer Ernest Haller and that fabulous costume designer OrryKelly he gives us a movie that will stand as one of the best of that period melodramas. The great Walter Huston was an assistant director under Wyler.There are some people who have written comments about Jezebel expressing how much better it could have been had it been done in color. Personally I don't think so. Just look at the closing scenes of the picture to witness the master camera work of Mr. Haller showing a close up of Ms Davis. The effect of light and shadow is almost comparable to a painting. Bette Davis reacts to the camera with an economy of gestures and yet she speaks volumes of what is going on inside her soul.Technicolor would have been the ruin of this film. At the beginning of its invention this new process was too harsh. The film wouldn't have kept the glorious look it still possesses had it been shot in color. As far as the red dress being more visible in sharp contrast with the white costumes of the other young women at the ball the black and white effect is more dramatic. William Wyler was very lucky with the amazing cast he assembled for the film. Bette Davis and Henry Fonda were at their prime when they appeared in Jezebel. Bette Davis is what holds the film together with her magnetism and star performance. It's almost impossible to think of another actress of that period giving as good a performance as Ms. Davis'.There are also people that have compared Jezebel with Gone with the Wind. The only thing they had in common is the fact that both take place in the period before the War between the States but that's as far as the similarities end. This was a stage play which by the way was not very successful when Miriam Hopkins and Tallulah Bankhead appeared in it.This is a film to be treasured thanks to William Wyler.".

	schema:headline " an exceptional film marred by a poor ending";
	schema:reviewBody "Up until the last few minutes of this film this was a truly wonderful film. Bette Davis does an exceptional job playing an extremely manipulative woman who repeatedly overplays her hand. At the beginning of the film she is engaged to niceguy Henry Fonda. But time and again she picks fights with him and tries to dominate him until he eventually tires of this and leaves her. A year later Fonda returns and Davis is ready to apologize and pick up where they had left offonly to find out that Fonda is now married. True to her manipulative nature she then schemes to have Fonda and the hotheaded gentleman George Brent get into an argument. What she didn't anticipate was that after Fonda was called away that Brent would continue this argument with Fonda's wife until eventually Fonda's younger brother challenges Brent to a duel. Soon afterwards Brent is dead and Davis sees that her scheming has gotten way out of hand. She loved manipulating others and making them miserable but this death really shook her. So a short time later when Fonda is stricken with Yellow Fever she tries to redeem herself by volunteering to follow him into quarantine to nurse him back to healthat which time the movie ends.So after that summary let's talk about the good and bad of the movie. As for the good there's so much to like about the film. The performances are wonderfulDavis received the Oscar for Best Actress and was THE standout performer in the film. Fonda and Brent give excellent support and are not overshadowed by Davis. Even the supporting actors are excellent though I really did not think that Fay Bainter playing Davis' aunt deserved the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress though she got it as her role was pretty small and not particularly transcendent. I really think they gave it to her because of the overall movie not her individual performance.Also a major plus to this movie was the incredible cinematography. This is simply the most beautiful black and white film I have seen and it's obvious the cameraman and director Wyler were tops in their fields. It's really amazing how despite being filmed in a sound stage the film looked so good.As for the bad and this kept the movie from receiving a 10 it was the stupid conclusion to the film. Throughout the entire film Davis played a selfcentered manipulator. But after seeing her plans go out of control she repents and is willing to give her life to save Fonda!? This just isn't in character at all and seems like a Hollywood ending. I really wanted a more thoughtout endingmaybe where she did go with Fonda into quarantine but only to try to win him back or perhaps him dying and her going about her merry way while hardly skipping a beat. THAT would have been more in character.One other note You will no doubt notice that this movie gives a VERY idealized view of slavery. The slaves seem universally happy and welltreated. For the sake of reality I kind of wish they'd showed less of Bette hobnobbing with the slaves something a society woman NEVER would have done in the Old South and maybe ordering some of them to be whipped!".

	onyx:emotionText "Up until the last few minutes of this film this was a truly wonderful film. Bette Davis does an exceptional job playing an extremely manipulative woman who repeatedly overplays her hand. At the beginning of the film she is engaged to niceguy Henry Fonda. But time and again she picks fights with him and tries to dominate him until he eventually tires of this and leaves her. A year later Fonda returns and Davis is ready to apologize and pick up where they had left offonly to find out that Fonda is now married. True to her manipulative nature she then schemes to have Fonda and the hotheaded gentleman George Brent get into an argument. What she didn't anticipate was that after Fonda was called away that Brent would continue this argument with Fonda's wife until eventually Fonda's younger brother challenges Brent to a duel. Soon afterwards Brent is dead and Davis sees that her scheming has gotten way out of hand. She loved manipulating others and making them miserable but this death really shook her. So a short time later when Fonda is stricken with Yellow Fever she tries to redeem herself by volunteering to follow him into quarantine to nurse him back to healthat which time the movie ends.So after that summary let's talk about the good and bad of the movie. As for the good there's so much to like about the film. The performances are wonderfulDavis received the Oscar for Best Actress and was THE standout performer in the film. Fonda and Brent give excellent support and are not overshadowed by Davis. Even the supporting actors are excellent though I really did not think that Fay Bainter playing Davis' aunt deserved the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress though she got it as her role was pretty small and not particularly transcendent. I really think they gave it to her because of the overall movie not her individual performance.Also a major plus to this movie was the incredible cinematography. This is simply the most beautiful black and white film I have seen and it's obvious the cameraman and director Wyler were tops in their fields. It's really amazing how despite being filmed in a sound stage the film looked so good.As for the bad and this kept the movie from receiving a 10 it was the stupid conclusion to the film. Throughout the entire film Davis played a selfcentered manipulator. But after seeing her plans go out of control she repents and is willing to give her life to save Fonda!?

All of the performances are excellently crafted and satisfyingly deep as would be expected from a stage play taken to the big screen. I love GWTW but Jezebel works as well or better at capturing the same basic period in US history while also keeping you waiting expectantly for the heroine's next outlandish maneuver. William Wyler was one of the great directors and his gift shines through in every scene. I give Jezebel 1010 stars and Davis more than deserved her Oscar.".

	schema:reviewBody "Now we shouldn't look to Rossen's film for actual history EXCEPT as reflected in later romance and indeed the Alexander legend. The film does indeed egregiously telescope events and make a complete chronological genealogical and motivational muddle of real historical events. Absolute realism is not the point of the film however  Hollywood is guilty of much simplistic remaking of history but Rossen's film is much more personal and ambitious in grand design if not in little details  the portrait of Alexander as a man brilliantly realized on many levels by Richard Burton is the real focus of the movie. What we have here is a portrait of the disintegration of the character of a promising ambitious young man intoxicated with power and the lies accompanying that and the formative power that the strong personalities of his parents Olympias and Philip had over Alex's mind.For this last reason I find the first half of the film to be superbly done. His stimulating contact with Aristotle the camaraderie between him and his companions and especially his complex relationships with Olympias and Philip are brought out beautifully if necessarily briefly by Burton in the film. Most of this is derived from the late Greek biographer Plutarch's Life of Alexander. Burton plays the young Alexander beautifully full of emotional ambiguities and hidden resentments. The murder of Attalus after the assassination of Philip is not only presented as the first of Alexander's blood crimes but as a necessary consequent of his upbringing as abetted and encouraged by his amazing monstrous mother. The rest of his career is presented not only as a continuation and surpassing! of his father's ambitions but as a fulfillment of Olympias' own expectations for her son. The psychological complexity here is exquisite and appropriate.This fine beginning makes the rest of the film redundant and annoying. We of course expect a good exposition of Alex's adult achievements but Rossen is frustrated at being tied to history here mostly derived from the ancient historians Arrian and Diodorus and we are treated to a perfunctory lazy account of all of his victorious battles and conquests. For instance the battles of Ipsus and Gaugamela are conflated into one encounter and the degeneration of Alex into a paranoid alcoholic is too broadly played. The usual cast of thousands used in the battle scenes are not convincing and we do not feel that the fates of nations and peoples hang in the balance. We are not granted any glimpse of Alex's genius at tactics and generalship. Darius is a mere cipher not a convincing King and opponent. Only Peter Cushing as Memnon gives us a spark of convincing opposition to Alexander's tyranny and he refreshingly reminds us that not all Greeks responded to Alex's call for a Panhellenic crusade against Persia. In historical fact more Greeks in all probability fought AGAINST Alexander than for him! Memnon's death at the battle at the Granicus is also an unhistorical invention he died of disease a year or so later after leading the increasingly successful resistance to Alex in western Asia Minor. His wife Barsine was certainly a captive to Alexander and probably bore him a son as well but this fact is blown up far too much in the film. The real Alexander's emotional attachments were homosexual to Bagoas Hephaestion Cleitus et al..In short the first half of the film is well realized and acute while the second half is confused hurried and unsatisfying. We understand much about Alex from the family drama in the first part we understand little about him from the second. Rossen certainly had limitations in telling this story if he had a larger budget and less at the time conventional restrictions on telling a story then we would have had a different and better and much longer! movie. The golden age of the epic film may well be past but I think that it can still be told. Consider this review as a challenge this story can be told well and at length with all the richness and complexity of the real without sacrificing drama and immediate interest. This is certainly one of the most fascinating stories of recorded history and it is a shame that Rossen was unable to complete what he had so brilliantly begun.".

	schema:reviewBody "As long as you don't mind the historical inaccuracies this movie may prove helpful for the Alexander fanatic like myself.  After 1st seeing this film I was horrified by the botch job that was done on the real Alexander story but after forcing myself to sit through it a 2nd time I was able to lighten up a bit on the factual content and just look for any great scenes that this film had to offer.  Particularly is the scene where Alexander goes to Athen's and the background shows a beautifully recreated shiny white Erectheon. Later Alexander walks through the Parthenon...a dream scene of ancient history buffs everywhere. Another good scene was right before the Battle at the River Granicus.  Here Alexander eyes his opponents on the opposite river bank and comments on who will be the 1st to fall...Richard Burton did a great job in some scenes but overall seemed to lack the charisma that exemplified Alexander. He has the look but the British accent doesn't suit Alexander very well.  I could go on but really see it yourself or better yet read The Campaigns of Alexander by Arrian it is much more than any movie could ever be on this enigmatic historical figure.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have always been fascinated by the short and violent life of Alexander of Macedonia which of course makes me biased in reviewing this film.  It has been said of this film that Robert Rossen who produced wrote and directed this film was aiming for a masterpiece but failed honorably.  While this is true in a way I still enjoyed it more than that. This movie is not fast in pace and the direction is not perfect either but it feels authentic.  I'm sure that not everything portrayed is true to history does anyone really care? but it is convincing and the acting is solid.  Richard Burton is a very good Alexander and he adds a lot of subtle edges to this enigmatic figure from history just ignore the silly blond wig...  All in all Alexander the Great is a good film perhaps too ambitious and even though it is not very accessible to viewers not familiar with the territory it is still quite dramatic convincing and enjoyable if you like historical epics.  And even though the film doesn't ask you to care too much about the characters it is still an interesting intellectual and high minded story you probably will not forget.  If you keep in mind that it is the events of history that are really on display here and not so much the individual players you may enjoy it as I did.".

	schema:reviewBody "Alexander the Great not surprisingly attempts to portray the life of Alexander the Great. On the surface it seems as though it should be excellent considering that the cast is led by two prolific actors Richard Burton and Fredric March as Alexander and his father Philip respectively. The film also features elegant costumes and lavish sets laden with depictions of ancient art and architecture. However all of these attributes disappointingly don't prevent the film from being extremely tedious.The film starts with Alexander's earlier life in Macedon and is mostly focused on portraying antagonisms between Alexander and Philip and the relationship of Alexander's mother to both. Richard Burton and Fredric March have some fine moments but for the most part their dialogue is uninteresting which makes the film mostly dull since most of the scenes in the film show lengthy discourses. There are jokes added as well that are often followed by a number laughing but the humor is mostly stale. There is one amusing point where Philip suggests that Alexander should wait until he is dead before naming a city after himself but this represents an exception rather than the norm. Barry Jones did give an enjoyable performance as Aristotle although he is only a marginal element in the film.During this first phase of the film the Battle of Chaeronea of is also portrayed where forces led by Philip and Alexander defeated a combined Athenian and Theban force in order to unite Greece under Macedonian rule. The battle despite having an array of extras in it is handled clumsily. It starts with brief shots of infantry and cavalry crossing a stream and then fighting out of formation. Then the focused is placed on Philip fighting oneonone and Alexander charging in after him. This portrayal seems to bear little to no resemblance to the actual battle of history is short in duration and not particularly exciting.Shortly after half way through the film Philip dies and the film moves to a portrayal of Alexander's military exploits in Persia. It is in this stage we are introduced to Memnon a Greek fighting with the Persians. Peter Cushing gives a strong performance as Memnon armed with sharp lines making his the top performance of the film though the character is seen in relatively few scenes. Harry Andrews is also notable as the Persian emperor Darius though Darius is never made particularly interesting in the context of an opponent to Alexander. However the scene representing the correspondence between Darius and Alexander showing the clash of egos was welldone.Most of this phase of the film is a rotation between short battle scenes and more mostly dull dialogue with some rare decent scenes. The Battle of the Granicus is shown basically as a brief cavalry charge. The treatment of Granicus is better than the treatment of Chaeronea but not much better. There is another final battle between Alexander and Darius presumably intended to represent the Battle of Gaugamela. The battle starts with a Perisan chariot charge and seems as though it will be interesting but it quickly culminates in a brief uninteresting cavalry charge as well. The main problem with these battle scenes is that they fail to give a sense of Alexander's military genius. It seems as though he just accumulated territory through a series of brief heroic cavalry charges and the film never represents the tactics used in any of the battles. These are also a series of brief and unnecessary battle clips overlapped by a map of Persia to represent the conquests not shown in fuller battles. After Alexander's conquests the film ends poorly with an uninteresting harmony and unity speech from Alexander for Greeks and Persians. Alexander the Great is a colossal bore and I strongly recommend avoiding it.".

	schema:headline " Well acted and produced  fair direction  but March is best";
	schema:reviewBody "Robert Rossen is one of the directors whose career was going well when the blacklist hit and he found himself in a tailspin. After Johnny O'Clock Body And Soul and All The King's Men Rossen seemed headed for major directing work. Then came the blacklist. In the years of Senator McCarthy Rossen did two projects The Brave Bulls and Alexander The Great. Then he began regaining his stride with They Came To Cordura and finally the film we really recall him for The Hustler. But he left a relatively small body of movies and we can only marvel at the less than ten titles it includes.This was unless you count the fictional They Came To Cordura the only history film in his work and it was done in Europe. In fact of the leads only one Fredric March is American. It is like all Rossen's work impressive to look at  he was a master at composition of figures on the screen. Look at the sequence of the assassination of Philip of Macedon. Philip leaves a crowd that remains on the outskirts and ascends steps to a temple. A figure darts out and attacks and kills him. The fate of the character although there has been a morbidity about Philip since the film began is reenforced by the way death seems to reach out an knock him down. As I said the film is very impressive to see.I stress this last scene of March's because his Philip has more going for him in the movie than it's erstwhile central figure. Alexander was his father's rival egged on by his mother as Richard the Lion Hearted is egged on by his mother in The Lion In Winter. But Philip is more of a superstitious type than Henry II of England. He is aware that his son is needed as an heir to complete Philip's dream uniting the Greek state under Macedonian sovereignty into a single power. But he is aware that the signs suggest his heir is going to be his great rival and destroyer like the Greek Gods led by Zeus overthrew their father Chronus. March's wife the clever and deadly Olympias Danielle Darrieux knows how to push March's buttons about his fears and March finally does what Henry II threatens to do  divorce his wife and marry again  and breed new better sons. It seals his death warrant  Olympias will not tolerate a rival on Philip's throne.March therefore has a more interesting role than curiously Burton as Alexander. I know that sounds strange but March's personal turmoil is much more interesting to consider and watch. Historically Philip is frequently overlooked because of his son's stunning military achievements against Persia and his empire building but Philip actually was a clever monarch. Interestingly enough while Alexander's body was eventually buried in a beautiful tomb in Alexandria Egypt the tomb has not been found by archaeologists. But twenty years ago Philip's remains were found in Macedonia. Philip in a sense has survived his son.After March leaves the scene Burton becomes the center of attention  his role in taking over Greece rapidly replaced by his role in bringing down the old Persian Empire of Cyrus Darius I and Xerxes see The Three Hundred Spartans. Possibly too much is bypassed  the heroic attempts of the last great democrat of Athens Demosthenes Michael Hordern to stop this juggernaut threatening Greeks's city states is seen too quickly. The confrontation with Darius III Harry Andrews is handled too quickly too  not quite the monarch his ancestors who invaded Greece were his defeat and death are tragic and deserving of deeper plumbing. Rossen decides to concentrate on Alexander and his role of building that empire that stretched from the Nile to the Ganges  one of history's most astounding military achievements. Certain quasilegendary events are shown  the cutting of the Gordian Knot for example. The corrupting influence of the growth of Alexander's power is shown too up to his premature death. He was an aged 33 when he left the scene.What would he have done if he lived into old age? Would he have noticed on the western boundaries of his empire those two peculiar states Carthage and Rome? His relations with the Jews in Jerusalem and the Holy Land were quite good for a change the Jews realized it would make sense not to fight such a powerful invader  in fact to this day Jewish families live up to an agreement with the Greeks to allow their sons occasionally to bear the name of Alexander the one nonJewish name allowed. Would Alexander have used Greek culture to unify the entire ancient world? Or would the relative decadence of the Persian world have undermined his plans? A ten year reign some twenty three hundred years ago that is still remembered is astounding. But where would it have ended?".

Had he not died at the age of 33 touching on the borders of current India who knows what might have happened.Richard Burton with years of classical training behind him plays Alexander as the charismatic prince of Macedonia who arouses both the admiration and jealousy of his father Philip played by Fredric March.The relationship between Philip and Alexander is what drives the film. The problems between them are not to unusual to more modern monarchies. The crown prince is always a rival source of power by dint of his position he gets his own personal followers and that is always of concerned to the king.In addition Philip is in doubt about his kid's paternity doubt encouraged by his wife Danielle Darrieux sick and tired of his infidelities.As played by March Philip is a parvenu leading a warrior state and a man of little learning. He remedies that for his son by getting the best teacher around for him in Aristotle played by Barry Jones. Aristotle gives Alexander the culture that Philip lacks and instills in him a belief of the superiority of Greek Culture against the rest of the world and it was his duty to spread it. Doesn't that ever sound familiar.When Philip is assassinated Alexander succeeds him and after securing the backing of the seven leading cities of Greece he moves east and south in an expedition of conquest. Burton's performance is grand because in his speech and in his closeups you see all the various forces at work in Alexander the idealism the egoism the arrogance it's all there in various mixtures at any given time of the film.The open homosexuality that characterized the production of Alexander in 2005 is not present in this film. The film does show Alexander's associates to be male which was not uncommon in Greek society back in the day and that women were there to breed nothing more. Of course they were something more in terms of their own agendas as Danielle Darrieux plainly shows. Might be a good idea to view both films back to back and see just how The Code affected productions back in 1956.".

The film does show Alexander's associates to be male which was not uncommon in Greek society back in the day and that women were there to breed nothing more. Of course they were something more in terms of their own agendas as Danielle Darrieux plainly shows. Might be a good idea to view both films back to back and see just how The Code affected productions back in 1956.";

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review DVD Alexander the Great";
	schema:reviewBody "I borrowed this movie with one intent and that is to see how the subject material was handled in the 50s compared to the most recent interpretation by Oliver Stone who gave us an Alexander with Colin Farrell complete with his hair dyed blonde. And while I was lamenting the fact that there were only 2 war scenes on a massive scale included in that version the hype that surrounded the story of a conqueror seemed to have made way for Stone's very queer depiction on the bisexuality of Alexander especially with the camera adopting his POV and gazing ever so lovingly at the male species countless of times until you want to throw up. I guess subtle is never in Stone's books.Now this version written and directed by Robert Rossen who also gave us the original Hustler did away with all that sexuality issues and neither did it find any need to have gratuitous nudity in watching Alexander make love in Stone's version Rosario Dawson went nude in her role as Roxane. Then again it was made about 50 years ago. Anyway what I found to be a major disappointment were the battle scenes. Yes it might be terribly dated by now and sadly didn't survive the test of time. At certain scenes and angles it's akin to old martial arts movies where enemies just circle around you waiting for their choreographed moves to be executed or worse if you pay attention to characters in the background they surely aren't moving like ferocious warriors choosing instead to mull around!Also we only get one major battle sequence in Alexander the Great which made the foray into India in Stone's Alexander look like bonus material. In fact this version took some time to establish key characters and began with Alexander's father King Philip's Fredric March conquests first interrupted by the birth of his son and the prophetic signs under which he was born. It took almost 30 minutes before you see any semblance to a fight and almost one hour before Richard Burton finally takes over the mantle and seeks out his destiny as one of the greatest known world conquerors of all time. However the film felt like it was in two arcs the first which dwells on the internal bickering within Greece with its many factions and the plotting between mother Olympias Danielle Darrieux and King Philip each wanting to win over Alexander's loyalty for their own political purpose. In this version though which harped on Darrieux's appearance in the credits I thought she made Angelina Jolie look more formidable in the role. At least Jolie was dripping with evilness and cunning compared to the more subdued Darrieux.The latter half dealt with Alexander's conquests through Asia though most of the facts were glossed over. It was too little too late as most of which are told using montage intertitles and narration which made it look like a rush job to end it. While Stone's movie had focused a fair bit over Alexander's obsession with being the Son of God and his increasing obsession over himself and his glories this version again made those themes look superbly examined in Stone's version. However one thing's for certain Richard Burton even with the horribly blond hair which looked like a wig was indeed a lot more charismatic and believable than Coliln Farrell. And that also meant when Burton was wearing the horrendous full faced helmet so that the stunt guy can take over!All in all a pretty decent effort in telling the story of Alexander the Great however as mentioned it didn't really stood up to the test of time.".

The point is that it has some important flaws the demerit the product.First of all Richard Burton was not the actor to play Alexandre though not for his undoubted acting ability but because he was too old. In fact he was almost the same age the Macedonian hero was when he died and it shows clearly even more when the picture takes his life when he was just an adolescent. Secondly the film is too slow with lots of talk and little action but Alexander was mainly a man of action. And finally the not abundant action sequences lack spectacle and strength even for the middle 50's. So it appears to me that director Robert Rossen either missed the correct focus to tell this story or got too tight to an erroneously focused script.However the film might be entertaining for those who like epic films andor are interested in the historical figure like me and has some good moments good color photography a fine and adequate musical score and a strong supporting cast. Frederic March does a good job as Philipus II the Barbarian Alexander's father who created the invincible Macedonian falange that was so very well used by his son at war. Danielle Darrieux plays Alexander's ambitious and confronting mother and there are fine performances too by Peter Cushing Stanley Baker Helmut Dantine and the always reliable Harry Andrews as Persian king Darius.Just for a look every once in a while but no too often.".

	schema:headline " A Dysfunctional Family Big Time";
	schema:reviewBody "As a teenager I saw the movie on first release. I recall an adult coworker at the time sneering at my choice as though I was lacking in artistic refinement. Well maybe I was then and still am now. But seeing it again for the first time in 50 years i still think it's a darn good movie. Of course there are aspects I can appreciate or criticize now that I couldn't then.One good point is the staging. Note how many shots are staged outdoors as would be expected of life in ancient times where there were few buildings to retreat to. I especially like the constant use of statuary to impart a period flavor that also makes for scenic settings. For another each scene is tightly edited and never gets boring unlike most historical dramas which seem to favor longwinded speeches that emphasize dialogue over pacing and rhetoric over meaning. Instead each scene even when it doesn't drive the story forward never palls.Burton's simply terrific as the son who starts out trying to prove himself to his dad and Athens and ends up trying to prove himself to the world and history and pretty much succeeds on all counts. It's a demanding role that not many actors could fulfill. But this is still early in Burton's career before he meets Elizabeth and before his imposing manner and sonorous delivery turns into cooked ham. Whenever I hear his name this is the movie I like to reference. Still and all the screenplay appears unsure what to do with Claire Bloom's character and as a result her presence as a marquee name seems wasted.The battle scenes are well mounted which is not too difficult when you've got what looks like the whole Spanish army at your disposal. On the other hand the combat sequences are surprisingly brief with a lot of generally pointless milling around. Also we don't get much sense of Alexander's ability to maneuver his troops which must have been formidable given his string of successes. There's the usual drama of rivalry and intrigue that always seems to swirl around the seats of power ancient or modern. Alexander sure has a lousy home life. Dad hates Mom and Mom hates Dad while Dad and Son can't trust each other power over the world being at stake. Plus Son never knows what Mom might be plotting. No wonder Alex wants to get out of the house big time. Still the screenplay combines the personal story with the drive for empire in effective fashion. However note how few closeups there are of any of the players even the leads but especially the supporting players. I'm not sure why but this has the effect of diluting some of the intrigue because many of the key participants remain hard to identify at least they were for me. What really surprises me is that the guiding hand behind the project belongs not to a big budget moviemaker but to a specialist in filmnoir Robert Rossen. It's hard to think of a category further removed from Technicolor spectacle than intimate blackwhite but Rossen somehow brings it off. My one real complaint are the final few scenes where the screenplay appears to pander to modern religious beliefs. Now I don't know Alexander's actual beliefs but I doubt they were of the later monotheist type that the screenplay clearly conveys. Looks to me like another instance of boxoffice trumping historical accuracy a not unknown trade off in Hollywood history even if it does make the man himself more acceptable to audiences.Anyway in my little book the movie succeeds better than most historical epics. And even 50 years later I still think my coworker was wrong.".

The Oliver Stone version that was premiered in 2004 looked to be more promising but it's not necessarily better and had also been heavily criticised for a number of reasons. Therefore the complicated history of a warrior whom conquered the middle east 2.300 years ago may explain the reason for the failure of those two films.".

	schema:headline " A chronicle of the life of the man that destroyed Persia in a few years";
	schema:reviewBody "Hopefully everybody knows who Alexander of Macedon is and for those who don't we was the Macedonian who in a few short years conquered all of modern day Greece Turkey Lebanon Syria Israel Egypt Iraq Iran Afghanistan and northwestern India. He was gone down in history as one of the greatest generals that the world has ever known but despite his conquests was he really a great man? Well history has recorded that he was but we look at his achievements over two thousand years after his death and the closest record we have of his exploits was from Arian who wrote over 100 years after his death.Whether Alexander truly a great man is not a question that this movie seeks to answer though it does explore his character based upon the mythology that has arisen around him and follows him from birth to death though does not strictly follow his entire life but rather important events. The movie focuses on his birth with his mum prophesying that she has given birth to a god his coming of age when he is given rule over Macedonea while his father is away at war his first victory on the field and his father's death. Once his father is dead after being assassinated by one of Alexander's friends Alexander then raises his army and invades Persia. The main events are then his conquest of Anatolia his battle with Darius the death of Darius his entry into Babylon his decision to return home after killing his friend in a drunken brawl which occurs in India and finally his death in Babylon. The scope of the story of Alexander of Macedon is huge almost too big to fit into a full length feature film.This movie is not so much a character study of this man but rather following him as he comes of age and then sets out on his goal to first conquer Persia and then conquer the world. However is character does come out namely the oedipal complex with his mother and in turn his dilemma when Phillip his father decides to get rid of his mother for a younger girl and his hubris. While his hubris is not his ultimate downfall it is his desire to conquer to the end that he forgets that those who follow him are far from home and in the end the only thing they want is to return to Macedon though Alexander's army was made up of many more people than just Macedonians. In the end when he dies of a sudden illness he is left with the question as to succession to which he replies 'my kingdom goes to the strongest'. Once again not strictly true as he did have an heir but his heir did not possess Alexander's qualities and his kingdom ended up being divided amongst his generals.As for the movie it was enjoyable maybe not faithful to the true story but since the story of Alexander is sketchy beyond what we know I guess it will be ever difficult to know the truth about this man beyond the legend that has developed around him.".

	schema:reviewBody "It is of course inevitable to compare this film with Oliver Stone's more advanced version of 2004. The Robert Rossen version falls short of almost everything except some details. The main qualities of the film lie in the absolutely perfect and most enjoyable diction all through like almost a Shakespeare drama on stage  Richard Burton is only one out of a splendid gallery of eloquence. Another quality worth observing is Robert Krasker's outstanding photo  every picture and scene is classical. The most interesting part of the film is the first part with Frederic March as the pathetic limping king Philip the drunkard which must be a wonderful role for any actor and which no actor could fail in  Val Kilmer made that part in Oliver Stone's version but Frederic March is even better. Some other of the more interesting parts are Peter Cushing as the doubting Memnon and his wife Claire Bloom as Barsine later Alexander's mistress  they are the only ones who openly challenge Alexander's vanity before Cleitus is killed for it which concludes this film the later half of which from Philip's death onwards is a terrible simplification of the Alexander epic in which most things are either completely wrong or just passed by in a hurry  especially the battles which are dilettantic in comparison with the great Stone battle scenes. Harry Andrews makes an imposing king Darius but is not allowed to act very much. For the rest the whole Alexander epic is spoilt by the fact that you only see the landscape of Spain  there is no connection with Asia at all.Unfortunately the film as a whole is a failure when so much could have been made out of this subject. The first half remains interesting but then the rest is stumbled across to get done with while Oliver Stone's film is so much more rewarding although being very far also from reaching the actual target. At least Colin Farrell is slightly more credible as Alexander than Richard Burton who makes a very superficial impersonation of the greatest warrior king that ever lived and doesn't seem to have understood him at all. The important part of Hephaistion Jared Leto in the Stone version is missing here altogether and Danielle Darrieux for all her beauty makes no impression at all in comparison with the perfectly fitting Angelina Jolie as Alexander's indomitable mother.Most lacking is ultimately Robert Rossen's script. The dialog no matter how eloquent is not substantial and not dramatic and as superficial as the entire film. The actors make the best of it but Robert Rossen was not up to the task of living up to his enterprise as both producer director and writer of the film.".

Richard Burton seems to want to give one and at times you can see the beginning of a spark but it appears that he either is reined in or just gives up which is a shame. Also for a spectacle the action scenes are pathetic. There's no urgency in them you don't get any sense of the fanaticism and dedication that carried the Macedonian army to world conquest it looks like a bunch of extras in this case the Spanish army standing around waiting to get paid and not wanting to work real hard for it. UA obviously had money to spend on this film they should have hired a top secondunit director like Yakima Canutt or Andrew Marton to do the action scenes and they would have turned out much much better.All in all considering the talent involved this film is a major disappointment. It moves like molasses and doesn't reflect well on Rossen Burton or anyone else involved with it. Too bad. To paraphrase another movie It coulda been a contender.".

In the film Kurt Cobain recounts his own life  from his childhood and adolescence to his days of musical discovery and later dealings with explosive fame  and offers often piercing insights into his life music and times. The conversations heard in the film have never before been made public and they reveal a highly personal portrait of an artist much discussed but not particularly well understood.";

	schema:headline " Uncommercially no Nirvana songs but a sincere and worthwhile study";
	schema:reviewBody "Kurt Cobain lead singer of Nirvana before his untimely death is often credited by music experts as being one of the most influential musicians of his time. A claim that careful analysis demonstrates to have much credence. Yet he seemed an unremarkable individual. Physical and mental illness. Dropping out of high school. Habitual druguser. Where did he find the insights that made him such an inspiration to other artists? Making a famous rockstar biopic must be a temptation to fill it with crowdpleasing footage of their songs. Then link it with candid shots to show the 'real' person. Thankfully Schnack has steered an alternative course with great integrity in his pursuit for truth. He has looked at how the formative years made the man. The result is not a pat answer underlined with some snappy lyrics. It is a convincing and inspiring portrait of a man who was not easy to know.Twenty five hours of unreleased interviews provide a voiceover for the film. We focus on the period from childhood to when Nirvana attain recognition. These formative years together with Cobain's own words give us a feeling for how his music developed. More importantly they show the pressures on his character. In almost a crucible of personal hell in spite of the bravado in what he says Kurt Cobain forged a telling sincerity of expression. That expression of someone who has little choice.Cobain acknowledges many influences including Led Zepplin Kiss ACDC and the Cars as well as more obscure bands. But his key experiment was based on mixing seemingly irreconcilable genres. How successful do you think a band could be if they mixed really heavy Black Sabbath with the Beatles? he asks.Some bands had approached elements of this already. Zepplin used strident contrasting sections gentle harmonies would alternate with heavy metal sections. Nirvana invoked not just musical contrasts but extreme disparities of mood and lyrics. Many of their songs flip in a split second from gentle sensitive caring singalongwithyourmum words  to an extreme violence of sound and imagery. Come as you are as a friend takes on a horrific edge in subsequent verses. The shock value has been duplicated since usually in a less extreme way in the structure of music and lyrics by many rock bands and even seems to filter down to pop groups such as Rihanna and Morningwood.We could equally wonder if it was just part of a general music drift. But the film's insights help even an untrained ear to analyse the trends and Nirvana's role in them.Cobain's life gave him plenty to draw on. Isolated homeless in the middle of winter suffering from ADD and later manicdepression in his dark night of the soul we can see that his love of music was his only interest. Living in a backwater of Seattle the only possessions he valued were his artistic nature and the guitar that offered a possibility of expression.There is nothing manufactured about the sound of Nirvana. Its heartfelt honesty perhaps helped to propel the group to wider audiences at a time when indie bands were being methodically sidelined by an avaricious industry. In reaching a wider public Nirvana also helped to show it was still possible for an unknown band to break through the seemingly invincible wall that dictated what was acceptable.The film's cinematography still and moving images of the places and sorts of people that populated Cobain's early life cleverly and almost imperceptibly adds flesh to the raw bones. The bleak Aberdeen backwater. Sleeping under bridges. Spending time in libraries to keep warm. Eventually meeting middleclass youngsters who populate an unsettlingly different world. All through this the idea for him of simply making enough money to survive was awesome. Cobain is maybe an extreme example of the doubleedged angst felt by many young people. I was such a nihilistic jerk half the time he says. I'm so fcking sarcastic at times then at other times I'm so vulnerable and so sincere and that's pretty much how every song comes out  it's a mixture of both of them and that's pretty much how most people my age are  they're sarcastic one minute then caring the next. Since the nihilism pervades all of the interviews except where he speaks of music it is reasonable to believe against his claims that he didn't change much. I'm pssed off about everything in general and so all these songs are pretty much about my battle with things that pss me off.The words are inelegant and he technically contradicts himself on occasion. But the general sense comes through. It is one of the special gifts of cinema to be able to show the bigger picture by putting words in different settings juxtaposing them with images to give meanings that could otherwise be missed.Perhaps Cobain is at his most articulate when talking about privacy and the intrusion of the paparazzi. If people believe they have a 'right' to know everything about a celebrity's life Then I have a right to try and change that view he says.Cobain was a tragic character who found happiness in so little and yet affected his artistic field greatly. Schnack's portrait will not satisfy fans that want a pop video of Nirvana songs. It doesn't feature a single one even though it will increase subsequent enjoyment and appreciation of their music. Neither will it satisfy the gorehounds who want to endlessly debate whether his death was suicide or not. Yet somewhere in the misery of Cobain's life was born a spark of creative fire that was far more important. It is hard to imagine how this film could have been less commercial or more true to the quest for that flame.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is the official story. I don't think many people realise that that a lot of the stuff written about Kurt and Nirvana was either sensationalised or just completely made up. This story though is one of the very few true stories. It is based on Michael Azerrad's book Come As You Are which was official and was made with the help of the band and their friend's and families.This movie is made WITH the actual discussions of Kurt with Michael. So the entire movie is basically just Kurt talking and the movie makers then just added pictures to what Kurt was talking about.Sometimes it's a photograph or a painting but a lot of the time it is actual footage of the people and places in this story and it makes it so much easier to visualise what Kurt is talking about when it presented so well for you like that.If you have read the book this is like a watered down version of that but it is still worth a watch because you are hearing it from Kurt himself and you are hearing the quotes in their original form. For the book some of the quotes were taken apart and put in different stages in the story to make it fit together properly. So here it is in it's raw form which is interesting. And there are a few things that didn't make the book.I really liked the visual aspect though. Some said it should have just been an audio CD well I completely disagree as do other people. The pictures visualise everything for you so you get the full emotional experience. Your mind doesn't have to wander around trying to think about what Kurt is saying. The pictures are already here for you so it gives you time to think about what Kurt is actually saying. It also shows you a lot of things that are in the story. The actual places Kurt lived and hung out etc. Hearing him talking and seeing the footage of this stuff just seemed to fit together perfectly and it surprises me that some people didn't appreciate that.Seeing Olympia Aberdeen and Montesano etc.. it helps show the story that is being told.Basically this gets two thumbs up from me. It's a must watch for a Nirvana  Kurt fan and probably an interesting watch for people who aren't even fans.My only notes to you would be that it is pretty sad and also it a VERY thinned out version of what you get from the book so if you want more you really should get the book too.".

There is nothing to spoil in this piece really. It's just a really relaxing experience throughout.It sounds a long time of just simply listening to audiotapes of Kurt Cobain  and it actually is. I disagree when I hear that only people who like NirvanaKurt Cobain would enjoy and appreciate the film. For people who really appreciate film language it is a film to watch too. I have seen it twice now and it does amaze me that I don't get bored. The mild soundtrack in the background along with pictures and video clips makes it a journey while you listen. Basically all of the clips you see are merged together with what he is saying to give a sense of atmosphere and relevance.  There is no clips of Kurt Cobain or Nirvana. Nor is there any songs. The only small clips of Kurt are at the very end Without spoiling even if that's not really possible there is one particular clip where there is a man walking in the background which is supposed to be Kurt. Therefore it's also a documentary you need to pay attention to just like any other film.But if you actually are interested to see this piece because you are a Kurt Cobain fan you really should have a look. It's probably the film which made me really assured that Kurt Cobain was a true role model. You can read as much about him as you want but the interviews which this film provides is truly excellent.It will definitely not suit everyone but for me it is one of the best crafted documentaries I have ever seen.".

The most powerful aspect of the film is the fact that we hear Kurt Cobain's voice speaking his own words a far better idea than the standard documentary format that features experts and fans talking about what made a person great. In the interviews Cobain is happy depressed funny bitter excited exhausted gracious resentful kind sarcastic ... but always engaging and interesting. It was also powerful to see the images of the towns in which Cobain lived  Aberdeen Olympia and Seattle  as he talked about different phases of his life. I agree with an earlier poster's comment that saving actual images of Cobain and Nirvana until the end really worked. After all it is Cobain's voice that is his greatest legacy and by filling our eyes with images of industrial workers train trestles rundown houses liquor stores street corners and so on the film reminds the viewer that Cobain was a man first and foremost and an icon later. And the soundtrack is AWESOME! Kurt talks a great deal about bands that influenced him as he grew up and started writing songs and many of these artists were kind enough to grant permission to the filmmakers to use their music for free. I hope that a soundtrack album is released at some point. My only complaint was the filmmakers' choice to include images of places buildings and scenes especially in Seattle that were not around when Cobain was alive. How much did the Mariners' baseball stadium which opened in 1999 shape the person who became Kurt Cobain and I somehow doubt that Cobain spent any time at Starbucks. Nevertheless I highly recommend the film to anyone who loves Nirvana or is fascinated by the man.".

	schema:reviewBody "I just saw this at the Toronto Film Festival and I wasn't impressed.While I appreciate the audio interviews captured within this film I question why a movie was made. I would have enjoyed the film as much if listened to on the way home while I was in traffic. It should have been a CD release not a film.The film revolves around some audio recordings that were compiled from a series of late night interviews. There were very intimate details described by Cobain including how he did care about what people thought about him as opposed to what most of his friends suggested and that he wanted to write some pop songs for their albums but Sub Pop forced them into keeping the albums underground. Some may already be aware of these facts but I enjoyed learning of them for the first time. The tone in which Cobain spoke felt genuine and the pacing of the interviews was perfect. These interviews deserve to be heard by any fan of Cobain's or Nirvana. They were a great listen.The problem with this film is there isn't a single video clip or photo of Cobain his family or Nirvana until the last 30 seconds of the movie. The entire film involves a series of related images that play based on the interviews. An example would be when speaking on his father's job they show footage of men working at a lumber yard. When Cobain spoke on Seattle they'd show images of Seattle Record stores streets and highways. They even had real time images being drawn in the form of artsy cartoons tree's and grass swaying during some of the vocals. It was like watching on LONG Fruitopia commercial combined with a film strip about Washington. Unfortunately it also seemed like they had problems clearing for use in this movie.I understand what the director attempted with the images but it failed in my eyes. It's almost like they brainstormed how they could generate the most revenue from the interviews as opposed to having a vision upon hearing them. It feels forced and I don't need to see this again. Literally. If I ever end up with a copy of the DVD I'll either record the audio to CD or listen to it with the TV off.".

At the time the word grunge wasn't something we used to describe this kind of metal rock crap we were listening to It was just druggie and hard sounding which fit our lifestyles more than Winger or Poison or even Metallica or Slayer. So when it all exploded it was very surreal kind of like being in a dark room that was suddenly flooded with light  crowded with people. Seattles little secret was no more. So that fact then was hard to digest for me  now some 16 years later as Van Sant  this doc further explore  dig into Cobains life I just think to myself Jesus he wasn't that interesting at all. Why are we still talking about this man as if he were this enigmatic figure who changed the world? Im not going to attack the man but heres where my head is at he left his daughter to be raised by Courtney Love. This is a large part of what makes this country so sick. Your worshiping a dead junkie not some antihero who died for his beliefs. This isn't about art or fashion  im not trying to be an ahole but every time I see this woman benefit from this mans death or see another book another CD another movie I get very very sick to my stomach.

	schema:reviewBody "I thought this was an excellent little piece and this is some of the most honest portrayal of Kurt Cobain you'll ever hear on audio tapes of actual interviews conducted a year before his death. This is not your average documentary and you will not see any clips of Nirvana or really even any pictures or footage of Kurt at all except for a grand total of maybe 2 minutes of short footage of some photographs taken from a few live performances and a few photo shoots. Besides that it is nothing but locations relevant to his life in Washington mainly Aberdeen Olympia and Seattle the main places he's lived in in the 3 main periods of his life.I found this utterly fascinating and personally I loved the footage of city streets random everyday people from those cities that Kurt spent his life in gorgeous views of vistas cityscapes and other such eye candy to free your mind and let Kurt do all the talking. It never once gets boring despite a great deal of the footage being nothing interesting at all some parts showing a part of Washington state that is dull lifeless and depressing but ultimately it all shows insight into why Kurt became the person he became and gives you images to go with the subjects Kurt is speaking of. I really cannot agree with the negative reviews of this film and I loved it. I am a huge Nirvana fan and I find Kurt Cobain utterly fascinating granted but I am not a biased fan at all. This is a very very honest portrayal of Kurt Cobain. You might not even like him much when the movie is over. He can be quite depressing and a tragic figure to listen to but one thing is for sure he always had something interesting to say and never sugarcoated anything and always spoke from the heart. This is a true look at the real Kurt Cobain in his own words and for that I commend it highly. My only complaint is that I wish it could have been a bit longer and I wish that there could have been a more complete indepth analysis of his life as a lot of things were skipped over.".

I have to agree with other commentaries on this film... it is wonderful to have the audio tapes of Cobain but the film it a thin wrapping around this content. I wish Schnack would spend more time focusing upon his filmmaking than complaining about the state of documentary. One has to ask if it were not Cobain would this film get any notice. The answer is no. I found the camera work overwrought and trying. There is little to be said of the editing. As with too many docs it could do with some aggressive trimming and could lose 13 of the film without any loss to the story.".

	onyx:emotionText "For a filmmaker who touts craft so much he lacks it completely. He is great at selfpromoting his film but it is entirely empty. I have to agree with other commentaries on this film... it is wonderful to have the audio tapes of Cobain but the film it a thin wrapping around this content. I wish Schnack would spend more time focusing upon his filmmaking than complaining about the state of documentary. One has to ask if it were not Cobain would this film get any notice. The answer is no. I found the camera work overwrought and trying. There is little to be said of the editing. As with too many docs it could do with some aggressive trimming and could lose 13 of the film without any loss to the story.";

His involvement with his bandmates and how they got to where they got while dealing with personal issues. And his inner demons and what he is passionate about and etc. It's a fascinating and yet sad coverage of Kurt Cobain from his interviews. I just think instead of random pictures and video clips it could have had animation and digital animation with Kurt Cobain. If your a fan of Nirvana or Kurt Cobain this film is worth checking out. Just about everything when it comes to the interviews has been edited almost perfectly in a congruent manner. The main gripe I have about this movie is that you will probably be better off listening to a CD of this instead of watching a movie of the interview.610".

It started out with a lot of emotion but I spent basically the entire film wanting to see pictures and video of Kurt. Part of what makes this movie so artistic is the fact that there are none. You do however hear plenty of Cobain's voice not in music but in talking. About his life. You learn about his days as a rambunctious little kid and in elementary school to when his life started to suck. It's actually a very emotional film.When I first finished the movie I was depressed for a couple days because I had seriously considered suicide many times from the time I was seven or eight years old and I didn't like the movie. Over the next couple of days the movie really sank in and I realized what a great character Cobain was and what an artsy film Kurt Cobain About a Son is. It really gives you as much detail about Cobain's life as you could ask for. I'm not the first one to say this but it really does make you feel like you are Kurt Cobain. If you are into Nirvana or Kurt Cobain absolutely check this movie out. If you're not this 810 rating does not apply to you.".

Summer 1936  the Spanish Civil War outbursts  Madrid is besieged and there stands out the following slogan  They will not pass  Madrid to be the tomb of fascism. In Madrid the family formed by Don Luis Agustin Gonzalez  his wife Dolores Amparo Soler Leal married to producer Alfredo Matas and their children  Luisito and Manolita share the risked and troublesome lives along with the maid Patricia Adriani and neighbours Alicia Hermida  Guillermo Marin  among others . Luisito in spite of failing exam  he wishes yearning a cycle  but his daddy wants to buy it when the war situation gets better . However  the violent happenings force him to delay the purchase and the delay is too long  like the war itself . As the cruel war is lasting too much  as it is to last much longer than expected . Meanwhile  Luisito Gabino Diego aspires  not unlike his father  to be a writer . However  the war dashes these hopes and dreams and leaves him as the head of his family  having to abandon his education and childhood . In addition  the outspoken  aspiringactress Manolita Victoria Abril  like her brother  at the outset of the story her life seems full of promise . There also appears the neighbour Doa Antonia Alicia Hermida  at the beginning of the play she seems jealous of the other family's wealth  however  this soon changes and the two families come to rely on each other for food and support  she is very conservative and disapproves of Julio's love for Manolita . As Julio Carlos Tristancho is one of the sons of Don Luis's neighbour  Doa Antonia . Yet despite Julio's very traditional background he falls in love with Manolita . Although she does not return his affections  he asks to marry Manolita saying that he will love her and provide for her as he has a stable job .The movie  and the play it was drawn from  show how daily life of the middle and lower classes and how to be conducted during the war  including their strategies for survival  as well as citizens doomed to a life of subservience at the hands of the Franco regime . Unexpected things happen  but townsfolk find ways to survive . Above all  it is a story of survival and adaptation . Bicycles Are for the Summer is a Spanish play written by Fernando Fernn Gmez in 1982 that deals with the effects of Spanish Civil War on citizens of Madrid . It was released as a theatrical exhibition in the same year  and a popular film directed by Jaime Chvarri . The play was premiered with big hit in Teatro Espaol Madrid in 1982  with Agustn Gonzlez  Berta Riaza  Mara Luisa Ponte  Enriqueta Carballeira and this cinematographic rendition exhibited in 1984 with screenplay by Lola Maldonado  being efficiently produced by Alfredo Matas and compellingly directed by Jaime Chvarri who maintains only Agustn Gonzlez from the original theatrical  and adding Amparo Soler Leal  Victoria Abril and Gabino Diego among others . The agreeable cast is pretty good . Although mediocre acting by Gabino Diego  in his film debut  as Luisito who wants his father to buy him a bicycle  despite having failed his exams . Magnificent interpretation by Agustn Gonzlez as Don Luis who provides most of the comic relief in what would otherwise be a solely tragic story  he provides encouragement and optimism to his family and neighbours throughout the tale  despite the suffering they undergo . Ampro Soler Leal gives an excellent performance as Doa Dolores who is even more conservative than her liberal husband  whilst she is easily persuaded by her hubby  she often disapproves of the direction her daughter's career is taking at the beginning of the yarn and enjoys her traditional way of life . Alicia Hermida is very well as the really traditional and conservative neighbour as well as Don Simn finely played by veteran Guillermo Marn . Other actors who give brief but fine interpretations are the followings  Aurora Redondo  Emilio Gutirrez Caba  Patricia Adriani  Laura del Sol  Miguel Relln and Marina Saura. This motion picture was decently directed Jaime Chavarri . His first professional movie was Los Viajes Escolares 1974  with an autobiographical touch but it was misunderstood by most critics . Later he worked with the notorious producer 'Elas Querejeta' in prestigious documentary titled El Desencanto 1976 and Alfredo Matas in a successful costumer titled Bearn 1983  adapted from the novel by Lloren Vilallonga . With the last mentioned film he also had success in terms of the numbers who saw the film . He also directed intense dramas such as Dedicatoria and A un Dios Desconocido . To change the genre he also filmed the musical  Las Cosas del Querer 1989  being followed by Cosas Del Querer 2 1995  along with a Tango film as Tangos Are for Two . And adapted from the theatre play by Fernando Fernn Gmez in his most popular film titled Bicicletas Son Para Verano . His last picture was a biography about Camarn 2005 .".

Imagine my surprise when I watched it on video.  It was beautiful funny thoughtful smart and wonderful.  It brings the romance of the story fully to life and touches the heart.  Sure there are errors in history and anachronisms but it's a fairy tale.  King Arthur wouldn't have worn plate armor either.Drew Barrymore delivers her best performance ever.  The accent is a bit distracting but she is consistent with it unlike certain Robin Hood's I could name.  She delivers on the promise she demonstrated as a youngster and brings those Barrymore genes to life.  She handles the comedy as ably as the romance.  You laugh when she first hits the Prince with an apple pretty good shot too!. You ache for her as her world seems to fall apart when Prince Henry learns the truth.  You cheer when she renders justice to her oppressors.Dougray Scott is a fine handsome Prince a thinker as well as a fighter. His eyes are opened to the world he lives in by this passionate girl. Angelica Huston really adds the evil to the evil stepmother.  The rest of the supporting cast are uniformly great.The addition of Da Vinci if historically incorrect is a nice twist on the Fairy Godmother.  Who better to help a child of reason and enlightenment?This is a true romance a rare thing in today's movies including the socalled romantic comedies. It is a wonderful piece of work and a fine update to a classic tale.And they lived happily ever after indeed!".

No in this one there is naturally one horrid stepsister but the other is quite lovable. Dougray Scott is marvelously funny in his role as a Prince trying to find his way and Angelica Huston is a brilliant evil stepmother and Drew Barrymore makes a stunning Danielle...

Overall this is not so much a movie about the acting but it's more about the sometimes sappy usually saccharine but wonderfully heartfelt classic story.

	schema:reviewBody "Ever After is a wonderfully imaginative romance. It's a classic Cinderella tale set in 16thcentury France and revolves around an independent young woman named Danielle. Although she works as a servant for her stepmother Danielle is anything but weak and subservient. She is passionate and strongwilled qualities that lead her to the French court dressed as a wealthy courtier to save a man's life. There she meets the handsome Prince Henry who is jaded by his suffocating royal lifestyle. He is fascinated by Danielle and her thirst for life and adventure and they fall deeply in love  but her jealous stepmother will do anything to keep them apart.Drew Barrymore turns in a stunning performance as Danielle. Her emotions are raw and realistic and she gives the character charm wit and beauty.Anjelica Huston brings a third dimension to her role as the evil stepmother who is usually just portrayed as a flat character. In this movie she is an ambitious mother who would do anything to make her own daughter a queen.The Prince is also usually a pretty flat clich character but Dougray Scott brought a refreshingly human side to him and portrayed his struggles and conflicts very well.The script is strong for a romantic fairy tale and the cinematography is gorgeous. There is one scene in which Danielle is floating on her back in the river a dreamy and breathtaking moment that describes her carefree nature perfectly. The music composed by George Fenton is lovely  I recommend the soundtrack for this movie too especially Walking On Water.A wonderful movie for all lovers of romance! 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "I remember when this movie was released I saw it so many times in the theater with my friends. We were 13 perfect age group for the film and we adored everything about this movie. It's years later and I bought the movie on DVD making me wonder if the movie did hold up as well as I remembered. Well it doesn't hold the same magic as I saw when I was a kid but Ever After still holds a certain charm that is absolutely irresistible. I think between the writing and the characters this was a great update on a classic story. Every little girl has dreamed of being Cinderella the girl who has been dumped on her whole life and then the man of your dreams comes to save you as you live happily ever after. Drew Barrymore takes lead through this charming fairy tale of a strong woman with the good faith that one day things will go as they should and she'd live in a utopia.Danielle de Barbarac is a young girl who lives in a manor with her widowed father whom she adores. When Danielle is eight her father marries the haughty Baroness Rodmilla de Ghent who has two daughters about Danielle's age. Soon after Auguste dies. Rodmilla is envious of Danielle and treats her like a servant after Auguste's death. The Baroness has fallen into debt. Marguerite her spoiled older daughter has grown to be cruel arrogant and badtempered while the younger Jacqueline is kindhearted softspoken and constantly overlooked. In the orchard one day Danielle encounters a man attempting to steal her father's old horse. She pelts him with apples knocking him to the ground and is horrified to learn that the man is Henry the Prince of France. Henry explains that his own horse was lamed in his attempt to escape stifling royal life. He forgives Danielle in exchange for her silence and rewards her with money. Danielle resolves to use the money to rescue Maurice an old family servant whom Rodmilla had sold. While her stepfamily is out of the house Danielle dons a noblewoman's dress and goes to court. She finds Maurice about to be shipped to the Americas and demands his release. Prince Henry sees this and is impressed with Danielle's intellect strength of character and beauty. Danielle refuses to tell Henry her name though eventually she leaves him with the name of her mother Comtesse Nicole de Lancret. Leading him to want to speak with her more only to fall in love with her not knowing that she is a true Cinderella.I still like this movie very much. Drew and the other actors may not have a great accent but they still all tried their best. Angelica Huston what a great choice as the wicked step mother and I use that term lightly. There is this beautiful scene between her and Danielle she starts to tell Danielle about her father and how Angelica barely knew him you see a sense of humanity in her and then she starts to look at Danielle with love but realizes how hurt she still is that her father cared more for Danielle than his own wife. You understand how she could be angry and jealous not justifying what she did to Danielle but her motivation is understandable and I love the punishment she receives for what she did. There's still a scene that gets a great reaction from me when Marguerite just spitefully tells Danielle how her mother is dead and Danielle just goes up to her and gives her one hell of a punch I think that's when I fell in love with her! What strength was given to the character making the film more than just a happily ever after film but a wonderful fairy tale with enjoyable characters a wonderful romance humor and most of all leaves you with a smile on your face.810".

The thing that really made me want to see this movie is what Drew Barrymore said in one of her interviews..It's so wonderful because all girls love Cinderella. She is really a positive rolemodel. From everything to being fiercely loyal and incredibly smart and well read to not only not waiting to be rescued but to rescue other people to take the pain that she's experienced in her life to only have it strengthen her. And also the fact that her heart and her mind is what is attractive and intriguing to this wonderful prince and not the way she looks.Drew Barrymore played a great Cinderella..

I just love her charisma and charm. Unlike her girl next door norm she was very intriguing in this movie playing an independent strong headed feisty peasant is a sharp contrast to anything I've seen her in before.While this story is supposed to be a version of Cinderella it takes on twists of it's own. There is no fairy god mother. Instead there is a charming intellectual inventor Leonardo Da Vinci Patrick Godfrey. Rather than two hideous step sisters there is one awful yet beautiful sister and one plain but kind sister. It holds true to the peasant falling in love with royalty and the prince coming to save her but this story tells so much more. The king and queen were given personality and the story gives much insight to the untold story and challenges in the life of a Prince. It helps that Prince Henry is played by a very eye catching and witty actor Dougray Scott.Everyone loves a happy ending and this movie did not disappoint. The director built up the characters so well that you sob along with Danielle when Prince Henry pushes her away after learning the truth but then celebrate along with her when he comes to save her from the evil clutches of an adoring yet creepy wealthy man who purchases her from her step mother. As always Anjelica Houston played a wonderfully evil role and did it with class and maliciousness that only she could bring to the film.The writers producers directors and cast come together for the most triumphant Hollywood win since Casablanca. I have seen this movie a dozen times and I hope to watch it a dozen more. Two thumbs up doesn't seem to sum it up. I only wish I had more thumbs!".

You can feel the emotion and I even cried a few tears twice and I hardly cry for movies except The Horse Whisperer.  All the actors and actresses chosen for the cast were perfect fits.  Anjelica Huston makes a very believable evil step mother.  Dougray Scott is the perfect handsome prince and has the attitude yet sensitivity required for the role of Prince Henry.  Patrick Godfrey made a funny Leonardo and Melanie Lynskey was perfect for the role of Jacqueline the quite notsobad stepsister.  This however is probably more on the lines of a chick flick but it isn't one that you think of usually when you think of a chick flick.

	schema:headline " Two excellent actresses stuck in a mediocre empowerment fable";
	schema:reviewBody "I have absolutely no problem with a revisionist feminist retelling of the Cinderella story in which the heroine is a more assertive and selfreliant character  as long as it's well done.  The problem is that well done is not a phrase I would use with regard to Ever After.  I suppose it's an OK movie if you're a 13yearold girl but it is an insult to the intelligence of any adult viewer male or female.The movie is ALMOST worth seeing for the wonderful performances of the radiant Drew Barrymore as Danielle the Cinderella character and the deliciously wicked Anjelica Huston as the stepmother Baroness Rodmilla de Ghent.  Then again I saw it on cable and didn't even pay the price of the rental.  But these fine talents are wasted by an inane script with banal dialogue characters who are both improbable and trite and absolutely no sense of historical reality.I understand of course that this is not a historical film and is based on a fairy tale.  Yet the filmmakers chose to move it to a concrete setting in 16th Century France and to introduce such reallife characters as King Francois I and Leonardo da Vinci.  If they do that they should make at least a minimal effort to strive for some historical accuracy.  Yet the royal couple behaves more like modern uppermiddleclass American parents what we get here is a family with all the glamour of royalty and none of its class prejudices.  There's also a lot of confusion about the heroine's social status.  She is repeatedly described as a commoner yet her name is Danielle de Barberac the de is generally a signifier of nobility.  In fact normally under the laws of that time if the Baroness had married a commoner she would have assumed her husband's status and become a commoner herself and if Danielle was a commoner so was her father.I don't mind Cinderella being reinvented as feisty independent or educated. However when she is turned into an intellectual a champion of social justice AND an amateur athlete and swordwoman all wrapped into one ... well that's a bit much. SPOILERS AHEADI can accept the scene where Danielle rescues Prince Henry from the gypsies by hoisting him on her back and walking off after the gypsy leader promises that she can leave with anything she can carry.  In fact I don't know if the filmmakers knew this but this scene resembles an allegedly true story from the Middle Ages when a city was under siege by an enemy force and as part of the terms of surrender the leader of the enemy forces promised to let all the women leave town taking away anything they could carry.  The women walked out of the city carrying their husbands on their backs.On the other hand the scene where Danielle gets away from the evil aristocrat to whom the stepmother has sold her as a slave is simply laughable.  She holds a rapier to his throat forces him to hand over the key to the shackles he has put on her and simply walks out of his castle free as a bird.  How ridiculous.  The moment the rapier wasn't at his throat anymore he would have simply either run after her tackled her and thrown her to the ground or called his servants who would have grabbed her.  I guess it was so important to make sure that she wasn't rescued by the prince but rescued herself that reality could fall completely by the wayside.".

	onyx:emotionText "I have absolutely no problem with a revisionist feminist retelling of the Cinderella story in which the heroine is a more assertive and selfreliant character  as long as it's well done.  The problem is that well done is not a phrase I would use with regard to Ever After.  I suppose it's an OK movie if you're a 13yearold girl but it is an insult to the intelligence of any adult viewer male or female.The movie is ALMOST worth seeing for the wonderful performances of the radiant Drew Barrymore as Danielle the Cinderella character and the deliciously wicked Anjelica Huston as the stepmother Baroness Rodmilla de Ghent.  Then again I saw it on cable and didn't even pay the price of the rental.  But these fine talents are wasted by an inane script with banal dialogue characters who are both improbable and trite and absolutely no sense of historical reality.I understand of course that this is not a historical film and is based on a fairy tale.  Yet the filmmakers chose to move it to a concrete setting in 16th Century France and to introduce such reallife characters as King Francois I and Leonardo da Vinci.  If they do that they should make at least a minimal effort to strive for some historical accuracy.  Yet the royal couple behaves more like modern uppermiddleclass American parents what we get here is a family with all the glamour of royalty and none of its class prejudices.  There's also a lot of confusion about the heroine's social status.  She is repeatedly described as a commoner yet her name is Danielle de Barberac the de is generally a signifier of nobility.  In fact normally under the laws of that time if the Baroness had married a commoner she would have assumed her husband's status and become a commoner herself and if Danielle was a commoner so was her father.I don't mind Cinderella being reinvented as feisty independent or educated. However when she is turned into an intellectual a champion of social justice AND an amateur athlete and swordwoman all wrapped into one ... well that's a bit much. SPOILERS AHEADI can accept the scene where Danielle rescues Prince Henry from the gypsies by hoisting him on her back and walking off after the gypsy leader promises that she can leave with anything she can carry.  In fact I don't know if the filmmakers knew this but this scene resembles an allegedly true story from the Middle Ages when a city was under siege by an enemy force and as part of the terms of surrender the leader of the enemy forces promised to let all the women leave town taking away anything they could carry.  The women walked out of the city carrying their husbands on their backs.On the other hand the scene where Danielle gets away from the evil aristocrat to whom the stepmother has sold her as a slave is simply laughable.

Whereas the typical Cinderalla stories depend on magic  the glass slipper and the pumpkin etc  this version is based solidly in reality and it works very well.  Dougray Scott is fine as the Prince looking in the kingdom for a bride. This story is not historically correct but it is a movie isn't it.  A clever use of da Vinci with his inventions.I never thought Angelica Huston was particularly attractive and here she is perfect as the wicked stepmom. Jeroen Krabbe' is wellcast as the dad who dies right after the wedding.

I won't even get into picking apart the plot or the acting. My primary complaint similar to my beef with Titanic is how we view and more importantly  depict the past through the glasses of our own neuroses and prejudices.In Titanic the assumption was that for Rose to truly be free to be human or real she must spit over the side of the boat and engage in drunken revels while her fiancee goes to discuss politics over cigars. get it ooohh boring! Her fiancee was not a character but a caricature the donkey on which James Cameron could pin the tail so that all those in the audience could squeal. We collectively engaged in trashing the past while we the more enlightened ones sat in the theatre congratulating ourselves and willing Rose on to degrade herself in the back seat of a car.Now take Ever After. The Leonardo character was presented as such figures always are in popular cinema a harmless grandfatherly eccentric old artist. For eccentric read cute cuddly quirky the Barney the dinosaur element of his soul conquering the BotticelliDonatello aspect. He wasn't a great man he just knew how to paint real well. It was the Reader's Digest version of an artist. Emphasize what we have in common with the great souls what they liked to eat for breakfast. Democratize them make them harmless.Prince Henry I found even more pathetic. Sorry I really don't think he had the same need that we do in our industrialist era to make gooey distinctions between who he was and what he did. The line slight paraphrase? I want to be loved not for my position but for who I am almost had me wretching into my popcorn. Come on! I wouldn't want this guy ruling my nation. Maybe I'd let him work in the field where he could make helmets out of daisies and walk around in those boots that Leonardo made.I realize some of you are saying Hey it's a fairy tale! So? Even the serious historical films are doing this. And obviously we're not learning enough history to counterbalance the lessons we're getting from our forms of entertainment.

Its a fact that not all actors can be directors. Many of them need coaching to achieve a decent performance and Vardalos is definitely one of them. Probably the worst film of the year ...Avoid Avoid Avoid!!!".

What can I say if the movie's name is I Hate Valentine's Day well I hate I hate Valentine's Day. This is by far the corniest movie I ever seen in my life. Maybe women will enjoy all the cheesy situations the leading character has and experience throughout the movie but men like me will get bored from the very first minute of the movie. It is supposed to be a romantic comedy but there was no humor at any moment. Nia Vardalos has the leading role I don't what but she has something in her personality that really annoys mebesides that her character is already annoying too. John Corbett did a decent job. In conclusion I Hate Valentine's Day was a completely wast of time and money. A movie not worthy to see and if you still want to well you better wait for it on DVD.".

What can I say if the movie's name is I Hate Valentine's Day well I hate I hate Valentine's Day. This is by far the corniest movie I ever seen in my life. Maybe women will enjoy all the cheesy situations the leading character has and experience throughout the movie but men like me will get bored from the very first minute of the movie. It is supposed to be a romantic comedy but there was no humor at any moment. Nia Vardalos has the leading role I don't what but she has something in her personality that really annoys mebesides that her character is already annoying too. John Corbett did a decent job. In conclusion I Hate Valentine's Day was a completely wast of time and money. A movie not worthy to see and if you still want to well you better wait for it on DVD.";

It's why the movie feels so fake that and a serious lack of acting skills. Nia's immobile forehead and huge eyes and Stepfordesque unending warm smile made her look like she was on Xanax. John Corbett's forehead was almost as flat. Creepy. And yet the director was intently focusing on their faces for a large percentage of this film. The writing actually was standard romcom fare tolerable but only Jay O. Sanders as the floral delivery man showed his acting chops and came off as a real person. Yet even he was forced to participate in an eyeroll inducing 'goofy' 'romantic' ending that you would expect from this script. Every single other performance was wooden. The major disappointment was that this film was chock full of actual funny comedians being used for straight roles. Did not work. I had to write this review because I just got HBO and I'm the type of person who will watch a bad movie all the way through. I think it might be a disorder of some type.Anyhoo that movie was so bad and I was so angry with myself for watching all of it that I wanted some payback in the form of a silly negative review. That and I want to spare others the pain and anger that I felt when the credits started rolling. Lastly if you're going to write a clichd story of a woman who hides her abandonment issues behind layers of quirky eccentricity try to hire a really good writer who can convincingly work a clich into a story so that it's not so bloody obvious.".

Then you realize no these people are serious you just laughout of pity.

I will grant that he does play the romantic lead well. And some of the supporting characters are kindof cute and bring a little humor but that's just not enough to save the film. The main character's goofy smile throughout the film only adds to the absurdity. The plot is somewhat intriguing but also absurd and predictable. The writing is horrible the direction just as horrible and the list goes on.This movie is watchable only when you have absolutely nothing else to do when you just want to relax and not think for a minute or worry about anything. In that vein I guess it's a good escape. But don't expect to be moved or transformed. It's just not that kind of party. 3 out 10 only because I'm generous".

The main character's goofy smile throughout the film only adds to the absurdity. The plot is somewhat intriguing but also absurd and predictable. The writing is horrible the direction just as horrible and the list goes on.This movie is watchable only when you have absolutely nothing else to do when you just want to relax and not think for a minute or worry about anything. In that vein I guess it's a good escape. But don't expect to be moved or transformed. It's just not that kind of party. 3 out 10 only because I'm generous";

And yes these 40 yr old protagonists who acts immature and stupid at times but it didn't get to the point of it getting so very annoying. I personally think it's cause of the movie My Big Fat Greek Wedding which is probably a better romantic comedy that Genevieve Gernier is in is why this film is probably taking a lot of bashing for.

That's what's hard to say about this movie. Some parts of Awake are good but some are merely okay.Like many thrillers telling much about the plot defeats the purpose of seeing the movie. However I will tell as much as I can.The story goes like this. A rich young man named Clay Hayden Christensen goes into the hospital for a heart transplant and he suffers from anesthetic awareness meaning he can feel and hear everything but can't do anything about it. This is key because what he hears changes everything.That's about all I can say. Awake is an entertaining little thriller and Jody Harold certainly has potential as a writerdirector. His lowkey handling of the film makes for an interesting almost dreamy approach but I don't know if it works like it's supposed to because I have a feeling that it decreases the amount of suspense that the material warrants. That said the unusual tone makes up for this deficiency.The acting is solid too. Hayden Christensen became famous for his portrayal of Anakin Skywalker in the second and third Star Wars episodes. His first outing wasn't great and called into question his acting ability. However his second round with the light saber was terrific and his performance here shows that Episode 2 was more likely to be an anomaly than the norm when it comes to his acting ability. His costar Jessica Alba isn't as good but it proves that she has more acting ability than many people give her credit for her reputation for being a tabloid sensation and the limited acting options that result from it are probably to blame. Terrence Howard is solid but he isn't given much to work with. Same goes for Lena Olin.Personally I think it sucks when you like a movie but a lot of that feeling disappears when someone points out something that causes that to decrease. Such a thing happened with me and reading a review after watching Awake but I won't say it because it's still a good movie to see.So is Awake a good movie or just a movie with enough good points to warrant a viewing? I'd say it's somewhere in between leaning more towards good.".

The cast ill admit are not all top notch in the acting field but believe it or not work rather well. Terrence Howard is always good Jessica Alba actually turns in a very decent performance and Hayden Christensen is Annakin Skywalker as a billionaire. The movie is short and yet still does a pretty good job developing the characters. There are several twists and turns in this film some easy to see coming others surprising and some not necessary. But you should appreciate the attempt whether or not you saw it coming. The story goes that Hayden is a billionaire who buys and sells companies and also continues to assure people work in the city. He has a heart attack at a young age so must be placed on the list for a donor heart. His father died when he was young and he now takes care of his mother who does not want to let him go. He has been dating Alba for a year and still has not told his mother for fear she will not approve. Skip some things to not give away too much plot details and they find him a donor heart. Once in surgery they put him under for the transplant yet he can hear everything and feel everything that is happening to him while the surgery is going on. That is all I can give away. Please check this out if you can it is a good thriller and deserves a look. Im sure some will be disappointed but most should go into this and come out with a smile on their face.".

	schema:headline " Unexpected Awake";
	schema:reviewBody "Awake makes it crystal clear from the very beginning that 1 out of 300 people under anesthesia remains awake during surgeryan unfathomable outcome. Hayden Christensen plays Clay Beresford who discovers that he is awake during heart transplant surgery. Having an out of body experience he screams I am so fed! However Clay's conscious state is the least of his ensuing tragedy. In director and writer Joby Harold's unexpected Awake all is not at all what it seems in a surprising tale of love and betrayal. Hayden Christensen and Lena Olin are awesome and electrifying as they elevate Awake. Christensen proves that he was victim of the script writing in the Star Wars Episode movies. He is electrifying in Awake. Lena Olin who plays Clay's mother Lilith is amazing as she reveals her character's power. There is such grace and poignancy when her Lilith confesses to her son I am so proud of the man you have become Jessica Alba struggles here as Clay's wifehis Mother is unaware of their relationship and marriage. As Sam Alba plays a key pivotal role however does not yet possess the dramatic gravitas or depth to carry this off. Terrance Howard is strong as Clay's surgeon but his performance is flawed in its emotional ambiguity. For the most part these failings do not distract only because of the power of Christensen and Olin. Even with some of the narrative shortcomings I really applaud Awake for its story of love everlasting and acknowledging the greatness in others before it is too late.Hayden Christensen is Clay Beresford. He is a young brilliant and wealthy New York philanthropist. As successful as Clay has become he still thinks he pales in comparison to his late business mogul father Clay Sr. Clay's beautiful and protective mother Lilith relentlessly pushes her son toward greatness. We discover in a Japanese business conversation that Clay's heart is literally failinghe is a transplant candidate. Much to his mother's chagrin instead of choosing her world class heart surgeon friend Dr. Neyer Arliss Howard Clays has chosen his dear friend Dr. Jack Harper compassionate Terrance Howard for the critical procedure. Clay is loyal to Jack who first saved him from a heart attack. Unbeknownst to Lilith Clay is in relationship with Sam Alba and wishes to marry her which would inevitably enrage his mother. The melodrama eventually arrives at its tipping point Clay goes under the knife to receive his new heart. Remaining awake under anesthesia turns out to be the least of his worries. Here director and writer Joby imaginatively crafts his story and our consciousness.At less than an hour and 20 minutes the narrative is riveting with pathos and convolution before arriving at its affirming conclusion. Christensen is absolutely amazing. He displays a tangible humanity and disguises a quiet force and power. Lena Olin is phenomenal. She is rock solid as the Awake emotional anchor. Her dramatic turn is beguiling and touching. With the graphic open heart surgery sequences Awake may not be for everyone. Keep in mind that Awake is more than just its medical scenario. Awake is a moving story of love and greatness well worth a watch.".

	onyx:emotionText "Awake makes it crystal clear from the very beginning that 1 out of 300 people under anesthesia remains awake during surgeryan unfathomable outcome. Hayden Christensen plays Clay Beresford who discovers that he is awake during heart transplant surgery. Having an out of body experience he screams I am so fed! However Clay's conscious state is the least of his ensuing tragedy. In director and writer Joby Harold's unexpected Awake all is not at all what it seems in a surprising tale of love and betrayal. Hayden Christensen and Lena Olin are awesome and electrifying as they elevate Awake. Christensen proves that he was victim of the script writing in the Star Wars Episode movies. He is electrifying in Awake. Lena Olin who plays Clay's mother Lilith is amazing as she reveals her character's power. There is such grace and poignancy when her Lilith confesses to her son I am so proud of the man you have become Jessica Alba struggles here as Clay's wifehis Mother is unaware of their relationship and marriage. As Sam Alba plays a key pivotal role however does not yet possess the dramatic gravitas or depth to carry this off. Terrance Howard is strong as Clay's surgeon but his performance is flawed in its emotional ambiguity. For the most part these failings do not distract only because of the power of Christensen and Olin. Even with some of the narrative shortcomings I really applaud Awake for its story of love everlasting and acknowledging the greatness in others before it is too late.Hayden Christensen is Clay Beresford. He is a young brilliant and wealthy New York philanthropist. As successful as Clay has become he still thinks he pales in comparison to his late business mogul father Clay Sr. Clay's beautiful and protective mother Lilith relentlessly pushes her son toward greatness. We discover in a Japanese business conversation that Clay's heart is literally failinghe is a transplant candidate. Much to his mother's chagrin instead of choosing her world class heart surgeon friend Dr. Neyer Arliss Howard Clays has chosen his dear friend Dr. Jack Harper compassionate Terrance Howard for the critical procedure. Clay is loyal to Jack who first saved him from a heart attack. Unbeknownst to Lilith Clay is in relationship with Sam Alba and wishes to marry her which would inevitably enrage his mother. The melodrama eventually arrives at its tipping point Clay goes under the knife to receive his new heart. Remaining awake under anesthesia turns out to be the least of his worries. Here director and writer Joby imaginatively crafts his story and our consciousness.At less than an hour and 20 minutes the narrative is riveting with pathos and convolution before arriving at its affirming conclusion. Christensen is absolutely amazing. He displays a tangible humanity and disguises a quiet force and power. Lena Olin is phenomenal. She is rock solid as the Awake emotional anchor. Her dramatic turn is beguiling and touching. With the graphic open heart surgery sequences Awake may not be for everyone. Keep in mind that Awake is more than just its medical scenario. Awake is a moving story of love and greatness well worth a watch.";

I'm not sure I mean certainly the film has a few problems some of the moments didn't ring exactly true to me and the music was a touch maudlin at times. But when this film gets it right it gets it really right. I was on the edge of my seat from the second act on. It's the first film I've seen in awhile that manages to balance a genuine emotionality with a strong thriller aspect. Even Hayden Christensen who I think we all had our doubts about after Episodes IIII puts in a memorable and affecting performance. Definitely a film to see and a director I'll be keeping my eye on.".

	schema:reviewBody "What follows are 16 examples of absurd plot points 1 The film immediately makes a big deal about the family conglomerate's potential merger with a mobconnected Japanese company receiving world wide notoriety but then this point is completely abandoned. 2 Hayden the young heir to a gigantic business fortune is only 22. Too young for an MBA and probably just out of college. Yet he's got a major role running a huge company and making deals himself. 3 Hayden's heart is so bad that he learns his new heart is ready just before he's going to have honeymoon sex with Alba. Up to that point except for one wheezing incident on some steps Hayden sprightly bounds about looks 22 and rigorous and even looks great on the gurney going into the ER. Don't transplant candidates have a hard time breathing much less walking and much less contemplating sex? 4 Hayden's Mom is very beautiful but looks the 5052 years of age this website says she was when filmed born in '55. Yet a big deal is made about her having Haden extremely young so young they're more like friends than son and mother. An actress about 40 should have been cast. 5 The evil transplant team consists of just 3 surgeons is the Australian actress a doctor or a nurse? and a drunk anesthesiologist. Don't transplant teams have upwards of 10 professionals in the OR? 6 No hospital staff ever enters or checks on the OR during what is supposed to be a long transplant procedure. Where are the other staff and patients at this hospital? The hallways are deserted except during second Hayden's wanderings. Mom and Hayden's new evil bride sit alone for most of the time in the hospital's waiting room. 7 Hayden's announced goal for his conglomerate is to create more jobs as he proudly proclaims to Mom following that week's new acquisition. What rich entrepreneur ever wanted to create more jobs i.e. more overhead? 8 The evil transplant surgeon is being sued in 4 malpractice suits yet the hospital continues to allow him to freely operate even on a 22yearold Billionaire. 9 As seen in a photo on the evil surgeon's office wall evil Alba looks exactly like she did when she recently worked at that very hospital as a nurse but amazingly no one except maybe one doctor remotely recognizes her even though she spends hour after hour sitting in a public space in the waiting room. 10 Success for the evil conspiracy hinges on the completely farfetched scheme of convincing Hayden to use this muchsued surgeon Alba somehow getting a job as Mom's secretary and Alba marrying Hayden before the new heart is ready so that the evil surgeon can kill him on the OR table yet they have no control over when a new heart will be available. 11 The decision to marry Alba marrying her and receiving the notice of of the availability of the new heart all took place within a matter of hours way too short a time for Hayden to change his will not mentioned one way or another prior to her marrying him so for all she knows he's going to leave his fortune to the American Cat Society. 12 Mom makes a call to her friend the world's best heart surgeon just before killing herself so he can put her heart in Hayden. No indication whether anybody bothered to check if she'd be a suitable donor. 13 As his new wife evil Jessica would have had power of consent to take him off life support after the new heart failed but the movie gave that power to Mom and Jessica never objects. 14 The world's best heart surgeon somehow responds with his team about 5 minutes after receiving the call from nowdead Mom. His team is just about as tiny as the evil team but at least there's a nurse. This puny team by itself manages to prep dead Mom remove her heart and plop it into Hayden in record time. No wonder he's the world's best! 15 The world's best heart surgeon immediately figures out that the new heart failed because the evil surgeon injected it with poison when there are probably 10000 better and more obvious reasons. 16 The drunk anesthesiologist figures out the conspiracy despite never asking a question and not being present for much of the procedure and calls the police. Maybe the world's best heart surgeon also provided the police details he got from Mom. Unclear. Whatever even before Hayden is out of the OR with his newnew heart the police have all the facts and assemble a big team to arrest everyone at the hospital. 17 Sorry I just don't have the courage to address the ridiculous second Hayden and his many conversations with both alive and dead Mom.".

I also just hate to say it Jessica Alba is decent in the movie and covers herself well in her role as Sam. But the top performance of the film was without a doubt from Howard he was so convincing and almost made you feel bad for him well I don't want to give too much away you'll just have to see what I mean.

The most glaring error in this abomination of a movie is that the main plot point the guy being awake during the surgery had NOTHING to do with the outcome. It would have ended the same way regardless. So what was the point of this? Who knows. Also this surgeon had 4 malpractice suits against him and he didn't think people would ask questions if a patient died on his table? Give me a break. Jessica Alba is completely talentless and Christiansen is almost as bad. The whole thing was just laughable from start to finish. I'm fairly certain that if you could feel someone cutting through your chest with a scalpel you would be in more pain than that.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is the most ludicrous and laughable thriller I've ever seen. Oh....where to start....Plot what little there is Clayton Beresford Jr. Hayden Christensen a young billionaire with a bad heart is desperately in need of a transplant. Clay has been secretly engaged to his mother's PA Samantha played by Jessica Alba. On the night that these two secretly get married it just so happens that a heart donor with the same rare blood type is found. Go and figure the odds of that one! Once on the operating table Clay finds out the anesthesia isn't working and he can feel everything and hear everything.Fortunately Clay seems to be able to filter out the pain of a razor sharp scalpel cutting open his chest by simply concentrating on his memories of Samantha which we are told he's doing through an annoying voiceover which never seems to stop.If you didn't burst out in laughter yet you will surely start to when you see the surgical scenes. How could a young billionaire agree to have a heart transplant performed by one surgeon one nurse an attending physician and an drunk anesthesiologist? There were more people in the room when my wisdom tooth was getting pulled. Not to mention the medical behavior which is too preposterous to be taken seriously...the operating room isn't even kept sterile...people are practically able to just walk in and out of the room without even having washed up... During the operation the viewer gets to hear Clay's thoughts none of which are too fascinating. Ah...but here's what it's all about ...the doctors are trying to kill him in order to take his money. Believing him to be unconscious the villains speak freely. Gosh! What will happen? Well... at least there's no interference from anyone else in the hospital while an incompetent doctor who's got four malpractice lawsuits running against him is performing major heart surgery. Not even Clay's overprotective mother seems to be able to check on his status. The only one interested in keeping updated is Samantha...but oh no...could sweet Sam be in on it....You'll quickly find out through some Scooby Doo dialog...In the end it wouldn't even matter whether or not Clay underwent anesthesia awareness because the end would have turned out the same way in both cases.If you can ignore the feeling that the directorwriter is trying to make fun of the patients who fell victim to anesthesia awareness maybe there's some dumb fun to be had...Enjoy...".

	schema:reviewBody "I hadn't seen a trailer or heard anything about 'Awake' surely a talented writer must be able to come up with a better title so I didn't know what to expect. Luckily I didn't read the tag line as it spoils one of the major plot twists. If I'd known 'the big twist' beforehand I would've enjoyed this movie even less.The main problems with the movie the ones that irritated me the most were the following 1 The story was a total ripoff of a Stephen King short story which was based on a TVshow episode from Alfred Hitchcock. Both were better than this movie by the way. And neither of them is credited.2 The fact that he woke up during the surgery and could feel pain during the procedure has nothing to do with the outcome of the story at all. The writers just thought it was a cool plot device and it is...but it isn't used efficiently at all. What does it matter if he feels the procedure even if he didn't he still would've been killed if the doctor's plan would've been successful.3 The acting is  and I can say this is objective  terrible. I liked Christensen's performance in 'Shattered Glass' and hoped he would be on the way up but he's sunk lower than ever. Jessica Alba adds another crappy performance to her long list she almost managed to ruin Sin City for me even though she was smoking hot. When she was trying to be evil I'm surprised she didn't just lower one brow anything would've seemed more evil than her 'demonesque' performance lol. Terrence Howard is okay but not an Alist actor at all in my book. He delivers his line in a strange way I can not quite put my finger on it but his way of acting too is strange.4 The tag line on itself is worth mentioning because it's without a doubt one of the most poorly written ever. Every year one in 700 people wakes up during surgery. When they planned her husband's murder they never thought he'd be the one.first of all the 'every year' is pointless. Secondly the statistic is complete exaggeration and the ones who do 'wake up' almost never feel any pain the just hear the surgeons but are still completely under anesthetic. It's pretty horrible if it does actually happen but to make the audience think one in 700 is correct is just criminal. And last but not least...why reveal one of the main pretty good plot twists in the tag line. The twist was introduced early on in THE THIRD ACT. That's not something to put in a normally relatively spoilerfree tag line.5 Why did Alba's character try to kill Hayden? She was his wife so she'd get the money anyway at least half if she got a divorce. And why did the other doctors need to do it? Cardiologist is one of the best paying jobs ever not as much as top managers or so but still...VERY highpaying. The reason they give  malpractice lawsuits was not very convincing at all to me.6 The way they used the double entendres was clever one of the best things in the script but why show it all again in flashback. That's just so oldfashioned and just plain annoying. I guess they didn't quite have all the footage for their very long movie not even 90 minutes.7 I thought the way they pictured Death was quite comforting and nice but when he talks with his mother in the afterlife I almost shouted out in anger. Apparently it's really that hard to avoid clichs and terrible emotional scenes. Did not feel anything for those characters at all.Now what are the good points? Well I liked the way they started the awareness during surgery scene. The movie premise was okay and for me the movie was very promising in the first act despite some clich scenes. Then the movie develops into a very mediocre psychological drama. The fact that they took someone else's good idea and managed to ruin it with bad writing is why this movie deserves nothing more than a 5. It's not that bad I mean...some scenes are okay qua thrilllevel but this movie could and should have been a lot better.".

Overbearing woman named Lilith...subtle!The surgical scenes are not at all censored. I appreciated that people who find surgery scenes scary might not. The horror of being awake during anesthesia was done well at first. You watch in emotional agony as Christensen screams inwardly through the chest incision and the rib spreader. The moment of irony from the trailers then comes where while he is one of the unlucky few to be awake during anesthesia he is also luck in that it helps him learn that his surgical team is planning to murder him.The big twist however is very predictable and sends the film delving into the conspiracy and his memories of the little signs which were there but he like us initially missed. There are two more twists at the end involving his relationship with his mother. One is an impressive gesture by Olin which comes of as unimpressive due to poor writing. The other is a secret about the family's past which seemed very tacked on and pointless.The initially well done anesthesia awareness drama gets lost in the poorly written conspiracy drama.

	schema:headline " Wish I was asleep...";
	schema:reviewBody "I was wary about watching this movie ever since I found it it was starring Jessica Alba  Hayden Chrsitensen. Specifically more for Alba. The anesthesia awareness takes a back seat to tepid tension anyway. The anesthesia problem had no bearing or effect on the ultimate outcome of the movie would have happened regardless. In fact it's only use is to flash back to the same scenes we've already witnessed over and over again. The writers lack the storytelling skills to be innovative on revealing a dastardly plot and must rely on shoving the same scenes down your throat for you to pick up on something ain't right here.Hayden plays boy billionaire Clay Beresford Jr. Clay also has an undiagnosed generic movie heart condition that is apparently so severe he requires a heart transplant and is on the transplant list. He actually looks pretty damn good for someone who is sick enough to need a new heart. He walks around runs fishes conducts business and even has a healthy sex life. Absent are any signs of what someone might normally expect from a heart patient like cyanosis fatigue being bed ridden edema pale color breathing problems neigh for one scene that involves some slight asthma like wheezing. Clay seems nothing like a heart patient. I wonder did anyone do ANY medical research? The answer is a resounding NO as this is just the beginning of medical inaccuracy.Clay's surgeon Terrance Howard is confident about his ability to successfully transplant a new heart into him despite the fact that the guy has 4 medical malpractice suits against him both the hospital and Clay are dumb enough to let him operate.In a rapid succession of events Clay's relationship with Samantha Alba who is also his mother's personal assistantis revealed mother disapproves they get married and after healthy honey moon sex again for severe heart patient? his beeper goes off indicating a donor heart has been found.Once in the hospital in a final act of childish defiance Clay sticks to his malpractice ridden surgeon over the top heart surgeon in the country.The medical team assembled to transplant his heart is atrociously laughable...first off they have a room about the size of a broom closet no real equipment and there's a total of 4...yes count them....4 people conducting this delicate and life threatening surgery. Malpratice surgeon evil doctor and crooked nurse. And they're all out to kill Clay for his money neigh the Anasthesiologist who is a drunk complete with flask and a last minute replacement for the evil one. Turns out even Samantha is in on the kill Clay conspiracy as she is the one time nurse and lover of the evil surgeon. I always wondered...Clay is such good friends with this surgeon and despite his malpractice suits failed to notice the framed large photograph in this guys office which prominently features the evil team complete with a scrub clad Samantha in the foreground looking exactly the same way she does when they meet.Throughout the surgery the evil doctors and nurses come and go from the room take their masks off make phone calls fight with each other. the unsuspecting anesthesiologist actually leaves the room for a lengthly amount of time.

	onyx:emotionText "I was wary about watching this movie ever since I found it it was starring Jessica Alba  Hayden Chrsitensen. Specifically more for Alba. The anesthesia awareness takes a back seat to tepid tension anyway. The anesthesia problem had no bearing or effect on the ultimate outcome of the movie would have happened regardless. In fact it's only use is to flash back to the same scenes we've already witnessed over and over again. The writers lack the storytelling skills to be innovative on revealing a dastardly plot and must rely on shoving the same scenes down your throat for you to pick up on something ain't right here.Hayden plays boy billionaire Clay Beresford Jr. Clay also has an undiagnosed generic movie heart condition that is apparently so severe he requires a heart transplant and is on the transplant list. He actually looks pretty damn good for someone who is sick enough to need a new heart. He walks around runs fishes conducts business and even has a healthy sex life. Absent are any signs of what someone might normally expect from a heart patient like cyanosis fatigue being bed ridden edema pale color breathing problems neigh for one scene that involves some slight asthma like wheezing. Clay seems nothing like a heart patient. I wonder did anyone do ANY medical research? The answer is a resounding NO as this is just the beginning of medical inaccuracy.Clay's surgeon Terrance Howard is confident about his ability to successfully transplant a new heart into him despite the fact that the guy has 4 medical malpractice suits against him both the hospital and Clay are dumb enough to let him operate.In a rapid succession of events Clay's relationship with Samantha Alba who is also his mother's personal assistantis revealed mother disapproves they get married and after healthy honey moon sex again for severe heart patient? his beeper goes off indicating a donor heart has been found.Once in the hospital in a final act of childish defiance Clay sticks to his malpractice ridden surgeon over the top heart surgeon in the country.The medical team assembled to transplant his heart is atrociously laughable...first off they have a room about the size of a broom closet no real equipment and there's a total of 4...yes count them....4 people conducting this delicate and life threatening surgery. Malpratice surgeon evil doctor and crooked nurse. And they're all out to kill Clay for his money neigh the Anasthesiologist who is a drunk complete with flask and a last minute replacement for the evil one. Turns out even Samantha is in on the kill Clay conspiracy as she is the one time nurse and lover of the evil surgeon. I always wondered...Clay is such good friends with this surgeon and despite his malpractice suits failed to notice the framed large photograph in this guys office which prominently features the evil team complete with a scrub clad Samantha in the foreground looking exactly the same way she does when they meet.Throughout the surgery the evil doctors and nurses come and go from the room take their masks off make phone calls fight with each other. the unsuspecting anesthesiologist actually leaves the room for a lengthly amount of time. NONE of these things would be allowed by any real hospital. Even former nurse Samantha comes in at one point completely ungloved and injects some sort of a poison into the new heart to ensure he won't survive.

Maggie Gyllenhaal also shows up later on as Burt's zenlike cousin who takes family closeness to a whole new level i.e creepy. Mendes balances scenes like these perfectly with the richly written script.

There is a point where the interspersing of comedy and drama starts to get old but luckily a third act of genuine lessons and happy mediums lead to some of the movies best scenes.And these are starmaking turns from Krasinski and Rudolph. He has a doofy charm that gets a couple good laughs but he also makes Burt a loveably doting and comforting boyfriend there for Verona no matter what. And Rudolph is a big surprise here as she turns in a performance of maturity vulnerability and depth. This type of performance is a long way from SNL. They are for the most part the straightmen to the quirky characters and are called upon to spend most of the movie's runtime just talking and they gel so well with each other that you really don't even mind.

	schema:headline " Successful Detour for Director Mendes";
	schema:reviewBody "Just six months after introducing us to one of the most unlikable and miserable movie couples viewers had ever seen in Revolutionary Road director Sam Mendes takes us on a little detour from his usual stylegenre and allows us to meet one of the most likable onscreen pairings in recent years with Away We Go.TV's John Krasinski is the amiable goofball and insurancefutures' salesman Burt and SNL alum Maya Rudolph in a quietly revelatory performance built on her gift of perfectly timed facial expressions is his longtime girlfriend Verona who does illustrations for medical textbooks. Suddenly they find themselves pregnant and searching for a real home in this semiautobiographical tale from scribes Dave Eggers and Vendela Vida. The pair untethered to their current situations decide to travel all over North America visiting family and friends so that they might find that perfect spot to lay down roots. Fans of Eggers' books should be pleased that the screenplay is imbued with his popular brand of sharp humor mixed with diluted sentimentality. The tale of these two thirtysomethings trying to do the right thing not only for themselves but for their daughtertobe is filled with humor and warmth that allows us to relate to both the chaos around the characters and their desire to shield their baby from it.Under Mendes surprisingly laidback director's hand the material and the performances rise above the clichs of the she's having a baby! subgenre of dramedies while successfully interweaving elements of discovering yourself on a road trip indie flicks. Episodic and sometimes meandering in nature the film's acts range from laughoutloud hilarious including a scenestealing Allison Janney making a bid for worst mother of the year in grand comedic style to laughably absurd witness Maggie Gyllenhaal as a selfrighteous alternamom with an unfounded hatred towards strollers to unexpectedly poignant in an unexpected sidetrip to Miami to help Burt's brother through a crisis. You won't find any screamingly awful delivery room scenes here and while there is some semicrude sexual humor it's realitybased instead of raunchy and never overshadows the film's heart.As with any Mendes' production the cinematography this time from Ellen Kuras is artistically sound and serves as the perfect place for Mendes to paint his details. When the director uses a steady tracking shot moving through the passengers on a plane in midflight to focus in on the sun's hazy golden light coming through the windows highlighting the faces of our two stars sitting sidebyside you can see Burt and Verona unified in a yearning pensive loneliness that makes you instantly root for their success. The promise of that scene is wonderfully fulfilled in the closing act the details of which I will not divulge which is probably the most hopeful denouement  beautifully understated and with minimal dialogue  you will ever find in a Mendes' film. As with anything in life even in the most hopeful of atmospheres there is still some uncertainty but if we're lucky we'll see the talented Maya Rudolph in more lead roles and Sam Mendes will take time for more pleasant detours such as this.".

	schema:reviewBody "Away We Go 2009 directed by Sam Mendes is a road movie with a difference. Many road movies involve strangers met by the protagonist as he or she travels from place to place. Away We Go sends the two main characters into different locations but all the people they meet are people they already know or think they know.When Verona De Tessant Maya Rudolph learns that she is pregnant the question for her and her partner Burt John Krasinkski is Where do we live after the baby is born? To answer the question they travel from distant U.S. and Canadian city to distant city. Mostly what they find is disappointment and bad surprises.Lily Allison Janney a former boss and friend proves to be a dysfunctional person raising a dysfunctional family. A cousin LN Maggie Gyllenhaal gives new meaning to the words New Age. Verona's sister Grace Carmen Ejogo has her own problems and heartaches.There are jokes and laughs along the way but the trip gets more and more discouraging for them and us as the movie goes along. What saves Verona and Burt and the movie is the loving caring and realistic relationship between the couple. They're both interesting quirky and attractive people. We care for them and we want their quest to succeed.Both Janney and Gyllenhaal are outstandingas expectedalthough Mendes has portrayed both their characters in an exaggerated overthetop fashion. That's OKwe get the point and the movie is a work of fiction not a documentary.Maya Rudolph makes a smooth transition from TV SNL to film. She's not dropdead beautiful in the Hollywood style which makes her more attractive to me and more appropriate to the character she plays.Burt's character is more problematic. He's supposed to be someone who sells insurance to insurance companies but he looks and dresses more like an assistant manager at a fast food restaurant. He goes to a job interview dressed like someone who has picked out his clothing at a thrift shop. And given his moderate success in business and Verona's equally moderate success as a medical illustrator they're amazingly casual about spending money. Are they using their life's savings? All in all this is a movie worth seeing but not likely to be on anyone's list of alltime favorite movies. We saw it at the excellent Little Theatre in Rochester NY. It would also work well on DVD.".

The end of this film is unbelievably right given the nature of human experience and its relationship to the ideals that we construct in our heads.

We are bound to both love and art by a promise that we are pretty sure will be broken from time to time just like the promises that the two people in the movie make to each other. But as human beings we so much want the promise to come true that we will make it again and again. Whenever I watch a movie I renew my own type of promise one that I know will be broken or at least will never live up to my own expectations. The characters in this movie go through the process of being broken by love mostly through a sort of family and place Odyssey in order to realize that the promises we make to each other can only be broken if we want them to be. We can love each other until we stop believing and we can bring ourselves to watch a love story that keeps that same promise to the viewer. Sam Mendes has made the only romantic comedy he could ever make as a director one that respects the viewer as well as the characters.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you are thinking of having a child this movie might be for you. Maya Rudolph and John Krasinski play an unmarried couple in their thirties who discover they are going to be parents soon. Both actors do a good job giving their characters a quirky touch while at the same time keeping them realistic and likable. Especially Burt stands out with his spontaneous efforts to lift Verena's spirit. This is a strength of the movie  there's warm humor in a lively dialog that makes us smile and sometimes laugh out loud. But Away We Go also has a more serious note to it  rather than a comedy it is a reflection about the responsibilities we take when we decide to become parents the lifelong commitments we make and the fear of making mistakes.Sounds good you say then why only five stars out of ten? Well for one thing if you are not currently thinking of having a child the movie might not be able to keep you interested the whole way. Instead of a story told straight it's more like a journey through situations and feelings parents are likely to experience. Or maybe like a sneak preview of traps you might fall into being a parent if you don't watch out. Which might just be your cup of tea but then it might not be. Now the dialog  I mentioned it being a strength of this movie but at other times it is also a weakness. Imagine you are sitting somewhere with a friend and this married couple next to you starts sweettalking each other. Personally I feel this is a good time to turn to your mate and say hey how about another beer. Not only is it nice to give those guys some privacy and avoid the feeling of being an intruder. The truth is I simply do not care to hear all the lovenames they invented for each other nor the gentle promises they are whispering into each other's ears. Sadly turning away to your mate doesn't really work in theaters and beer is expensive. So here we are forced to sit through those awkward moments shuffling in our seats and waiting for the comic relief. Luckily the writers were smart enough to provide quite a lot of that. But more often than not it arrives painfully late.Towards the end there is a scene where all the do's and don'ts of being a good parent are reiterated as if to drive the point home with a sledge hammer. I can understand why other reviewers have scolded the main characters for being patronizing though to be fair I don't feel it actually permeates the movie. All in all I don't believe Sam Mendes' latest work will appeal to everyone simply because of its subject matter. It can be awkward to watch at times but it also has likable carefully drawn characters and a number of genuinely entertaining moments.".

	schema:reviewBody "I had heard good things about this movie and went into it with high hopes. Those hopes faded quickly. I love The Office. LOVE IT. But John Krasinski cannot act. I found that out when I watched Away We Go. I can only figure that John K. is Jim on The Office IRL and therefore that character requires no acting ability.The characters are supposed to be 33 and 34. Maya Rudolph looked 54 and John K. looked 24. It was really distracting. I don't know what the dumb getup John's character had onthe awful beard glasses from 1960 wild hair but he was not a hippiethe movie has fun with making fun of hippies later onwas about. Worst of all there is zero chemistry between these two. They were not believable as a couple. They may as well have been in separate rooms reading their lines to a wall as far as their acting abilities and chemistry went.

	onyx:emotionText "I had heard good things about this movie and went into it with high hopes. Those hopes faded quickly. I love The Office. LOVE IT. But John Krasinski cannot act. I found that out when I watched Away We Go. I can only figure that John K. is Jim on The Office IRL and therefore that character requires no acting ability.The characters are supposed to be 33 and 34. Maya Rudolph looked 54 and John K. looked 24. It was really distracting. I don't know what the dumb getup John's character had onthe awful beard glasses from 1960 wild hair but he was not a hippiethe movie has fun with making fun of hippies later onwas about. Worst of all there is zero chemistry between these two. They were not believable as a couple. They may as well have been in separate rooms reading their lines to a wall as far as their acting abilities and chemistry went.

	schema:reviewBody "The style of Away We Go very much reminded me of a late 1960searly 1970s film. I kept thinking of Harold and Maude or The Graduate where the lead characters learn about themselves as their relationships grow and change. There were some characters that were so despicable that they'll make you laugh and cringe at the same time. The disappointments were done in a comedic way so the movie never drags. There were introspective scenes along the journey where I thought a Cat Stevens song would start playing. The main couple travel to various cities to find the perfect place to raise their daughter and they meet an insane cast of characters along the way. These people remind me of people I've actually met in real life. A lot are parents with the best of intentions but what they are doing is just plain wrong.Maya Rudolph should be in more serious roles. She's an amazing actress. She gives a very genuine performance no overacting at all. As for John Krasinski he was very good too as the loving supportive boyfriend. There's a scene where he kept trying to say the right thing but it keeps coming out all wrong. I think any couple will be able to relate to it when they see the film.What makes this movie charming and deeper than a lot of romantic comedies is that you already have an established couple that's very much in love. This is usually where a romantic comedies ends but Away We Go probes the deeper question of what happens after you meet the person of your dreams. Away We Go completely avoids the clich of boy finds girl boy loses girl boy finds girl again.I thought the music was okay not the best but the two men I was with very much enjoyed it.I don't want to give away too much but if you like a quieter film with a tone like the other movies I mentioned you will enjoy this. If you're a looking for just a mindless roadtrip this is not the film for you.I just read an article that the screenwriters were influenced by early 1970s movies especially Hal Ashby who directed such classics as Being There and Harold and Maude. That explains why I kept thinking of Cat Stevens. If you go to the FilmInFocus website there's a 6 page interview with the screenwriters.Also there's a comment that the film glorifies animal cruelty. The dog races were chosen because it's the saddest place the screenwriters could imagine to do the scene in Arizona. The context in the movie was to show the misery of a place like that not glorify it at all.".

	schema:headline " Do the preggo shuffle  Away We Go";
	schema:reviewBody "I love Sam Mendes I'll say that now. What else do I love? Comedies with indie quirk. And that leads me to Away We Go a film that embodies the genre completely as evidenced by the trailer with its awkward laughs I stapled the itinerary to your coat? Really? and cool soundtrack I must have absolutely loved it  right? Wrong. I know I should I know that people all around me are showering it with praise but besides the final thirty minutes'Away to Montreal' 'Away to Miami' and 'Home'it is laboriously slow and uninteresting. Sure I laughed and stars John Krasinski and Maya Rudolph are fantastic it's just the story that never resonated with me. Until those last travels taking them places that included situations of true weight we mostly watch them reconnect with friends and family from the past to bring out some cheap laughs and a whole lot of uncomfortable. If you thought Allison Janney was quite the character in the trailer just wait until the crazy hijinks leave her mouth in unedited glory you may just change your mind.Burt and Verona Krasinski and Rudolph are a couple in their midthirties unmarried and pregnant with their first child. They have moved to Burt's hometown in order to be by his parents who have offered to help her folks passed on a decade earlier. Living in a trailer doing mostly freelance work and declaring their love for each other every second of the daythey are quite the cute couplethe idea that they have gone astray in life becomes one that sets them on a cross country journey to find a new place to call home. The fact that the two people they thought they could count on moving to Antwerp for two years definitely expedited that decision. So they are off to Phoenix Tucson Madison and Montreal to see where is best to raise their unborn daughter all locales with people they know an already active support group to help jumpstart their new life. The film is not about the baby though nor how the two try to learn how to be good parents despite the plethora of parenting advice thrown their way. Instead it is a tale about two lost souls that have each other with no other ties tethering them anywhere. It's a journey for them to discover that home is wherever the other is none of the other static means a thing.Like any cathartic spiritual journey there must be a series of stops along the way showing them how bad life can be with wrong decisions and lies. There is the couple that doesn't really love each other an indifferent malaise that has trickled down to their children parents that have the opportunity to be selfish and finally live for themselves no matter if their grandchild will be born the month after a kooky family following the three S's in life resulting in a hippy lifestyle that makes them so selfimportant and bourgeois despite hating all that that label brings with it and a pair of old college friends unable to conceive with a slew of adopted kids in a loving and censored lifestyle. A lot of the antics dealing with these clichs bring some solid humor but even more supply forced situations that lead nowhere except for empty laughs leaving an unsatisfying taste in your mouth. Maggie Gyllenhaal's LN yes that's her name and Josh Hamilton's Roderick and so overwritten and stereotypical that I wondered why it took so long for our heroes to realize how vapid they were. And what is with the fiveyearold breastfeeding? Talk about unnecessary shock value. I did like the stroller bit at the end of the sequence however so it wasn't all bad.Kudos to Rudolph and Krasinski for really breathing some life in their roles though embodying the affliction that is the thirtysomething crisis of being an adult. They react to the situations thrown their way with consistency to character and end up in the place they had been working towards all along. Why they had to endure so much overwrought comedy before reaching that point I do not know especially since the trip to Montreal and unfortunate visit to Miami are all that were needed to get them opened up to where they end. Maybe Verona's sister played by Carmen Ejogo helps the cause too but no one else. All others become filler to pad out the story and trick the audience into thinking something relevant occurred since they laughed.Miami contained the phenomenal Paul Schneider with virtually an extended monologue about how his wife has changed their family's lives forever. It's a strong performance that shows Krasinski what it means to be a parent and how having his girlfriend by his side is the most important thing to him. As for Montreal the Garnetts Chris Messina and Melanie Lynskey expose our leads to the fragility of existence and the many definitions of what family is. In a very touching scene moreso because of its amateur night poledancing locale we get two powerful performances and a nice metaphor comparing love with syrup. After our introduction to the Garnetts the end result surprises a bit but with total clarity and understanding of where they are coming from. And the final segment 'Home' is just the perfect bookend to the tale leading the soontobe parents and us to paradise. Why oh why did this final third have to be attached to such trite frivolity?".

They moved near Burt's parents Jeff Daniels and Catherine O'Hara because they wanted to give their child loving relatives in close proximity. Now however Burt's mom and dad announce that they are fulfilling a lifelong dream of moving to Belgium where they will be for the next two years. Huh. It does not appear that they are thinking of the coming granddaughter only of themselves. This throws Burt and Verona into a frenzy of activity for they want to select another locale to call home near friends or relatives and there isn't much time. Over the course of the next few weeks the young couple travel to Arizona Wisconsin Montreal and Florida in search of a new place to put down roots. Along the way the pregnant twosome meet up with a bizarre friend Allison Janney an adopted cousin Maggie Gyllenhaal and other pals and relations. Will they find the perfect place to raise their daughter? After viewing this winning movie no one can ever say that Sam Mendes does not have a softer side which to be honest was fairly absent in his works such as American Beauty or Revolutionary Road. In fact although Mendes is still wonderful at showing the idiosyncrasies and flaws in the lives of average Americans this film's sweetness is its core asset. The cast is great with Krasinski and Rudolph near perfect as the loving couple while Janney Daniels O'Hara and all of the lesser known cast members do a great job as well. Gyllenhaal deserves special mention for she looks sensational and is a scream as the new age type mother. Naturally it is quite beautiful to go from one splendid venue to the next and the costumes are lovely as well especially Rudolph's maternity wardrobe. As for the script it is stylish imaginative and very funny. If you love exceptional movies that more closely resemble coq au vin than meatloaf in the world of films here is one definitely for you to savor. .".

	schema:headline " Solid indie romcom";
	schema:reviewBody "I think I can honestly say that I like Sam Mendes. His films seem to gun above all else for a place of timeless emotional resonance even when that timelessness eludes the films themselves and usually succeed even within the more confined quarters of their respective settings whether the wargutted landscape of Jarhead or the 30s era noir of Road To Perdition. Although the critically loved American Beauty loses alarming shades of impact for me with each viewing due to its flawed philosophical stabs toward truth Mendes still manages to provoke a contemplative mindset out of his audience. His films operate well on that level even when they fall short in their personal declarations. Away We Go is Mendes' warmest film to date taking on a tone of humor and lightness that none of his other works approached without a biting irony to match. Bert The Office's John Krasinsky and Verona SNL's Maya Rudolph are a young couple expecting their first child. They occupy a ramshackle trailer in Colorado near where Bert's parents Jeff Daniels and Catherine O' Hara live. Bert and Verona's reasons to remain in the area fall apart quickly when his parents decide to immediately move to France for a couple years despite hearing the news of their coming grandchild. With that incentive now gone the couple embarks on a road trip around the continental U.S. to reunite with old friends and look for a new place to call home. With each stop through each encounter with estranged family and past friends they find unsurety in their future as well as deepening layers in their relationship. I've read a couple accounts that criticize the clashes between the poignancy and humor in Away We Go and to a certain extent I would have to agree. There is definitely a clumsily staggered rhythm at certain points in the story but overall I'd say that the heart of the insights and conflict overcomes the erraticism of the pace. There is some great chemistry between Krasinsky and Rudolph and the talent the aforementioned Daniels and O' Hara Jim Gaffigan Allison Janney Paul Schneider and Maggie Gyllenhaal among the rest of the supporting ensemble create convincing foils and compliments to Bert and Verona's journey. The direction is solid and the screenplay by first time screenwriters novelist husbandandwife team Vandela Vida and Dave Eggers is sharp hilarious and mostly consistent with its narrative. There's really nothing to keep me from recommending Away We Go. It's got an infectious vibe to it and while it may be incongruent at times and perhaps ride the JunoLittle Miss SunshineJunebug wave a little hard it still remains enjoyable and heartfelt.".

I walked out of this movie with a smile on my face and a heart eager to fall in love as deeply as they did. The film begins with a pregnant couple and ends with a pregnant couple. The couple themselves grow in love while going through vastly different couples way of looking at love and parenting. This film reminded me of why if fell in love with movies in the first place. The movie has a general feel like juno a few tearjerking moments and a couple laugh out loud moments and a ton of touching moments. When i saw this movie everyone laughed at the right time and everyone cried at the right times. The entire audience loved this movie and so did i. I Highly recommend this movie.".

About 23 of the way into the movie I found myself wondering what the point of the film was. It seemed like a series of disconnected vignettes that did not form any sort of coherent story. The individual pieces were OK on their own but they did not work well together.I also found myself having no sympathy for the characters. There was nothing in the film to make me identify with them or care about their plight. All of the themes were forced down the viewers throats and many of the gags were blatantly foreshadowed. The plot points were weak if at all present. Sprinkle in secondary characters that were so over the top and you end with a disaster of a film. Even my wife thought it was depressing.I am glad it was a free screening I would rate this as one of the worst movies I have seen in the last 5 years. Even Rolling Vengeance was better than this.".

They thought their life was going great until they found out that Burt's parents were leaving the country for two years and would not be there for the birth of their grandchild. Verona and Burt decide to go on a road trip and travel around the U.S and Canada to find the perfect place to live to call home and bring up their child. They travel to Phoenix Tucson Madison Montreal and Miami where they either have relatives or friends living. Along the way they are also looking for the perfect family as a role model for them to follow in raising their daughter. As with all new families they discover their own way.My Comment With each stop on their trip they encounter their unsure future at being parents. As they travel around the country in search of a supporting family member former coworkers or college friend what they expected usually turns out differently. They are more confused than before and see how difficult life is in raising a child. In the end they discover that they're not losers after all. The film delivers a good mix of hilarious comedy and human drama. Especially the scene about the fruity taste is something you will never forget. There are plenty of funny scenes but there are also some serious introspective moments as well. The movie doesn't offer any solutions to life except that you are on your own and that is the way it should be. The character development was good because you feel for them and you want them to succeed. In the end they learn more about themselves as their love and their baby grows. I think any young couple can relate to this movie. Focus Features Run Time 138 Rated R 610".

	schema:reviewBody "It's always great to see good directors develop and go in different directions. Just in the past few years I've seen some of my favourite directors evolve and direct works that are quite uncharacteristic of their previously established styles be it David Fincher with his emotional and romantic The Curious Case of Benjamin Button or Paul Thomas Anderson with his monumental character study There Will Be Blood. Sam Mendes one of the most fascinating and talented directors working today has so far delivered four very precise calculated ambitious and largescale films which is why it was interesting to discover that he of all directors was behind a quirky lax unhinged indie dramedy.Actually after watching the film Mendes' style is quite noticeable. Although it's a very loose and smallscale human comedy the film's aesthetic is still very formal featuring symmetrical compositions and fluid camera movements. The lighting is top notch and in general it's an indie film that has a very highquality look clearly Mendes' stamp. Mendes is a very interesting director in that sense because despite his being one of the most visually striking and prominent directors working today with his last four films being among the most gorgeouslooking films in recent memory his origins are on the stage and that background is actually very prominent in this film.Plotwise this film tells a story that we have all seen before  the road trip movie. Specifically it's a film about unconfident people going out on the road in order to discover themselves. And yet screenwriters and novelists Dave Eggers and Vendela Vida manage to craft unique and identifiable characters and through their journey create what is essentially a parable about relationships and selfdiscovery. The main couple is expertly played by John Krasinski and Maya Rudolph who really play against type Krasinski is known as the quiet and awkward Jim on The Office while in this film he is very confident outgoing and funny Rudolph on the other hand is known for her outrageous roles on Saturday Night Live while in this film she plays a more mellow and peaceful character. The story establishes a series of supporting characters who are also expertly played by a very impressive supporting cast Maggie Gyllenhaal and Allison Janney particularly stand out as friends of Krasinski and Rudolph respectively who provide very opposite views about life and longterm relationships.Ultimately this is a fun wellmade enjoyable quirky little indie film it's funny and charming and lighthearted while also delivering an interesting and thoughtprovoking parable about marriage longterm relationships life and the various approaches couples have to all those things. That said I think that the film might even be too quirky and precious for its own good these elements that often lead to such fantastic films as Little Miss Sunshine or Juno to get derided by the cynics don't often bother me but in this film I think that it's preciousness kind of takes away from the audience's connection with the characters. I can't quite put my finger on it but all I know is that while the film is good I felt a much stronger connection with the characters in another indie film from this year 500 Days of Summer.".

	schema:reviewBody "The ramshackle tone and episodic structure of this 2009 road dramedy doesn't scream Sam Mendes American Beauty Revolutionary Road to me but his filmmaking style becomes more discerning as the journey of the two protagonists deepens emotionally with each succeeding stop in their journey. Written by married authors and firsttime screenwriters Dave Eggers and Vendela Vida he owns 826 Valencia the pirate storewriting workshop in San Francisco the storyline focuses on Burt and Verona a pair of thirtysomethings who seem to recognize their lost years of relative aimlessness are about to close with the birth of a baby. They look to be living comfortably he's a bellowing insurance salesman she's a medical reference illustrator albeit in a rundown home close to his parents in Denver. When Burt's selfabsorbed parents announce abruptly that they are moving to Antwerp before Verona's due date the young couple recognizes an opportunity to travel crosscountry to find a place they can settle down and start to develop roots.Burt and Verona first journey to Phoenix and visit her former boss Lily an acidtongued harridan and her defeated husband Lowell. One can only assume Lily has changed considerably since working with Verona as I'm not clear why they would be drawn to such an unfiltered alcoholic mess of a wife and mother. The couple immediately move on to nearby Tucson where Verona's younger sister Grace lives and through their mutual memories of their deceased parents we begin to understand Verona's hesitancy to marry. Burt and Verona then move on to Madison to meet his childhood friend Ellen who has transformed into a smarmy New Age narcissist under the guise of a college professor who dubs herself LN. The polarizing effect of her parenting skills pushes the young couple to Montreal where they reunite with seemingly contented college friends Tom and Munch who have a rainbow tribe of children but slowly reveal a deep sense of melancholy over their existence. Their nexttolast stop is Miami to visit Burt's brother Courtney. His wife just left him and he can't build the courage to tell his young daughter.Relatable performances are crucial to this sort of characterdriven venture and fortunately the leads score on that front. John Krasinski Jim on the US version of The Office is constantly upbeat as Burt but he brings subtle shades of poignancy and resignation to avoid coming across as obnoxious. As Verona Maya Rudolph makes a strong career transition from SNL sketch comic to straight actress bringing a counterbalance of gravity and insecurity to the relationship. In the absence of manufactured friction their comfortable interplay holds our interest while their journey evolves with unexpected turns until they find a deeper level of commitment on a trampoline. Surrounding them is a stellar cast of scenestealers a shrewish Catherine O'Hara and an avuncular Jeff Daniels as Burt's clueless parents Allison Janney superbly inappropriate as Lily comedian Jim Gaffigan looking forlorn and medicated as Lowell and Maggie Gyllenhaal hilariously hateful as LN especially as she explains her progressive views on nursing and avoiding strollers. Comparatively subtle work comes from Carmen Ejogo as supportive sister Grace Chris Messina and Melanie Lynskey quietly agonizing as the Montreal couple and Paul Schneider as Courtney. It's good to see Mendes pull off a film that isn't defined as much by dark characters and polished production values. The change has really done him good.".

Using historic footage the film looks at the evolution of American music and the artists who created it and pulls back the curtain in a very creative way to expose the sad truth behind today's artificial music stars. The reality is that superficiality is in says Marsalis. And depth and quality is kind of out. Inspired by the death of his brother director Andrew Shapter and his crew traveled thousands of miles visiting dozens of cities speaking with hundreds of fans journalists record executives and musicians while searching for real American music. What they found were megatalents without a major label including one artist Eric Clapton believes is the real thing.";

Those are the two things that're wrong with the music industry.

After watching this I realized I really didn't learn anything with the exception of being exposed to some artists I had never heard of.Before the Music Dies starts off as a narrative explaining how a death in the family led to the narrator's search to find what's wrong with today's music industry. That's where the narration ends from that point on the movie becomes a series of clips and artistexecutivefan commentary.The film then proceeds to waste your time with a dozen commentators who all seem to agree on everything. Executives care about money not art. Executives care about money not art. Executives care about money not art. Over and over and over they drill that in to your head in case you didn't know already. Repeatedly telling us how bad record executives are is harmless enough even if tedious but the film becomes simply dishonest when it raves about the greatness of record executives in the past. When a commentator bluntly states that When Stevie Wonder wants to make a record he makes a record it makes you wonder if he or the director do any research into Motown and their factorylike operation of churning out hits before butchering history.Besides the fact that the film barely scratches the surface of why we have such bad music today it actually doesn't really discuss today's music. Hip Hop is barely mentioned and never discussed. Instead of taking a serious look at today's music the film takes cheap shots at Ashley Simpson to represent everything that's wrong with music today.The film tries to end with a positive outlook for the future citing the rise of Napster and the internet as music's salvation. Though the fact that Napster was a good 5 years before Ashlee Simpson's time this salvation doesn't appear to be well thought out.So what else are we to do? In one of the most cheesy endings to anything ever the narrator comes back to make a plea that we teach the children about Pink Floyd and The Who.On the positive side Erykah Badu was pretty funny and the performances were pretty fun.".

There are some pretty harsh yet funny comments from the cast which includes Eric Clapton Erykah Badu Elvis Costello Dave Matthews and Bonnie Raitt. Various topics from downloading songs to live shows are discussed and while the documentary doesn't say anything we don't already know it does manage to be entertaining from start to finish.".

Which is only one of two places it could end up. You either love it or despise it I can't imagine there being a middle ground for anyone.  You could write an entire review which I probably will moreso on the type of humor in the film than the actual film content itself.  Well here I'll try anyway.  Belushi is a confident expertly trained CIA agent who knows all the right moves.  Ritter is a lookalike of a dead agent who the CIA needs to help deliver a message to aliens see here we go.  Belushi pseudokidnapps Ritter to go along with the mission which is where the laughs really began for me.  Ritter's angry resistance is so hilarious and Belushi's sauveness is extremely catchy.  The film then turns into a road movie with Ritter going through a transformation from the wuss to a more confidant guy.  The fever pitch of the film is the much mentioned clown fight with a classic line from Belushi of No hittin' in the nts allright? then BANG he delivers a foot to a clowns groin.  Belushi starts to go a little soft toward the end and it's up to Ritter to you ready for another one deliver a glass of water to an alienhuman in exchange for the secret to a better earth.  Now in just those few examples you can tell if you'd be in for the whole ride or not.  As it is it's only 85 minutes and was released to if it was lucky a hundred theaters.  I didn't even mention Belushi swinging from a balcony by his shoelace! or the moment he feels up his FATHER.  Something must be said as well for the music which is itself too funnystupid an oddball mix of southern violin work and Italian mob music.  The tone is set early so you are at least prepared for what you're in for.  An absolutely dopey silly comedy that may just hit you the right way.".

The tone is set early so you are at least prepared for what you're in for.  An absolutely dopey silly comedy that may just hit you the right way.";

Friday 2000 Washington D.C. is the rendezvous. The fate of the world revolves around that date and place. Nick is forced to recruit a timid insurance salesman lookalike Bob Wilson John Ritter and drive cross country to the destination.This is mostly a buddy picture in which each of our protagonists learn something from the other and they bond. Nick becomes more sensitive and Bob becomes tougher.This is not a great movie but ever since I saw this movie on HBO during the 80's its just stayed with me. Its fun and it moves quickly. This soundtrack is also pretty good catchy. If you like movies like Shanghai Noon Rush Hour 1  2 then you'll like this movie. It has a nice mix of action and comedy.Some of my favorite scenes  Nick's Macguyverlike nail gun creation his shoelace Tarzan impression and the bad clown attack. One of the most interesting aspects of this movie is that Ilsa Shewolf of the SS is Nick's dad.Celluloid Rehab".

Not much publicity will happen if the YUFO'S don't have the glass. I figured this was the biggest 'goof' because it was a messup in the allaround plot of the movie.One of my favorite flicks by the way. Not known NEARLY as widely as it deserves to be. John Ritter's acting is amazing. Belushi is at his best. Also I find it brilliant that they had Dyanne Thorne from the Isla movies play Belushi's sexchanged warveteran dad. So funny.My favorite line is probably after the Russian negotiator calls Bob a Poor Slovnichski along those lines when Nick asks her what kind of position to expect in the KGB if he gives up the map and the negotiator replies Colonel. then Bob butts in No way! Nuhuh. That's a dealbreaker! No. Forget it. The deal is off. Take a WALKski! I bust a gut every time.".

It seemed to start off OK but within maybe 2 or 3 minutes it just fell completely flat. It tries to be funny through absurdity which can work out just fine if you do it well but in this case it was just unbelievably lame. The story simply wasn't funny it was just dumb. They tried to add some direct humor with jokes and setups but they were even dumber. So we end up with a continual stream of horribly telegraphed jokes none of which were funny even if we didn't see them coming. And to add to the insult the delivery and timing was all over the place.I have to agree with the other reviewer in that Ritter can be underappreciated but even though he actually seemed to be trying unlike Belushi who couldn't be bothered nothing could possibly save this movie. It's simply so stupid that I couldn't help feeling the joke was on me that some jaded burnedout exec in Hollywood was laughing at MY stupidity for thinking that a movie with two stars couldn't be THAT bad.

I can only surmise that the writers who worked on this film faced with a creativity crisis  you know one of those dark moments of writer's block  must have solved the creativity problem by consuming a few deep hits of laughing gas and this movie is what resulted. Unlike Bill they DID inhale.I've seen this movie several times over the years and I somehow always find myself enjoying the comedy in it though I find it the comedy really rather hard to define. It's not really a Laughyerbuttoff kind of slapstick humor though there is a goodly amount of slapstick in it. It's not really a Laughatthefunnylines sort of humor though again both Ritter and Belushi do have some very funny lines in it.I think it's one of those movies that you must approach much as you do say a Monty Python film you need to be in that frame of mind you need to straight away drop some of your defenses and your preconceived notions of what constitutes funny. Otherwise this movie will quickly leave you thoroughly unamused by the side of the road as it continues along its merry twisted path. By the time the clown scene comes well you will not find it funny at all. By then you would probably get more comedic value out of switching the TV channel to Bill O'Reilly or Neil Cavuto.What makes Real Men work for me is the combination of the bizarre almost Twilight Zonelike storyline and the excellent chemistry between John Ritter and James Belushi. The story premise is SO implausibly dumb it just constantly makes me laugh as the movie unfolds. Combine that with the acting and antics of Ritter and Belushi which are just spoton smooth as silk and the whole thing just makes for compelling watching. As mentioned the two leads have good lines but I think their body language and facial expressions say as much in this movie perhaps more than the spoken word.So drop some of your defensive shields get in a suitably zany mood and watch this movie. REALLY watch it looking at some of the physical humor the quirks of facial expressions listening for some of the double entendres etc. Then you might love this movie as I do.".

REALLY watch it looking at some of the physical humor the quirks of facial expressions listening for some of the double entendres etc. Then you might love this movie as I do.";

Some viewers may grow weary of it all and have thoughts such as What were they thinking?.The capable comic actors in the leads do their best with basically third rate material. Belushi and Ritter are well cast and they do have their moments. Ritter once again proves himself adept at physical humour.

	schema:reviewBody "Axel Munthe  Der Arzt von San Michele or Story of San Michele or Das Buch von San Michele is a coproduction between France Italy and West German that resulted in a Germanlanguage 2hour movie from 1962 so this movie is already way over 50 years old. This also becomes obvious from the inclusion of actor O.W. Fischer who plays the title character. The Austrian actor was certainly very established at that point and had won many awards that qualified him as one of the German acting elite back then. Heinz Erhardt and Ilja Richter for example are also in here and Germans probably still know these today. There may be other actors and actresses in the cast familiar to audiences that have seen a lot of stuff probably especially Italians. But these names weren't good enough to make the film work I guess. It is based on the real autobiography by Munthe but looking at how many people worked on this one behind the camera directing and writing I find it a bit shocking how weak this film turned out. I think this couldshould have been much much better with the cast they had at their disposal. The good thing is that it is a color film despite the age maybe a bad thing for some also I like that. But even the somewhat modern look did not keep it from being a disappointment. I don't know who Alex Munthe is but I cannot say at all that the movie got me curious about him or his life and achievements which is admittedly always a dealbreaker when it comes to films with so much focus on the lives of main characters really existing main character even if Munthe was already dead when the film came out. So yeah I personally think this one we have here drags a lot on several occasions and it definitely could have needed more focus maybe at 9095 minutes max. the performances are sometimes good sometimes forgettable but nothing stays too memorable either and it's probably not one of Fischer's best I have seen so far and I ave seen a bit. I give this one a thumbsdown. Maybe the best aspect is the visual side. It is certainly not the story and you should watch something else instead.".

It's not very often humour and genuine scifi have been balanced so expertly. But thankfully like Family Guy before it Futurama has now been given a new lease of life in the form of 4 direct to DVD movies to be split into 16 episodes to make up a new season. When something this great is brought back there is always the lingering fear that it won't retain the magic of the original. But I can confidently say that the magic is back! When Family Guy released Stewie Griffin The Untold Story I feel it suffered the problem of seeming too much like an overlong episode a problem I think that the Simpson's movie also suffered though both were not without their fair share of laughs. HoweverBenders Big Score the first of these new Futurama features FEELS like a movie. I feel it should appeal to old fans who will be spoilt by many injokes and call backs as subtle as they may be and those and shame on them who have never encountered Futurama before. The story kicks off with a quick introduction of the characters and within 5 minutes old fans will be in familiar territory and newcomers will be brought up to date. What follows is nearly an hour and a half of laughs scifi action and romance.This is a film I would definitely have paid to see at the cinema over the Simpson's movie. I hope that the DVD sales of this and the next 3 films do well as it was sorely missed.Welcome back Futurama!".

I signed the online petition all of those years ago when it got canceled rumor has it all those signatures got printed and transported to box the CEO of FOX into his office but thats only a rumor as far as I know. Having said this I want to ensure everyone that even if you go into the movie with high expectations  they will be exceeded.The plot may seem tangled but the writers don't leave anything out. Nothing is forgotten like in Lost. If you watched the TVseries you will love this. If you didn't  tough luck but you will probably wind up loving it anyway. Its literally a celebration of all of the five seasons aired on television and its impressive that they did this without repeating anything.All of the old themes are brought back  its like the show never went off the air. You will straight off the bat be able to reidentify with characters and feel the same way about the show you did all of those years ago.I haven't seen a story tied up like this in years.

From buying the volumes on DVD to watching the repeats shown on Adult Swim we've finally got some more Fry some more Zoidberg some more Professor Farnsworth and oh yeah even some more Zap. Futurama fans rejoice and be happy that Futurama is going to be back on the air but the celebration begins with their first directtoDVD movie Bender's Big Score. And I tell you what it was most definitely a score.This is easily the most in depth Futurama story to date. You've got timetraveling duplicates running all over the place. One coming the other going one staying and another just hanging around with his butt hanging out. To summarize the story in a short and sweet way Nude Alien Scammers think internet scams are taking over our Futurama world one by one and guess where it begins yep with our pals from Planet Express. That is the main story but you also have sidestories with Leela's new love Hermes' lack of a body and a few others. All in all this is one jampacked story that should please all fans. One thing I'm sure some Futurama fans will argue about is the slight change to the theme song. It's almost the exact same but now with a more hip electronic sounding addition. I don't mind it at all but I do prefer the classic theme song....which plays at the end of the movie.Speaking of pleasing all fans you have almost every character you've met in the Futurama Universe saying Hi. Another reviewer said that none are introduced just for the sake of being introduced....now that's a diehard speaking right there. It's quite obvious they've set up minor side missions just so they could include many characters. They've got the Devil and his lil devil robots playing music for only one scene and have screen time for about 3 seconds. Besides this point you do have almost every character you'd want to see. Though I didn't see my beautiful gigantic Amazon women! Though I'm sure they'll be back.Bender's Big Score was a very entertaining movie. It was pretty much nonstop Futurama silliness from the get go. You have the touching moments as well but the jokes are the ones that run the show. Unfortunately and I say this tentatively I really didn't laugh out loud that much. At 98 minutes I was expecting to be laughing at least every couple minutes or so. Not the case here more like a once every 10 or so. But I'm me and you're you so you may laugh all the time but I found the jokes a little too familiar most of the time. Example Bender will talk about himself and say something like this Sure it's not a big deal for that guy. Wait I am that guy. Me Bender. But sometimes that old Futurama joke still rings true. One example Zoidberg gets hostile with Leela because she talks down about a dumpster. Zoidberg confronts her with a spikey head You stay out of my dumpster! That was classic Zoidberg.All in all Bender's Big Score was a great reunion for all Futurama fans. It's not the funniest 98 minutes of Futurama I've seen but it's very memorable and truly entertaining. It's been a while but Futurama is back and I can tell you one thing the Hypnotoad is back in action baby! All praise the Hypnotoad. All praise the Hypnotoad.

	schema:reviewBody "It pains me to have to say so but Bender's Big Score makes a disappointing return for the Futurama series.One of the great appeals of Futurama was the respect it showed for its own continuity. With Bender's Big Score that's out the window. Here's the best example Nibbler's secret life as a powerful sentient being a subplot the original show spent four seasons building up to is revealed 15 minutes into this production  and for no reason all it leads to is a futile attack on the alien scammers.Not that this movie doesn't like pointing out Futurama continuity. At times the story looks like a contest to see how many obscure characters it can work in. There are loads of tackedon and unnecessary cameos Santabot is probably the most egregious. Meanwhile important secondary characters like Dr. Zoidberg The Professor Zapp Branigan Kif and Amy Wong have very small roles.And the main characters disappoint as well. The FryLarsLeela love triangle is shallow and lacks any of the poignancy we saw in The Sting and other Season 4 episodes. The lambasting of Fox for cancelling the show is heavyhanded Family Guy did a much better job of this and if you didn't like it at least it was short. The alien scammers while they did have some grossout appeal with their sprunging weren't nearly powerful enough to take over the earth. Leela could have killed all three of them with one kick. And the whole timetravel story which were once verboten in Futurama was convoluted and nonsensical.And above all else... it just isn't funny.

	onyx:emotionText "It pains me to have to say so but Bender's Big Score makes a disappointing return for the Futurama series.One of the great appeals of Futurama was the respect it showed for its own continuity. With Bender's Big Score that's out the window. Here's the best example Nibbler's secret life as a powerful sentient being a subplot the original show spent four seasons building up to is revealed 15 minutes into this production  and for no reason all it leads to is a futile attack on the alien scammers.Not that this movie doesn't like pointing out Futurama continuity. At times the story looks like a contest to see how many obscure characters it can work in. There are loads of tackedon and unnecessary cameos Santabot is probably the most egregious. Meanwhile important secondary characters like Dr. Zoidberg The Professor Zapp Branigan Kif and Amy Wong have very small roles.And the main characters disappoint as well. The FryLarsLeela love triangle is shallow and lacks any of the poignancy we saw in The Sting and other Season 4 episodes. The lambasting of Fox for cancelling the show is heavyhanded Family Guy did a much better job of this and if you didn't like it at least it was short. The alien scammers while they did have some grossout appeal with their sprunging weren't nearly powerful enough to take over the earth. Leela could have killed all three of them with one kick. And the whole timetravel story which were once verboten in Futurama was convoluted and nonsensical.And above all else... it just isn't funny. I can't think of one funny thing that happens in the whole movie or any memorable moments.I can only hope that this disappointing effort was the result of trying to write a featurelength film for the first time and that it indulged whatever need the creators have to reference themselves.";

To hear of the comeback was great. To have to wait quite a while not so much. Seeing the final product a real joy and pleasant surprise.To be sure they're a little rusty in places. Some of the lines especially in the initial third of the film are questionable and would not have made the final cut under the regime that provided us with the standard series. Hermes only occasionally an entertaining character gets too much screen time in a somewhat superfluous side plot featuring his equally unentertaining wife and his irritating enemy Barbados Slim.

It retains much of the trademark dynamic writing taking in some of the same unbelievable and jawdropping spins on science and humanalien relationships and making us laugh when explaining away the continuity errors the writers were aware were needed to create an engrossing story.It makes good use of screen time and never drags it heels which I felt both the Family Guy and Simpsons features did. In the end both of those other features were such a plot compromise where you ended up had so little bearing on where you started you had to laugh unintentionally. With this Futurama feature although the plot is bombastic in the greatest sense of the word like a Queen record for example it ties up everything I wanted to know in a timely fashion using classic storytelling techniques  and where necessary awesome seamless and not gratuitous 3DFX  throughout.Now I've covered the good and the bad it is time to address the ugly  the backlash. Some have moaned that there isn't enough humour in this feature. To be honest one of my favourite features of the original series was getting us away from the old clich which seems to doom a lot of animated shows namely Cartoon  Funny. Yes it has several moments of great humour  a nice fiftyfifty of building set pieces and incisive oneliners  but it balances them well with a poignant story which I think they pull off as well as 'The Devils Hands Are Idle Playthings' if you consider that they had to pace it out over nearly ninety minutes which is over four times the length of a standard episode. It's a tall order for almost any script writer used to cramming in the jokes in thirty minutes or less but these writers don't have a lot of trouble with it.Another point of contention with the hardcore fans has been what a few of them have called a hopelessly complicated plot. This makes me laugh because the hardcore brethren praise the show constantly for intelligent postgeek humour then with the same breath criticise this new installment for breaking out of the shows comfort zone to use that same intelligence to create a mind blowing story. They must have been watching a different movie because I stuck with almost every twist and turn with awe and the few I haven't resolved yet will  like all great works of art  reveal themselves with further observation.In closing  to you hardcore fans who say this isn't a patch on the original episodes get off your soap box and think yourself lucky there's anything new at all and secondly I bet you only grew to love those episodes through repeated viewings so stop being so hard on what is a logical continuation of a great premise! 810NOTE For those new viewers who missed a lot of the injokes that spilled over from the original series and who aren't sure why there is such an abundance of characters go and buy the Season 14 box set from Amazon or eBay and it'll all make perfect sense.".

As it transpires they scam the company right from under Professor Farnsworth and soon Fry and the others are working for them on a global scam. The scammers search for information leads them to Fry's ass where he has a tattoo of Bender with an embedded binary code on it. The code opens a time portal through which the aliens send Bender to steal valuable items from history. However with Professor Fransworth's doommeter going off the scale it can only be so long before the universe tells itself apart.When I saw there was a Futurama film I added it immediately to my rental list even though it was not due out any time soon. After this I forgot about it until suddenly it turned up on my doorstep. I mention this so that you do not think I was hyping it in my head in the lead up to watching it  just that I was looking forward to more of the Futurama humour that I had been missing since the series was cancelled. The film starts in a rather clumsy fashion making references to the series being cancelled that aren't that funny and are just done. I thought things might get better from this point on but sadly and bewilderingly they didn't.The main problem is the plot which at best is described as convoluted and at worst is just all over the place. This is not to say that the plots in the series were even anything that good but it was rare for them to actually get in the way of the comedy. Here however so much effort and time is spent on the many uncontrolled plot threads that it appears the writers have had very little time to create the sort of wit that they did in the series. Over the ninety minutes there are about ten good laughs and these are generally asides that the series did better. Of course at times this works but there are just too few laughs across the longer running time to justify it and it is hard not to find yourself sitting with an awkward smile while waiting for the next laugh to eventually come along. The messy plot could have been delivered tongue in cheek to prevent it being a focal point but actually the film does the opposite  pushing itself forward and leaving the asides and general comedy very much in the shade.The Futurama film was understandably hotly anticipated by those who bemoaned the loss of the series I myself was looking forward to it and ready to forgive it some weaknesses. However the final product is far too weak in terms of laughs and far too messy in regards plotting and delivery. It cannot even sort of fill the running time in regards entertainment value and it would have been much better if it had picked one plot dropped half of that and kept all the funny asides to make up a twenty minute episode.".

Watch the movie a second time it really helps you understand the movie and help you put all the pieces together. And it also made me realize how nice the storyline was put together. It really have some nice tweaks because of the time traveling and it can give you headaches trying to figure out what is going on the first time watching it but watching it a second time helped me put it all in order or almost I think... Because time traveling can't really be explained properly.For me as a fan I think it is just GREAT to see Futurama BACK in the AIR!  ... I hope in the future they will make more Futurama but somehow this also gave a nice ending also letting you know that Fry was the one for Lela! Very sweet  You should be aware that there is a change from the movie and the series from how often the funny lines comes. In this full length movie there can be some time without the humor in first place but it should also be different from the series in that way it is a full length movie so it should have a better storyline and I think it surely does.  And it also makes this film more deep than any of the episodes where. So to all who likes Futurama go out and see it be sure NOT to miss it...

So it's with some sadness that I have to admit Bender's Big Score just isn't very good.It starts out well enough with a fanpleasing broadside at Fox for having canceled the show prematurely but the story is soon hijacked by three unpleasant and unimpressive villains who use spam to take over Bender Planet Express and the Earth. It's a very frustrating and unentertaining storyline that just won't go away. Then they discover a binary code on Fry's ass that makes God send a glowing ball that lets Bender travel back in time to steal things. Gee there's some great speculative fiction Deus Ex Machina literally pulled off a character's ass. Also Leela falls in love with a bald dude from the head museum which sends a jealous Fry back to the past where he learns the true meaning of love from a lonely narwhale. I am not making this up.Oh. And there are songs. Awful indifferent songs that seem to have been crammed in as an afterthought.It's all a huge mess and not particularly funny. There's little of the cleverness and snarky science that we all loved so much. This is not the Futurama of Roswell that Ends Well. It's more reminiscent of the weaker episodes in the final season in particular the maudlin Jurassic Bark.I know a lot of fans will be rallying behind this to support the franchise but there's no denying that this is a huge letdown. I still love the show and want more of it so I'm hoping next year's DVD releases will show a lot of improvement improvement.".

And there are songs. Awful indifferent songs that seem to have been crammed in as an afterthought.It's all a huge mess and not particularly funny. There's little of the cleverness and snarky science that we all loved so much. This is not the Futurama of Roswell that Ends Well. It's more reminiscent of the weaker episodes in the final season in particular the maudlin Jurassic Bark.I know a lot of fans will be rallying behind this to support the franchise but there's no denying that this is a huge letdown. I still love the show and want more of it so I'm hoping next year's DVD releases will show a lot of improvement improvement.";

	schema:headline " Not terrible but somewhat disappointing";
	schema:reviewBody "Bender's Big Score may have been a pleasant feature film in its own right however when faced with the nearly flawless original series and the three years of anticipation by eager fans it sorely disappoints. A number of elements of this new release unfortunately do not measure up to the genius that was the original run.While the writing in the film was capable of producing a number of chuckles and a few big laughs it suffers from an overuse of selfreference. A few inside jokes may have been amusing but the viewer is eventually bombarded with a bulging cast of characters and a dizzying array of references to previously established canon. Not only that quite a few jokes attempted to derive humor from metareference alone something that the original series never resorted to. The opening sequence for example went as far as using puns for metareferences. Such jokes may blend in with Family Guy or even The Simpsons but are terribly out of place in the Futurama universe. Even worse the sort of satire involved with this sequence is not the gentle prodding kind we've come to known in the original series but a meanspirited sardonic sort. While its understandable that such emotions may prevail after the frustrations over the premature cancellation of the show expression of these feelings in the first few minutes of the comeback seems to be in poor taste.The movie is filled with little details that remind you of just how great the original series was by falling short of the standards set by it. There is a general excessiveness surrounding this film expressed with nudity crude behavior violence and gore. This excessiveness leaves one with the impression that Futurama was a beast shackled by the draconian regulations of the FCC finally gaining its freedom thanks to the liberating nature of the DVD medium. Unfortunately the original series never gave the air of a beast attempting to break free. Rather the original elevated above such crudeness with intellectualism and smart satire. Thus the viewer is confused by the sudden onslaught of gore and crudeness which seemingly to have joined the series from nowhere. The writing attempted to weave musical sequences into the film however these attempts too fell short of the original's greatness and were as shoddy imitations. While the original series managed to incorporate singing and dancing transparently by cleverly embedding them into the storyline for example as part of an opera or a concert the musical sequences in this film were utterly forced into their places.Which brings me to my final point. The awful transitions into singing may have been forgiven if the songs were actually good but that is not the case. It seems after a two year hiatus some of the actors may be well advised to get some voice acting practice sessions before jumping into this production. The singing in the original series may not have been paragons of musical talent but they were welldone and represented the characters and the situation beautifully. The musical sequences in this film were poorly executed and out of place by comparison. In addition a number of otherwise genuinely emotional and poignant scenes were drained of their emotional component due to poor acting.After all this though I still think Bender's Big Score is a movie worth owning especially for long time Futurama fans. The disappointments that I pointed out were only due to the incredibly high standards set by the nearperfection of the original series. This film may have not lived up to expectations but it is still a quality piece of work that's probably better than a lot of other things out there right now and though it may not be as good as the best episodes of Futurama it will still be loved by someone who loved every episode of Futurama.".

The Futurama movie is nothing more than a cheap sellout.Starting out with the visualsI think there wasn't even a single new background designed for this episode of visual boredom. No new locations visited meaning the surroundings like beaches deserts eternal ice etc.. I have not seen a single shot feeling new and fresh to me. Just the regular episodes I watched over and over again. There is also no interesting new CG just regular space battles with golden death stars as the kingpins of ugliness.Moving on to humor No interesting new quotes. The regular stuff you heard over and over again with slight variations. Same jokes really the same jokes. Zap and Kif managed to get 10 min of overall screen time. Nibbler does some interesting things. Bender behaves a classic but uninteresting. You can notice a significant movement to political propaganda edutainment slapstick and splatter yes it gets stupid but bloody hooray!.Moving to voices MacNeille and Herman did a tremendous job on the side characters glory to them. Welker is again star of the show. Thats all. The rest sounds unmotivated. West was in bad shape for his additional role and voice. I knew it the moment he walked in and said his first line. Ugly. Shame on you and the writers for forcing you.Moving to music Who wrote this crap? Is this Keeler? Because this doesn't sound like Ken Keeler. Neither does it sound like Tyng. The hip hop song is good the rest the exact opposite.Moving to plot A nice idea. Nice. Easy to handle. You did squat. clapclap Moving to the director Did you choose CareyHill as director because obsoletely fabulous was a good episode in your opinion? It is one of the worst if you take away the engineering and computer science insider jokes and that is exactly what you did with this movie.You are getting tame concerning scifi and you are compensating it with violence. How mature. You applied Simpsons strategies. A dozen cameos of oneepisode inseries characters. Thats cheap and this is yet another weak movie.Do you producers have any comment on that? Especially Mr. Cohen? I have all of your promises and suggestions on DVD and so do thousands of people e.g. Zap picks up double nude painting etc.. In my opinion you are a traitor. You and Kaplan Verrone and Groening who did squat as I guess. Who is your target audience? Go and ask yourself. Gore has nearly more lines than LaMarche. Obvious case. You sold yourself and us out.There are two more movies coming up so I'm giving the next one a chance. But let me tell you this dear producers writers and directors You are heading the way of the Matrix and went the way of Zucker  Zucker's Police Squad. Don't let it happen.For the fans Lost your DVD sets? Need a warmup? Buy the movie!For interested people You want to know what Futurama is all about in only 88 min? There you go.".

That didn't work well. Futurama was always very geeky and everything had a basis and in some twisted way it was still believable or explained somehow. Having 3 benders and 2 Frys walking around just made me feel that it wasn't the old good Futurama. And I was really expecting at least the SLIGHTEST indictment of what happened right after the series ended between Fry and Leela but there just wasn't anything to it. The scammers were really disgusting something I've never felt in futurama for the exception of the queen slurm worm and I'm not saying I'm a prude or was offended but it's just not that kind of show. Futurama has always been about witty unexpected doublesensed things.It was just not the same.

	schema:reviewBody "I've always been a bit disappointed that 'Futurama' is coming back. It's not that I don't like the show quite the contrary it's the finest animated television program I've ever had the pleasure of viewing. The characters the character development the animation the writing the acting...it's eons above any other contemporary cartoon I've seen and that includes 'The Simpsons'. It's hysterically funny and at times rather touching was there a dry eye in the house when we first watched Jurassic Bark?. And the last episode The Devil's Hands are Idle Playthings might just possibly have been the best series finale I've ever seen.Of course that's precisely why I'm a bit worried about 'Futurama''s return...sure it's back but at what cost? What has changed? It's hard for me to come up with a comparison the closest I can think of is when 'Mystery Science Theater 3000' was cancelled by Comedy Central and then revived on the SciFi Channel while it was still pretty funny it really lacked a lot of the show's original charm that came with the previous writers and actors. And if there's one thing 'Futurama' can't afford to lose it's its charm. Regardless I was still megaexcited over the release of 'Bender's Big Score' and went out to purchase it the day it came out.My expectations of the film were sort of medium I knew it wouldn't be great but it would be at least on par with a regular episode of the show. Were my expectations met? No. No they weren't. It was bad. It was really bad. Well it wasn't REALLY bad but Lord was it disappointing.Let's start off with the plot the basic core of the film revolves around a trio of naked lobsterlike aliens who using the power of email scams and a tattoo on Fry's rear end which has an embedded code that makes time travel possible enlist Bender's help to go back through time steal a variety of expensive objects and take over the world. However as is the norm with featurelength adaptations of television shows there's a number of subplots Hermes' body is destroyed and living as a head in a jar must try to win back the love of his family this story doesn't really go anywhere and is mainly used to pad out the 89minute run time a series of flashbacks follow the life of Fry if he were to return to the 21st century which of course creates TONS of continuity and canon problems and Leela starts falling in love with Lars a lab technician much to Fry's dismay this story takes over the entire third act wrapping up in a completely ludicrous conclusion.And of course there's a fair amount of time spent on cameos from beloved 'Futurama' characters. Unfortunately it's the notsobeloved ones that are featured most prominently. While there's no Calculon Wernstrom Lrr URL or Robot Devil there's plenty of Hedonismbot the Harlem Globetrotters Santa and Barbados Slim who has more screen time than Zapp Branigan. Let me reiterate BARBADOS SLIM has more screen time than ZAPP BRANIGAN. A Zapp Branigan that is barely used by the way...I like the character in small doses but I couldn't help but feel a bit ripped off when his threeminute part was over with. And did I mention Santa has his own musical number? Now there ARE a good number of chuckles throughout and maybe even a couple of guffaws if you like Zoidberg's antics and who doesn't? but most of the time the jokes really fall flat which is something that I never thought I'd say about 'Futurama'. One joke in particular which is the myriad of uses for dust made from the groundup corpses of FOX executives may have been amusing the first time but is repeated so often throughout the course of the film it just becomes annoying. In fact the whole FOXbashing fourthwall breaking opening scenes that reference their cancellation is really heavyhanded and gets old quickly.The FryLeela relationship is handled rather clumsily as well. The kinda subtly complex relationship the two characters formed over the course of four seasons seems to have completely vanished. Fry comes off more whiny than sympathetic and Leela's relationship with Lars seems forced and unbelievable and yes I am aware that they're fictional characters so I'll just stop talking now.On a positive note however the animation looks spectacular. A lot of money went into making it look like a theaterquality feature film and it shows. The inevitable space battle towards the end and a lot of the background art looked superb.Mostly though the entire thing played out more like a belowaverage episode of the show stretched out over 90 minutes and it DOES feel like 90 minutes might I add. 'Futurama' didn't quite return with a 'bang' per se but more of a 'nondisruptive rap'. Of course I've only seen it once. I may give it another chance sooner or later and again with commentary but after such a long wait the first experience should have been a memorable one.I don't wish to appear ungrateful though I'm extremely happy that the fan support wasn't all for naught and the show's back in production. I've yet to relinquish hope either the brief preview of the next film 'The Beast With A Billion Backs' featured on the Best Buyexclusive bonus DVD that came with my purchase looked to be much more promising it had a few laughs and it appears to be focusing on the relationship between Kif and Amy...and you can't go wrong there....can you? Until then though I think I'll just stick with reruns of the series.But that's just MY opinion...".

	schema:reviewBody "I first saw this movie with almost no expectations.  Now I own it and have watched it more times than I can remember.I have heard that this movie caught a lot of flak about not being realistic about mental illness and not providing a diagnosis for Joon etc.  I think that it is more realistic for the average person with a mental illness than any other movie I have seen on the topic.  There was no theme of being institutionalised forever and there was no unrealistic expectation of a cure.The character of Sam put it best when he said Aside from being a little mentally ill she's pretty normal.  I think that's the best quote I've heard in a movie on that particular topic.I also think there is a reason for there being no stated diagnosis of Joon. She personifies those of us who can't get on with the things we want to do in life because of a mental illness and treatment getting in the way.  She does it very well down to the mannerisms.  If she were to be labeled say obsessivecompulsive or posttraumatic stress disorder or schizophrenic or bipolar then the universality would be taken out of it and it would suddenly only apply to people with one certain label.This movie did wonders for my family.  Upon watching it we all said That's us! and learned to laugh at ourselves and the situations we got into.  It offered me a lot of hope  what more could I want than to find an understanding and eccentric friend to love and move into my own apartment away from the mess of hospitals and doctors?  It still makes me laugh every time I see it and Joon has become a household word... I recommend this to anyone particularly anyone with a mental illness and their families  it might lighten things up but it certainly doesn't skip over the bad parts.".

Now I own it and have watched it more times than I can remember.I have heard that this movie caught a lot of flak about not being realistic about mental illness and not providing a diagnosis for Joon etc.  I think that it is more realistic for the average person with a mental illness than any other movie I have seen on the topic.  There was no theme of being institutionalised forever and there was no unrealistic expectation of a cure.The character of Sam put it best when he said Aside from being a little mentally ill she's pretty normal.  I think that's the best quote I've heard in a movie on that particular topic.I also think there is a reason for there being no stated diagnosis of Joon. She personifies those of us who can't get on with the things we want to do in life because of a mental illness and treatment getting in the way.  She does it very well down to the mannerisms.  If she were to be labeled say obsessivecompulsive or posttraumatic stress disorder or schizophrenic or bipolar then the universality would be taken out of it and it would suddenly only apply to people with one certain label.This movie did wonders for my family.  Upon watching it we all said That's us! and learned to laugh at ourselves and the situations we got into.  It offered me a lot of hope  what more could I want than to find an understanding and eccentric friend to love and move into my own apartment away from the mess of hospitals and doctors?  It still makes me laugh every time I see it and Joon has become a household word... I recommend this to anyone particularly anyone with a mental illness and their families  it might lighten things up but it certainly doesn't skip over the bad parts.";

Other than weekly poker games Benny's is a life of servitude and this is the source of his isolation.  He longs to be free to have other relationships but is wracked by guilt at the idea of leaving Joon in anyone else's care.Joon is an artist and is also mentally ill a schizophrenic who has good and bad days and who depends on Benny to provide routine in her life.  She has run out every housekeeper to be found in town but cannot function without assistance and supervision.  The film does a superb job of differentiating between mental illness from which Joon clearly suffers and stupidity which is not a problem she faces. Into their lives comes Sam a cousin of one of Benny's poker buddies. Through a clever conceit Sam moves in with Benny and Joon.  Sam is undereducated partially illiterate but a comedic genius who studies Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton knows catalogs of old movies and has perfected the art form kudos to Depp for the grace and conviction of this part of his performance.  Like Keaton and the great silent film stars Sam rarely speaks to communicate and this combined with his illiteracy condemns him to be considered stupid as well.  The great sneaker quality of Depp's performance is to show that Sam is always watching always listening and that he's no dim bulb by any stretch. In Sam Joon finds a person who makes her laugh lives by his own rules and cares for her deeply.  In Joon Sam finds a woman who appreciates him as he is but he also knows a relationship with her is taboo.  In a particularly revealing scene he asks Benny as one man to another How sick is she? We know he is wrestling with his feelings for her but Benny does not and his offhanded answer comes across as callous and almost mocking.While the handling of Sam and Joon's budding relationship may seem trite and the humor applied to Joon's illness might seem cruel in my experience the people who make those judgments know little about living day to day with a mentally ill  not to be confused with unintelligent  human being.  There is deep and abiding truth in the idea that laughter and love can cure the incurable people who seemed unable to function before can make great strides when they are shown trust and respect.  And although the psychiatric issues were glossed over in this film it has at its core an honest message of hope.  One of my favorite films for Depp and Masterson's outstanding performances and a true depiction of imperfect people on the journey to becoming whole. 910".

Instead at their worst they're merely troubled and interesting characters and at their best they're absolutely charming and heartwarming.

The real miracle of this film is that it is able to tell a story laced with realism through a whimsical lens and it walks the tightrope of making one feel good without blatant reassurance.

Including all the movies I've seen and aren't worth owning BJ lands neatly into the top 23 overall.It's a simple fairy tale but simple neither in its creation nor execution. The layers of theme and the reality and originality of characters so well performed in every way almost put it beyond genre and certainly it is neither a comedy nor a drama. It precedes and predicts smart dramedies of the later 90's and beyond.But the tale's most significant moral so subtly and honestly deliveredone real reason this movie stands outis the prescient confronting of our society and culture's treatment both legally and personally of the socalled mentally ill.Finally today we are beginning to acknowledge how disgustingly medieval is our approach to mental illness via heavy drugging chopping of brains and nerves and even electric shocking patients. Add to that the fact highlighted in this movie that our supposedly free society takes away any personal control from either the individual or the family when someone has been labeled mentally ill and gives that control to the pscyhiatric organizations not to any legal or governmental body you notice.It is estimated now that all these mass control methodologies originated by Germans mostly in the early 20th century and polished in Nazi Germany and under Stalin will be eliminated in the United States within 20 years. This movie has helped contribute to that motion and heralds a major positive turn in our society from the long trends of worsening education and rising crime that began when pscyhs were given control of our educational institutions and our mental health methodologies.The obvious demonstrable fact is that changing the way one acts toward a personany personto a positive from a negative will assist them in improving their own ability to live their life. Negative being absolutely any motion or communication that compromises or reduces their own control confidence or positiveness toward the future. Many people are not even insane but just individual enough to cause the established mental health industry to label them with a disease so they can prescribe drugs for them. The old joke Are there really more insane or just more definitions of insanity? applies.Like Joon simply being treated with dignity and as a regular person is all they need to lead a successful independent lifethey really weren't a big problem until someone said they were and kept telling them so. But even without the tremendous significance of this thematic message the movie is extremely clever and subtly entertaining. The DVD contains an excellent and different little piece where John Schwartzman the cinematographer comments over about 20 minutes of makeup and lighting tests of the lead characters. Much better than the usual 20minute making of. His comments plus the director's commentary give an excellent context for how the movie was conceived and made and shows that they were well aware of the issues and challenges they faced. Of course I believe they met all those challenges exceedingly well and produced a timeless little classic.".

The layers of theme and the reality and originality of characters so well performed in every way almost put it beyond genre and certainly it is neither a comedy nor a drama. It precedes and predicts smart dramedies of the later 90's and beyond.But the tale's most significant moral so subtly and honestly deliveredone real reason this movie stands outis the prescient confronting of our society and culture's treatment both legally and personally of the socalled mentally ill.Finally today we are beginning to acknowledge how disgustingly medieval is our approach to mental illness via heavy drugging chopping of brains and nerves and even electric shocking patients. Add to that the fact highlighted in this movie that our supposedly free society takes away any personal control from either the individual or the family when someone has been labeled mentally ill and gives that control to the pscyhiatric organizations not to any legal or governmental body you notice.It is estimated now that all these mass control methodologies originated by Germans mostly in the early 20th century and polished in Nazi Germany and under Stalin will be eliminated in the United States within 20 years. This movie has helped contribute to that motion and heralds a major positive turn in our society from the long trends of worsening education and rising crime that began when pscyhs were given control of our educational institutions and our mental health methodologies.The obvious demonstrable fact is that changing the way one acts toward a personany personto a positive from a negative will assist them in improving their own ability to live their life. Negative being absolutely any motion or communication that compromises or reduces their own control confidence or positiveness toward the future. Many people are not even insane but just individual enough to cause the established mental health industry to label them with a disease so they can prescribe drugs for them. The old joke Are there really more insane or just more definitions of insanity? applies.Like Joon simply being treated with dignity and as a regular person is all they need to lead a successful independent lifethey really weren't a big problem until someone said they were and kept telling them so. But even without the tremendous significance of this thematic message the movie is extremely clever and subtly entertaining. The DVD contains an excellent and different little piece where John Schwartzman the cinematographer comments over about 20 minutes of makeup and lighting tests of the lead characters. Much better than the usual 20minute making of. His comments plus the director's commentary give an excellent context for how the movie was conceived and made and shows that they were well aware of the issues and challenges they faced. Of course I believe they met all those challenges exceedingly well and produced a timeless little classic.";

	schema:reviewBody "Depp continued his early nineties love of starring as offbeat characters the type of characters that most actors would avoid taking on for fear of embarrassment or losing credibility. It may be true that very few actors have the ability to carry off such characters with skill and make them believable and charming. Depp is the master of these roles and in Benny and Joon he again proves his great talent and versatility. He may be the big name and steal most of the scenes he is in but the surrounding cast and story make it an enduring film of bittersweet romance comedy and tries to prove that there is hope for all of us when it comes to love.Benny and Joon were orphaned at a young age and Benny has spent the greater part of his life looking after his mentally ill younger sister. Joon is slightly unbalanced and sometimes gets herself in trouble by burning things and causing 'public disturbances'. Benny works as a mechanic in a garage has never been away from home or had a proper relationship as he feels he must always look after Joon. Recently Joon has been getting more unstable leading Psychiatrists to advise that she be put in a home under care. Benny wants to live a normal life but cannot leave his sister. Joon is an incredibly smart and talented young woman but would never ask to be put in a home. On one of their regular poker nights Benny's friends play cards with Joon as Benny is late. The stakes are high a week's washing a troll toy etc. One friend puts his newly found cousin Sam in the pot a 26 year old who can't read and spends his time watching movies and emulating Buster Keaton. Joon loses and Benny has a new house guest. At first he seems odd but as time goes on he proves to be a source of goodness in the household and Joon falls for him. Sam also manages to get local waitress and BMovie star Ruthie involved with Benny. However when Benny finds out what has been going on between Sam and Joon he is furious leading to Joon being committed. Benny realises his mistakes and asks Sam to help bring Joon back.Above all this is a warm hearted tale with some good performances. Depp is superb when getting up to his supposedly unusual antics Masterson manages well with an equally difficult role and Quinn holds it together with his subtle performance of a character who must cope with the weirdness around him. Moore provides fine support as Ruthie and there are a few funny moments. The film does not push for laughs or heartfelt tears and therefore is quietly charming and should hopefully leave most with a feeling of goodwill afterwards. The director deals with mental illness as many before have that it makes a person more lovable and whether or not this is true it does not get in the way of the plot. Joon does not seem that different from everyone else and Sam is a born entertainer but a spontaneous one who should not be put on stage. It may be too slow and subtle for some and it doesn't have the look or emotion of Edward Scissorhands but it is nevertheless a fine movie and one which is destined to have a cult following.8 out of 10".

Benny  Joon this movie was just so awesome to me and it was so romantic and sweet. I didn't see the movies for a few years so I decided to buy it when I saw it on sale. Rewatching this movie brings back so many memories and I still love this movie so much. Even though it's cheesy and predictable this is just a charming romantic comedy. The reason why is because it does have something different the main love story has two characters who are complete opposite but find that happiness in each other they also remind another what real love feels like. Johnny Depp plays Sam based off of Buster Keaten he pulls in great physical comedy and made this movie magical and enjoyable believe me Benny  Joon is a fun story that any one could fall in love with.Benny and Joon are brother and sister their parents died in a fatal car accident when they were just children. Benny has promised to take care mentally ill Joon. But when Joon walks in on a card game with Benny's friends she joins in without Benny's knowledge and wins something big Benny's friend's cousin Sam. Sam goes to live with Benny and Joon his physical gags charm their hearts and brings in Ruthie a waitress who Benny is just in love with but doesn't have the courage to admit it. But the plot thickens when Sam and Joon fall in love and over protective Benny intervenes.Benny  Joon is one of those rare memorable romantic comedies while the rest of the cast like Mary Stuart Masterson and Aidan Quinn both pull in heart warming performances it's Johnny Depp who takes the movie a time when he was pretty much just known as Edward Scissorhands he took something different and made it work. His scene in the park with Benny and Joon is just so wonderful and funny. I would recommend Benny and Joon it's a good movie terrific actors and has a fun and catchy soundtrack this is a movie not to miss.810".

The story surrounds Benny  Joon Pearl two siblings who have lived together since the accidental death of their parents in a car crash. Benny Aidan Quinn works as a car mechanic but finds it difficult to form a longterm relationship with any woman he meets as he must care for his mentally ill sister.One night while playing cards with Benny's friends Joon Mary Stuart Masterson loses her hand but wins Sam Johnny Depp who is an avid silent movie fan and is also dyslexic. He moves in with Benny  Joon for what at first looks like a night but turns into a permanent stay. Benny thinks this may be the answer to all his problems  it will also avoid him putting his sister in a group home as he doesn't like those sort of places.Unfortunately for Benny Sam  Joon fall in love  I would be madly in love with him too if I was in her position! lol but I better not give away the rest of the story for those who haven't seen it! The strong message that I got from this movie was to accept people for who they really are inside. I felt so sorry for the way Joon was treated by her brother but was so happy when Sam came into her life as he didn't see her as mentally ill but as a normal human being. I wish all human beings were seen in the same way! The performances in this movie are absolutely outstanding but Johnny Depp's was the best  funniest!  I would love a person like Sam to be one of my best friends! This movie had me smiling from start to finish  I loved the comedy routines in the park  I couldn't believe it was Johnny himself doing all those stunts in that scene! I won't ramble on for much longer but I will say this PLEASE SEE THIS MOVIE! IT IS SWEET  FUNNY  YOU WON'T REGRET IT!Thanx for reading my comment!".

He's the typical over protective brother wanting to save Joon from all the world's pains and heartaches and problems. The struggles between Benny and Joon and between Benny and Sam are heartwrenching. It's a wonderful funny yet slightly sad story about the weird shapes and sizes land brands of love. The actors bring to life very colorful believable characters. It's one of those movies I don't mind watching over and over again. A last note for anyone watching it in a family setting with younger kids the fword is used once about an hour nd 10 mins. into the movie. Just as a heads up.".

On the one hand I don't really care for James Rolfe's more recent AVGN episodes but on the other hand the script for this movie was supposedly written several years ago during a time when his episodes were in my opinion better. So I decided to watch it with a completely open mind out of curiosity's sake more than from being a diehard fan.It was a noble effort and a great practical and technical achievement and I respect James as a filmmaker and artist for all the work he put into it but objectively speaking it just isn't that great of a movie. Not because of cheap practical effects which I didn't mind not because of the acting which was mostly passable but for two more important things the script and the humor.Plain and simply this movie is not funny. I hardly cracked a smile through the entire thing. I think the one or two laughs I got were of the Wow they seriously included something that dumb?? variety. I also spotted multiple instances of jokes recycled from old AVGN episodes e.g. It's better to be pssed off than pssed on but even many of the original jokes were stale and lame. I actually cringed when they did the old It sounds like people are having sex but oh wait they're doing something else entirely! Hilarious!! bit. I suppose it could also be that my sense of humor is different now compared to seven years ago when I became an AVGN fan but it all boiled down to an unfunny comedy.The script in this thing has issues. The whole thing is a bit confusing an convoluted. There are several annoying and uncompelling new characters. The plot is too dense and should have been kept simpler. There's a scene early on where Cooper AVGN's outofnowhere sidekick talks about all kinds of insane thing he believes in and we get a sequence illustrating it this scene is jarring an awful and took me out of the film completely. There's no tension in any scene with the villains not only because they're played up as goofballs but because the heroes are inexplicably not afraid of having guns pointed at their heads. The romantic payoff at the end is unearned. Etc etc. All in all it's not a tightly written story and could have used a lot more editing.The only other thing I'll say is that I did not see this movie in theaters I rented it and watched it alone. People have been saying that it's the kind of thing that's best seen in a group and maybe that's the case but by the same token being a hardcore fan in a packed theater full of other likeminded people likely creates a blinding euphoria that hinders objectivity. I'd advise everyone to watch it again at home and I won't be surprised if the novelty of the experience wears off and you come away with a different impression.".

	schema:headline " A Missed Opportunity";
	schema:reviewBody "Firstly let me declare an interest I've been following Rolfe and The Angry Video Game Nerd since about 2007. I've bought his DVDs mainly to contribute to his finances  since 90 of the content is available free online and I regularly visit his website Cinemassacre. His short videos are always a joy. They're informative and humorous poking fun at the weird curiosities of videogames board games movies TV shows and books. However when I heard about an AVGN movie I was a little puzzled. How could that ever work? The main problem is that The Nerd isn't really a true character as such he's merely an exaggeration of James Rolfe's personality. Sure the white shirt is a costume and the love of Rolling Rock is a vague attempt at character detail but his main characteristic the anger for awful games  well that normally comes from embellished truth. This is why the most successful AVGN videos focus on the games that Rolfe has a true history with. Exposing the absurdities of 2003's Big Rigs Over the Road Racing the subject matter of a recent episode is a lot of fun but it pales in comparison to The Nerd spitting bile at Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde a game which Rolfe hated as a child of the eighties and detests even more decades later. Nevertheless The Nerd had built up a loyal army of fan and Rolfe had a guaranteed audience for a movie irrespective of whether the format truly lent itself to one. So with format tinkering needed where to go for the movie? The obvious answer would have been a smallscale characterbased comedy. Explore and expand The Nerd turn him into an actual character and as a resultillustrate why he's deserving of a selftitled movie. Unfortunately and I take no pleasure in that term Rolfe has always had desires to dream a little bigger. Numerous episodes of AVGN and Board James have taken pretty radical deviations after the reviews have concluded. Viewers have been treated to bizarre storylines with budgetstretching special effects miniatures and fightsequences. These have for the most part been fun  even if they weren't really the reason why Rolfe had been embraced so enthusiastically by the web community. It are these episodes from which AVGN  THE MOVIE takes its cues. Rolfe and codirectorcowriter Kevin Finn have delivered an unashamedly hokey BMovie with an outlandish wacky plot. There's no deep delving into the Nerd's character and the only development he goes through is overcoming a reluctance to do something incredibly minor. And if you're expecting more depth to Rolfe's performance then you will be disappointed. I lost track of the number of times his reaction to something was simply a lippursing frown and a shake of the head. There's also not a huge amount of comedy here. There are comic setpieces sure  but the intention seems to be that you will laugh at the sheer nonsense of scenes rather than specifically funny dialogue. The closest I got to laughing was a bemused smile towards a couple of moments. And that's the biggest shame I'd overlook the fact that this is a misguided format for AVGN  The Movie...if the resulting product had generated some decent laughs.The plot is that a Games Company have developed a sequel to the infamous ET or Eee Tee as it is here and want the Nerd to review it thus publicising it for them. This would have been the perfect springboard for a Wayne's World type story with our protagonist being exploited by a large corporation. Alas Finn and Rolfe seem to lose interest in this plot line...which is why we end up with a finale consisting of a chatty alien a shiny spaceship and a giant existencethreatening monster. Rolfe is accompanied by a surprisingly large cast. Most of the performers do what they can with the material but there isn't really much depth to the proceedings so much of them are essentially cardboard cutouts. Nerdy Sidekick Zany alien Warhungry General. I get that this is kind of The Point  but there needs to be more to spoof than purely pointing out that you know your way around clichs and conventions. It's a little ironic that by attempting to make the scale of this movie bigger they end up showing the production up as far more amateurish. It seems that Finn and Rolfe dreamed a little too big in the scripting stage and rather than reign things in with knowledge of budgeting they simply kept things exactly as they were as they entered production. The result of this is that we get a huge amount of greenscreen miniatures and rubber suits. Yes there's a charm to it and Rolfe as a big fan of Godzilla is obviously paying tributes but it does make this seem more like the web sketch it came from than the Movie it yearns to be. I should stress that I didn't dislike AVGN  The Movie. It's far too long shave off 40 minutes and it would be far tighter and I was a little distracted during the sagging second third but it's always watchable. It's certainly more entertaining than the output of The Asylum with which it shares a similar look. And yet I feel this is a missed opportunity. It's disappointing that Rolfe and Finn were so focused on pastiching monster movies and capers rather than creating a movie as original as the web series that inspired it.I leave you with the fact that Kevin Smith made his debut movie Clerks for less than 30000. James Rolfe and Kevin Finn had 10 times that amount and made Angry Video Game Nerd  The Movie.".

I've bought his DVDs mainly to contribute to his finances  since 90 of the content is available free online and I regularly visit his website Cinemassacre. His short videos are always a joy. They're informative and humorous poking fun at the weird curiosities of videogames board games movies TV shows and books. However when I heard about an AVGN movie I was a little puzzled. How could that ever work? The main problem is that The Nerd isn't really a true character as such he's merely an exaggeration of James Rolfe's personality. Sure the white shirt is a costume and the love of Rolling Rock is a vague attempt at character detail but his main characteristic the anger for awful games  well that normally comes from embellished truth. This is why the most successful AVGN videos focus on the games that Rolfe has a true history with. Exposing the absurdities of 2003's Big Rigs Over the Road Racing the subject matter of a recent episode is a lot of fun but it pales in comparison to The Nerd spitting bile at Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde a game which Rolfe hated as a child of the eighties and detests even more decades later. Nevertheless The Nerd had built up a loyal army of fan and Rolfe had a guaranteed audience for a movie irrespective of whether the format truly lent itself to one. So with format tinkering needed where to go for the movie? The obvious answer would have been a smallscale characterbased comedy. Explore and expand The Nerd turn him into an actual character and as a resultillustrate why he's deserving of a selftitled movie. Unfortunately and I take no pleasure in that term Rolfe has always had desires to dream a little bigger. Numerous episodes of AVGN and Board James have taken pretty radical deviations after the reviews have concluded. Viewers have been treated to bizarre storylines with budgetstretching special effects miniatures and fightsequences. These have for the most part been fun  even if they weren't really the reason why Rolfe had been embraced so enthusiastically by the web community. It are these episodes from which AVGN  THE MOVIE takes its cues. Rolfe and codirectorcowriter Kevin Finn have delivered an unashamedly hokey BMovie with an outlandish wacky plot. There's no deep delving into the Nerd's character and the only development he goes through is overcoming a reluctance to do something incredibly minor. And if you're expecting more depth to Rolfe's performance then you will be disappointed. I lost track of the number of times his reaction to something was simply a lippursing frown and a shake of the head. There's also not a huge amount of comedy here. There are comic setpieces sure  but the intention seems to be that you will laugh at the sheer nonsense of scenes rather than specifically funny dialogue. The closest I got to laughing was a bemused smile towards a couple of moments. And that's the biggest shame I'd overlook the fact that this is a misguided format for AVGN  The Movie...if the resulting product had generated some decent laughs.The plot is that a Games Company have developed a sequel to the infamous ET or Eee Tee as it is here and want the Nerd to review it thus publicising it for them. This would have been the perfect springboard for a Wayne's World type story with our protagonist being exploited by a large corporation. Alas Finn and Rolfe seem to lose interest in this plot line...which is why we end up with a finale consisting of a chatty alien a shiny spaceship and a giant existencethreatening monster. Rolfe is accompanied by a surprisingly large cast. Most of the performers do what they can with the material but there isn't really much depth to the proceedings so much of them are essentially cardboard cutouts. Nerdy Sidekick Zany alien Warhungry General. I get that this is kind of The Point  but there needs to be more to spoof than purely pointing out that you know your way around clichs and conventions. It's a little ironic that by attempting to make the scale of this movie bigger they end up showing the production up as far more amateurish. It seems that Finn and Rolfe dreamed a little too big in the scripting stage and rather than reign things in with knowledge of budgeting they simply kept things exactly as they were as they entered production. The result of this is that we get a huge amount of greenscreen miniatures and rubber suits. Yes there's a charm to it and Rolfe as a big fan of Godzilla is obviously paying tributes but it does make this seem more like the web sketch it came from than the Movie it yearns to be. I should stress that I didn't dislike AVGN  The Movie. It's far too long shave off 40 minutes and it would be far tighter and I was a little distracted during the sagging second third but it's always watchable. It's certainly more entertaining than the output of The Asylum with which it shares a similar look. And yet I feel this is a missed opportunity. It's disappointing that Rolfe and Finn were so focused on pastiching monster movies and capers rather than creating a movie as original as the web series that inspired it.I leave you with the fact that Kevin Smith made his debut movie Clerks for less than 30000. James Rolfe and Kevin Finn had 10 times that amount and made Angry Video Game Nerd  The Movie.";

That being said the movie simply was a  let down. For all the build up all the hype and the anticipation of  the nerd reviewing what could be debated as the worst game ever created  in E.T. it simply was not a good film.  There were some enjoyable moments like Nathan Barnatt's cameo or Doug  Walker's cameo but aside from that there really isn't much too talk  about.  The jokes were the same things you'd see in your average episode of the  webseries the script was decent but in the end juggled too many ideas  and ended up being very convoluted.  For what it's worth with a budget of 300k there are worse movies out  there and if you're a fan you will find some enjoyment out of it.  Personally his films like The Deader the Better or The legend of the  blue hole were much more enjoyable than this. Maybe it's a growing up  thing maybe I've grown past the humor or maybe it just feels dated  I'm not sure. The film left a very sour taste in my mouth and I would  have much rather seen multiple AVGN episodes as opposed to this  mediocre film.  Seriously though why do the fans have to ride his dick so hard? If you  keep telling someone something is amazing when it's not they'll  continue to put out the same mediocre crap. It's out of criticism that  they decide to work harder and put more effort into creating something  great. To the fans that give this film 1010 you need to learn to form  your own opinions and not be another sheep in the heard. Don't ride his  dick look at this film honestly. Especially when he can be so critical  of other peoples work but doesn't have very many critics of his own.".

James Rolfe took all his frustrations funny and odd moments one experiences while playing those old retro games and created a series that not only old school gamers enjoy but also the younger generations because it introduces them in a humorous way how gaming used to be. It's a clever idea and executed in an efficient way. The show makes fun of the so bad it's good moments and most importantly feels genuine. The movie however... well where do I start? Its not that much of a problem that the movie immediately feels amateurish. That is pretty much to be expected after all this is a lowbudget production and his first time at a project this big. The same goes for the plot acting writing special effects etc. Some of it is deliberately that way. But even at the lowered expectations I can't help it not to feel disappointed. The main issue here is that it tries to be so much more than it actually is. For a series that is about a guy expressing his frustrations on an old game or movie it sure strays far away form it. And this is where it loses all the charm that makes the series work. It never leaves enough room for the nerd to do what he always does. Too much of it is wasted on the buildup and on things that just aren't relevant to the series. His hilarious rants are replaced by incredibly cheesy dialog lame jokes and bad slapstick. There isn't even an actual game in it instead you get some imitation called Eee Tee which is understandable since they would have to get the license but the letdown here is that the movie is all about getting him to review it and not about the review itself. There isn't much game in it. What is kinda a saving grace for a movie like The Wizard is completely absent here.It goes for the sobaditsgoodhumor but being that the movie is so selfaware about it it always ends up feeling forced like it deliberately lets something shitty happen and then just expects you to laugh it up. The first half of the movie drags on and almost bored me out. The second half was better mainly due to the action Godzillastyle scenes which were fun but ultimately are wasted because it ends absurdly quick with a poor conclusion.So was the movie worth the wait and the sacrifices? Probably only for the diehard AVGN fanboys. Everyone else will likely agree that the amount of episodes he could've made in the meantime would've been so much more worth it. For James and his crew I hope it's a valuable lesson and that he stays humble about it. AVGN isn't exactly movie friendly material so I at least can applaud his attempt. It is ironic that the movie thematizes the shitty is the new good idea yet tries to promote the same thing for itself while completely failing to deliver any good laughs or at least make it feel authentic. The fun the crew apparently had while making it never showed on the screen. Trash can be fun if done right but that's not the case here. It's just so bad it's bad.".

Some of the Nerd's James Rolfe reviews are great classics like Bugs Bunny and Batman for old video game consoles. For this movie? He obviously wasn't thinking straight. At first it seemed like a good movie. It's very different from the Nerd's classic video game reviewing style. Some of the classic reviews featured guest speakers but this movie's first problem occurs when a character named Cooper appears. Why does this need to happen? Cooper's character feels completely unnecessary and was never established in any previous review or within this movie itself. How would you like it if you were watching a movie when suddenly a random character appears without any introduction or development? Why did James Rolfe think this would be a good idea? Did he think it would be more realistic? This is quite possibly one of the most annoying things any movie could do. Although Cooper is constantly trying to convince the Nerd to review an old ATARI video game E.T. but Cooper feels very shallow as a character while constantly trying to do this.Why does the Nerd constantly complain and refuse to review the E.T. game despite Cooper and Mandi's constant nagging when he's reviewed horrible game titles in the past Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Many of the comedy elements in this movie feel like cheap gags such as the General Dark Onward getting his arms cutoff by accidents as he attempts to pursue the Nerd throughout the majority of the movie. Another cheap gag was Cooper's character falling from houses and off cliffs filmed using a dummy. One of the worst things about this movie was how the character Mandi was handled. She is constantly placed on the receiving end of jokes. By the time Mandi is thrownup on used as a cheap sounds like innuendo in the next room but actually isn't joke captured by the General Dark Onward and abandoned when she needed help I actually felt bad for Mandi. The Nerds before birds gag didn't add up to any of the fun in this movie. In the movie the actual review of E.T. doesn't take place until during the end credits. Any fan of the Nerd knows that the entire episode shows the video game review is meant to be the main element. The AVGN tradition is meant to go like this the nerd introduces an old classic video game spending the majority of the time talking about the game's worst flaws while swearing and throwing fits of rage. The actual E.T. review lacks many of these nuanced elements. Perhaps this movie would have been better if it featured a series of about four reviews? Rather than an entire movie entirely focused on one? Some of the puzzles are too hard to figure out. Take this dead end for example. Would you guess you have to pass through this wall? How? You have to kneel down with a red crystal and....oops one sec...Most of the characters have things to say which aren't important at all. So why pay attention to them? The giant robot that appears while looking cool despite the low budget felt adjacent to the actual plot and felt onedimensional. The ending sucks too.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you liked the trailers you will probably like the movie but if you had doubts about the new characters and the writing right off the bat you will probably think like me.I'm a fan of the AVGN from the beginning and will always be a fan.But that movie is not wellwritten. Not well at all. Some people that were at the Fantasia film festival reported that all jokes were met with roaring laughter but I was at the same screening and did not experience that. The laughs were scarce and only a few jokes are really clever and well written in the dialogue. So most of the movie was silence and polite laughs once in a while. About 10 real laughs.The writing is REALLY subpar and underwhelming. Might that be the contribution of Kevin Finn compared to James Rolfe writing alone his episodes of AVGN? I don't know and don't want to dump the blame too easily on one person.It seemed like the wits the cleverness of James scripts usual AVGN episodes were gone and all that stayed was a naive unsubtle script and dialogues. Most of it is contrived a little stupid and clichd.The effects are good and fun there is some really cool model work there and I found that the effect shots and the editing were really well done. I know a lot of things were done in postproduction but it doesn't show the movie holds very well together.If only the writing was there to support the rest of the movie and make it funny... That should have been the bone that holds all that meat together but it fails.The sidekick of James is naive annoying and stupid. Not really the actor's fault because his lines are so bad... They should have went after all for Mike Matei. I know he's camera shy and everything but I felt people wanted to see people they knew and would pardon a couple of acting mishaps if need be. We needed a cynical witty sidekick not a naive idiot making bad jokes over bad jokes. Sometimes the same bad joke like 5 times during the entire runtime like his mother calling him over and over.The nerd girl character arc is mostly boring and unnecessary. They could have cut 5 or 10 minutes from the movie for her alone. All her interactions with the bad guys are cringe worthy. Here again I feel the actress is good but that the material is seriously lacking.It's like they thought it was funny on paper with the quick repartees and physical humour but it doesn't connect so the uncleverness of the dialogue and script REALLY shows.It is unfortunate like I said because the movie by itself could be very fun! They could have cut at least 30 minutes of bad dialogue EASY if you ask me. The whole thing felt slow and didn't pick up quick enough. Should definitely have been more fastpaced and less relying on the sidekick and nerd girl. We were there to see James after all. Having a wellwritten better sidekick could have worked in though!

	onyx:emotionText "If you liked the trailers you will probably like the movie but if you had doubts about the new characters and the writing right off the bat you will probably think like me.I'm a fan of the AVGN from the beginning and will always be a fan.But that movie is not wellwritten. Not well at all. Some people that were at the Fantasia film festival reported that all jokes were met with roaring laughter but I was at the same screening and did not experience that. The laughs were scarce and only a few jokes are really clever and well written in the dialogue. So most of the movie was silence and polite laughs once in a while. About 10 real laughs.The writing is REALLY subpar and underwhelming. Might that be the contribution of Kevin Finn compared to James Rolfe writing alone his episodes of AVGN? I don't know and don't want to dump the blame too easily on one person.It seemed like the wits the cleverness of James scripts usual AVGN episodes were gone and all that stayed was a naive unsubtle script and dialogues. Most of it is contrived a little stupid and clichd.The effects are good and fun there is some really cool model work there and I found that the effect shots and the editing were really well done. I know a lot of things were done in postproduction but it doesn't show the movie holds very well together.If only the writing was there to support the rest of the movie and make it funny... That should have been the bone that holds all that meat together but it fails.The sidekick of James is naive annoying and stupid. Not really the actor's fault because his lines are so bad... They should have went after all for Mike Matei. I know he's camera shy and everything but I felt people wanted to see people they knew and would pardon a couple of acting mishaps if need be. We needed a cynical witty sidekick not a naive idiot making bad jokes over bad jokes. Sometimes the same bad joke like 5 times during the entire runtime like his mother calling him over and over.The nerd girl character arc is mostly boring and unnecessary. They could have cut 5 or 10 minutes from the movie for her alone. All her interactions with the bad guys are cringe worthy. Here again I feel the actress is good but that the material is seriously lacking.It's like they thought it was funny on paper with the quick repartees and physical humour but it doesn't connect so the uncleverness of the dialogue and script REALLY shows.It is unfortunate like I said because the movie by itself could be very fun! They could have cut at least 30 minutes of bad dialogue EASY if you ask me. The whole thing felt slow and didn't pick up quick enough. Should definitely have been more fastpaced and less relying on the sidekick and nerd girl. We were there to see James after all. Having a wellwritten better sidekick could have worked in though!  I am still very proud of the final product as far as EVERYTHING else besides the dialogue because it looks GREAT and feels GREAT.It is only my opinion and I don't intend to offend I still love James and his work. I will still support the guy in his future endeavours and WILL buy the movie to help him finance whatever else he might want to do.";

What I expected going into the movie was just the Nerd going about his usual day. A lot of immersion into his story was removed by the instant flood of look how famous I am. Don't get me wrong I'm really proud of Mr. Rolfe and he deserves the credit for trying and working so hard but it really put me off with how full of himself he seemed through most of this. He's the ANGRY Video Game Nerd not the narcissistic.It is James' character so he's allowed to create it any way he wants but it really rubbed me the wrong way. It seemed so prideful.Second... the dialogue is some of the worst I've ever heard and the worst acted. I'm sorry but it was just terribly corny. I know that it's SORT OF in the spirit of the AVGN but he had a system that worked fine in his reviews that seemed a bit... tweaked in the movie to fit mass appeal. I know James is a child at heart but there's a difference between being youthful and acting like a kid. In fact I have a feeling that if I saw this film as a CHILD I might like it better. As an adult it was just bad. Really bad. Unwatchably bad.I can't give James a hard time for the special effects. He's not a megamillionaire and he had to work with the budget he had. Some of the effects looked welldone. Others were... embarrassing.The story had potential to be amusing but what killed most of the comedic value for me was the black buddy Cooper. He had no purpose in the film other than to crack bad jokes and annoy everyone. I don't know if his dialogue was written that way on purpose but every time he opened his mouth I wanted to punch it repeatedly.Overall I love AVGN reviews... but I think James should just stick to those and hopefully never make a sequel. I applaud him for putting in all of the effort it's not easy to make a movie all by yourself with very little advice on how to do so and I can tell he tried really hard. It just was a massive waste of time and money.I'd rather have a buffalo take a diarrhea dump in my ear than watch it a second time.".

That's not funny it could have been so much funnier if they had just made him throw it out of the window angrily or something.

	schema:reviewBody "I take no pleasure in giving James a bad review for his long awaited feature as I have been a fan of his work since watching his review for Castlevania 2 on MySpace. Since then I feel like I've grown up with James and have always loved his nostalgic trips back to the past. In thinking about reviewing a beloved webseries turned feature film I feel it is important to state why I love the source material The Angry Video Game Nerd webseries. My passion for this series can be broken down to a few compartments a My love of video game nostalgia being brought back to the past usually when I'm surfing for a Nerd video to rewatch I shop by what game I'm in the mood to revisit b video game history I may be unfamiliar with like Swordquest or Atari Porn when the Nerd plays angry historian and c what James Rolfe brings to these reviews it occurred to me that there are tons of nostalgic video game reviews and I have ZERO interest in watching them there is something about James reviewing these games that feels special like seeing an old friend again and playing the games you both grew up with. That said The Angry Video Game Nerd movie encompasses none of the reasons I have loved the webseries for so long. SPOILERSThe movie starts with the clever premise of the Angry NerdJames Rolfe character slowly learning that the Internet videos he makes intended to warn his audience about the horrors of bad games have had the opposite effect his fans are now more interested in playing these games! If this wasn't horrifying enough for the Nerd now game companies want to intentionally make their games bad to fit their audience's lovelust for bad games! And even worse these game companies want the Nerd to be a spokesman for this new generation of intentionally bad games!The rest of the movie could have written itself as a type of Wayne's World corporate America doesn't understand why something is cool plot but the filmmakers seem to grow tired of such a limited scope rather quickly and this premise is forgotten for the remaining ninety minutes. As you can imagine the rest goes downhill fast... The film has a distinct Nickleodian feel the characters presented are flat childlike and given clichd dialogue with nothing very interesting to do.James seems to be enamored with the success of his series and hammers the viewer relentlessly with his own popularity for the opening halfhour. How enamored is James with the success of The Angry Video Game Nerd? A fan of the Nerd purchases a game from the store the Nerd works at solely because the Nerd spits on it like some kind of 1980s rock god. James doesn't seem to understand the difference between himself and the Nerd. James Rolfe makes Internet videos which feature the Angry Video Game Nerd. In the film the Angry Nerd both makes Internet videos and seemingly doesn't understand technology beyond a Commodore 64 and record player. The character does not ever lend itself for being in a feature leaving James to spend the entire movie either enjoying his success as James Rolfe or frowning as the Nerd.The film uses too many nonactors as extras something that may be possible with careful direction and editing but not here it took me out of the movie every single time. The writing is awful a fact that cannot be blamed on the budgetary limitations. The movie abandons the reasons why the webseries worked it has very little to do with video games or nostalgia and you almost feel as though the only reason it features the Nerd is to trick the viewer into watching it in the first place.The movie is FAR too long and takes a lot of its sensibilities from Troma. There is an entire scene where the Nerd's video game store boss threatens the Nerd at gunpoint to sell a Call of Duty clone. Not only does this scene drag but is rendered irrelevant and forgotten for the duration of the movie. Worst of all the movie isn't funny and when it tries to be funny it made me feel embarrassed to be watching it ie the fan conga line.  I waned to think this film was OK I even told a VERY skeptical friend that it would take a lot for me to think it wasn't AT LEAST 'okay' Well that is exactly what they did The Angry Video Game Nerd movie is aggressively bad intelligence insulting and a waste of time.".

My passion for this series can be broken down to a few compartments a My love of video game nostalgia being brought back to the past usually when I'm surfing for a Nerd video to rewatch I shop by what game I'm in the mood to revisit b video game history I may be unfamiliar with like Swordquest or Atari Porn when the Nerd plays angry historian and c what James Rolfe brings to these reviews it occurred to me that there are tons of nostalgic video game reviews and I have ZERO interest in watching them there is something about James reviewing these games that feels special like seeing an old friend again and playing the games you both grew up with. That said The Angry Video Game Nerd movie encompasses none of the reasons I have loved the webseries for so long. SPOILERSThe movie starts with the clever premise of the Angry NerdJames Rolfe character slowly learning that the Internet videos he makes intended to warn his audience about the horrors of bad games have had the opposite effect his fans are now more interested in playing these games! If this wasn't horrifying enough for the Nerd now game companies want to intentionally make their games bad to fit their audience's lovelust for bad games! And even worse these game companies want the Nerd to be a spokesman for this new generation of intentionally bad games!The rest of the movie could have written itself as a type of Wayne's World corporate America doesn't understand why something is cool plot but the filmmakers seem to grow tired of such a limited scope rather quickly and this premise is forgotten for the remaining ninety minutes. As you can imagine the rest goes downhill fast... The film has a distinct Nickleodian feel the characters presented are flat childlike and given clichd dialogue with nothing very interesting to do.James seems to be enamored with the success of his series and hammers the viewer relentlessly with his own popularity for the opening halfhour. How enamored is James with the success of The Angry Video Game Nerd? A fan of the Nerd purchases a game from the store the Nerd works at solely because the Nerd spits on it like some kind of 1980s rock god. James doesn't seem to understand the difference between himself and the Nerd. James Rolfe makes Internet videos which feature the Angry Video Game Nerd. In the film the Angry Nerd both makes Internet videos and seemingly doesn't understand technology beyond a Commodore 64 and record player. The character does not ever lend itself for being in a feature leaving James to spend the entire movie either enjoying his success as James Rolfe or frowning as the Nerd.The film uses too many nonactors as extras something that may be possible with careful direction and editing but not here it took me out of the movie every single time. The writing is awful a fact that cannot be blamed on the budgetary limitations. The movie abandons the reasons why the webseries worked it has very little to do with video games or nostalgia and you almost feel as though the only reason it features the Nerd is to trick the viewer into watching it in the first place.The movie is FAR too long and takes a lot of its sensibilities from Troma. There is an entire scene where the Nerd's video game store boss threatens the Nerd at gunpoint to sell a Call of Duty clone. Not only does this scene drag but is rendered irrelevant and forgotten for the duration of the movie. Worst of all the movie isn't funny and when it tries to be funny it made me feel embarrassed to be watching it ie the fan conga line.  I waned to think this film was OK I even told a VERY skeptical friend that it would take a lot for me to think it wasn't AT LEAST 'okay' Well that is exactly what they did The Angry Video Game Nerd movie is aggressively bad intelligence insulting and a waste of time.";

I am a big fan of AVGN Monster Madness all the stuff James  Co have put out over the years so when I heard he was making a fulllength movie based on the AVGN I was pretty psyched. As soon as it was available for rental or download I rushed over to Vimeo and rented it and when all was said and done I was completely let down and annoyed that he was even charging people money to watch this embarrassment. I guess the plot is just not strong enough for a fulllength film in the first place basically the nerd is super famous and the entire film shoves that idea down your throat until you choke. All his fans want him to review the stupid Atari game E.T. chanting and acting like some kind of twisted cult begging him to reveal his thoughts on the game but he hates it so much he swears he never will. Then all of a sudden we are following around a bunch of random characters that have nothing whatsoever to do with the AVGN. The special effects are terrible the entire cast seems like rejects from failed Disney or Nickelodeon shows and to make everything even worse the film doesn't really have anything to do with old Nintendo games It's about aliens and gigantic Japanese demonicGodzilla monsters! I don't even know what else to say DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME. After about 30 minutes you will want to shut it off and that's what I did at first but then FORCED myself to sit through it so I could see what happened. The ending is complete trash the nerd chick who is supposed to be the love interest in the film suddenly starts making out with Cooper the token black sidekick and the nerd reviews E.T. finally and decides it's actually a challenging and fun game. What the hell were they thinking? I guess they were trying to cash in and sadly that's what this is a lame attempt at making some money. I hope James retires the nerd after this I don't even feel like seeing another episode now the movie killed the show for me. It's nothing like the web series at all it's like a terrible Nickelodeon show that occasionally shows the nerd guzzling a beer or frowning and that's about it. I feel bad writing such a terrible review but it's reality He didn't take us back to the past he just made a terrible film that sucked a".

	schema:reviewBody "I've been a fan since 2008 first new episode i caught was the Wizard movie review episode. Needless to say i really enjoy the show having rewatched many episodes over and over. As we all know the nerd was always a mix of clever sarcastic humor with childish and fantastic elements. I always preferred The earlier episodes to episodes like the Texas chainsaw massacre or the rob the robot episodes. In other words i never really enjoyed the fantastic elements of the show as much. Its weird with the nerd. We have episodes like the Atari Elemental prize games and then we have the nerdy turd and stupid things like that regardless i always enjoyed rolfe s work and i think he is a great guy. The reason why i hated the movie so much is because it is completely focused on the absurd elements of the show. We never get any of the clever sarcastic nerd analysis. Its like avgn always goes down one of two 2 roads One of well written ironic and funny reviews pointing out the actual flaws of the game which resonates with fans like me who actually played those games he is reviewing and another one that i honestly don't know who it appeals to i guess kids but most people who actually knows what he is talking about are like 26 to 30 years old now. In the end i found the movie very unfunny almost unbearable difficult to watch. On James s defense I've seen many cinemassacre reviews in which he praises shitty movies that i wouldn't touch with 10 meter a stick so at least i know he is being true to himself and to his taste. Its just not my cup of tea i cannot watch a movie like TMNT 2 and enjoy it for its ridiculousness. Its quite painful for me to be bashing this movie and criticizing the work of this great guy who is a true hero in my eyes but it could have been better because the nerd has great funny episodes that i can still rewatch and enjoy. The Deader the better and the blue hole movies were quite great so i know james is a capable movie maker. If he had managed to at least find a balance.. The Friday the 13th episode is quite funny even with the theatrical elements because he does make some of his funniest points on that episode. its just too bad about the avgn movie just terrible. To be fair its not all bad the acting wasn't as horrible as everybody is commenting I really enjoyed the acting on the part of mandi and dr zandor the small alien was also quite funny and well voiced. The problem is The movie is a disgrace in two major aspects 1  the writing propably the main reason why i believe some people thought it was horribly acted. 2  the story and all the major action events in the movie are just too stupid its difficult to believe anyone would enjoy something like this. The only part of the movie i actually liked was the end credits with the actual review of ET.".

	schema:reviewBody "I should start with praise for James Rolfe and the AVGN webseries because a lot is deserved. He's a bright spot in the sea of internet hosts  a unique and effortlessly charming comedian with genuine and endearing passion for what he does. Watching his film reviews is like listening to the wisest of old friends. Watching 'AVGN' really is like being taken back to the past. At its best the show's nostalgia wit and selfconscious tongueincheek silliness work brilliantly.But it gives me no pleasure at all to say  this is Rolfe at his worst. It would be unfair to complain that the film detracts from the nature of the show  this production was clearly meant to take the sketch character into a different medium and construct a story for him. That's a worthy goal and suggests a genuine intention to expand. But sadly judging the film on its own merits there is a lot to criticize. I hesitate to make a list but there's a lot.New characters for 'the Nerd' to interact with are a fine idea but these are underwritten flat extremely generic and almost all poorlyplayed. The second character could essentially be cut from the script here without any effect. He's a sidekick for the sake of having one with no purpose appeal or character traits of his own compare Cooper to Garth in Wayne's World.An epic plot and action scenes could have worked here despite the budget if they were made carefully. Sadly the effects seem more and more rushed as the film goes on. It's a noble goal to fill an independent movie with model shots and puppets.... but not using toy vehicles and a puppet with no mouth articulation. The third act is composed mostly of these.This is a film that tries to do a lot but seems to put little effort into any element and so we're left with a mismatched sortof demo reel of what the writer directors would like to accomplish character comedy surrealism romance ensemble work effects a zombie sequence which seems especially tackedon creature effects spoof fight scenes road movie elements  but all of them subpar and thrown into one pot. The film seems 'out of control'. Watching the puppet scenes hearing the bad dubbing on its static lips it's very difficult to consider this a 'movie' in a real sense.It feels rushed throughout  especially in the script oddly enough considering how much time was available before filming. The movie features very very old jokes  many that I remember already hearing in other films at one point the old 'psed off is better than psed on' gag is rolled out. The characters are clichd a running joke focuses on an overbearing mother phoning her son and clucking orders at him  at the risk of sounding cruel get out of bed Joooohn get out of bed!.Occasionally the movie will break the fourth wall to comment on its reliance of clich for example the lengthy 'girl fight' between two attractive actresses with no real purpose but pointing out a bad slightly misogynist? storythread hardly justifies boring us with it for so long in the first place. As well the movie opens with a significant portion of recycled jokes from the show  this might be regarded as a fun 'shout out' or selfindulgent reference for the fans but that seems like a stretch. Surely those fans would have preferred fresh material?There is also a certain element of selfcongratulation in the film which becomes sickly very quickly and never lets up. To open the film with a barrage of triumphant 'favourite lines' and far far too many clips of reallife fans praising him as though he were the messiah immediately seems deeply unprofessional and selfpromoting. This never stops  the adoring crowds are present in many scenes  and never seems ironic. James just spends a lot of time in the film receiving compliments for the show. Cameos abound long after their novelty has worn off and rarely with any direction or clever use of the faces  Lloyd Kaufman mugs into a static camera in his living room for some time. Nothing is reignedin.Of course a director's first film often falls flat. Not everyone is lucky enough to open with 'Duel' or 'Clerks'  but this feels like an unusually flawed first attempt. It's overlong badlypaced crammed with shoddy and lazy effects and succeeds with only one of its large cast of characters  the Nerd himself an appropriately weary protagonist here although even he is flawed saddled as he is with a confused and convoluted arc I found it very difficult to tell what his motivations were at most points and given little time to shine. He is far too often the straight man in his own movie.As a fan of Rolfe's I hope he learns from this step rather than just enjoying the trappings of having released a film and played in theaters. At times 'Angry Video Game Nerd the Movie' veers on being a vanity project. A glance at almost any video on his website will demonstrate that he has a LOT more to give. This is a comedian and filmmaker with exceptional talent a deep love of his craft and exceptional onscreen charisma.He deserves a real movie. Some of us have been waiting for him to realize his great ambition and make one for a decade now. Sadly this is not it.".

	schema:headline " Unmemorable Lackluster";
	schema:reviewBody "I guess I should start off my saying that I've been a big fan of AVGN for at least 5 or 6 years now so this review may be subconsciously biased for or against due to this fact.As a fan of the web series I just didn't feel like the movie lived up to the episodes. The writing particularly dialog but also plot points at times was pretty bad. The acting itself was good for the most part it was just the writing. The jokes are completely unfunny. Reminiscent of classic AVGN sure but not up to par at all. Most of the similarities come from jokes that were recycled from the web show and the new material was facepalm worthy. A lot of clichs were used which is fine for a film like this where they were obviously just trying to mock clichs and clich films but it wasn't pulled off satisfactorily.The effects were hit or miss. I didn't of course expect Hollywoodlevel special effects and I realize that similar to the clich thing they wanted some degree of cheese as a throwback to old low budget cult classics but some of them were painfully bad. There was one scene where there were robots walking around that were clearly people dressed in cardboard boxes wrapped in tin foil. Some of the other effects however were surprisingly well done and I applaud them on that.The plot holes were really hard to ignore. Where did Cooper AVGN's new sidekick come from for instance? He has never been a part of the AVGN universe in the past and no back story at all is given as to how or why his character ended up in the film. There was also a romantic hookup between two characters that had no prior chemistry and never expressed a love interest toward each other at all previously which was just bizarre and felt way out in left field.Lastly I felt a strong sense of arrogance in the way that the AVGN character was portrayed given that James wrote the movie. From the very beginning he's touted as the voice of all gamers the world over and THE authority on game critique  even to the point where there was one scene where a crazed fan bought an unwanted item simply because AVGN spit on it. I felt this strong self importance and shameless selfpromotion vibe coming off of much of the film.I think the movie had potential but I think opportunities were missed. I also feel that a lot more care could have been taken in the actual writing and many scenes should not have made the cut for one reason or another where they could have filled the extra time from the cuts with scenes that filled the plot holes.I realize that this was an ambitious project with a low budget but I feel that they probably tried to over extend spending too much of the budget on things that were either unnecessary or could have been cheesed down slightly and they cheesed out too much on things that could have had a bit more of the budget put into them.I'm giving it a 410 mostly just for effort but it's actually just a pretty bad film and would only get a 4 or higher from a fan as it has no redeeming qualities to anyone not familiar with AVGN.".

	onyx:emotionText "I guess I should start off my saying that I've been a big fan of AVGN for at least 5 or 6 years now so this review may be subconsciously biased for or against due to this fact.As a fan of the web series I just didn't feel like the movie lived up to the episodes. The writing particularly dialog but also plot points at times was pretty bad. The acting itself was good for the most part it was just the writing. The jokes are completely unfunny. Reminiscent of classic AVGN sure but not up to par at all. Most of the similarities come from jokes that were recycled from the web show and the new material was facepalm worthy. A lot of clichs were used which is fine for a film like this where they were obviously just trying to mock clichs and clich films but it wasn't pulled off satisfactorily.The effects were hit or miss. I didn't of course expect Hollywoodlevel special effects and I realize that similar to the clich thing they wanted some degree of cheese as a throwback to old low budget cult classics but some of them were painfully bad. There was one scene where there were robots walking around that were clearly people dressed in cardboard boxes wrapped in tin foil. Some of the other effects however were surprisingly well done and I applaud them on that.The plot holes were really hard to ignore. Where did Cooper AVGN's new sidekick come from for instance? He has never been a part of the AVGN universe in the past and no back story at all is given as to how or why his character ended up in the film. There was also a romantic hookup between two characters that had no prior chemistry and never expressed a love interest toward each other at all previously which was just bizarre and felt way out in left field.Lastly I felt a strong sense of arrogance in the way that the AVGN character was portrayed given that James wrote the movie. From the very beginning he's touted as the voice of all gamers the world over and THE authority on game critique  even to the point where there was one scene where a crazed fan bought an unwanted item simply because AVGN spit on it.

It could be a sincere down to earth comedy about a nerdy gamer that becomes a celebrity but instead it is a crazy mess about aliens and some esoteric side plot about a ancient robot god or something.I really do not think it is a matter of budget the story is really really bad and unfunny embarrassing really. It could be like CLERKS with no budget whatsoever and be great it is a really bad movie for any budget. And 350k is a big budget for him it is really not a matter of money.

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS AHEAD!!!I don't typically do movie reviews. This is only my 2nd or 3rd. But like a lot of the reviewers here I was a fan of AVGN since 2006 or so when the first game reviews started reaching a larger audience I was watching when he called himself The Angry Nintendo Nerd. I looked forward to them the way my parents' generation looked forward to a new episode of their favorite television shows every week. I was an 80's Nintendo kid too and suffered through a lot of the same horrible games. I was also really impressed by the Nerd's hardware reviews i.e. the CDI review an obscure system I'd always wanted to know more about and see in action. There was a cynicism there in the beginning and the Nerd was showing us how these game companies cut corners and put out substandard products to gullible kids and their clueless parents. There's no doubt that by 2012 definitely 2013 the regular episodes became a little more silly. Beating up Bugs Bunny beating up the Joker OK... I'll roll with it. I could do without it but whatever. The ninja from the Ninja Gaiden episode was good. And I get it  Rolfe is a filmmaker and he wants to incorporate that into his most successful project. Somehow merge the two together. OK.So then this movie project began. And there were fewer AVGN episodes and I sorta lost interest. For a while I'd check back for new episodes every so often but it became clear that it was just going to be James and Mike playing games out of character indefinitely with the sporadic and even hokier AVGN review thrown in here and there. The James  Mike stuff is alright but obviously it lacks the depth and research of the Nerd's best early reviews. So I figured this movie has got to be something really spectacular if it drew Rolfe away from his sure thing the bread  butter of his Cinemassacre enterprise. Or maybe it was a big risk all the chips in the pot sort of gamble. I don't really know. I know he relied on fans to contribute heavily to the finances. I know that if I were one of those fans who contributed to this film I'd want a refund. And an apology. I mean where to begin. Its two hours of my life I'll never get back. Two hours I barely managed to sit through. I was checking Facebook and reading more interesting things on my smartphone while this thing was playing. It was just so boring. I'm not going to necessarily agree with everyone who thinks the whole movie was a giant egotrip James himself doesn't strike me as egotistical. I think it was just really hard to come up with a plot centered around a video game reviewer and the natural direction to go is to make that reviewer very important somehow so he can be the focus of the movie. Some of the angry fans wanted to see well more anger. They wanted to see more reviewy type stuff. But it isn't easy to have a movie with a plot jam a review in there and keep the story rolling. That's why they shoehorned it in during the credits  and why it was so disappointing. Even the E.T. I'm sorry Eee Tee review fell flat after sitting through two hours of that crap. It was boring like everything that came before it. I think the most pathetic thing about this is that you can tell they were somewhat going for a so bad its good feel. What else can you do with a budget of only a few hundred K? The problem is that it completely fails. The bad jokes aren't so bad they're funny they're just bad. The bad special effects aren't so bad they're funny they're just bad. It's like someone had the thought we don't have enough money for good special effects or even bad but passable special effects  instead of just having a story that doesn't rely so much on special effects lets just put up some cardboard and get some Hot Wheels and I can use my lighter to set things on fire. In closing this movie didn't need to be made and I'm glad I didn't contribute to it financially or pay to watch it. The worst thing about it all I'm soured on AVGN permanently even the old reviews I liked.".

	schema:reviewBody "Well it finally arrived after years of waiting. Sadly for James it turns out that many people didn't like his character's outing to the big screen. However I can't help but thinking a lot of the disgruntlement is misplaced. Don't get me wrong it's not what most people would consider a good film but I think I should offer an explanation of why it turned out the way it did.First this is more of a Cinemassacre feature than an Angry Video Game Nerd feature and you will be more inclined to like it if you have spent your time watching the endless movie reviews on the Cinemassacre website. James is a fan of what a lot of people would describe as trash and a lot of this film contains schlock content  dumb characters corny jokes and silly special effects. Bad  over the top acting and silly dialogue therefore isn't really the point for this type of film  it's a given. If you don't like this sort of thing then you aren't going to like this movie period.The reality though is that people love the Nerd character first and foremost above Cinemassacre and sadly he does suffer mildly in the context of this movie. His dislike of E.T. is taken from an amusing irrational hatred into irrational behaviour and his insistence that he won't review the game is a card played a little too strongly. Still I really don't think the criticisms that there are ego issues going on here are valid. The Nerd is an enormously popular character and people have flocked to cinemas nationwide across the states to support their hero. James showed his popularity in the movie for the purposes of a joke being that the fictional public assumed that the Nerd videos are for comedyfun which obviously they are which dismayed the fictional Nerd character who simply hated the games  he is famous for the wrong reason. I think this has been wildly and widely misinterpreted as James stroking his own ego and I think that's unfair. It's driving to the plot point to the film.The plot of course is ridiculous and silly. It's a fun concept but gets bogged down by being the film being too long which makes the plot too slow. Things do get rather confusing towards the end as the Nerd's companions go off on their own miniadventures but to no real consequence. People just want to see the Nerd. As for the ludicrous monster that appears towards the end we are right back in Cinemassacre territory with plastic models and men in rubber suits  the ridiculousness is the point.Regardless of the target audience the film is at least partially a comedy and it does raise a few smirks. As the laughs are more frequent and punchier in the Nerd episodes this has left a lot of people disappointed. What we all love is seeing the Nerd spit venom at  games but he's not doing that here until the credits of the film which is probably the most entertaining and interesting part. The various cameos and fan moments are kind tributes but are mostly goofy and unnecessary.I suppose I can summarise by saying that this is not the Nerd movie many of us were hoping for but just a Bmovie starring the Nerd. It was an ambitious project in which an amateur filmmaker had the means to pay homage to the films he loved. Unfortunately this was at the expense of the character that the audience loved which is what everyone really wanted to see. However I have a huge amount of respect for the project as a whole. What James has achieved with his Nerd character is impressive and a lot of blood sweat and tears went into this movie. There's a lot of heart here and that context gives it a special charm. Standing it by itself though against slicker and meaner films it's an easy target for criticism. But to do so in the overly aggressive way that others have is to miss the point entirely.That's what I think anyway.".

But he's not a professional filmmaker he's more of an internet video maker.The jokes in this are quite poor.

That's fine for 15 minutes but when you keep up the bad acting for 2 hours the charm wears out very fast.Yes the overuse of the Nerd making references to fecal matter is just tiresome. It was tiresome in the show and it is no better here.The cinematography is lame and feels like a straight to DVD film than an actual movie. Even the trailer looked cheap and bad. This movie looks more like something you would see on the Syfy channel than a theatrical feature. The special effects in this movie are bad but are intentionally so for the sake of comedy like in Austin Powers Team America The Lego Movie Harry Hill's work and The Young Ones. But those movies and shows were actually funny.Here the joke doesn't work. It could be the really bad HD and straight to video feel that puts off the charm of the bad effects. Also the sloppy editing. There are some unfinished looking shots here.The movie is self aware it's low budget and tries to make fun of itself but it's just not funny. I'm not a fan of self deprecation. It's too winking at the audience for me.I will have to admit the score is very good. The opening theme is amazing and I like the theme Birds Before Nerds.If this was an internet movie like the TGWTG Anniversary specials it would've worked.

	schema:reviewBody "Being a huge AVGN fan I have been waiting for this movie from the very first moment it has been announced. Unfortunately for me the waiting was not worth it. The movie commits the biggest crime any comedy movie can commit  it is not funny. Actually it's kind of tired and boring and at times even cringeworthy. The jokes are old and forced the acting is mediocre at best and the pacing is way off. Do we really need to see all the Nerd praising every 5 minutes of the film? We know AVGN is famous. We get it it was supposed to be selfconscious satire. But in order for it to work you need to use it for something like plot development. But the movie goes nowhere with that leaving the viewer wondering if it was really a satire or maybe an actual pointless narcissism. The characters are boooooring and no one really gets a proper development. The plot is unimaginative and it jumps all around failing to focus on a specific event long enough to engage the viewer. It feels like the film could have worked if the team just picked a direction they wanted to go. Like if they went full batsht crazy with it without holding back. Instead the movie is stuck in this weird limbo between intentionally so bad it's good and we're trying to make a real blockbuster. As a result we have a mediocre mix of AVGN show and some Bcomedy movie with both parts interfering with each other and thus not working at all. The film has no identity.You know those movies that team TGWTG make sometimes like Kickassia? Those are actually funny because it feels that everyone there are just having fun while going full insane. That's not the case with AVGN and that's a bit sad. If you are a fan consider watching this but don't expect much. If you are not really into the AVGN then the movie has nothing to offer you at all.".

	schema:reviewBody "I would describe my expectations for the AVGN movie as cautiously optimistic and I think my expectations were met.Don't expect a full on comedy it's more of a comedy adventure film. The movie has plenty of scenes that aren't meant to be comedic they're meant to further the story characters or add dramatic tension. With all these points that make up the movie including the comedy script character interaction cinematography etc. I'd say they all the elements hit their mark most of the time.. but their are certainly times they don't.On the script The storyplot it's self was a lot of fun. It was enjoyable to see what was going to happen next. Blending the E.T. burial story with a lot of crazy nonsense and then tying it all up. The dialogue never felt like it was overtly unnatural with the exception of the Nerd... but that's part of his character to talk like that so I make an exception. It wasn't spectacular dialogue but it was never bad to a point that it took me out of the movie.The characters served there purposes for the most part... but I never felt like I was ever truly cared about the friendships. There just wasn't a lot of chemistry among the lead characters. The effects we're a lot of fun most of the time. I was very excited about the practical effects and they certainly got a lot of laughs at the theater I went to. I do have a few gripes though about the special effects. There are a few CGI touchups that just didn't work for me. The Nerd jumping away from Gun Fire and we see CGI dirt shoot up? You couldn't of had a practical effect for that? As far as practical effects go most made me laugh. But to try to be vague on spoilers there's a character in this movie relied very heavily on practical effects... and the character looks terrible. This didn't work for me because it was supposed to be an actual character that the leads interacted with... but I just couldn't by the character because of how fake it looked. Don't get me wrong it made me laugh when I first saw him but after that it was a distraction. I'm glad I saw it though. I took my wife to the movie and it's not like she doesn't like the avgn videos... they're just not her thing... but she even said she found the movie entertaining. I think if this movie can please a person who is not very familiar with the AVGN series then James Rolfe did something right.I look at this movie two ways 1. A mildly entertaining comedy adventure film. 2. Fantastic Accomplishment for James and everyone involvedincluding the budget provided by fans.".

It unintentionally shows the LACK of awareness that a truly evolved deeply aware character should have and be tormented about in order to deserve audience empathy or sympathy OR the lack of which is used to serve as a cautionary tale to the audience.

That is a testament to the supporting cast's talent and skills.Cal's eventual 'return' has nothing to do with character development transformation or evolution of consciousness. It has only to do with the ultimate capitulation that until something better comes along he may as well be back in his comfy cozy status quo of entitled enablement where the living is easy and no one will demand that he grow upsomething of which he is willfully incapable and uninterested in doing.The film could have been pointed and intentional about showing the traps and tragedies  the devastating effects of this kind of lack of conscience consciousness but it excuses and glorifies it instead  in fact it wallows in selfpity right along with the arrogant selfish emotionally stunted main character.and it sure sent chills up my spine when thinking of the recent revelations about convicted murderer Scott Peterson.If you want to see Crudup at his most nuanced and full of an exciting potential that has never been truly realized in my opinion see the underrated 'Inventing the Abbotts' ....".

	schema:reviewBody "Billy Crudup stars in this slow moving film as Cal an architect who one day just walks out on his loving wife and son. What Cal is in search of we know not but he is full of selfloathing for leaving and begins a drunken trek cross country. In his travels he meets a series of people who he treats like crap and then wallows in more self loathing and drink. The movie does end up with a moral Cal realizes that he had it pretty good at home but we don't realize this until we've sat through at least the first ninety minutes wondering where this movie and Cal for that matter are headed. Adding to the confusion are some flashback sequences that are never explained and have nothing to do with the ending whatsoever. The only bright spot is when Cal meets up with Dulcie Moore and you think Aha! I know where this movie is headed and then it doesn't go that way at all. And that's a shame. Dulcie's story line is dropped just as the movie takes a turn towards being remotely interesting and we are sent right back on Cal's boring journey. There is nothing redeemable in the character of Cal and what he needs is a swift kick to the butt. Add to that a soundtrack that is ninety percent Willie Nelson songs and you can see where a good shot of caffeine prior to watching this movie will come in handy. On an upnote the cinematography was beautiful it just should have been saved for a better movie. If you really need to be told that there's no place like home watch The Wizard of Oz instead.".

The movie does end up with a moral Cal realizes that he had it pretty good at home but we don't realize this until we've sat through at least the first ninety minutes wondering where this movie and Cal for that matter are headed. Adding to the confusion are some flashback sequences that are never explained and have nothing to do with the ending whatsoever. The only bright spot is when Cal meets up with Dulcie Moore and you think Aha! I know where this movie is headed and then it doesn't go that way at all. And that's a shame. Dulcie's story line is dropped just as the movie takes a turn towards being remotely interesting and we are sent right back on Cal's boring journey. There is nothing redeemable in the character of Cal and what he needs is a swift kick to the butt. Add to that a soundtrack that is ninety percent Willie Nelson songs and you can see where a good shot of caffeine prior to watching this movie will come in handy. On an upnote the cinematography was beautiful it just should have been saved for a better movie. If you really need to be told that there's no place like home watch The Wizard of Oz instead.";

Thanks to Billy Crudup the star of World Traveler this is a film worth taking a look. It will stay with the viewer for weeks to come.If you haven't watched the film please stop reading.The beginning of the film will disorient viewers not paying attention to this story about a man who one day walks out of his present prosperous life. What could he want when for all appearances he has it all. What we don't realize is that Cal's journey will bring him to deal with his own life and find closure as he gets involved in all the situations one sees him in the film.There is a point in the middle of the film where Cal meets an old school mate. It's clear that Jack played brilliantly by James LeGros has seen into Cal's soul and he didn't like what he saw. In a way Cal has such a personality that provokes a dislike in many of the people that comes in contact with him. In Jack's view Cal will never do anything that will matter in his life but obviously this long forgotten friend has no clue as to what's going on inside the drifter's head.What we don't realize is that Cal in turn is looking for the elusive father that abandoned him when he was young. In fact this is the surprise that is saved for the end and it rewards us by staying with the film that plays at different levels provoking us. Billy Crudup's work is extraordinary. This young actor proves he was meant to play Cal. No other actor comes to mind that could have projected the range Mr. Crudup shows with this depiction of Cal. In minor roles we see a lot of excellent actors. Julianne Moore is perfect as Dulcie. Cleavant Derricks is the kind Carl. Liane Balaban makes a sweet Meg. Karen Allen makes a welcome appearance as Delores. Finally David Keith is wonderful as Richard.The cinematography by Terry Stacey is gorgeous. The original music was created by Clint Mansere. The great Willie Nelson is heard in the sound track. Watch this film to see a new talent at work with a perfectly cast actor.".

Good acting by all actors  especially leading man Billy Crudup as the man who thinks he can walk away and supporting actress Julianne Moore as a delusional woman who claims to be escaping from her husband. This is a tough story about a man struggling to handle being a responsible adult who makes some terrible choices while searching for answers. I believe the character finds out there are no easy answers and nothing will help him fully understand why. I think this movie speaks about the many people who at times feel like lost souls trying to figure out how they ended up where they are and wondering what would it be like to just leave it all behind. Turns out you can't really leave it all behind because your past life follows you and haunts you wherever you go. I recommend it.".

The poor dear. I can certainly identify with part of it who the hell wants a 3 yearold kid who sounds weirder over the phone than E.T. in his most alien moments? Who wants a 3 yearold kid period. Still our rather short antihero produced the little bastard of his own free will hence one of the first things we learn about Crudup is that he's an irresponsible selfish git. The movie showcases his disspirited search for himself  or put in more simple terms he uses this personal mental crisis as an opportunity for a nice little unplanned sex holiday.As he makes his way to the first small town Crudup reveals that it isn't just his strange son or The Empire State Building that became a burden for his small shoulders. His genitals got that certain itch the one that guys get all the time. Being goodlooking something the movie tells us over and over though not that he is practically a midget he gets to sleep with several women in no time. Apparently he possesses such raw irresistible sexual magnetism that a waitress played by oncepretty Karen Allen practically bribes her colleague to let her have him. Would you like those eggs with a salad and a pair of small breasts? Crudup nods and off they go.To cut a long story short what saves this movie from being unwatchable is that it's a road movie and road movies always have elements of surprise to them if nothing else. The best part of WT was the very effective scene in which Julianne Moore turns out to be a demented schizophrenic paranoid that talks to empty chairs.The worst part of the movie is Crudup's visit to his father played by Keith an actor only 14 years Crudup's senior. When you add to that the fact that nowadays older actors and actresses always look younger than they really are  due to plastic surgery  we end up with a fatherandson situation that doesn't exactly lend realism to the proceedings. Dad why did you have me when you were just 10? This is almost Oliverstoneian casting! Jolie and Farrell as mother and son. Mom how come Ancient Greece had the medical knowhow to get you pregnant at the age of 3? Ditto Close and Gibson in Hamlet. Unfortunately he never poses this essential question. Instead the writerdirector Friendly Beard uses this opportunity to make excuses for Crudup's selfishness. He was a poor little boy deserted by his equally mean father at a young age so that's why Crudup is such a bastard now. Explanation offered excuse rammed down out throats case closed. Like father like son like Hollywood like me for it's not my fault destiny has been unkind to me.This is the kind of liberal leftwing Psychology 101 baloney that we've been served by American dramas for decades now. The recent trend is that noone is ultimately responsible for their actions hence we should weep for all the sociopaths psychopaths and other degenerates out there. Poor little innocent things run over by a harsh life... Please Mr.Judge don't give Mr.MassMurderer the death penalty for it is a cruel and unusual punishment for a lost soul that we are trying so desperately to save. His father was an alcoholic and his mother watched The Cosby Show every day. It's not his fault he turned out that way... It's the same with Crudup we're supposed to be moved touched by this lastminute revelation as if he were the only kid who grew up without a parent.Antisocial behaviour whether it be just regular adultery or genocide has been scientifically proved to stem mostly from the individual's DNA structure much less from his upbringing. Psychopaths are born not created not referring to Crudup though. The result of this new trend is that people are becoming softies with excuses ready for every single thing they do wrong and if that isn't a precursor to the eventual fall of the Western World I don't know what is.Nice shots of the American landscapes and a horrible soundtrack by Willie Nelson and Bonnie Rat.".

Poor little innocent things run over by a harsh life... Please Mr.Judge don't give Mr.MassMurderer the death penalty for it is a cruel and unusual punishment for a lost soul that we are trying so desperately to save. His father was an alcoholic and his mother watched The Cosby Show every day. It's not his fault he turned out that way... It's the same with Crudup we're supposed to be moved touched by this lastminute revelation as if he were the only kid who grew up without a parent.Antisocial behaviour whether it be just regular adultery or genocide has been scientifically proved to stem mostly from the individual's DNA structure much less from his upbringing. Psychopaths are born not created not referring to Crudup though. The result of this new trend is that people are becoming softies with excuses ready for every single thing they do wrong and if that isn't a precursor to the eventual fall of the Western World I don't know what is.Nice shots of the American landscapes and a horrible soundtrack by Willie Nelson and Bonnie Rat.";

Billy Crudup impresses every time out but hasn't yet found the role that will propel him onto the Alist. Unfortunately World Traveler isn't likely to raise his profile. He plays Cal a successful thirtysomething who suddenly leaves his wife and child in search of something intangible just beyond the horizon. On the road he meets people who force him to examine the painful corners of his life. Directed by Bart Freundlich Julianne Moore's reallife husband the movie crawls along at a snail's pace and never really exploits the energy inherent in a road picture  just being on the road with the top down and the pedal pressed to the metal. Cal is the typical the guy who's trying to find himself' but he is so selfcentered that as a viewer I found myself wishing he would just get lost and never come back. There is some strong acting here though. Canadian Liane Balaban New Waterford Girl St. Jude has a minor but satisfying role. The best work in the film however belongs to James LeGros who has a chance meeting with Cal in an airport. They knew one another in high school and LeGros has been harbouring a grudge against Cal for fifteen years. In a scene that is almost worth the price of admission he unloads an avalanche of resentment on Cal who listens and decides to change his life. It is a well written scene wonderfully played by Crudup and LeGros but not enough to carry the whole movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "During the part of Cal's trip with Julianne Moore where he stopped at a state fair in Montanna the song You were only fooling but I was falling in love was sung by a female vocalist. Could the singer have been KAY STARR?? Portions of the tune did in fact sound a little like her and then there were a few notes that sounded more like Patsy Cline.So I am betting that the song was not sung by KAY STARR. Anyone that can remember music from the 50's and 60's might offer up their thoughts on this topic. I believe that this recording was of another Country and Western singer. Overall the movie was quite interesting but had a few discontinuities and unanswered questions e.g. what was going on with Cal getting handcuffed as He gets off of an airplane in the first minutes of the movie?".

Portions of the tune did in fact sound a little like her and then there were a few notes that sounded more like Patsy Cline.So I am betting that the song was not sung by KAY STARR. Anyone that can remember music from the 50's and 60's might offer up their thoughts on this topic. I believe that this recording was of another Country and Western singer. Overall the movie was quite interesting but had a few discontinuities and unanswered questions e.g. what was going on with Cal getting handcuffed as He gets off of an airplane in the first minutes of the movie?";
