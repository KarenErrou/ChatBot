The film provides comedy and drama as well as various scenes of Tokyo which has the characteristic of rapidly changing scenery thus the title.Official website for this film is named tokyosanpo.jp stroll around Tokyo and that's exactly what they do for majority of this movie. On the way they encounter many strange people and events most occur in real life Tokyo though severely exaggerated for comedy.This is my 7th film starring Odagiri Joe and he's just such a versatile and talented actor who you can always count on. He doesn't have strikingly good looks but his acting is just so good that I can really connect with his character almost every single time. Miura Tomokazu who plays the loan shark also acted very well in his usual scarypowerful role.It was a really funny comedy film but what I really loved was how well the characters developed. I can literally feel those two main characters bonding. Although Odagiri's character really hated this idea of going out on a walk with his enemy at first he slowly became interested in this loan shark and didn't want this walk to ever end. This was such a wellmade film that it made me feel the same way. I especially loved that rollercoaster scene near the end where Odagiri's character began to see the loan shark as a father figure and others in the makebelieve family as the family he never had. It was just so touching and I was so connected with the main character at this point that tears started to well up in my eyes too. I just can't stress enough how good an actor Odagiri is and this was a perfect film for him. No one can act the average joe roles better than Odagiri Joe.Unlikely and disturbingly simple plot for movie family bonding journey discovering selfidentity countless cameo... it has almost everything I love seeing in movies. Even if you're not into all these things I can guarantee watching this film is a time well spent.".

The next day the debt collector offers Fumiya an opportunity to erase his debt walk with him around Tokyo. What we get is a road movie a very funny road movie where the unlikely duo walk instead of drive. There's eventual male bonding marvelous footage of Tokyo and a smrgsbord of odd characters and situations along the way.WriterDirector Satoshi Miki has a stable of comedic actors who work with him often and who fill out this film playing the side characters. They remind me of the North American group that came out of Second City Television we now associate with Christopher Guest movies. They share that sense of humor too where each of the characters seem to exist in their own orbit but since they all do they get along fine. Dialog is somewhere between non sequiturs and honest answers when you don't anticipate them. And it's all about timing and delivery. Funny people.I would be remiss if I didn't mention the hairstyles of the two main characters. J Odagiri famous Average Joe Japanese actor sports a Dylanesquefro while famous Big Bad Guy actor Tomokazu Miura's cut seems to suffer from some sort of mullet imbalance. They're an odd pair perfectly suited to this lowkey oddball comedy.A thrill for me is the appearance of Yuriko Yoshitaka as Fufumi the niece of the debt collector's fake wife. She costarred at age seventeen in one of my favorite films of all time Noriko's Dinner Table as the younger sister Yuka. While that Sion Sono film was no where near a comedy Yuriko Yoshitaka's character possessed a bit of the same surreal comportment that works for her in this film. She's tasked here with playing a loud extremely happy selforientor who likes to put mayonnaise on everything and pulls it off without being overly obnoxious. Your mileage may vary but I think she's got a bright future. She seems comfortable acting.".

	schema:reviewBody "After a burly debt collector Aiichiro Fukuhara Tomokazu Miura rams a sock down the throat of a college student while telling him that he has to pay his debt of 840000 yen in three days or else the last thing you expect from Satoshi Miki's Adrift in Tokyo is an offbeat and very funny comedy. Yet in this 2007 film now getting its first release Miki manages to pull it off and does so with considerable aplomb. A charming at times surreal and often very touching film Adrift in Tokyo provides the viewer with a rare glimpse of some of the lovely back streets shops and shrines of Tokyo that tourists never see while creating characters that are believable and have the capacity for growth.Abandoned by his natural parents when he was three years old Fumiya Takemura Jo Odagiri is now in his eighth year of school and presumably is studying law yet he seems to lack ambition and has no plans for the future. Miki does not tell us how he managed to amass a debt of almost 9000 in U.S. funds but gambling is suspected since student loans are not usually collected with sock in mouth. Surprisingly a restrained Fukuhara who is holding Fumiya's ID and Driver's License as collateral returns a few days later with a proposition. He will give the young man one million yen if he will walk with him across Tokyo to the Kasumigaseki district of Tokyo.Telling him that the walk could take a few days or even a month Fumiya does not know what to think about the offer but not having a great many other options he shows up the next day at the appointed place to begin their walk. Later Fumiya learns that the debt collector is planning to turn himself in to the police for the murder of his wife which he claims was accidental and is choosing Kasumigaseki because their police station is the best. As they begin their walk they also begin talking and sharing their past and each character is revealed to be surprisingly sensitive and vulnerable. Meeting some bizarre characters along the way Fukuhara revisits some of the places he visited with his wife in better days a Shinto shrine a favorite desert caf and a bus ride on Sunday night which he calls the loneliest bus ride in the world. Fumiya also begins to share his thoughts and feelings especially his loneliness in not sharing typical family outings such as going to the zoo or riding on a roller coaster. The two visit the site of his family home which is now a vacant lot and Fumiya recalls incidents from his school days like his first kiss trying to pass off an ordinary polo shirt as a designer gift and being paid a fee by a married woman for an affair that never quite came off. One of the funniest subplots involves three fellow workers of Fukuhara's wife and their half hearted attempt to find out why she has been absent from work. When they go to her house to see what has happened to her they are caught in the middle of a film shoot and are recruited to join the cast as extras.The final act introduces more odd characters such as Fukuhara's friend Makiko Kyoko Koizumi and her very strange niece Fufumi Yuriko Yoshitaka who is addicted to mayonnaise. Fukuhara pretends that Fumiya is his son and the warmth of the family provides a sharp contrast to Fumiya's life of isolation. Adrift in Tokyo is about small things  sharing making connections with the world around us simply walking and talking. Reinforced by the music of Maurice Ravel especially Ravel's haunting Pavane pour une Infant dfunte both characters grow in ways that did not seem possible at the beginning of the film. Fumiya begins to express more emotion and Fukuhara in an understated way provides emotional strength for the younger man reminding us that happiness can often lie in moments of simple pleasure.".

The plot revolves around a guy that is in debt and gets in trouble with the debt collector. Later the debt collector gives him a solution to the problem by going on a walk with him to a specific destination he would give him a lot of money. The main reason that interested me on the journey was the question why the debt collector would choose that man to go on a walk with him. I really liked the style and direction of this movie especially with it's awkward scenarios and awkward humor in this. It pretty much was a engaging movie all the way through mainly because of the direction of it all. To anyone who enjoys watching Japanese style and humor while going from point A to point B without it being dull should check this movie out.810".

Its not a film i laughed much at but during the last third or so but it left me grinning and in a elevated state of mind. Really. Awesome little film this.It concerns a student and debt collector of the mafia roaming the streets of Tokeyo for three days and their pretty much random encounters andsmalladventures. Its directed with lightly and competent hands.Parts i really liked1. The electric guitar weirdo roaming the streets of Tokeyo. Awesome! Not sure why the student lost respect for him because he was polite to the cops. I though he handled that very nice. 2. The student choking at the curry that wasn't even spicy. This is a touching feel good moment handled precisely right!3. The two main characters. This really reminded me why watched films to begin with.".

	schema:headline " Two weirdos on a Tokyo walkabout.";
	schema:reviewBody "Does it make sense to say that a movie is predictably unpredictable? And is that a bad thing? This is one of those movies where for some reason two guys who don't know each other go on a journey usually against the will of one or both. In this movie a middle aged torpedo bribes a college kid to follow him around Tokyo. Fukuhara has decided to turn himself into the police and wants to wander the streets of his town one last time before he goes to prison. He meets hapless college kid Fumiya when he's sent to collect some debt of his. Fukuhara offers to give Fumiya the money he sorely needs in exchange for company. This all happens early and the majority of the movie is following their walkabout.They walk through several parts of Tokyo while embarking on random quests born out of their conversations and random curiousness. They meet a bunch of characters on their way and their journey is filled with weird and silly situations. They go on detours try new food get in a fight and for a stretch they have to pretend to be father and son. There is a lot of humor to be found but also a good heart and by the end Fukuhara and Fumiya are much closer to each other than they even realize. The city itself supplies a lot of charm as they move through a few of its many wards and you really get a sense of the diversity of such a huge metropolis.The movie progresses like you'd expect an unlikelybuddyjourney movie to. You've probably seen the first they don't knowlike each other much and 'the other guy' has weird habits but hey they've found common ground and now they're friends thing a dozen times but as always with movies it's all in the delivery. The laughs are frequent and come from the weirdest places and the way the guys bond in this is deeper and more complex than your average american movie which makes it more poignant. Perhaps my love of silliness and randomness and my limited knowledge of Japanese culture and filmmaking makes Tenten a funnier more unpredictable experience to me but I'd wager anyone who sees this will find something to enjoy.".

The film's premise is quite odd  a loanshark named Fukuhara offers to forgive the debt of a young man named Fumira if Fumira simply walks across Tokyo with him. Why is Fumira in debt in the first place? It's never explained and it doesn't matter. A lot in this movie is never quite explained it just sort of happens. Just when you think you have a bead on where the story might be going for example did Fukuhara REALLY kill his wife as he says?  a bizarre character or plot twist appears. You get the sense that maybe the director was trying to make a Japanese version of Amelie and it almost works. There are some items in the movie that don't quite fit or miss their mark Fukuhara has ominous coughing fits in the first half of the movie but they disappear completely in the second half.... but overall the movie is never boring or slow and the main characters seem to have genuine chemistry between them.".

Janssen plays an exCIA agent who has become an author writing both nonfiction exposes Phillip Agee was in the news at this time and fiction spy novels. The CIA is on his case in the person of Arthur Kennedy CIA chief in Athens where Janssen is staying. Janssen is pursuing a case that interests him while dodging the traps set for him by Kennedy and NOT dodging them toothe scenes where he is captured by the CIA and sent in for deprogramming are harrowing in the extreme! and trying to help Maurizio Merli a former colleague with personal problems. Janssen also is having an affair with a lovely lady of course!. David Janssen was the rare individual to have not one not two but THREE excellent TV series under his belt RICHARD DIAMOND THE FUGITIVE and O'HARA UNITED STATES TREASURY. A brooding understated actor he is perfect for this role and generates a real intensity and depth. Like Charles Bronson he is able to communicate pain through his eyes and he generates a lot of audience empathy. Director Romolo Guerrieri uncle of Italian crime master Enzo Castellari worked in peplum spaghetti westerns crime films and Franco and Ciccio comedies as a writer and director and assistant director and second unit director before making this film and he has a great eye making fine use of the Greek location shooting both the mean streets of the city and beautiful seascapes. For fans of European crime and spy films this is a mustsee and it should also interest any David Janssen fans out there. I've loaned this video to a number of friends over the years and everyone has enjoyed it singling out Janssen's unique screen presence and happy to have another example of his work available. Let's hope someone decides to do a letterboxed DVD of this soon.".

That principally means that I know I should be skeptical when encountering a title that sounds entirely unfamiliar. The absolute highlights of this specific genre have long been identified and rediscovered already and the chance there's still a hidden gem lurking beneath the surface is quite slim. But you never know of course and since the cast list of this Covert Action also contains no less than four interesting names I really wanted to check it out. As secretly feared the film is a giant waste of time and veteran director Guerrieri does not succeed in telling a half interesting story or serving a few remotely exciting action sequences. The film has an impressive cast as mentioned already including names like Arthur Kennedy Ivan Rassimov Maurizio Merli a natural born Poliziotesschi hero and David Janssen. The latter depicts a former CIAagent named Lester Horton who after publishing a completely unsuccessful fiction novel decides to base his next book on his own memoirs and factual CIA cases. This makes his old supervisor Maxwell a badly ageing Arthur Kennedy very nervous and suddenly Lester and everybody in his surrounding are in lethal danger. Personally I never cared for David Janssen and I was much more interested in the characters of Italian heroes Merli and Rassimov. Their roles are regrettably downgraded to supportive ones however. Merli plays a corrupt and heroinaddicted excolleague whose wife is having an affair with Janssen. If you ask me it's fairly implausible to prefer a dull fatigue and whiny writer over a vivid and fiery blonde deity like Merli but whatever. Rassimov stars as Maxwell's henchman and his only task is to pop up everywhere and look menacing. Most of what's happening remains vague and largely unexplained for some reason and Covert Action doesn't contain any notably memorable moments. The entire film takes place in Athens Greece which results in a handful of beautiful filming locations but that hardly justifies a recommendation.".

	schema:reviewBody "At some point as a kid I must have had encountered this film because I remember the scene where the guy is watching the cartoon porn in the cinema and gets shot in the back of the head. I hadn't thought of that scene in decades had no idea of the name of the film and must have caught it on television. How I can remember this but can't remember to take a towel to a swimming pool is beyond me.A rather middleaged line up of stars in this one too I notice. David Janssen is an exCIA agent looking for a man called John Benson who has recorded a cassette that could bring down the whole organisation. Only we the audience know that Benson has had his throat slit shortly after the film begins well I guess the killer knows it too. Janssen is drawing a lot of attention and is being followed around by stonyfaced agent Ivan Rassimov who brings him before the pure malice of Arthur Kennedy. Arthur doesn't like that Janssen now makes a living publishing novels about CIA operations and wants to know what he's up to and he's not above getting Janssen the odd kicking to put his point across.Janssen also hooks up with his buddy Maurizio Merli another agent operating in Athens with a secret to hide and Janssen's lovely ex Corrine Clery as a girlfriend. Merli has his own problems  he knows where Benson's cassette is and he may also know who paid for the drug dealer to be shot at the start of the film. Kennedy also wants rid of Merli and has arranged for Merli to be 'taken care of' by his successor Giacomo RossiStuart who doesn't do or say anything in this film. Philipe Leroy also drops in as a friendly Greek policeman and things start getting violent once everyone tries to track down the cassette.I was quite taken with this one as I guess it is a throwback to the old Eurospy films. It has quite a few twists in it and for a change Maurizio Merli has a bit more to his character than just being a punching and killing machine although he gets to do that too. Clery nearly makes it to the end without getting naked she doesn't make it though and Arthur Kennedy plays the most gleefully evil villain I've seen in a long time. There's some truly cruel happens to Janssen in the film and Kennedy takes great delight in prolonging the agony. It's Kennedy and Merli that make the film no doubt.In summation95 of Greece is made up of CIA agents.".

Arthur doesn't like that Janssen now makes a living publishing novels about CIA operations and wants to know what he's up to and he's not above getting Janssen the odd kicking to put his point across.Janssen also hooks up with his buddy Maurizio Merli another agent operating in Athens with a secret to hide and Janssen's lovely ex Corrine Clery as a girlfriend. Merli has his own problems  he knows where Benson's cassette is and he may also know who paid for the drug dealer to be shot at the start of the film. Kennedy also wants rid of Merli and has arranged for Merli to be 'taken care of' by his successor Giacomo RossiStuart who doesn't do or say anything in this film. Philipe Leroy also drops in as a friendly Greek policeman and things start getting violent once everyone tries to track down the cassette.I was quite taken with this one as I guess it is a throwback to the old Eurospy films. It has quite a few twists in it and for a change Maurizio Merli has a bit more to his character than just being a punching and killing machine although he gets to do that too. Clery nearly makes it to the end without getting naked she doesn't make it though and Arthur Kennedy plays the most gleefully evil villain I've seen in a long time. There's some truly cruel happens to Janssen in the film and Kennedy takes great delight in prolonging the agony. It's Kennedy and Merli that make the film no doubt.In summation95 of Greece is made up of CIA agents.";

	schema:reviewBody "Hello Goodbye is a movie about a wealthy middleaged French couple that suddenly experiences a storm of difficulties. Alain Gaash is Jewish and his family is surprised and somewhat taken aback when his son decides to marry a Christian woman in a church. Alain's wife Gisle had converted to Judaism in order to marry him but she realizes suddenly that his family still sees her as nonJewish. Alain's Jewish friends don't see him as Jewish enough because he isn't circumcised and the couple ends up having a late identity crisis. The main focus of the film though is not so much on the search of Jewish identity but on Gisle's search for meaning she was a housewife for years who gave up her career to support her husband and raise their son. Now that the son has left home her life is empty. She does all sorts of crazy things like destroying her expensive car and convincing her husband to move to Israel where they had no secure income or even a home. Gisle seeks the help of a very suspicious drugusing Rabbi and falls for his good looks and wisdom. Alain suspects that their bad lovelife is due to the fact that he is not circumcised even if they had had problems in this area before their identity crisis so he gets a circumcision. This of course changes nothing. In any case the couple barely has anything to do with each other Gisle finds out where Alain is working by chance Alain finds out by accident that Gisle didn't tell him their furniture was thrown into the Meditarranean on the way to Israel... At some point not only do the main characters lose contact with each other the film loses all contact with it's audience. The ending is so ridiculous and shmalzig it's unbearable.

He's paired with a topnotch French actress their third movie together. In the film they have a successful marriage and on screen they are great together great chemistry with all the ups and downs of a marriage that has lasted 25 years. He's a successful contented gynecologist she's apparently never worked only raised a son who's getting married. She wants a life change that's the major impetus for the movie. As anyone can read in the description eventually they immigrate to Israel. Of course they are Jewish and that plays a sizable role in the movie.The script is quite good quite realistic though some of what happens from the time they enter Israel to live there seemed a bit overdone. For example I wonder if Israel really has so many gynecologists or this was just the writer using artistic license.There are some great actors in this movie in addition to the leads. I like French so I didn't mind that so many I assume French actors were hired for the scenes filmed in Israel. This movie has a lot of extras and by extra I mean scenes and short moments where we see actors whom we see only once and only for a short time. These vignettes generally don't add to the story line they are there for effect  in a movie like this usually for comedic effect. They can add or subtract from the entertainment value of the movie. As well they can give us a break from concentrating on the main story. Having said all of this and maybe having rambled a bit let me say that the extras in this movie are great. The many actors all do a very good job and the movie was more enjoyable to me.Finally the extra on the dvd is exclusively an interview with the lead actress. I found it very interesting and informative.".

	schema:headline " Immigration to Israel by the view of a French family";
	schema:reviewBody "Hello Goodbye is a movie about a welltodo and established French family of assimilated Jews. Alain Gaash is Jewish but not circumcised and married to Gisle who converted to Judaism in order to marry him. His mother is no less ignorant about Judaism.When their son decides to marry a Christian woman in a Church the family loses the last piece of their Jewish identity  the progeny of their son will not be Jewish.Tired of commercialism and looking to find new meaning of life the couple decides to emigrate to Israel. Gisle needs to crash the car given to her by Alain to show the seriousness of her intentions.The movie shows quite well Israeli environment. Skilled crooks coexist together with kind and generous families ready to share with the newcomers the scarce goods they have themselves. The line of people bringing to Gaashes various household items is a very touching moment.Gisle finds someone who calls himself a Rabbi  may be a rare case of a Reform Rabbi or more likely just a fake. This Rabbi while throwing high theological concepts to a newcomer who is not ready to comprehend them is just a showoff who goes for mixed dancing forbidden by the Jewish law smokes weed and doesn't mind having an affair with a married woman which is prohibited even stricter. But Gisle intuitively understands that the Rabbi is a joke and does not fall for him.Another important episode in Alain's life is a circumcision. Many adults coming to Israel undertake it. The movies erroneously claims that no anesthesia is allowed during the procedure.Alain finds a job as a car washer rather than a doctor. This change affected so many immigrants to Israel. There are stories of cleaning ladies in the Knesset saving lives due to their training as doctors and security guards solve famous Math tasks earning various prizes and awards. Alain goes through that route as well.Without retelling the whole movie the final scene is devoted to the dilemma to stay in Israel with inferior job on inferior pay under inferior circumstances or to return to France and to regain the prosperity and familiar conditions.At the end Alain and Gisle decide to stay in Israel like many others.

	onyx:emotionText "Hello Goodbye is a movie about a welltodo and established French family of assimilated Jews. Alain Gaash is Jewish but not circumcised and married to Gisle who converted to Judaism in order to marry him. His mother is no less ignorant about Judaism.When their son decides to marry a Christian woman in a Church the family loses the last piece of their Jewish identity  the progeny of their son will not be Jewish.Tired of commercialism and looking to find new meaning of life the couple decides to emigrate to Israel. Gisle needs to crash the car given to her by Alain to show the seriousness of her intentions.The movie shows quite well Israeli environment. Skilled crooks coexist together with kind and generous families ready to share with the newcomers the scarce goods they have themselves. The line of people bringing to Gaashes various household items is a very touching moment.Gisle finds someone who calls himself a Rabbi  may be a rare case of a Reform Rabbi or more likely just a fake. This Rabbi while throwing high theological concepts to a newcomer who is not ready to comprehend them is just a showoff who goes for mixed dancing forbidden by the Jewish law smokes weed and doesn't mind having an affair with a married woman which is prohibited even stricter. But Gisle intuitively understands that the Rabbi is a joke and does not fall for him.Another important episode in Alain's life is a circumcision. Many adults coming to Israel undertake it. The movies erroneously claims that no anesthesia is allowed during the procedure.Alain finds a job as a car washer rather than a doctor. This change affected so many immigrants to Israel. There are stories of cleaning ladies in the Knesset saving lives due to their training as doctors and security guards solve famous Math tasks earning various prizes and awards. Alain goes through that route as well.Without retelling the whole movie the final scene is devoted to the dilemma to stay in Israel with inferior job on inferior pay under inferior circumstances or to return to France and to regain the prosperity and familiar conditions.At the end Alain and Gisle decide to stay in Israel like many others. What keeps them there the warmth of many Israelis the builtin optimism so explicitly felt in the country a hope for a better future or the instinctive love Jews may feel for The Land of Israel  we may only guess. But they stay.This movie is not a French comedy and neither it is a thriller. It is a movie where serious philosophical picture is hidden behind tiny comedies and dramas.

Finding humor in both those Jews who obsess over Jewish identity and those that are coverts to Judaism who also obsess over Judaism I laughed continually through the film's first half. As you would hope w pros Ardant and Depardieu the acting is spot on.Very believable until things start to go over the top soon after they reach Israel. It slows down after that and rambles quite a bit and the ending is a copoutbut I am very grateful for the laughs.

Inside the harsh confines of the supposedly beneficial institution Polin and his fellow inmates must deal with constant physical and psychological abuse by the staff as well as the natural emotional tensions brought on by their own burgeoning adolescence.

The film is exceedingly low budget but in many parts that actually works to it's advantage such as the nuclear power plants conveniently placed directly behind the cemetery looking as though they were pasted in there with photoshop and fairly corny zombies. Through much of it the audience cackled and cheered and it was greeted with much applause at it's finally plus I recognized some of the locations and many of the stars were in the theater.

	schema:reviewBody "Really zombie movies are such a hit and miss genre that you can't ever honestly watch one with high hopes. Which is why when one turns out to be pretty damn good you are more than pleasantly surprised.This was just a well put together movie. I thought the direction script and acting were all very well executed...especially for a bunch of relative unknowns. It had gore humor story...and what I really appreciated was they gave you just enough insight and character build up that when someone did finally kick the bucket...you know who it was and cared. The dialog was also pretty fun to listen to. I'm a fan of horribly foul language...which this movie did not have...but the dialog kept me interested enough that I didn't even notice the lack thereof.Plot summary. It's prom time in this town and all the teens are scurrying to find their dates. All teen categories are featured here there's the nerds scifi club the misfits the punk rockers and the incrowd tools. While this minor school drama that everyone can relate to is going on a menace is looming. The town power plant has been leaking toxic waste into it's surrounding town causing the dead to return to life. While the prom is in full swing the dead arise and start wreaking havoc. Naturally the first to notice are those who are without dates and it is up to them to not only protect and save themselves...but to save the obvious buffet that is the teen prom.If you like fun zombie movies with good lines and gore...watch it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Every once in awhile a film comes along which breaks new ground. Not to say that I'm a better judge than anyone else but just in the past year I attended over a dozen festivals at which I saw over 200 films so the bar is set pretty high for me and it takes a lot to make my jaw drop. Gregg Bishop's Dance of the Dead did that and more.The line stretched around the block here for the World Premiere at the 2008 SXSW Film Festival  the buzz had already made its way around Austin Texas. The premise is fairly straightforward. As festival director Matt Dentler pointed out in his intro to the screening this film combines my two favorite genres teens trying to get laid and zombies. That's a simplification of course but it's not inaccurate. What's new here is not just the most successful marriage of the two genres I've ever seen but the combination taking both to a new level.It's prom night and the local kids are looking for dates and praying they'll get lucky at the end of the night. Meanwhile something is up at the local cemetery. It will be up to a group of wouldbe heroes to save the day and keep the high school gym from becoming a teenage zombie buffet. On the face of it the idea doesn't seem all that original. We've seen some of these elements before to be sure. But this is a genre film after all and assuming one likes zombie movies and teen sex slash comingofage films emphasis on the slash it would be enjoyable regardless. For this viewer what sets one film apart from another is originality. Is there anything new here? I ask myself as the film unspools. The answer is a resounding yes. Dance of the Dead breaks new ground literally.Much of the strength of this film lies in the believability and authenticity of the cast. Typically one finds 20somethings playing high school seniors and the audience sees right through it. In this case there is no 25 playing 18  it's 18 playing 18. These are real teens playing teens. That and the freshness these kids bring to their roles is at the heart of the success of this film. It's always hard to single anyone out in a brilliant ensemble cast but the plot clearly revolves around Lindsey and Jimmy Greyson Chadwick and Jared Kusnitz. He thinks he's all that. She wonders why he takes her for granted and thinks of wandering off elsewhere to get what she needs. We know where this is going but how it gets there will require some major zombie buttkicking and Kusnitz who was able to do his own stunts by spending interminably long days on martial arts and choreography is clearly up to the task. Doing some damage of their own are the other kids all of whom have bright futures in cinema Justin Welborn Chandler Darby Carissa Capobianco Michael V. Mammoliti Mark Lynch Blair Redford and Lucas Till along with Mark Oliver as Coach Keel who would make Stallone and Schwarzenegger proud.There is so much more that sets this film above others. Joe Ballarini's script is intelligent and respectful never patronizing in an I may be an adult but I know how kids talk kind of way.' It's a big reason why Gregg Bishop is able to keep the film from straying into Porky's territory which likely would have been easy to do in the hands of a lesser director. Most good horror films have a killer soundtrack and Dance of the Dead is no exception. Shadows of the Night made famous by Pat Benatar in the 80s is given a new treatment here which gave me goosebumps. Most of all though the stunning visuals are what will stay with you long after the credits roll. Here is where Dance of the Dead truly shines. The scene which sealed the deal for me was groundbreaking literally. To find out that what you see on screen was all done incamera with no postproduction special effects or CGI added was the icing on the cake. Kudos to the entire production team for giving this film the look of a big budget Hollywood movie.Most of the cast and crew were present for an extended QA during which the audience was treated to some eyeopening details about what went into the making of Dance of the Dead. For example it was a very long shoot  one fight scene took twelve hours  and the kids worked themselves to the bone but it paid off and helped make this one of the most exciting films I've seen in the past year. Dance of the Dead truly blew me away. It's a groundbreaking combination of high school mayhem and zombies  think John Hughes meets John Carpenter meets George Romero. This is why I attend film festivals and sit through hundreds of screenings  somewhere among them is an undiscovered gem and Dance of the Dead shimmers.".

The movie was nothing special but for that budget it was more than satisfying. Almost the same thing happened with this movie the only difference is that this one is even better than The other side. I have a feeling that with 15000  Bishop makes more than some directors with 15 mil. . At least he knows how to make a very entertaining movie I don't wanna think how good this movie would be if Bishop had a bigger budget. So I gotta say Dammitwill someone finally give this man the money so he can make a movie with decent special effects?! He really deserved it.So gotake your friendswatch this movie and you will all have a great time. Take this movie for what it is by that I mean that this isn't some big budget moviejust the opposite and this will be one of the best prom nights you have ever seen. In the endI would give this movie 7 starsbut because of having so little and offering so muchI'll give it 8 for effort.".

Zombie movies either need to have vast amounts of heads being splatted with organs flying left right and center dead alive for example or make a point about human behavior when all society goes to heck any George a Romero of the dead movies with some splattering.All this movie provides is a look at how another teen movie would look like if the jokes were taken out and replaced by tedium and zombies. and while this movie is probably supposed to be funny. its not. the characters are very 2D you never really get to know them enough to give a darn. The confederate teacher for example is especially lame. i guess if i wanted to express how i felt when i watched it i would say it was like...

And one last note. to the people who compare it to john carpenter and gorge HAVE YOU EVEN SEEN A JOHN CARPENTER OR A GEORGE ROMERO MOVIE?? i honestly think you haven't. don't soil good directors name with this dreck";

Dance of the Dead has absolutely no suspense whatsoever and the pacing of the movie along with comedic timing is a bit off at all times. Then there's the acting which ranges from acceptable to downright BAD I guess that's what you get when you cast real High Schoolaged actors. All in all it's no better than a bfilm. I wouldn't even rank it a B. But that's not to say it lacks any redeeming value. The character development is weak but not nonexistent. There's some serious lack of creativity Power Plant for example and there are moments of complete clich I understand what kind of movie it is but let's face it but there's also some good gory laughs thrown in during later scenes if you can bare with it a while. The gore is here and there and the special effects are good enough. My main problem was the amateurish aspects of it. The pacing the timing etc. The movie just seemed to skip too quickly without building up scenes or parts of the plot. It does get better as it goes though.I'm no disgruntled employee but I do think the movie is way overhyped. It's by no means anything comparable to the likes of Shaun of the Dead or Evil Dead for that matter but it does have a few things going for it. Only recommended for zombie fanatics that have an affinity for bquality films. If you like polished production values you might want to avoid it. A good test is watching the intro sequence.".

The whole mess plays like a 'Saved by the Bell' Halloween special complete with a ten year old's sense of humor and a fauxrock soundtrack.

The zombie makeup looks like the product of a kid's face painting party and the gore usually the highlight of zombie movies is virtually nonexistent.

In a genre dominated by any number of standout efforts like Return of the Living Dead Shaun of the Dead Fido and Zombieland it really takes something special to transcend mere competence in filmmaking. Sadly Dance... doesn't quite do that although I give it a few points for the attempt.As is usually the case it's the tyro script that keeps this one in the realm of the mundane. After a somewhat promising opening way too much time is spent introducing the principal characters none of whom are overly interesting with the possible exception of the criminally underused Gravedigger and establishing the tone of the proceedings which promises comedy but fails to consistently deliver. The slim plot that ensues is distressingly banal centering on the usual hijinks of recognizing the situation surviving it and the eventual efforts to save a prom from zombiedom. None of it is unique or terribly entertaining sorry to say. Perhaps the greatest fault is the hodgepodge of zombie tropes that refuse to mesh throughout the film sometimes they're slow sometimes they're fast sometimes they literally vault from the grave! And then there's just pure silliness like zombies that can drive cars or carry their severed head around or are pacified by music. The makeup and fx range from good to slipshod but nothing stands out as memorable set pieces veer from the slapstick of a bodiless pair of zombie legs staggering away to straightup Romerostyle grue and disembowelment but none of it is scary or suspenseful or even particularly disturbing. There's no tension in the film at all mostly due to characters painted in broad strokes leaving the viewer no reason to care about them.Basically Dance... brings nothing new to the table and that condemns it to the disease of boredom. One positive note I have to give it is that the young cast by and large actually appears to be the right age for their high school characters. That's just about the only unusual thing in the whole film.Hohum DVD viewing that I'm glad I copped at the library. A short piece done by the director in college shows more promise than the feature film can live up to.".

Sadly that fact became too wellknown with Hollywood and now it's an unspoken law that every major studio and indie producers alike must release at least five zombie movies a year. If a studio is having hard times financially no problem! Just release a subpar zombie movie and all the zombie geeks will have you swimming in cash before you have even written the script. Furthermore I think Yahtzee Croshaw summed up my thoughts on the subject when he said It's my observation that zombies are second only to ninjas pirates and monkeys in the list of things nerds like and need to shut up about. The zombie genre has become more overbearing and overdone it makes the amount of remakes and pointless sequels look downright conservative. And what bothers me even more than that is the fact that 99 of the zombie movies I'm talking about are EXACTLY the same. If you think Dance of the Dead is any exception to the paragraph I just wrote you have less intelligence than a zombie itself. Forgive the terrible analogy. People site Dance of the Dead as some sort of shining pillar of originality in the carboncopy genre just because the movie revolves around a prom. This may be true for the setting but aside from that Dance of the Dead repeated every single zombie clich known to man. The jokes are all stereotypical clichs example the gym teacher. The situations are all clich example the romantic subplots. And if the movie was ohsooriginal couldn't at least think of ANYTHING more creative than a power plant as the source of the zombies? I mean for once in a horrorcomedy can't zombies become zombies from eating bad soup or something? As I said beyond the setting Dance of the Dead has no originality or even creativity.The overall film also lacks polish to an unbearable degree. It's filmed like a madeforTV movie for one of the kid's channels and the acting ranges from decent to downright painful to watch. I'd go as far as to say the acting is harder to watch than the gore. Why? Because another thing Dance of the Dead lacked was gore. While a kill happens on screen the camera is off staring at the wall or some flowers or a passing car but never on the gore itself. Never. When a kill does rarely happen on screen there is no blood. This happens more than once. A zombie's head in cleaved in two yet there is NO blood. What is up with the conservative use of gore? This is a zombie movie. I want gore. Not the camera looking at cars.But the biggest problem I had with Dance of the Dead was the lack of entertainment value. I give it credit for being at least slightly more energetic and fastpaced than the average zombie movie which are almost all synonymous with Let's slow down for grandpa he just had hip surgery. But other than the slight energy the action scenes are few and far between. The movie had me so bored I had to watch it in two separate viewings desperate for anything to start happening whatsoever. 75 of the runtime is nothing but teenagers being forced to act like fake politically correct clich teenagers. What is the point of a zombie movie if it's not entertaining . . .? I once loved zombie movies and though this new sweep of pathetic zombie movies can't make real zombie movies any less enjoyable it's sad to see zombies treated so poorly and uncreatively.Overall while Dance of the Dead isn't a completely bad movie it's the one thing I despise more than anything else FORGETTABLE. You know I was told prom was going to be the night I was never going to forget so I stayed home and watched Kill Bill and ate left overs. That was a night I never forgot. But everyone who did go to prom in my class completely forgot about it by a week later. I was so glad I didn't waste my time. I think that's a lot like Dance of the Dead. People told me it would be the most awesome zombie movie in years yet when I watched it I saw a waste of time. Take my advice don't watch Dance of the Dead. Like prom it isn't memorable. At all. It's a waste of time and money.210".

I think that Gregg Bishop really has an amazing talent and I'm hoping for more from him and his crew in the future and will go back and check out the ones I've missed.You can tell at times that this was a lowbudget flick and pretty indie but had a good story line and really had you rooting for these kids all the way through. Of course the classic ready for war walk down the hall is always a great addition and there were some great lines.There were issues with editing that I caught all along but the director was also the editor and producer and I'm quite sure had his hands full maybe having someone a little more removed would be helpful but budget is budget . Can't wait to get this one home and have folks over for a movie party!".

First of all... it is by no means a new idea to put zombies in a movie even if its not a zombie or horror movie... that idea is not new and honestly I am sick of this zombie inflation lately. To call the movie XXX of the dead pretty much fits how redundant most of it is... if you haven't seen most of the ripped off ideas in a horror movie you have seen them in a teen comedy. Second... I love mixtures of comedy and horror but in this movie I could laugh maybe twice. Most of the jokes are unbelievable lame and worn off. The reason is simple... this is a teen movie. Everybody who can laugh at all these teen comedies where the geek gets the prom queen at prom night can watch this and get some blood and decapitations on top. But for everyone else... what this really is trying to make fun of a pathetic genre by putting zombies in it and still keeping the jokes on a teen comedy level.In that way its like comparing Braindead to American Pie. The zombies were OK although I don't get why some jump out their graves and run while others walk slowly the gore FX were cheesy I guess that was intent the plot was ooooold and the jokes were bad... So what does make this movie work?? I can only guessSciFi geeks killing zombies and the main geek not even looking like a geek?? Nice prom night dresses splattered in blood?? Zombies being hypnotized by a punk rock band this is as lame as the Land of the dead firework freak zombies dancing peeing in the punch and kissing??Is this a spoiler? Because I really think this must be the highlights... sure Dance of the dead is well done and the acting is good but how can a movie that rips off every idea from other movies and throwing clichs from two genres in a blender without being any smart on the jokes be praised?My name is Bruce was working on a similar level but although I didn't think that one was a highlight it had some good jokes and was obviously making fun of the genres while Dance of the dead to me doesn't manage to make fun of either genre... its cheap recycling on all levels and I'd rather watch a movie like Feast that mixes comedy and horror with a far lower budget but at least has some fresh characters and charm.And please... no more XXX of the dead movies no matter if horror or comedy.

It seems that the zombies know where a special feeding ground will indeed be..at the prom! Our teen heroes must first ward off a large group of zombies that have barricaded them in a funeral homeha ha!and then make it to the prom to hopefully save their fellow classmates and teachers with the help of their trusty militaristic coach and his garage of weaponry. This teen group includes geeky scifi club members a pizza delivery boy a rejected cheerleader whose date got food poisoning from spinach the student body president a very unstable bully and cameraobsessed nerd who's in love with the cheerleader.Zombie horror comedy aimed at fans of John Hughes' films regarding those kids who were considered unpopular outcasts..for the exception of the cute cheerleader played by Carissa Capobiancoor nerds. There's not a lot of buildup before the undead invasion commences although we do share in some high school hijinx teen angst and satiric shenanigans regarding teenagers and their unhealthy relationships with their teachers and each other. The cast is so infectious ingratiatingly charming and enthusiastic I couldn't help but embrace them because somehow these kids rise past their obvious stereotypical characteristics. As expected with this type of movie there are lots of outrageously violent sequences between humans and zombies such as flesheating heads being bashed in..and split apart limbs removed brains blasting from the skulls by gunfire etc. Lots of crazy comedy bits include a garage rock band's unique ability to halt zombie attacks through their music..and pizza boy Jared Kusnitz and his student president girlfriend Greyson Chadwick have a cute slowdance to a Pat Benitar song while zombies remain in a trance!and the combat coach who really seems to be enjoying himself in using his vast array of weaponry to kill the undead. Since RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD movies like this have been welcome to a whole breed of zombie fans and I think Dance of the Dead will find a home with an audience always hungry for more. Don't look for any real meaning or depth because this simply aims to entertain.".

	schema:reviewBody "My soninlaw recently saw Easy Rider for the first time and became totally confused. What's that all about? he asked me. What could I say? I replied You just had to have lived through those times to understand and appreciate the movie. The same can be said of The Wild One. Before Blackboard Jungle before Rebel Without A Cause before Look Back in Anger there was The Wild One. What are you rebelling against? Whatcha got? That certainly sounds like James Dean in Rebel Without a Cause but no it's Johnny Brando in The Wild One. I saw this movie for the first time when I was 13 and was mesmerized by it. Apparently it was distributed again after Blackboard Jungle and Rebel Without a Cause came out because I saw it the same year I saw the other two. As far as fascination of the three this one effected me most. Almost as good as Brando is Lee Marvin. I've read conflicting accounts of how The Beatles came up with their name. One they so admired Buddy Holly and the Crickets that they adopted Beatles as a replacement for Crickets. The other story is that John Lennon so admired The Wild One that he took the name of the rival bikers and gave it a new spelling. Whatever the case Lee Marvin is a good foil for Brando.My favorite part of the movie is the opening. The open highway is a symbol for the movie. The highway is a means of passage for new ideas new challenges new life styles. The highway can bring evil as well as good. It is symbolic of freedom and a carefree way of life. It's not surprising that trucks began replacing freight trains as the major means of transport for goods and services following World War II. The highway also began replacing the rails as the major means of escape for the socially and spiritually oppressed among us. The viewer sees the blacktop for what seems to be several minutes. Suddenly something appears on the horizon. Before the viewer knows it rebels in the form of bikers are headed directly toward the camera. Then it seems they actually run through the camera and come out of the screen into the audience. What a piece of cinematography. Hungarianborn Laszlo Benedek mainly concentrated on television after this film. Being such a gifted director one wishes he had done more films.There is actually not much of a story in this movie. Supposedly based on a true account of a biker gang taking possession of a small California town it's mainly a comment on changing times and mores in postwar America. But from the first roar of bikes journeying down the pavement the viewer is hooked and stays spellbound to the very end. One thing puzzles me about the film's history How does a movie get banned in Finland?".

	schema:reviewBody "Although it might look quite tame compared to todays standards at the time of it's release The Wild One was considered ground breaking stuff which upset it's fair share of people it was banned in Britain for 14 years. However it helped inspire the era of rebellion which lead to such classics as the James Dean epic Rebel Without a Cause. It is also memorable for Brando giving one of his greatest performances as Johnny Strabler leader of the rebellious biker gang the Black Rebels. True he didn't receive an academy award nomination for his role but there's still no doubting the standard of his performance.At the start of the film we are introduced to Johnny and his gang as they interrupt a race taking place. This leads to a confrontation with the local sheriff which results in them leaving elsewhere to cause trouble. However just as they leave one of the members of the gang steals a trophy that would be presented to the runner up of the race the first prize trophy was too big to stealand gives it to Johnny. This represents the respect the gang has for Johnny. Soon after the gang arrives in the small town of Wrightsville it is here that the film divides into two stories. The first one focuses on the relationship that develops between Johnny and a local girl called Kathie. At first it appears that the two couldn't be anymore different he's a rebellious free spirit and she's lead quite a sheltered life going by rules and discipline. But it is through Kathie that we get to know the real Johnny as it is revealed that behind all the macho bravado he is quite a lost insecure soul unable to emotionally communicate with anyone which explains why he behaves as he does. It is a credit to Brando's performance as to how he is able to draw sympathy from the viewer for his character. As Kathie has lead a sheltered life she has always been looking in from the outside she has a father who is the sheriff of the town but isn't respected by the other residents and is considered something of a joke.It seems he is just there to make up the numbers and shows no signs of law enforcement skills when called to deal with a problem. Kathie sees him as a fraud just as she sees Johnny. The second story focuses on the conflict that develops between the residents of the town and Johnny and his gangduring which it is the residents of the town who come off as the bad guys and not the black rebels.As i previously mentioned while this film might look quite tame compared to todays standards it is still worth a look if you get a chance. If not to see what all the fuss was about at the time then just for Brando's performance which really is in a league of it's own.".

	schema:headline " Symbols and Bongos";
	schema:reviewBody "One of the more famous early films depicting youthful rebellion The Wild One is as interesting now for its embrace of past cultural tokens which provides an odd mixture for modern viewers as it is for its more timeless universal themes. It is a mostly successful film that only avoids getting a 10 because of its embrace of some filmic stereotypes of the era.Marlon Brando stars as Johnny Strabler the leader of a leatherjacketed motorcycle gang called the Black Rebels Motorcycle Club the backs of their jackets say BRMC in one of his early iconic roles. The film begins with the BRMC wreaking havoc with a motorcycle race in a small town. They ride into the middle of the track really just the town's streets they harass the crowd and eventually they even harass the officials. A cop finally kicks them out but not before BRMC members they steal a trophy meant for the motorcycle race and give it to Johnny.Amusingly it's a second place trophy but Johnny still ties it up to the front of his bikewhich happened to be Brando's reallife Triumph motorcycle. Wanting to avoid trouble with the law and acting like they're bored anyway they ride on to a nearby town Wrightsville which is even smaller. The citizens of Wrightsville seem a lot more amenable to the BRMC even though they cause a minor car accident when they first arrive. The sole Wrightsville policeman remains cordial and the townsfolk mostly seem to be happy to have tourists who might boost business a bit. Johnny quickly falls for Kathie Mary Murphy who works at Bleekers the local bardiner and so decides to stick around in Wrightsville for a bit. When a splinter group of the BRMC shows upthe Beetles led by Chino Lee Marvinan old semifriendly rivalry flares leading to rowdiness and resentment from the citizens of Wrightsville. The situation goes from bad to worse.Brando deserves all of the accolades he's received over the years from this role. He could have easily carried the film on his own. He's charismatic cool and complex and he only becomes more complex and darker as the film goes on. Eventually he says more through silence than most actors do through long monologues.A lot of this is aided by good direction from Lszl Benedek and a good script by John Paxton and Ben Maddow adapted from a short story by Frank Rooney about a reallife motorcycle club known as the Booze Fighters. The script and Benedek's direction is chock full of subtle symbolism. One of the more obvious symbolic elements is the trophy. It may seem corny at first that Johnny would tie this to the front of his motorcycle but we learn later that he wants to surmount his present position in life or his present disposition in life. The trophy represents that hopedfor transcendence.It's also fitting that it's only a second place trophy. That speaks both to Johnny's psychological roots we learn about this in more detail later which perhaps won't allow him to reach the transcendence he craves and to his need to be a perpetual underdog. This is also tied in with him being a rebel. It's something he both needs and desiresit confirms his selfimposed martyrdom. The rightfully famous exchange of dialogue where a girl asks Johnny what he's rebelling against and he answers Whaddya got? isn't just a glib remark. That's Johnny's character in a nutshell.More subtle symbolism can pop up in the most seemingly innocuous shotssuch as Johnny slamming his beer down on the bar and having it bubble up and brim over. There is both a general emotional symbolism thereJohnny feeling the desire to burst out of his present reality or transcend his present boundaries and a sexual symbolism because of the context. He's at the bar where Kathie works. He's pining for her but she's basically brushing him off. Similarly take a close look at Kathie's fondling of Johnny's motorcycle when they're in the park. If you made a mental note to watch with this in mind you could probably catch additional symbolism in most nooks and crannies every time you rewatched The Wild One.Even though Brando could easily carry the film on his own if he needed to he doesn't need to. There are plenty of other fine performances including Marvin Murphy Robert Keith as the Wrightsville Sheriff and some fun bit part appearances by people who later became quite famous such as Alvy Moore and Jerry Paris.If The Wild One has a flaw it is its slight corny embrace of rebel stereotypes. There is a twinge of Reefer Madness 1936 or the later Blackboard Jungle 1955 in the film's portrayal of the bikers.But some of what now seems to be a bit of goofiness is part of the attraction too. Since this is the early 1950s the bikers listen and dance to jazz not rock 'n' roll. They also embrace beatnik culture particularly in their lingo. At one point two BRMC members start doing a kind of jivetalking' beatnik rap. At another point Brando plays bongos on a jukebox. It may be goofy but it's a lot of fun.I often jokingly say It's a love story! no matter what kind of film I'm watching as the vast majority of films have some kind of loveromance subplot. The Wild One is no exception. It could be seen as a romance as much as a film in any other genre. As such it is notable in that while it doesn't exactly have a happy ending for a romance film it certainly has a poignant ending as Johnny gives up two symbols of martyrdom and rebellion the less obvious symbol given up arises in how he travels perhaps indicating that he's transcended his previous self after all.".

The sole Wrightsville policeman remains cordial and the townsfolk mostly seem to be happy to have tourists who might boost business a bit. Johnny quickly falls for Kathie Mary Murphy who works at Bleekers the local bardiner and so decides to stick around in Wrightsville for a bit. When a splinter group of the BRMC shows upthe Beetles led by Chino Lee Marvinan old semifriendly rivalry flares leading to rowdiness and resentment from the citizens of Wrightsville. The situation goes from bad to worse.Brando deserves all of the accolades he's received over the years from this role. He could have easily carried the film on his own. He's charismatic cool and complex and he only becomes more complex and darker as the film goes on. Eventually he says more through silence than most actors do through long monologues.A lot of this is aided by good direction from Lszl Benedek and a good script by John Paxton and Ben Maddow adapted from a short story by Frank Rooney about a reallife motorcycle club known as the Booze Fighters. The script and Benedek's direction is chock full of subtle symbolism. One of the more obvious symbolic elements is the trophy. It may seem corny at first that Johnny would tie this to the front of his motorcycle but we learn later that he wants to surmount his present position in life or his present disposition in life. The trophy represents that hopedfor transcendence.It's also fitting that it's only a second place trophy. That speaks both to Johnny's psychological roots we learn about this in more detail later which perhaps won't allow him to reach the transcendence he craves and to his need to be a perpetual underdog. This is also tied in with him being a rebel. It's something he both needs and desiresit confirms his selfimposed martyrdom. The rightfully famous exchange of dialogue where a girl asks Johnny what he's rebelling against and he answers Whaddya got? isn't just a glib remark. That's Johnny's character in a nutshell.More subtle symbolism can pop up in the most seemingly innocuous shotssuch as Johnny slamming his beer down on the bar and having it bubble up and brim over. There is both a general emotional symbolism thereJohnny feeling the desire to burst out of his present reality or transcend his present boundaries and a sexual symbolism because of the context. He's at the bar where Kathie works. He's pining for her but she's basically brushing him off. Similarly take a close look at Kathie's fondling of Johnny's motorcycle when they're in the park. If you made a mental note to watch with this in mind you could probably catch additional symbolism in most nooks and crannies every time you rewatched The Wild One.Even though Brando could easily carry the film on his own if he needed to he doesn't need to. There are plenty of other fine performances including Marvin Murphy Robert Keith as the Wrightsville Sheriff and some fun bit part appearances by people who later became quite famous such as Alvy Moore and Jerry Paris.If The Wild One has a flaw it is its slight corny embrace of rebel stereotypes. There is a twinge of Reefer Madness 1936 or the later Blackboard Jungle 1955 in the film's portrayal of the bikers.But some of what now seems to be a bit of goofiness is part of the attraction too. Since this is the early 1950s the bikers listen and dance to jazz not rock 'n' roll. They also embrace beatnik culture particularly in their lingo. At one point two BRMC members start doing a kind of jivetalking' beatnik rap. At another point Brando plays bongos on a jukebox. It may be goofy but it's a lot of fun.I often jokingly say It's a love story! no matter what kind of film I'm watching as the vast majority of films have some kind of loveromance subplot. The Wild One is no exception. It could be seen as a romance as much as a film in any other genre. As such it is notable in that while it doesn't exactly have a happy ending for a romance film it certainly has a poignant ending as Johnny gives up two symbols of martyrdom and rebellion the less obvious symbol given up arises in how he travels perhaps indicating that he's transcended his previous self after all.";

	schema:reviewBody "I heard about this movie off and on for over 30 years before seeing it. It was described by various people as trashy glorifies violence portrays motorcyclists as violent nihilists as well as cool. As a kid in 1970 I rode my 5 brake horsepower or less which allowed me to be licensed to operate it at age 15 motorcycle a 2stroke Italian import sold under the Harley Davison name and immersed myself in biker lore. In hindsight I made a laughable biker  about 5 years ago my mother sent me a picture of me with that bike and what a hoot to see again that scrawny nerdy kid with his little 50cc bike. But I thought I was cool! And I was taken for cool because I actually owned and rode a motorcycle. I guess I was cool in a way. That dopey little bike gave me a peer identity as... well not merely a good drone maybe. But rebellious? Hah! My parents APPROVED of my motorcycle... helped me buy it and everything. Some rebel! Without it though I would only have been another of the school's brainiacs a knowitall smart kid and suckup to the adults who ruled our lives. Wow! I was leading a double life good boy and bad boy though more of a pretend one at the same time.Cycle Magazine was my bible and in its pages I 1st heard about The Wild One. One writer published an essay about being a teenager with a bike not unlike mine at the time of the movie's release or perhaps its later rerelease. He wrote of how the movie reinforced a badboy sense of themselves amongst his peers and of relishing the disapproving stares they received outside the theater as they revved their little bikes at the curb playing at being Black Rebels themselves. I also recall an Episcopal priest who wrote of his Honda 90 and how his bishop received a disapproving call about the company he was keeping merely because he was seen riding behind a group of outlawlooking guys on much larger bikes. It's funny but it shows how people see what they want to see.So now I've seen the movie and it's actually more than I expected. Yes it has elements of a Reefer Madness style screed against motorcyclists. Yes the acting is often wooden and the characters hokey. Yes the story barely hangs together. Yes it's dated. And yet and yet it turns out to be more sophisticated than expected. The gangsters are disorderly disruptive and destructive but not truly menacing until they chase Kathie on their bikes. Before that they are mostly just annoying. Johnny's affected nihilistic cool famously summed up by his answer Whatayagot? to the question of what he's rebelling against is pierced but not annihilated by his attraction to Kathie. The townspeople are not merely the innocent victims of the big bad motorcycle gangsters. It is they who form a vigilante committee and take the Rebel Johnny into a back room and beat him up even though it turns out that he's done very little other than stonily defy authority and behave rudely to anyone who tries to penetrate his affected cool. It is they who cause Jimmy's death by throwing a tire iron at Johnny on his motorcycle. It is they who refuse to listen to Kathie the only one who knows what's going on. The bikers are certainly not the good guys but the townspeople come off as worse in the end.Don't forget that when this movie was made the good guys were always supposed to be good the bad guys were always bad and the story had to have a happy ending or failing that it had to have a moral ending in which the tragic consequences of evil winning the day were made abundantly clear. In the end Johnny does not settle down or cease to be a rebel. He never says another word to her but he does show up one last time and leaves the emblematic trophy with Kathie bestowing a smile upon her his first and only friendly expression before riding away for good. This defiance if that's the right word for it of American cinematic norms was innovative for its time.".

People see them as hoodlums they define themselves as rebels  but Johnny gives the perfect answer to the inevitable question. What have you got?Indeed there's nothing that doesn't invite to rebellion it's not just being against the norm or the system but not even making a norm out of one's rebellion the idea is simply to go to escape from the conditioning and alienating effect of civilization. These guys aren't the baby boomers they lived the War they remember its effect on the elder they inherited an America to rebuild but the spirit was all lost in the greatest generation's souls. They're part of the rebirth of America and its conquering spirit but only in the name of motorbikes bottle of beers and rock'n'roll.The Wild One directed by Laslo Benedek is the first of a trilogy that can be defined as the Rebellious Youth of the 50's followed by Blackboard Jungle and the the iconic Rebel Without a Cause a title that could have fitted this one. James Dean's movie dealt with rebellion from an Oedipal point of view showing the roots of the youth's unease the absence of a true model to respect. Blackboard Jungle was more about the failure of education. But The Wild One shows the results without getting through their background all we see is these kids in their 20's looking for vast landscapes for driving bars where partying and towns for terrorizing.And the first two films have one thing in common they start with the infamous headliners you know these big words that don't take the viewer's intelligence for granted. Yes we know the whole rhapsody this lost youth is revealing of the failure of a system  and let us pray for it will never happen again. Did we need that? I guess it's like the famous CagneyRobinson movies in the 30's were people weren't used to see gangster playing the lead roles. Well the 50's had to deal with rebellious minds no less dangerous except for the fact that they didn't cause trouble for money they had no reason whatsoever to act like they did they did because  well why not?And the casting of Marlon Brando as the seminal rebellious kid is the film's masterstroke not just because of his iconic look 2 years before James Dean with the leather jacket the hat and the Triumph one of the most defining images of the 50's there's more to that there's Marlon Brando there's this constant enigma engraved in his face. This is something I sensed in most of the characters he played in the 50's we never exactly know what he thinks what he feels and most of the time his character gets away with his secret. Johnny Stabler is no exception he doesn't emerge from the group as a leader but as a natural outcast with one hell of an aura.This is pure Brandonian detachment and I love it. See how he subtly escapes from the gang as soon as he sees the beautiful Kathie Mary Murphy yes it's obligatory romantic subplot but Brando elevates it to another dimension ever improving HER acting by the miracle of his presence. I suspect the moment she tried to get the capsule of his bottle and he took it away from her was one of these improvisations he has the secrets. Brando plays everything he's tough sensitive intriguing and fascinating. Ultimately she despises his gang but in no way she can despise him because there is something incredibly attractive in that guy who doesn't enjoy attracting.This is the rebellious attitude a nihilistic escape in the world and within oneself without coming back with no one on one's back. Stabler has no connection with the past he never looks back if he takes the girl she's got to go with him if he doesn't trust the cop it's because he did before and it cost him a lot. Always moving forward . Is his motto although when one of his gang friends is injured by an old man observing the cute Kathie he decides to stay. The townspeople try to accommodate with the gang but it's only a matter of time and beer that the generation gap shows its limits forcing the local councilman Mary's meek father to interfere. But the man is incapable to use his weapon abandoning all the control to the angry mob lead by a local bully.The Wild One isn't the subtlest script ever but I admire its straightforward way to make its point in 80 minutes that feel longer this is how thrilling it is. There is a bit of wilderness and softheadedness in all of us it's all about which button to press. Its primitive simplistic but for some reason it works and Brando is mainly the cause but I wouldn't attribute all the merit to him there is a stellar performance from Lee Marvin as his rival Chino almost stealing the legend's show and an unrecognizably young Tim Carey as one of the hoodlums.As simple as the film is it'll be forever renowned for its iconic image of Brando and his indelible quote enough to put it in the legendary 50's a mustsee definitely a cultclassic  or the Easy Rider of the 50's And Marlon Brando was born to be the Wild one.".

	schema:reviewBody "Every so often that movie comes along that defies everything everyone and all expectations.  It reaches beyond the realms of mere big screen entertainment and constructs iconography and archetypes that are so enduring that to this day they are relevant and have an effect.  Make no mistake about it The Wild One is THE first movie to represent a youth culture of any description.  People cite Rebel Without A Cause as the first youth culture movie BUT this movie came before and in my opinion is by far the better movieThe story centres on Johnny Strabler Marlon Brando and his motorcycle gang who terrorise a small California town alongside another motorcycle gang led by Chino a young Lee Marvin.  After Chino's arrest for out of hand antics the gangs run wild during the night doing with the town as they please from attacking the telephone operator freeing Chino from prison to attacking a citizens house whom they believe responsible for Chino's arrest and accosting just about every female in the town.  While Johnny is not totally blameless for this he is most definitely NOT the instigator that everyone makes him out to be.  This does not stop the townspeople adopting a mob mentality and going at Johnny with all guns blazing.  However while they are planning this there is a love story unfolding between Johnny and the daughter of a cop a love story that is never truly consummated.  The cops daughter had intrigued Johnny since the beginning since she had appeared untouchable.  He saves her from the wrath of the rest of the B.R.M.C. the name given to Johnny's motorcycle gang and takes her to a forest where after some heated Academy Award flavoured dialogue and a kiss and a slap the cops daughter runs from Johnny although not FROM Johnny.  The running stands for a metaphor related to suburban societal entrapment.  Johnny is later caught and battered by the mob until the towns cop unknowingly stalls the mob for Johnny to escape.  Johnny grabs his motorcycle and attempts to ride out when something a tyre iron is thrown at the wheel of his moving bike and causing is to fly out of control and into an elderly citizen. And when it seems that Johnny is going to go to jail for an extremely LONG time a couple of towns people including the cops daughter decide to tell a few truths that help Johnny get out of it.  Johnny and his boys leave town never to return.The mere storyline of this movie is simply not enough to translate exactly what it is that this movie stands for and is responsible for.  A scene that is and forever shall be ingrained into the Hollywood psyche is when Johnny is standing by a jukebox and one of his gang members is dancing with a girl and she asks B.R.M.C. what does that stand for?'.  Johnny's gang member replies The Black Rebels Motorcycle Club' and she replies Hey Johnny what are you rebelling against?' and he replies in what could very possibly be the most career defining sentence that has ever been uttered onscreen Whaddya got?'.  Now in this day and age that comes across as incredibly trite and corny but in those days in that social environment that existed in Western Culture that movie was called incendiary and ran into censorship troubles cue The Hayes Code and in England was banned outright until sometime in the mid 70s.  While watching this movie one must remain totally and utterly aware of the context of this movie.Another the scene that was the cause of many a raised eyebrow and was exactly what makes every kid on earth that's ever been condescended to by teacher and parents and the like totally empathise is the scene where the cops daughter and the cop have saved Johnny's life and Johnny is being read the riot act by the Sheriff and he just sits there looking at the floor c'mon guys u know you've been in that position before totally listening but appearing as if he isn't.  As Johnny is strutting out of the room the cop stop him by asking if he has anything to say to these people who have basically saved his life at least from jail.  The cop even prompts him so far as to say You could at least say 'Thank You'.  Johnny doesn't move doesn't turn to look at them doesn't speak.  This silence is broken by the cops daughter who says It's OK he doesn't know how'.  This on it's own cements John Strabler and the most archetypal rebel.  The key here is in relating to the character.  Everybody from your typical fedup suburban teenager to your urban delinquents to a three year old can understand the complexities and the moral stand that is taken by someone when they decide that they will not do things like apologise or thank people.  Youth rebellion was a complete and utter non entity in the 50s no one could fathom kids doing things like this.  Kids up until the 50s merely did what there parents did.  This movie was the first to challenge all this to challenge class oppression and gender roles even as there are women shock horror as members of Chino's motorcycle gang.

	onyx:emotionText "Every so often that movie comes along that defies everything everyone and all expectations.  It reaches beyond the realms of mere big screen entertainment and constructs iconography and archetypes that are so enduring that to this day they are relevant and have an effect.  Make no mistake about it The Wild One is THE first movie to represent a youth culture of any description.  People cite Rebel Without A Cause as the first youth culture movie BUT this movie came before and in my opinion is by far the better movieThe story centres on Johnny Strabler Marlon Brando and his motorcycle gang who terrorise a small California town alongside another motorcycle gang led by Chino a young Lee Marvin.  After Chino's arrest for out of hand antics the gangs run wild during the night doing with the town as they please from attacking the telephone operator freeing Chino from prison to attacking a citizens house whom they believe responsible for Chino's arrest and accosting just about every female in the town.  While Johnny is not totally blameless for this he is most definitely NOT the instigator that everyone makes him out to be.  This does not stop the townspeople adopting a mob mentality and going at Johnny with all guns blazing.  However while they are planning this there is a love story unfolding between Johnny and the daughter of a cop a love story that is never truly consummated.  The cops daughter had intrigued Johnny since the beginning since she had appeared untouchable.  He saves her from the wrath of the rest of the B.R.M.C. the name given to Johnny's motorcycle gang and takes her to a forest where after some heated Academy Award flavoured dialogue and a kiss and a slap the cops daughter runs from Johnny although not FROM Johnny.  The running stands for a metaphor related to suburban societal entrapment.  Johnny is later caught and battered by the mob until the towns cop unknowingly stalls the mob for Johnny to escape.  Johnny grabs his motorcycle and attempts to ride out when something a tyre iron is thrown at the wheel of his moving bike and causing is to fly out of control and into an elderly citizen. And when it seems that Johnny is going to go to jail for an extremely LONG time a couple of towns people including the cops daughter decide to tell a few truths that help Johnny get out of it.  Johnny and his boys leave town never to return.The mere storyline of this movie is simply not enough to translate exactly what it is that this movie stands for and is responsible for.  A scene that is and forever shall be ingrained into the Hollywood psyche is when Johnny is standing by a jukebox and one of his gang members is dancing with a girl and she asks B.R.M.C. what does that stand for?'.  Johnny's gang member replies The Black Rebels Motorcycle Club' and she replies Hey Johnny what are you rebelling against?' and he replies in what could very possibly be the most career defining sentence that has ever been uttered onscreen Whaddya got?'.  Now in this day and age that comes across as incredibly trite and corny but in those days in that social environment that existed in Western Culture that movie was called incendiary and ran into censorship troubles cue The Hayes Code and in England was banned outright until sometime in the mid 70s.  While watching this movie one must remain totally and utterly aware of the context of this movie.Another the scene that was the cause of many a raised eyebrow and was exactly what makes every kid on earth that's ever been condescended to by teacher and parents and the like totally empathise is the scene where the cops daughter and the cop have saved Johnny's life and Johnny is being read the riot act by the Sheriff and he just sits there looking at the floor c'mon guys u know you've been in that position before totally listening but appearing as if he isn't.  As Johnny is strutting out of the room the cop stop him by asking if he has anything to say to these people who have basically saved his life at least from jail.  The cop even prompts him so far as to say You could at least say 'Thank You'.  Johnny doesn't move doesn't turn to look at them doesn't speak.  This silence is broken by the cops daughter who says It's OK he doesn't know how'.  This on it's own cements John Strabler and the most archetypal rebel.  The key here is in relating to the character.  Everybody from your typical fedup suburban teenager to your urban delinquents to a three year old can understand the complexities and the moral stand that is taken by someone when they decide that they will not do things like apologise or thank people.  Youth rebellion was a complete and utter non entity in the 50s no one could fathom kids doing things like this.  Kids up until the 50s merely did what there parents did.  This movie was the first to challenge all this to challenge class oppression and gender roles even as there are women shock horror as members of Chino's motorcycle gang.  This could be the most exceptional piece of filmmaking that EVER happened.  I guarantee you that in no matter what town you live in that if you walk down the street you will see some degree of influence from this movie on the people you encounter. Without this movie the following things would not be the same in society1There would be no Rockabilly music of the same fashionable kind 2There would have to be ANOTHER image of the rebel possibly the James Dean created image of the rebel because this one would not be 3There would be no movies the way they are today in terms of youth rebellion this movie challenged censorship sensibilities 4The punk rock movement would be utterly different Jesus Christ Sid Vicious has Marlon Brando's jacket not to mention The Ramones 5A lot of modern music The B.R.M.C. for instance would not be the band they areThe point being made here is that the effect of this movie is beyond mere moviedom.

They looked so cleancut it was almost laughable hardly like the bikers since then. The gang member who looked the part was Lee Marvin as Chino who was a hoot the first time I saw this film but an overblown clown on subsequent viewings.The movie had some nice filmnoir photography too with some nice nighttime shots. The only negatives were a couple of stupid dialog scenes but you'll get that in dated pictures and in most movies of today too! 'The Wild One is corny but on a personal note I felt far better than the other '50s teenrebellion stories such as Rebel Without A Cause.".

Their strange almostromance never quite materializes despite a strong attraction between them. Their lifestyles and attitudes are just too different for them to ever be a successful couple. But I think one of the most powerful aspects of this movie is the theme of male and female miscommunication of thwarted longings for understanding and intimacy.

When the sad lonely Kathy is almost ready to fling herself into his arms he literally pushes her away. These themes of longing for love and understanding fear of vulnerability inability of the sexes to understand each other are just as valid today as when the film was new they are timeless. The movie has a lot of great Fifties JD stuff including bike races fights the hipster slang spouted by the bikers to the bewilderment of the townspeople the legendary  What are you rebelling against?...What have you got? exchange between Johnny and one of the town girls looking for excitement.

	schema:reviewBody "Would this movie still be watched but for Brando's performance? I think not  it would be relegated to the scrap heap of old B movies. But Brando carries the movie by having the right qualities to play Johnny Strabler the leader of a motorcycle gang that creates havoc in a small California town. Brando plays Johhny with sullen smoldering rebelliousness with a suggestion of depth and vulnerability underneath. Brando had already shown his abilities in A Streetcar Named Desire and was soon to make On the Waterfront. The performance here is not up to those standards but it is engaging. At the time he made this movie Brando's star power was such that he could name his roles so it is interesting to speculate why he chose to make this. Maybe this role appealed to his own rebellious spirit.The movie is dated for sure but you may learn some things about the 1950s that you won't find in the history books. Many early 50s anachronisms are in evidence 78 records on the jukebox references to television as being new bebop music and argot local HUMAN telephone operators. The comment the old bartender makes about the advent of TV is prescient Everything is noise and pictures nobody talks to anyone anymore  there is more truth to that with each passing decade. The score  generic loud obvious and intrusive  would not be accepted in contemporary movies. Johnny's attempt to be cool by snapping his fingers to music on the jukebox is so phony as to be embarrassing. One interesting thing was to see an early version of the highfive in response to the interjection pop me. But credit must be given for this being one of the first mainstream movies to treat the rebellion against the claustrophobic conformity and cold war angst of the early 50s. It was unique for its time.We do not get much motivation for the reasons the gang members behave the way they do. There are mighty few specifics about the guys in the gang  where they come from how they support themselves or what they do besides terrorize small towns. We get only a hint of Johnny's past when during a beating by the locals he says My old man used to hit harder than that. But maybe all we need to know comes from Johnny's extolling the feeling he gets when getting on his cycle to just go.There are many memorable scenes like the one where Johnny is asked if he doesn't want to thank some people who have done him a good deed and he comes to an inarticulate stop only to have his woman friend say That's okay he doesn't know how. Lee Marvin has a good go playing Chino the head of a rival gang that had split off from Johnny's. Chino is the more stereotypical bad ass. He may not have the complex personality of Johnny but Marvin seems to be having such a grand time in playing him that it is hard not to share in the fun.There is some interesting photography such as the opening scene where the cyclists roar right over the camera placed in the center of the road. And there is some good nighttime black and white work as well.In an era of driveby shootings heavy drug trafficking and internet pornography the events in this movie can seem pretty tame but one should not underestimate the number of themes addressed  ones that are still relevant standing up to intimidation vigilantism the desire for freedom misinterpretation of behavior with unfortunate consequences the proper use of force sex crowd behavior generational conflicts and confusions the ills of stereotyping and greed.Also one lesson to be learned is that steatopygous actors should not wear tight jeans.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Wild One created a sensation when it first came out in 1954. Directed by Laszlo Benedek and written by John Paxton its story which concerns a gang of motorcycle punks that take virtual control of a small California town is based on fact. As the lead bad boy Marlon Brando already a top star became a movie legend as much because of this film as anything he'd done previously. This is the sort of movie that kids went to see repeatedly as they went to see Easy Rider much later on. Yet within a year James Dean would make East Of Eden and after that Rebel Without a Cause and his death in an auto accident not long afterwards would make him even more or a symbol of youthful rebellion than Brando had been. As a result The Wild One has been somewhat neglected by film historians. That director Benedek has never enjoyed anywhere near the critical acclaim of the Dean triumvirate of Kazan Ray and Stevens doesn't help matters and that middlebrow liberal Stanley Kramer produced this film only makes things worse.This movie is quite different from Rebel or for that matter its urban counterpart The Blackboard Jungle. It's about disaffected young men rather than teens. There's a beatnick edge to these characters that probably didn't appeal as much to the very young as the relatively benign confusion of Dean and his causeless rebels. The black leather jackets are intimidating the style of these young men is lower middletoworking class. One wonders where they came from. Are they veterans? If so had they served in the war? If so which one? I find myself asking odd questions when watching this movie. There's an air of experience to these bikers that the mixedup suburban kids of other youth films don't have. They aren't poor city guys trapped by poverty either. Since they move around a lot they seem free though one's inner social worker can't help but make the observation that they're really as trapped by their perpetual motion as any inhabitant of a coldwater flat. Or are they? They don't seemed trapped. Let's get real it's the middleaged townspeople held captive by these bikers who are trapped.Alas the romance between bad boy Johnny and the local good girl is worked out conventionally. Yet there are ironies at work here. The local union hall types are nothing to get excited about and at their worst they are as jerky as any of the bikers. Virtue is presented as boring even depressing yet another kind of trap the straight world sets up and another thing to get away from. Some of the dialog is strictly fifties textbook Freud my old man could hit harder than that! but some of it is good even classic question what are you rebelling against? answer what have you got?.There's a real sexual tension at work in this film from the first scene to the last. Though the script doesn't come out and say so these young men are essentially potential rapists gangbangers on wheels. The later youth films softpedaled the sex or made it seem safe. In The Wild One the bikes are plainly phallic the the young men adults not kids and sexually hungry the older men are or appear to be sexless and with their neat little uniforms and shirts and ties they all seem ready for the embalmer.".

Yes it has dated as all highly styled films do but if you get over that and open yourself up to the visuals especially Brando's starry performance as a contrast to everyone around him this film is fantastically enjoyable! It's also quite remarkable when you think about other films of the period and especially the clothes of the leading men  tight jeans were quite extraordinary. I loved the information from another user that Brando was selfconscious about the size of his bum. Marlon if you happen to read this don't worry you were a babe! Helped along by leather frothing beer bottles and shiny bikes of course! This film was banned in Britain until 1968 less to do with the plot and more to do with the films sensational and fetishistic qualities I would imagine. If you have only found yourself laughing up till now have a different look at the scene between Brando and Mary Murphy out under the stars his costume and the bike glittering or the coffee shop with all its shiny paraphenalia... just the sort of thing to upset the male censors and where the real power of the film lies.".

Upon entering the local caf he spies a young waitress by the name of Kathie Bleeker Mary Murphy and decides to get to know her a little better. Not long afterward another motorcycle gang called the Beetles also arrives and their leader named Chino Lee Marvin decides to provoke Johnny into a fight in the middle of the street. One thing leads to another and Chino is eventually arrested which causes both motorcycle clubs to spend the night in Wrightsville. That's when all hell breaks loose. Now rather than reveal any more of this movie and risk spoiling it for those who haven't seen it I will just say that although this film is rather dated it still manages to entertain fairly well. I especially liked the performances of both Marlon Brando and Mary Murphy who both played their parts quite well.

On the other hand polite formal language is allowed almost anywhere even when communicating nothing but hatred and violence. Power always privileges its own discourse whilst marginalising those who would challenge it or that are the victims of its power.  Junot Daz Stanley Kramer's The Wild One opens on the dusty streets of California. Young Johnny Strabler Marlon Brando then slides into view perched atop a motorcycle and dressed in sunglasses and leather. He's flanked by the Black Rebels a boisterous motorcycle club who drift from town to town.Early scenes find Strabler and his gang disrupting a community motorcycle race. Not allowed to participate Strabler steals a second place trophy an irreverent gesture which Kramer knows speaks only to Strabler's insecurities sense of inferiority and desires to belong.

In other words the film's your typical Stanley Kramer production calculated to please any and everyone.Despite this The Wild One was deemed positively shocking. It was accused of promoting criminality banned by British censors not released in England until 1968 and attacked by conservative groups in America who deemed it a plot to undermine America's youth. It was also turned down by censors at the Breen Office who decided that it breached the Motion Picture Production Code a ruling which forced script alterations. For Kramer though Strabler's just a confused guy looking for love. What are you rebelling against Johnny? a character asks him early in the film. Whataya got? he sullenly replies not quite sure himself. Like a canary in a coal mine unable to articulate exactly why its lungs burn social rage and the violent outbursts it oft leads to is always felt worse by those who can't articulate disaffection.One must remember the context in which The Wild One was released. This was a world of picket fences Eisenhower traditionalism whitecollar nine to fives corner churches grey flannel suits the Korean war McCarthyism a burgeoning hyperconsumerism and corporate conformity. Under this all lay the ticking timebomb of the Beats the hippies the jazz and folk scenes Kerouac rock and roll irate leftists and the sexual revolution. Change was coming baby and daddy was nervous.Today's fad is oft tomorrow's joke so as emblems of rebellious machismo the Black Rebels are mostly ridiculous. They strut about like effete peacocks straddling engines disturbing the peace and spouting a strange blend of Beatlingo jazz slang and 1950s hipster. And because today's conception of masculinity is always the camp comedy of tomorrow  displays of masculinity are always bound to insecurity and so are always eventually deemed effeminate dweeby or camp  contemporary audiences will no doubt find Brando and his buddies giant laughing stocks.But behind such dated rituals Kramer teases out a sense of youthful disaffection that is virtually timeless. Strabler's alienated melancholic wants to fit in but refuses to abide by a postWar conformity that he finds abhorrent. For Strabler only two choices thus exist playing by the rules or self destructive violence. Audiences loved this. Brando's sexily wounded persona would tap into a zeitgeist seduce young men and women and become the template for later icons like James Dean and Paul Newman. One of the first characters to exploit the misunderstood youth vs the establishment gap from Brando can be drawn a line to everything from Rebel Without a Cause to Jailhouse Rock to Easy Rider.Structurally and aesthetically The Wild One plays like a western motorcycles replacing horses leather jackets replacing spurs and pistols. Brando's the archetypal drifter who rides into a dusty inhospitable town. Ironic for a film about supposed hooliganism the film's at its best when Brando's simply slouching over tables or quietly eyeballing the pretty Kathie Bleeker. All desire pain and subtle insecurity his character possesses a selfawareness which others in the Black Rebels do not. Strabler's aware of how others perceive him. He feels their gaze. And he knows that Kathie in particular sees through all his calculated posturing. Around her he feels ashamed of his speech his lifestyle attempts to disguise his tongue but she doesn't care. More maternal figure than lover Kathie sympathises with the unspoken roots of wild ones. The film then ends with Kathie rescuing Strabler though the two can't remain together. Strabler drives off dust in his wake. The mighty Lee Marvin costars.810  See Jimmy's Hall 2014.".

On the other hand polite formal language is allowed almost anywhere even when communicating nothing but hatred and violence. Power always privileges its own discourse whilst marginalising those who would challenge it or that are the victims of its power.  Junot Daz Stanley Kramer's The Wild One opens on the dusty streets of California. Young Johnny Strabler Marlon Brando then slides into view perched atop a motorcycle and dressed in sunglasses and leather. He's flanked by the Black Rebels a boisterous motorcycle club who drift from town to town.Early scenes find Strabler and his gang disrupting a community motorcycle race. Not allowed to participate Strabler steals a second place trophy an irreverent gesture which Kramer knows speaks only to Strabler's insecurities sense of inferiority and desires to belong. Subsequent scenes watch as Strabler and his boys journey to a nearby town. Here they collide with irate townsfolk.

I tuned into Turner Classic Movies expecting pure camp with only Brando to lend precious little substance only to be surprised at how moved I was at the conclusion eighty minutes later. Not that I am suggesting this is an unjustly regarded masterwork like I said it is schlock and often too cheesy to take seriously. Yet in spite of the relatively tame action on screen and the cheesy frat boy antics of the bikers there's still something going on underneath the surface a palpable sense of frustration and alienation.The Wild One hits on the tyranny of conformity in 1950s America and the way the younger generation fears a life that is painfully ordinary and staid. This is best illustrated in Kathie who makes it clear that the idea of settling down and then dying in the same boring town is terrifying for her there's a rebellious nonconformist streak in her most obvious when she offers herself to Johnny on the outskirts of the town and yet this scene also shows she's only willing to go that far if he continues with his rouse of forcing himself on her. She won't break away from the conformity of the town unless a man takes her away from it all. She craves the free life Johnny seems to possess.And yet even Johnny is a lost soul who has no clue what he really wants at all. We're given little of his past aside from the implication that he had an abusive childhood. While in no way the best performance of Brando's career it is a fine one one which elevates the film. He utilizes facial expression and body language to communicate all the isolation and adolescent confusion that the schlock dialogue cannot fully deliver. In the end Johnny is still an enigma though judging from his final moment with Kathie he does seem to be more at peace with himself. You really do have to wonder where he'll be going after this if he's still just going to wander forever. And what of Kathie? Will she ever free herself from that sad little county?These questions lend such a poignancy to the ending almost making you forget how cheesy everything else was before. But I like the lack of absolute resolution. It gives those star cross'd lovers an afterlife that few Bmovie characters enjoy.".

	schema:reviewBody "High Sierra  is almost excruciatingly important in the development of cinema laying to bed the  gangster picture  of the 1930's while simultaneously giving birth to American film noir.  Oh and it made Humphrey Bogart a major star while it was at it.  Therefore I'm not entirely sure that your film collection if you have one can survive without it.Based on a pulpy novel it chronicles the story of Roy Earle sprung from a life sentence in prison so that he can knock over a casino along the CaliforniaNevada border.  It's easy to miss but notice the first minute of this picture closely  it's of course the Governor  bought off by a mobster  who gets Roy released from his life sentence indicating that the corruption has finely infested the top of the social order.  This is the usual toughminded whistleblowing gangsterpicture stuff that Warner Bros. specialized in.  But there's also something else at work here perhaps something new  one gets the sense that what happens to Roy in this movie has been engineered from On High in advance . . . in other words he's in the Jaws of Fate.  And thus we're in the unforgiving world of Film Noir.More than the opening scene it's Bogart who almost singlehandedly invents film noir with his groundbreaking work in  High Sierra.  Not cocky like Cagney and Muni not psychopathic like the early Edward G. Robinson not as smooth as Raft Bogart is a ruthless professional with a wide stripe of sentimentality.  His Roy never shirks from killing but he doesn't get off on it.  He's more a rebel than a gangster a poetic soul denied respectability a man longing for the innocence of his youth. Unfortunately he thinks he finds in the personage of a transplanted Okie farmgirl  Joan Leslie  a reasonable facsimile of that innocence. Competing for his affections is Ida Lupino a sour  dimeadance girl who's been up down and around the block a time or three.  She's the baggage that comes with the two newgeneration hoods whom Bogart is assigned to babysit for the casino heist.  Not until later in the picture does Bogart recognize Lupino's better suitability to his own temperament and experience. They share in common among other things suicidal impulses a desire to escape a corrupted world.Roy Earle was a new type of character  the truly romantic criminal. Bogart would play variations on Earle throughout his career though he rarely exceeded his triumph here.  And while I've given the actor much of the credit some more credit must be extended to the screenwriter John Huston.  High Sierra  was the beginning of a beautiful friendship.Oh and did I mention that the movie  aside from its importance in American film history yadda yadda  is quite simply a good time?  Witty dialogue great onlocation direction by Raoul Walsh a cute dog and a climactic car chase that wouldn't be equaled until 1968's  Bullitt are just some of this movie's other virtues.".

The movie version of the book isn't quite as good but it does something few adaptations do it captures the spirit of the original.The story is about a John Dillingerlike criminal Roy Earle just released from prison and his planning of his last 'heist' as he moves from the Midwest to California. It's as much a character study as anything else and here the book is better as Burnett seems to get inside the heart and soul of Roy Earle in ways that screenwriter John Huston and director Raoul Walsh can't. This isn't their fault. Burnett gives us Earle's inner life in interior monologues and movies simply can't do this. Nevertheless we get a feeling for Earle a lonely extremely sentimental and romantic man essentially a frontier type or with more brains an artist who cannot fit into modern life. The reason is simple he doesn't understand it. He is driven by two things strong emotions and extreme professionalism. The problem is that his profession is crime. Between these two extremes he is unsocialized or rather doesn't understand the subtlety of contemporary life. To put it in current parlance he's not hip which is to say he has no detachment no capacity for pulling back and reflecting unless that is he is in love and even then he gets it wrong by misunderstanding an attractive crippled girl's reliance on him for love and taking her country girl disposition for naivite i.e. like him which isn't true. This tragic aspect of Roy Earle is beautifully and perceptively described by Burnett and while it's present in the film it makes Roy seem obtuse while the truth is his emotions run deep and are sincere. He wants to give up crime and marry a smalltown girl so that he can go back and get it right again. In the lead role Humphrey Bogart gives a major performance. Superficially he's wrong for Roy Earle too urban flip smart and clever. But he trades in his natural big city persona for a moony brooding romanticism and it works. He doesn't seem the least bit sophisticated and in his quieter moments he comes off like a man who can kill the way other men write checksHe has a true girlfriend in Ida Lupino but he doesn't realize that she's more his type lifeweary straightforward deep and caring. He prefers the one he can't get and this gets him in trouble as his commitment to her puts him in a dreamy dissociative state that is dangerous for a man in his line of work. The story builds on little things and the bucolic mountain and smalltown setting of the film is terra incognita for Roy and we sense this even if he doesn't. He is for all his professionalism way out of his league and is looking back to his idealized romanticized early life and longing for an ideal girl that he can 'fix' rather than doing the right thing and going off with Lupino and stating anew which is his only chance for happiness.Roy is a man who lives in two parallel worlds the real vicious one he must cope with and the fantasy one he longs for and sees in the crippled girl he so tenderly loves. There is no inbetween for him as his head is in the clouds much of the time. It is therefore fitting that the movie ends up literally in the clouds or so it seems atop a mountain as Roy shoots it out with reality one last time.".

Bogart could be pretty good as a comedic actor but you wouldn't know it from his performance here which is the working out of a tragedy. The script is by John Huston and it shows. He was a good writer. That little lesson Earl teaches the youngsters about how a Thompson submachine gun goes off he taps his fingers three times on the table is memorable. There are other good lines. Bogart and the young girl have a folksy little exchange about how if you watch the stars long enough you can almost feel the earth turning beneath you. The Doc Henry Hull describes Earle as rushing towards death. Okay Dillinger said it first but it was Huston who put it in the script. Mediocre score but good photography. Skidding cars leave clouds of dust during the final chase. The road to Whitney Portals is now paved. And without intending to the movie makes one nostalgic for the simpler world of 1941. Not simply unpaved roads but a different world all around. When was the last time we saw a small town that was not a bedroom community part of urban sprawl?A good movie. Catch it if you can.".

	schema:reviewBody "Humphrey Bogart's screen name in High Sierra is Roy 'Mad Dog' Earle. But it's clear from the outset that if Bogart is anything he's not crazy. Bogart may have been a wild guy in his youth but he's now a middleaged man who is fully aware that he can't do anything else but continue in a life crime. He's got the resume and the reputation for that and nothing else. What else can he do but accept an offer to crew chief a heist at an expensive resort hotel in Nevada.He can't pick the men he'd like they're probably all dead or in the joint. He gets some young punks assigned to him by Barton MacLane who is acting as a middleman for boss Donald MacBride out on the west coast. Bogey gets Alan Curtis Arthur Kennedy and an informant at the hotel Cornel Wilde. Curtis and Kennedy are getting their hormones in overdrive over Ida Lupino.On the way west Bogey meets up with a near do well family headed by Henry Travers and he starts crushing out on teenager Joan Leslie. They represent to him a simpler time before he took up crime as a living. The first half of the film sets up the characters the second part is the robbery and it's aftermath. In that second half High Sierra moves at a really good clip. Not too many went out for popcorn when it was shown in theaters back in the day.High Sierra was one of three films that George Raft turned down and were given to Humphrey Bogart that established him as a leading man. The other two were The Maltese Falcon and Casablanca. Raft must have had some agent back in the day.Of course Bogart is playing a gangster but this one is a three dimensional character and a fine piece of work. It represented a big advance from some of the villains he played at Warner Brothers during the late Thirties.High Sierra was directed by Raoul Walsh and another Hollywood icon director John Huston cowrote the screenplay. There's a lot of similarity with this and Huston's later classic The Asphalt Jungle.High Sierra was remade twice as a western with the miscast Joel McCrea in Bogart's role and in the Fifties as I Died a Thousand Times with Jack Palance. I daresay it could be made again quite easily for this generation it's story is timeless.".

	schema:headline " Bogart the sympathetic gangster";
	schema:reviewBody "This was Bogart's breakthrough film. Though Lupino got top billing over him on account of her filmstealing performance the year earlier in another Raoul Walsh work 'They Drive By Night' it is Bogart's performance that makes the film so memorable.He plays Roy Earle a Dillingerlike gangster from the 30's who is released from jail with a dodgy paidoff pardon. He is to lead one last big jewel heist but finds himself displaced and at odds with the new 'jitterbugging' 1940's society. Instead of being chummy with the new lot of crims he finds he has more common with the dispossessed Oakies figures from his past he can sympathize with. He is a man caught between two worlds Perhaps what Dillinger would have been like if he had lived? The Dillinger likeness is hard to ignore with his name cropping up a couple of times in the film and this is a film that is sort of 'caught' between two genres. It marks the transition from the gritty 30's Warner Bros. gangster films to the pessimistic lowbudget 40's noir. 'High Sierra' has elements of both so it is an interesting study.In my opinion this is one of Bogart's best performances and best characters That said Bogart played so many great characters in his career that it is very difficult to pick and choose. We have moved on from the portrayal of the psychotic gangster in the 30's by a Muni or a Cagney Earle is a sympathetic gangster figure. He is given definite human qualities he has a heart and a soul. He's also willing to 'play the sap' for a dame and this is noticeable in his unrequited love for a much younger girl Velma. His care and attentiveness to the girl who has a club foot is character building a beautiful component of Bogart's performance. The fact that Roy is rejected by Velma who becomes wanton and selfish after her foot is repaired only serves to endear him more to us.Roy's perfect girl is in the fine form of Marie Garson Ida Lupino great performance a 30's survivor like himself. She's also cynical weary and downtrodden and knows about life's hard knocks. She's in love with Bogart throughout but Bogie only wakes up to this and her devotion to him after being dealt a cruel blow by Velma. Lupino a British actress is maybe a little unconvincing as the gangster's moll because of her English diction and accent but she plays the part very well. Joan Leslie overacts in her role Velma but she was only 17 so it's largely due to inexperience. She handles Velma's transformation with accurate judgement.Raoul Walsh handles the action very well this a fastpaced film with some terrific and wellcrafted sequences.Certain racist elements are apparent in the film with the alltoo requisite 'idiot black' making an appearance. Looking at the film now it's a backwards portrayal but at the time nothing would have been thought of it. Perhaps we should be glad that an AfricanAmerican actor was actually getting a chance in the films not condemning a film that is very much a product of a bygone era.I never thought that I would be crying at the end of a Warner Bros. film from the gangster cycle but this film leaves me in tears at it's conclusion. We know that Earle as an outlaw must ultimately die but by the end of the film we are rooting for him so much that it is a painful saddening blow when the inevitable occurs. The famous last scene in the mountains is justifiably brilliant with Lupino terrific in her emotions and Bogart in his desperation. They make a great team Bogart and Lupino. Oh and 'Pard' too.1010.".

She's in love with Bogart throughout but Bogie only wakes up to this and her devotion to him after being dealt a cruel blow by Velma. Lupino a British actress is maybe a little unconvincing as the gangster's moll because of her English diction and accent but she plays the part very well. Joan Leslie overacts in her role Velma but she was only 17 so it's largely due to inexperience. She handles Velma's transformation with accurate judgement.Raoul Walsh handles the action very well this a fastpaced film with some terrific and wellcrafted sequences.Certain racist elements are apparent in the film with the alltoo requisite 'idiot black' making an appearance. Looking at the film now it's a backwards portrayal but at the time nothing would have been thought of it. Perhaps we should be glad that an AfricanAmerican actor was actually getting a chance in the films not condemning a film that is very much a product of a bygone era.I never thought that I would be crying at the end of a Warner Bros. film from the gangster cycle but this film leaves me in tears at it's conclusion. We know that Earle as an outlaw must ultimately die but by the end of the film we are rooting for him so much that it is a painful saddening blow when the inevitable occurs. The famous last scene in the mountains is justifiably brilliant with Lupino terrific in her emotions and Bogart in his desperation. They make a great team Bogart and Lupino. Oh and 'Pard' too.1010.";

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is a very complex film for its time that combines elements of the old tried and true gangster film film noir and melodrama. It makes for good viewing today and is a very good showcase of Bogart's versatility as an actor. The main character is Roy 'Mad Dog' Earle Bogart a man released from prison by a wealthy old associate so that he can pull off a big jewelry heist at a resort near the CaliforniaNevada state line. On his crosscountry trek to reach the destination of the robbery Roy meets the Goodhue family. The Goodhues have lost their farm and are on the way to stay with relatives that just happen to live near Roy's destination. When Roy arrives where the rest of the mob is staying he finds two toughguy wannabes Babe and Red that are constantly fighting over a girl  Marie Garson Ida Lupino. At first the younger hired guns don't respect Roy. They think he is old and washed up. However he soon shows them who is in charge and they don't challenge him again.Only a few of the minor characters are painted totally good or bad  such as the elder Goodhues on one extreme and Babe and Red on the other. The major characters have subtle shades of both good and evil in their personalities. This is particularly true of Roy. He longs for the simple life among good people that the Goodhues remind him of yet during the course of the robbery he must pull off and its aftermath he thinks nothing of killing in order to accomplish his aim. Roy is actually capable of great kindness helping out the Goodhues when they get in an auto accident and don't have any insurance and even paying for Velma's operation to remove a birth defect so that she can walk normally. Roy falls in love with Velma one of the Goodhues' relatives believing her to be a simple and decent girl. However he finds she changes into the most hardboiled of people once her handicap is removed. Her final rebuff to Roy is filled with almost unwatchable cruelty.The woman who actually cares for Roy is Marie. It takes time for Roy to accept this since it seems hard for him to believe that people can have both good and bad in them even though this is very much a trait of Roy's own character. Marie has a background completely opposite that of Velma's mentioning how she was beaten by her father as a child and then went on to work for a dime a dance place before winding up with Red and Babe. She has great heart but she lacks judgment which she herself admits. The odd piece of symbolism built into this movie is Pard the hardluck dog who has seen each of his owners die untimely deaths. In spite of this Roy makes a pet of the dog seeming to confirm the fact that he is indeed running towards death. In the end it is this friendly little dog that is in fact Roy's undoing.".

In fact it is this film made the same year as The Maltese Falcon and directed by Raoul Walsh not John Huston and Michael Curtiz. Based on a novel by W.R.Burnett author of Little Caesar and The Asphalt Jungle it is quite well written. Roy Earle Bogie is a clone of Dillinger like Bogie's first notable role of Duke Mantee in The Petrified Forrest. He has been in prison but he gets an early release by bribes engineered by an old friend Donald MacBride in a good serious performance. MacBride is planning the robbery of a luxury resort and needs Bogart to do it. But Bogart finds that MacBride's assistant an excop played by Barton MacLane is untrustworthy. He also worries about the young men he has to work with  especially a too friendly inside man Cornell Wilde in one of his first roles. And on top of everything else there is the matter of a young girl with a club foot Joan Leslie that could be Bogart's daughter. He falls for her and wants to help cure her. He can when he has the cash  he has a friendly doctor Henry Hull to assist him. But he is so hung up about the girl that he ignores the signs of another tougher woman Ida Lupino who does show an interest in him. Also he tries to ignore the stories of demons and doom regarding an adorable little dog that a caretaker Willie Best tells him.The film is a first rate one just a smidge less impressive than The Maltese Falcon and Casablanca because of the strength of the script. High Sierra is well written but it has no memorable quotes like Of all the gin joints.... or I enjoy talking to a man.... Willie Best's details about the illluck pursuing the dog is the best stretch of real dialogue in the film and today due to feelings about racial stereotyping concerning Best many people tend to overlook how it sets the stage for later levels of the tragedy in the film.The only problem I have regarding it is Jerome Cowan. He is given one of the lead positions in the credits but his role a reporter who appears in the last ten minutes of the film doesn't merit it. He also has dialogue directed to Ida Lupino suggesting they met or know each other somehow. There appears to have been cut scenes in the film. Was Cowan in those cut scenes?".

In principle everything in High Sierra follows the patterns of this glorious genre but after watching it several times you come to the conclussion that this movie is much darker than the most of gangster's movies. This Gangster this Roy Earle Bogart at his best is not heartless and cruel as james Cagney's Scarface for example. No. This Roy Earle really wants to quit on being an outlaw. He wants to go back to the farm where he grew up and start a new life. He meets a decent girl Joan Leslie and falls in love with her... But leaving the underworld is not that easy. Once you've killed and robbed you're forever marked. And that's the cross that Earle's gotta carry. Finally he realizes that this life he's dreaming about the good girl the farm kids running around... it's not gonna be possible. So he put up with being an outlaw and loving the bad girl the flirtitious one Ida Lupino great woman...   the one that really loves him because she understands him because they both came from the same place. Much more than a simple ganster's movie High Sierra is a drama about what means to be a marked man. Raoul Walsh does an outstanding job as expected from such a giant. The script is signed by none other than Mr. John Huston and perfect would be the aproppiate word to define it. The dialogues are powerful dinamic maybe a little sexist but it was 1941 and anyway Roy Earle treats women much more gently than many of men. Lupino's and Bogart's characters are just amazing and they both perform one of their best jobs. The car chasing at the end of the film is one of the best sequences ever and there's no doubt it's been copied hundreds of times in subsequent films.So if we have Raoul Walsh Humphrey Bogart and John Huston nothing can possibly go wrong. High Sierra  EssentialMy Rate 910".

	schema:reviewBody "By 1941 Humphrey Bogart had nearly a dozen gangster roles to his credit but in High Sierra we get to see a criminal with a heart. That aspect of Roy Earle's Bogey nature is played out with the chance meeting of Pa Goodhue Henry Travers and his pretty niece Velma Joan Leslie. Though their age difference is plainly visible Earle experiences a pang of feeling for Velma even though she is handicapped with a clubfoot. The story within a story of Roy's white knight effort to cure Velma's malady and find a way out of his life of crime is eventually derailed but not before the viewer gets a chance to observe a tough guy's soft side.But then there's his hard side. Fresh out of Mossmoor prison Roy Earle wastes no time in hooking up with former gangster friend Big Mack Donald MacBride who had arranged his early release and has already lined up Roy's next big payday. Roy will have to get heavy handed with two rookie sidekicks Arthur Kennedy Alan Curtis who between them are juggling a pretty dime a dance girl along for the ride. The would be moll is Marie Garson Ida Lupino who with one look at Earle instinctively knows her two companions are in over their head. Roy tries to keep his distance from Marie but when Velma makes it clear that she's marrying another man Earle's romantic interest in Marie is driven up a notch.The film makes good use of Warner Brothers stock players. Barton MacLane is on hand as a rogue cop who's taken up with Earle's boss Big Mack. Henry Travers is put to good use in a role that serves as a warm up for that of Clarence the Angel in It's A Wonderful Life. Cornel Wilde and Jerome Cowan find themselves in limited roles Wilde as the smarmy Mendoza who sets up the hotel heist and then rats out Roy to the authorities. And let's not forget Old Pard the friendly mutt with an attraction to people who wind up dead. Pard had a good acting coach he was Bogey's real life pet dog Zero.The newspapers hang a 'Mad Dog' tag on Roy following the botched hotel heist and Earle's shooting death of Jack Kranmer MacLane. Presumably seeing Marie off to safety he finds himself on the run and seeking refuge in the shadow of Mt. Whitney. Reacting to a radio broadcast Marie retraces her steps back to witness Roy's stand against the police knowing that he'll never allow himself to be taken alive. However Earle's final defeat doesn't have the defiance of Cagney's in White Heat no 'top of the world Ma' challenge to incite the authorities. In the end a big time hood falls in disgrace. By then you get the feeling that Marie already knows the answer to her own question when she asks a reporter  Mister what does it mean when a man crashes out?You may be surprised as I was to learn that Ida Lupino was actually top billed over Humphrey Bogart in High Sierra I'd be curious as to the politics involved in that decision. Though her performance is very good her actual screen time is considerably less than Bogey's. Lupino also excelled in another team up with Bogart that of the vile and conniving wife who murdered her husband in They Drive by Night. Catch that one for her intense courtroom scene it's a blast.".

	schema:headline " an exceptional crime movie more than anything for what the writers Walsh and Bogart do with the protagonist and romance";
	schema:reviewBody "Roy Mad Dog Earle usually isn't the kind of guy you want to say the wrong thing to on the street or in a store. He's an exconvict with a record of robberies and other criminal endeavors and now that he just got busted out by a crime boss he respects he wants to pull off this next score and maybe call it quits. He has that stonecold face of a man with plenty of grit in his system and he won't settle for an shenanigans or anyone messing around with a woman the wrong way. Raoul Walsh the filmmaker and screenwriters John Huston and WR Burnett know this very well about the character that he's the tough guy who SHOULD be the villain of the story. But he isn't and High Sierra marks a crucial step in the crime films of the 30s and 40s by making Earle more than just a brutish guy with money squarely on his professional mind. He's also one who can be vulnerable and fall in love or possibly be one to deep down deny how he might crash at some point. We see this last part very clearly and compellingly when Earle is sleeping and in some kind of bad dream and the woman he's with looks on at him drifting in and out of talking saying no..no not this don't crash. Rarely has any crime film allowed us to get the uncertainty in a psychological vein as this at least in the straightlaced era of the 40s.Bogart then is the best choice for this character and he embodies Earle with the same velocity he gave to his more onesided tough guys from the gangster pictures of the 30s but he also carries the side that is meant to be more affected by the opposite sex. In a noticeable sense Bogart's Earle has two sides the one he's normally best at showing to either his boss Donald McBride's Big Mac one of the best actors in the film even in just one scene or to his criminal cohorts and the other side where he gets involved with a smalltown family where the daughter Joan Leslie has a foot condition and he decides to get it fixed for her thinking perhaps that he might ask her hand in marriage. This gets complicated however when the personal side creeps into the professional and Marie Ida Lupino proving her acting chops before she proved those at directing falls deep for Roy like Ican'tlivewithoutyou attachment. Seeing the transitioning of romantic interest is a great measure of characterization in an of itself because Bogart plays it at first with Lupino straightforward don't get involved with me and don't get too deep in the job but this changes as the reality of Roy's interest in Velma is made clear. How can a criminal really involve himself and not expect to be rejected by the more conventional smalltown family? A lot of these scenes help raise High Sierra above the typical paintbynumbers in a high stakes heist picture but Walsh also doesn't forget to give the audiences what they want. There's some fine tooling with the heist sequence for example to show just how shabby a thing like this can be without the right planning and in fact how it's not too much of a surprise how it could be a setup gunshots galore. And as the tension mounts the techniques at Walsh's disposal are to the point but also in some stylistic flourishes. Like when Roy suddenly has no choice but to hold up a teller at a store for money that he may or may not be owed and the call goes out to the authorities in superimpositions mechanical things going over people's eyes and faces very quickly. And few chase scenes go for the length but excitement that happens as Roy's being chased by the cops on the mountain roads. The simplicity of style of Walsh's professional focus on the job at hand is matched up wonderfully with the screenplay's handling of making these more realistic than is expected you feel for Roy not in a despising way as a villain but who is left to the haggle of circumstance and fate and there's even a moment of sadness up on that mountainside as authorities and Roy go head to head.I can't say which I would prefer this or Colorado Territory as I've yet to see the latter. But if you're a fan of Bogart in the slightest it's surely worth the rental and it may even appeal to today's fans of crime films well not all of them of course looking for a lesson in the embracing and subversion of the genre of the period. Plus it has one of the great endings in the crime genre.".

In a noticeable sense Bogart's Earle has two sides the one he's normally best at showing to either his boss Donald McBride's Big Mac one of the best actors in the film even in just one scene or to his criminal cohorts and the other side where he gets involved with a smalltown family where the daughter Joan Leslie has a foot condition and he decides to get it fixed for her thinking perhaps that he might ask her hand in marriage. This gets complicated however when the personal side creeps into the professional and Marie Ida Lupino proving her acting chops before she proved those at directing falls deep for Roy like Ican'tlivewithoutyou attachment. Seeing the transitioning of romantic interest is a great measure of characterization in an of itself because Bogart plays it at first with Lupino straightforward don't get involved with me and don't get too deep in the job but this changes as the reality of Roy's interest in Velma is made clear. How can a criminal really involve himself and not expect to be rejected by the more conventional smalltown family? A lot of these scenes help raise High Sierra above the typical paintbynumbers in a high stakes heist picture but Walsh also doesn't forget to give the audiences what they want. There's some fine tooling with the heist sequence for example to show just how shabby a thing like this can be without the right planning and in fact how it's not too much of a surprise how it could be a setup gunshots galore. And as the tension mounts the techniques at Walsh's disposal are to the point but also in some stylistic flourishes. Like when Roy suddenly has no choice but to hold up a teller at a store for money that he may or may not be owed and the call goes out to the authorities in superimpositions mechanical things going over people's eyes and faces very quickly. And few chase scenes go for the length but excitement that happens as Roy's being chased by the cops on the mountain roads. The simplicity of style of Walsh's professional focus on the job at hand is matched up wonderfully with the screenplay's handling of making these more realistic than is expected you feel for Roy not in a despising way as a villain but who is left to the haggle of circumstance and fate and there's even a moment of sadness up on that mountainside as authorities and Roy go head to head.I can't say which I would prefer this or Colorado Territory as I've yet to see the latter. But if you're a fan of Bogart in the slightest it's surely worth the rental and it may even appeal to today's fans of crime films well not all of them of course looking for a lesson in the embracing and subversion of the genre of the period. Plus it has one of the great endings in the crime genre.";

	schema:headline " The movie that made Bogart a topbilling star.";
	schema:reviewBody "It's hard to imaging these days but there was a time when Humphrey Bogart was nothing more than an actor who always played secondary character roles in the shadow of the movie its main character. For instance behind George Raft who was a much bigger star at the time but also female leads such as Ida Lupino who also stars in this movie. But Raft then turned down roles for movies such as this movie High Sierra The Maltese Falcon and Casablanca. All roles that were then past on to Bogart instead. Roles that truly launched his career to an amazing height surpassing George Raft by far. Still he didn't received topbilling for this movie yet. That honor once more went to Ida Lupino even though Bogart's role is much bigger and is unquestionably the main character of the movie. Ida Lupino was just a better selling name which says something of the time period and point of Bogart's career this movie got made in. This movie really marked his big breakthrough and after this he would mostly only land roles as a topbilling actor in movies such as Casablanca The Treasure of the Sierra Madre and The Maltese Falcon.But what makes this movie so great is not just Bogart but also really the movie its story and directing from Raoul Walsh.The story is written by John Huston who is better known as an actor and director than a writer even though he wrote the screenplay for many fine movies. This is also truly one of those movies. It's really no formulaic story and truly highly original and therefor also compelling. The main character is in love with a girl who isn't in love with him while there is another girl who is in love with him though his heart is still with this other girl. Sounds melodramatic and perhaps confusing but it's something really refreshing to see and makes the story and character developments progress in a way you wouldn't always expect it to. On top of that there is a main plotline involving a robbery but really the movie is mostly about its central character. This movie just has basically everything in its story that is needed to make a great movie with. Add to that the performance from Bogart and the fantastic directing from Raoul Walsh and you have a great tense entertaining fast going and original classic movie.It's not really fully a filmnoir since that genre was still pretty much nonexistent at that time and was still a work in progress. This movie does show some noir tendencies mostly with its lead character female roles and the main plot line involving a robbery but it's not quite noir enough in its style to fully consider this a pure filmnoir. It's the other Humphrey Bogart from later in the same year The Maltese Falcon that is widely considered to be one of the first real filmnoir's. Ironicly it was a movie directed by John Huston the man who wrote the screenplay for this movie.The movie also features some surprising good action sequences. You have to remember that this is an 1941 when the action genre was still something nonexistent but director Raoul Walsh knows to create a couple of good looking action sequences with camerapositions and editing you would expect from an action movie that is being made this present day. Especially the car chases within this movie are memorable.Interestingly enough director Raoul Walsh himself remade this movie 8 years later into a western movie Colorado Territory that might not be as good as this original but it's just as good intriguing and entertaining on its own and remains an underappreciated movie.A real perfect classic and still an unique movie to watch.1010httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

Truth is is that both films merely showcase what a talent the great man was and crucially that he could imbue his characters with terrific results.

Come the finale at Mount Whitney High Sierra a constant looming presence in the film the thrills have more than catered for the inclined seekers of that particular bent but ultimately as the credits role Walsh's camera leaves us in no doubt as to what has driven Roy and High Sierra to it's point of meaning a special and great movie indeed 910".

In High Sierra the goodness in the mad dog is played up the bad guy looks good. Huston did that with aplomb in The Man who would be King. At the same time he reverses the role of the poor girl with the clubfoot into an ungrateful woman. Only animals remain the same...The lines are made for Bogart's style.

	schema:reviewBody "In High Sierra Humphrey Bogart plays an ageing gangster who's seriously conflicted. On one hand he's a career criminal who's utterly ruthless and readily kills people who get in his way but on the other he's also a rather nostalgic sentimental and compassionate person who hankers after a calmer and more decent lifestyle. The fact that he's rather old for the crime business and that he's surrounded by younger people contributes to his feelings of alienation which are also reinforced by the difficulties he experiences in adjusting to everyday life after having spent many years in prison.Bogart's gangster also recognises that his life of crime has put him on a course from which he is unable to escape and that he has no alternative but to follow where fate takes him. This man's Achilles heel is his tendency to be soft hearted and this is unquestionably a fatal flaw for anyone who pursues a life of crime.Crime boss Big Mac Donald MacBride pays for Roy Mad Dog Earle Humphrey Bogart to be released from prison on parole because he wants the experienced bank robber to lead a gang who are planning to carry out a hotel robbery at a Californian resort. When Roy arrives at the gang's cabin in the Sierra Nevada Mountains he meets Red Arthur Kennedy Babe Alan Curtis and Babe's girlfriend Marie Garson Ida Lupino. Roy soon recognises that the two young men are inexperienced and unpredictable and also that there'll be problems if Marie stays involved.Roy decides that Marie should be sent back to L.A. but becomes more content for her to stay after she tells him that Louis Mendoza Cornel Wilde who works at the hotel and is the gang's inside man has a tendency to be indiscreet and loose tongued in the wrong places.On his way to L.A. to visit Big Mac Roy calls on the Goodhue family Ma Elisabeth Risdon Pa Henry Travers and their granddaughter Velma Joan Leslie. Velma is an attractive young lady with a deformed foot and Roy pays for her to have surgery to correct the deformity. Later Roy proposes to Velma but she rejects him for a man closer to her own age. When he meets Big Mac Roy discovers that his boss is very ill and as a consequence the money that he'll earn from the robbery will be very important to him.When Roy's driving away from the cabin on the night of the robbery he's followed by a mongrel dog called Pard who has a reputation for bringing trouble to his owners. Although he doesn't want to take the dog with him Roy allows himself to be persuaded to do so. The robbery goes badly and Roy shoots a security guard before escaping. Red and Babe are killed when their car crashes and Louis tells everything he knows when he's questioned by the police.From that point on all Roy's plans unravel spectacularly as he and Marie become fugitives and fail to capitalise on the jewels they stole from the hotel. Roy decides soon after that it would be too dangerous for him and Marie to remain together and so they separate. The police then continue their relentless pursuit until the story eventually reaches its extremely dramatic climax.Ida Lupino is excellent as the tough streetwise Marie whose affection for Roy remains strong even after he tells her that he wants to marry Velma. Her devotion to him is unswerving and she continues to remain undaunted throughout all the dangers and setbacks that they experience together.Bogart's exceptional performance in this movie conveys very convincingly the complex nature of Roy Mad Dog Earle. He talks tough through clenched teeth in some scenes but also shows genuine kindness in others without ever losing any credibility. It's this ability which is so impressive and no doubt was a major reason why this role was the one which elevated Bogart to the star status that he justifiably enjoyed for the rest of his career.".

	schema:headline " Sentimental psychological classic movie very unique for its genre";
	schema:reviewBody "Although I am not particularly fond of westerns I saw this movie since I had heard much about it from many people. It is true that a lot of westerns show the wild lives of cowboys overdoing with cruelty. RIO GRANDE however is a different story. It is not only a western but a highly educational movie which combines all precious values in life some of which do not necessarily go in harmony including honor love the feeling of duty grandeur and psychological reflections. Moreover as a film it is supplied with highly prestigious cinematography memorable music and most importantly great cast. But there is something more that makes Ford's film really memorable  the characters presented very clearly. But why such a title? While watching the movie one clearly notices that the title RIO GRANDE does not only refer to the famous river that separated the cavalrymen from Indians in Mexico but has wider metaphorical extensions.The characters are very well developed throughout. Lieutanant Kirby Yorke John Wayne a northerner lost the family 15 years earlier but never gives up finding a chance to rebuild the old relationship with his southern wife Kathleen Maureen O'Hara and their son Jeff. His rio grande is duties and strict orders that make a barrier for a happy life within the family. Kathleen Yorke tries to get her son out of the cavalry however Jeff decides to protect honor rather than his comfort. She also aims at rebuilding the family ties with Kirby but is aware that it requires much sacrifice. Their relationship is built upon a high respect for the freedom of both and a very delicate love between a man and a woman. Jeff Claude Jarman their son attempts to do right and seeks for the honorable deeds. The blink of ambition in his eyes is noticeable in every scene with him. There are also other characters that the movie shows in a very psychological light consider Travis Tyree played by Ben Johnson.The cast give memorable performances but the pair of John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara shine above all. Wayne seems to have been born for the role and although he played in two previous parts of John Ford's cavalry trilogy FORT APACHE and SHE WORE A YELLOW RIBBON he gives his best performance in RIO GRANDE. Wayne wonderfully emphasizes grandeur feeling of duty and a husband who reflects on his past mistakes in marriage. Maureen O'Hara has something aristocratic in her behavior as well as in her appearance which helps her portray a southern lady who used to live a rich life on a plantation. She also stresses her attempts to rebuild the past mistakes however she seems to be driven by completely different factors.Music is absolutely wonderful for this genre. The ballads supply the movie with sentimental mood. Yes they are deadly sentimental but they in no way make you sad but rather lifted to high emotions. Here comes to my mind a very poetic scene when Wayne and O'Hara are serenaded by troop soldiers on one moonlit night. Their faces strongly express profound emotions and nostalgia for the better life together. This is so well played that anybody who sees the pair will be able to deduce some reflections from their faces.Some people said that the Apaches are showed as real monsters in RIO GRANDE. It is important to state here that they are showed exactly in the way they were perceived rather than what they were really like. These were very wild tribes in the eyes of the white people and that is what the film shows. As a matter of fact both the Apaches and the cavalrymen defended their values and John Ford did not forget about it.And coming back to the thrilling atmosphere of the movie there is one more aspect that needs to be mentioned  the locations. The Monument Valley supplies the scenes with authenticity as well as drives viewers into a wonderful mood. It simply leaves an unfading trace in memory as do the cast the content and everything about RIO GRANDE.What to say at the end?... The last part of Ford's cavalry trilogy though 55 years old is a classic attempt to bring all that is valuable onto screen  HISTORY MEETS SINGLE INDIVIDUALS! Aren't our lives constructed in such a way that we all have our own rio grande such a barrier that closes us from happiness? I leave this universal question open to every open minded reader as John Ford implicitly did more than 50 years ago to every open minded viewer. Anyway the film is unarguably worth seeing!".

	schema:headline " This fine film is one of the finest cavalry epics and is based on historical fact.";
	schema:reviewBody "Rio Grande was the last of John Ford's cavalry trilogy which also included She Wore a Yellow Ribbon and Fort Apache.  Like the latter this film was filmed in black and white.  All three films were based on short stories by James Warner Bellah.In this film John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara first played the romantic roles that they played later in films like The Quiet Man and McLintock. There is real chemistry between these two stars.  Their relationship is a major thread that weaves the plots and subplots of this film together.  Both of their characters have depth.  O'Hara is more than her usual fiery Irish self.  She is sensitive sometimes humorous and occasionally aristocratic. She has difficulty hiding her continued affection for her estranged husband Wayne despite the fact that he was responsible for burning the family plantation. Wayne is the tough commanding officer of the remote outpost. His toughness masks a softer side.  This shows clearly when he stands outside the hospital window of his son who has a black eye from a soldier's fight.  At the end of the film he takes a father's pride in his son's courage in battle.There is more going on in the film than in the usual Western.  There are relationships.  Wayne is disappointed in his son who flunked at West Point and enlisted in the cavalry as a trooper.  His mother wants to buy him out of the cavalry.  The son wants to prove himself.  All of this contributes to some real human moments in the film.  Subplots include Trooper Tyree's sometimes humorous attempts to escape the law and the sometimes unwilling help provided by others.  And of course there are the Apaches.The river is a major theme in the movie.  It is a barrier which the cavalry cannot cross in their pursuit of the Apaches.  This is demonstrated in the opening credits.  The cavalry and Mexican soldiers meet at the river in a scene from later in the movie.  When captured chiefs escape across the river Wayne meets a Mexican officer in the middle of the stream.  He offers to place himself under Mexican command.  The Mexican officer declines saying he must defend the border at all costs.  Wayne responds With three men.. .Your dedication to duty is to be commended.  I too have my orders. At the end of the film Wayne risks his career with the complicity of General Sheridan played by J. Carroll Naish and crosses the river to rescue the children captured by the Apaches.The supporting cast does a wonderful job with this film.  Many are regular faces in John Ford films.  Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr. play friends of Wayne's son played by Claude Jarman Jr..  Victor McLaglen plays the role of top Sergeant.  He played the same role in all three films in Ford's trilogy.  Chill Wills is around and is much better than usual as the doctor who helps Trooper Tyree escape from a Texas sheriff.  The Sons of the Pioneers are also on hand to sing songs.The Victor Young score includes elements which will appear later in the Quiet Man.  Many of the songs are dumb and inappropriate.  There are too many Irish ballads that would have been much better used in The Quiet Man. The few songs by Stan Jones are the best of the lot.  At one point in the film the cavalrymen are walking their horses to the lyrics twentyfour miles on beans and hay.Photographically this film is less impressive than She Wore A Yellow Ribbon but the usual shots of Monument Valley are still impressive. There is an appropriate dark quality to this movie that is missing in the other films in the trilogy even in Fort Apache which was also filmed in black and white.  The scene at the deserted church is memorable.  The black and white photography accentuates the shadows and the threat of death to the children as the Apaches dance the night away.This film is based on a historical incident.  In 1874 Colonel McKenzie led the 5th Cavalry across the Rio Grande to destroy a Kickapoo village in Mexico. The Kickapoos had been raiding quite successfully in Texas and efforts to punish them had been quite fruitless.  This forgotten incident was used by Ford in this film.  The Indians now are Apaches but whoever heard of Kickapoos?This fine Western is worth seeing for its rich characterizations and fine story.  It can be enjoyed on many levels.".

Yates agreed to let him shoot The Quiet Man at Republic but first he wanted a guaranteed moneymaker.Fort Apache and She Wore A Yellow Ribbon were both done at RKO and made money.

And that boys and girls is how Rio Grande came into being.Good thing too because of studio politics we got ourselves a western classic. And a family classic as well. John Wayne who is once again playing a character named Kirby Yorke has two families the United States Cavalry to which he's devoted and a wife and son from whom he's been estranged. How he repairs the relationships between wife Maureen O'Hara and son Claude Jarman Jr. is the key to the whole story.As Maureen toasts at a dinner scene with J. Carrol Naish as General Philip H. Sheridan to my one rival the United States Cavalry.Young Jefferson Yorke has flunked out of West Point and has joined the army as an enlisted man. Through none of his own doing he's assigned to the frontier post commanded by his father. Mom then comes west to try and spring him from the army but young Jeff doesn't want to be sprung.In fact to his father's surprise the young man proves himself to be an able cavalryman without any assistance from Dad. And when Maureen comes west old love rekindles between Wayne and O'Hara.All this is against the background of some Apache hit and run raids across the Rio Grande. Topped off by them attacking a party escorting dependent women and children away from the post. Young Trooper Yorke rides for help there hence the title quote.A lot of John Ford's stock company fills out the cast to give it that familiar look of Ford films. Some bits from previous films were used like the training Roman style of the new recruits. They prove a more able bunch than the ones from Fort Apache.Some traditional melodies were used as they are in John Ford period pieces but unusual for a Ford film several new songs were written for the film done by the Sons of the Pioneers. One of them written by Dale Evans entitled Aha San Antone. She was employed at Republic studios also.A fine classic western with a nice story about family relationships and responsibilities one incurs in life.".

	schema:headline " Ford's Grand Vision of the West";
	schema:reviewBody "As many people know Rio Grande is the third installation of John Ford's sweeping Cavalry trilogy his paean and dirge for the forging of the West after the Cival War. In each there is Indian fighting romance and Monument Valley. Younger officers look forward to winning glory in the Indian Wars while the older veteran officers who served in the Civil War are tired of fighting and would rather keep the peace instead. And the enlisted men coming from all walks of life some running from something others trying to find something but all taking war and peace as they come. They want to stay alive but aren't too worried about dying.Unlike the first two cavalry films Rio Grande focuses more on the love between an Army officer and his wife and the pain his life causes her. This pain is made even worse by the fact that their nly son has chosen to follow his father's way of life and winds up serving in his father's command. When as is inevitable Indians flee their reservation the family becomes embroiled in war against the Apaches whom everyone knows were the toughest most ruthless and evil Indian fighters of them all. This is where Ford moves away from typical westerns. While his Indians are fierce and tough Ford tries to show in all the Cavalry films that they are also honorable and fighting for home and family not because they are evil. And while Wayne's character must pursue his Indians until they're either captured or dead he is not without both sympathy and respect and knows for certain that it is the white man's treatment of them that is at the heart of all the Indian wars.Over the years as I've seen more and more of his movies John Ford has become my favorite director. He had the ability to make stories with depth compassion and remarkable truth and these qualities have caused his films to last. I hope that you will see all of the Cavalry Trilogy and then seek out all of the rest his movies.The other films in the trilogy are Fort Apache 1948 and She Wore A Yellow Ribbon 1949.".

	onyx:emotionText "As many people know Rio Grande is the third installation of John Ford's sweeping Cavalry trilogy his paean and dirge for the forging of the West after the Cival War. In each there is Indian fighting romance and Monument Valley. Younger officers look forward to winning glory in the Indian Wars while the older veteran officers who served in the Civil War are tired of fighting and would rather keep the peace instead. And the enlisted men coming from all walks of life some running from something others trying to find something but all taking war and peace as they come. They want to stay alive but aren't too worried about dying.Unlike the first two cavalry films Rio Grande focuses more on the love between an Army officer and his wife and the pain his life causes her. This pain is made even worse by the fact that their nly son has chosen to follow his father's way of life and winds up serving in his father's command. When as is inevitable Indians flee their reservation the family becomes embroiled in war against the Apaches whom everyone knows were the toughest most ruthless and evil Indian fighters of them all. This is where Ford moves away from typical westerns. While his Indians are fierce and tough Ford tries to show in all the Cavalry films that they are also honorable and fighting for home and family not because they are evil. And while Wayne's character must pursue his Indians until they're either captured or dead he is not without both sympathy and respect and knows for certain that it is the white man's treatment of them that is at the heart of all the Indian wars.Over the years as I've seen more and more of his movies John Ford has become my favorite director. He had the ability to make stories with depth compassion and remarkable truth and these qualities have caused his films to last. I hope that you will see all of the Cavalry Trilogy and then seek out all of the rest his movies.The other films in the trilogy are Fort Apache 1948 and She Wore A Yellow Ribbon 1949.";

	schema:headline " Most Realistic of Ford's Cavalry Trilogy a True Western";
	schema:reviewBody "As a writer I find this to be the most honest and least pretentious of all John Ford's western films. His cavalry trilogy ended with Rio Grande the others are Fort Apache and She Wore a Yellow Ribbon and it was also the first pairing of John Wayne with Maureen O'Hara with whom he made five film appearances all told. The setting of the film is not glamorous by anyone's standards it is dusty hot remote a country for hard men and hard duty. The storyline has Wayne in command of a fort. When his son is assigned to him for training with other recruits his wife estranged for fifteen years follows himto try to meddle... The storyline makes clear that during the Civil War he refused to disobey orders to burn down her family's plantation now she's come west and he wants her back and want to instill his pride in and love for the cavalry in his son. There is rough humor in the film changes to mind and body learning to ride standing up to the elements and to men lessons the West can demand of anyone who comes there. nd after a plan of Wayne's to protect settlers against the Indians backfires he has to risk everything to save his career and his command. The theme of the film is that any man has to dare and dream beyond old conventions and ideas in order to reach his best and that goes for O'Hara as well. The film was directed by John Ford with script by James Kevin MacGuinness..Bert Glennon's skilled BW cinematography captures the bleak beauty of the spare semidesert country and admirably. Frank Hotaling did the production design and Victor Young contributed the score. In this feature's large cast were Wane O'Hara. Claude Jarman Jr. of The Yearling as their son Harry Carey Jr. Victor Maclaglen J Carrol Naish Chill Wills and many solid western performers. But the best thing to me about the production is the absence of any attempt to glamorize or apologize for the West. The men who rode for the cavalry lived with loneliness the roughness of the country they patrolled and constant danger from those they opposed this film makes it clear why men would do this for the meager pay they received that it was the challenge they took up as a way to use their abilities and emotional strength to the full. That is why I like this film the best of all of Ford's estimable works.".

What a fool I have been to avoid RIO GRANDE. This superb humane film even though about the cruel US cavalry is a perfect balance of family dramas hilarious tough humor and genuine concern for the development and survival of soldiers and the camaraderie of the troop. Everything good anyone else on this site can say it utterly true especially the astonishing photography breathtaking Maureen O'Hara the raucous Victor MacLaglen and sensitive Claude Jarman. I eagerly look forward to waking up more to myself and seeing FORT APACHE and SHE WORE A YELLOW RIBBON and as usual celebrating more of the diverse product of Republic Studios. FLAME OF BARBARY COAST was good especially the incredible lavishness of the sets. I would be very keen to know the cost and box office success of both films. Anyone......? WAKE OF THE RED WITCH made around 1949 was a massive success... as was THE QUIET MAN in 1952. Vale Republic!".

	schema:reviewBody "Director John Ford's third and last film about the U.S. Cavalry the others being 1948's Fort Apache and 1949's She Wore A Yellow Ribbon Rio Grande was initially a minor project done only to please the head of Republic Films Herbert Yates who wanted a marketable western before allowing Ford to make The Quiet Man a movie that in Yates' mind showed no promise Of course time would prove him wrong anyway. However instead of delivering a throwaway film just to please his producers Ford final Cavalry film was another step in his own evolution of the genre as it included a new dimension to his Westerns by adding the family element to the picture.Rio Grande stars John Wayne as Lt. Col. Kirby Yorke a Union officer who has spent his time after the Civil War battling apache rebels in an Outspot in the Rio Grande. Suddenly the life of this lonely man gives a 180 spin as he discovers that his son Jeff Yorke Claude Jarman Jr. whom he hasn't seen in 15 years has joined the Cavalry and is assigned to his post. Things get even more complicated as his wife Kathleen Maureen O'Hara arrives too in order to get her son back and in some way recover the family she lost when the Civil War made her husband a Northerner her enemy. In the middle of this family drama troubles arise as an Apache bandit is using three tribes to create chaos and Yorke will have to decide between his two loves the Cavalry or Kathleen.Like the previous two Cavalry stories Rio Grande was based on a story by James Warner Bellah and despite sharing many elements with the past two films like members of the cast and some character names the three stories are not tied together and are basically stand alone films joined by a common theme. The story is more oriented to drama rather than to action although it still gives the characters a chance to show off their riding skills. The element of the family adds a new dimension to Wayne's character and the theme of division between families because of the Civil War is a nice touch that adds to the sexual tension between the main characters. The tag line reads John Ford's Greatest Romantic Triumph and this time it doesn't lie this Western is a powerful melodrama that plays a different tune than other westerns.Despite being a minor project John Ford shows off his great talent turning this small modest movie into a wonderful film of epic proportions. His trademark cinematography shines in all its splendor and portrays Monument Valley with an unnatural beauty and he keeps his film as historically accurate as possible despite the use of some recently composed songs. The portrayal of the Native Americans so demonized this days it's actually realistic for its time and Ford makes sure that it's stated that the Apaches are not evil per se but leaded by a criminal rebel. His familiar themes like honor sacrifice and responsibility and being torn by them are all present here making a powerful and entertaining Western that even nonfans of the genre can appreciate.I'm not very familiar with John Wayne but in my opinion his performance was very good. His character is torn between the love he feels for his country and the love he feels for his family and the guilt he feels for his actions during the Civil War makes him even more interesting as if behind the macho image were a loving man tied by his duties. Maureen O'Hara is wonderful as Kathleen and makes the perfect match for Wayne's troubled hero my only complain would be that she looks a bit too young for the part. Ford regulars like Victor McLaglen Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr. also appear in supporting roles and have remarkable scenes specially Johnson.Rio Grande is a remarkably welldone film mixing drama and action it definitely makes up for an entertaining evening. Most people me included have a certain prejudice towards pre60s Westerns while it's true that Westerns used to portray Native Americans in a bad light one has to judge the films according to the times when they were done and John Ford's Western are no exception in fact he seems to portray them in a relatively fairer way than other directors. While maybe outdated by today's standards Rio Grande is definitely a masterpiece of the genre that deserves a chance before passing judgment over it.Before watching Rio Grande I was not really familiar with John Ford's career or John Wayne's so I'm not biased towards the man and his work. Rio Grande has some problems its true but it's miles ahead of other Westerns of its time and is definitely a mustsee for anyone interested in the history of cinema. 810".

It's now among my favorite John Ford westerns with both JOHN WAYNE and MAUREEN O'HARA giving really heartfelt performances as a husband and wife separated for some time their only son CLAUDE JARMAN JR. having just joined the regiment as a soldier under his father's command at an outpost being menaced by Apaches.There's a jaunty rollicking score by Victor Young that captures ballads of the Old West to provide some colorful background music wonderful scenes of soldiers training under VICTOR McLAGLEN at his crustiest and endearingly funny BEN JOHNSON wonderful as a man on the lam and the breezily confident HARRY CAREY JR. It's even got a story that has more than one theme running through itthe personal conflict between father and son husband and wife and how the young son played extremely well by Claude Jarman Jr. has to prove himself to his fellow soldiers.The final shootout occurs when the Apaches kidnap some children and hold them prisoners in a church. It sets the stage for the final encounter just one of several skirmishes with the Indians that is masterfully staged and photographed.Pictorially it's one of the handsomest of all the John Ford epics and should definitely have been filmed in Technicolor although the BW photography is indeed impressive. MAUREEN O'HARA gives one of her most sensitive portrayals and JOHN WAYNE is at his best.Summing up A solid western well worth watching whether you're a John Ford fan or not.".

He whips him and the other men to against the Apaches but of course Jeff's mother Kathleen Maureen O'Hara who Kirby separated from shows up to take her son away. Kirby faces a tough battle and his unorthodox plan gets him a courtmartial and he must fight to redeem himself and bring his broken family back together.

Of course it is sentimental...nearly all Ford's films are in one way or another. Of course the Apache are painted in the worst possible light but Ford was a man of his generation and in those days the Apache were still seen as brutal savages.What makes this film stand out for me as at least the equivalent of the other two in the trilogy is the relationship between Wayne and O'Hara.

	schema:reviewBody "John Ford was perhaps the bestknown exponent of the of the 'cavalry film' that subgenre of the Western that tells the story of the conflict between the US Army and the native Indians of the American West during the second half of the nineteenth century. The three films which he made on this theme between 1948 and 1950 all of which starred John Wayne have become known as his cavalry trilogy. Rio Grande is the third of these the earlier instalments being Fort Apache and She Wore a Yellow Ribbon. It is also the first of three films Wayne made beginning with the word Rio the others being Rio Bravo and Rio Lobo both directed by Howard Hawks.In Rio Grande Wayne plays the same character he played in Fort Apache Kirby Yorke although he has now been promoted from Captain to Lieutenant Colonel. The spelling of his surname has also changed in the earlier film it was spelt York. The title derives from the fact that Yorke is now stationed on the Texas frontier charged with defending settlers against marauding Apaches. The fight against the Indians however is only one of a number of interlocking plot lines. The most important one concerns Yorke's relationship with his son Jeff and his estranged wife Kathleen neither of whom he has seen for fifteen years. The cause of the estrangement was an incident during the Civil War when Yorke then serving with the Union forces obeyed an order to burn down his wife's plantation home in the Shenandoah valley. Kathleen is from an old Virginia family. During the course of the film however they begin to rediscover their love for one another.Jeff having failed officer training at West Point has enlisted in the Army as a private and has been sent to serve with his father's regiment. Kathleen disapproves of her son's choice of a career and arrives at the fort determined home with her only to find that he is just as determined to remain in the Army. A third plot line concerns Jeff's friend Trooper Travis Tyree who is on the run from the law having killed a man in a fight. Jeff and Tyree are among those who volunteer for a dangerous mission to rescue some children kidnapped by the Apaches.Ford is rightly regarded as one of the great Western directors some of his films such as Stagecoach are recognised as being among the great classics of the genre. As with all great directors however not all his films are of the same quality and Rio Grande has always struck me as being one of his lesser works. It has its good points John Wayne was an expert in portraying tough but honourable men of action and this is a typical Wayne performance. There is some good photography of the dramatic scenery of the West blackandwhite although She Wore a Yellow Ribbon had been made in colour especially of Monument Valley one of Ford's favourite locations. Although the action supposedly takes place on the Texas frontier the valley is actually on the borders of Utah and Arizona.The film however also has its weaknesses. Maureen O'Hara is miscast as Kathleen only 30 at the time she was far too young to play the mother of an adult son. Apparently the studio Republic Pictures insisted that Ford use her as part of their price for allowing him to make The Quiet Man which was eventually made two years later with the same combination of Wayne and O'Hara. The depiction of the Indians is biased as in many Westerns of this period such as Only the Valiant another cavalry film they are simply portrayed as savage barbarians venting their bloodlust on innocent white settlers with no attempt to show their point of view. The earlier instalments of the trilogy had been rather more liberal in this respect. For a film which is not officially a musical there is an awful lot of singing going one so much so that one might conclude that the US Cavalry's main function was light entertainment with warfare only a sideline. A sentimental ballad like I'll Take You Home Again Kathleen doesn't really seem right on the lips of hardened cavalrymen. Overall Rio Grande is really little more than a standard Western adventure story. 610".

For a film which is not officially a musical there is an awful lot of singing going one so much so that one might conclude that the US Cavalry's main function was light entertainment with warfare only a sideline. A sentimental ballad like I'll Take You Home Again Kathleen doesn't really seem right on the lips of hardened cavalrymen. Overall Rio Grande is really little more than a standard Western adventure story. 610";

Perhaps as Science Fiction films were not highly regarded in the early 50s he felt his reputation might suffer if he acknowledged his contribution perhaps he thought it might help Nyby's credentials if he were given credit for this masterfully crafted tale. Who knows? But rest assured...this IS a Howard Hawks film! The story based on John Campbell's short story 'Who Goes There?' is a nifty claustrophobic tale of a group of soldiers and scientists in the Arctic discovering a giant 'flying saucer' under the ice. When the ship blows up during the excavation the 'pilot' a huge green chlorophyllbased humanoid played by a young James Arness is recovered frozen in a block of ice. Bringing the iceencased figure back to the base it is then accidentally thawed out...and all Hell brakes loose!While the cast lacks bigname stars each actor is wonderful delivering wryly funny Hawks' dialogue at a breakneck pace. The military commander Capt. Hendry Kenneth Tobey is a nononsense boss respected and lovingly chided by his men led by Dewey Martin who constantly try to 'set him up' with a pretty scientist he had 'struck out' with on leave in Anchorage Margaret Sheridan. She is now at the base assisting brilliant yet blissfully naive Dr. Arthur Carrington Robert Cornthwaite who naturally assumes 'the Thing' is only homicidal because he is misunderstood! As the truly frightening potential of the creature reveals itself it becomes a race against time to destroy it before it kills everyone leaves the base and reproduces countless seedlings of itself to conquer the world!The FX are lowbudget but very effective as is the extensive use of light and shadow sound effects and an eerie Dimitri Tiomkin score. Unlike the benevolent 'visitors' of THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL this alien doesn't warn of total annihilation as the final option should we carry our nuclear weapons into space it's ONLY agenda is to kill!This is a truly amazing film one that has aged little and is every bit as enjoyable today as when it was released.As the tag line to the film warns us Look to the sky...".

The monster is rarely seen as we catch him only in horrifying glimpses as the characters in the movie do. There's a standard brains versus brawn subtext in the film but it's not emphasized to the movie's detriment. That the cast consists mostly of relative unknowns give the picture an almost documentary feeling at times as if one were watching an actual event.

As soon as the Air Force contingentled by Kenneth Tobey realizes that their visitor from space is bent on feeding on the human residents there a cat and mouse situation is set up.The Thing is first repelled out into the Arctic blizzard giving the lead scientist Robert Cornthwaite enough time to  theorize that it's a highly evolved vegetable from outer space and therefore MUST be advanced enough to impart the answers to all man's questions if given a chance to communicate.Therein lies a major conflict between the Air Force personnel and this scientist... the military sees The Thing as a threat and the scientist sees The Thing as a fountain of knowledge in disguise. Some disguise! James Arness plays the E.T. visitor which appears at key moments through the film as a menacing humanoid with unusual clawlike hands and though it is inferred that it is vegetable rather than animal you're left to your imagination as to what exactly the creature is composed of. The brief encounters with the Thing as it returns from the unseen depths of the storm to feed on human blood is heralded with the ominous ticking of the crew's Geiger counter. Tension mounts as it draws nearer and nearer to the vulnerable wooden buildings of the outpost.Once it has been revealed that Science wants to protect the Thing as the Dr. Carrington has planted seedlings from the Thing's tissue remains into their greenhouse lab for an eerie result of reproduction the military binds together with a plot to destroy It.Although lacking in modern sophistication and effects this film allows the viewer to be marooned with the hapless research and Air Force crew to face an Unknown a common enemy... a theme so highly epitomized by the McCarthy era of antiCommunism that engulfed the nation at that time. I say this will always be a classic unto itself and though not in any way comparable to John Carpenter's 1982 remake in terms of gore horror and psychological perspective it still carries its own due to the snappy script and sense of foreboding.".

A group of scientists and air force officers at an Arctic station discover something in the ice and that something sees them as dinner. The battle goes on in the claustrophobic station in a scenario that without a doubt was the model for the original Aliens. The cast is a very fine ensemble and the direction is crisp and on the edge. Conversations overlap and at times runs simultaneously but the direction is so good that you miss nothing. Best of all is that this is one of those films where what you don't see is what scares you. There is no splatter or graphic detail but tantalizing hints that lets your mind conjure up your worst nightmare. A great one for a dark and stormy night.".

A group of scientists and air force officers at an Arctic station discover something in the ice and that something sees them as dinner. The battle goes on in the claustrophobic station in a scenario that without a doubt was the model for the original Aliens. The cast is a very fine ensemble and the direction is crisp and on the edge. Conversations overlap and at times runs simultaneously but the direction is so good that you miss nothing. Best of all is that this is one of those films where what you don't see is what scares you. There is no splatter or graphic detail but tantalizing hints that lets your mind conjure up your worst nightmare. A great one for a dark and stormy night.";

	schema:reviewBody "While I love the remake very much I was finally able to see the original all the way thru without the colorization on TV. It is a truly awesome movie.Comparing the two is not really fare or easy as Carpenter's version has the benefits of modern movie magic. But that is in my opinion the only place it excels. It seems in the remake all the characters are derelicts and for the most part not very likeable. In the original you had a sense of these people liking each other and sticking together.Kenneth Tobey is a very good and believable leader of his men. He also shows a very human side in that he realizes he is not the smartest of men. He is what he is. A captain of a small band of Air Force Soldiiers simply doing their job.Robert Cornblaithe is excellent as Dr. Carrington. He comes of snootish yet still likeable enough because you can see that deep down he really admires Captain Hendry Tobey though he can't see eye to eye with him on their situation or dealing of his Thing From Another world.Every character in the movie is well played. They all look like they belong in their roles. Their look and attire fit their characters and when one guy is called Professor so and so or whomever you believe it unlike many movies in those days where they picked anyone to play the supporting actors. There is one thing though Margaret Sheridan's pants pulled up almost to her neck line exaggeration...but close I could have done without. I realize it was a style of the times but I think they could have given her something a little better to show off her figure when you first meet her. Especially since she was the only female love interest and was tagged as a pinup girl in earlier scenes. She looks better when her hair is down and she is in different clothes. I know that is being picky but I just had to say it.The creature is better presented in the original as far as being frightening. You hardly ever see him. When you do it's only for brief periods at a time and usually in the dark. That frightening sound of The Thing is very original in that it's not just a growl but sounds like a cat meowing at times. Very eerie!The story is well known and both are similiar although I must admit the remake is closer to the actual Campbell JR.'s short tale. But the original still gives it a good account and in many ways surpasses the short story because it is easier to identify with the creature since he's humanoid.It boils down to suspense drama and mood versus gore FX and fast paced action. Both movies are top notch. I am proud to own both and would not try and say one is overtly better than the other. The remake has the benefits of the then modern movie technology. The original had the benefit of black and white to add to the suspense and utter danger they are in. The choice is yours. I myself enjoy the original a little more as it holds up today probably better than any other SciFi movie from that era.".

	schema:reviewBody "Which version Hawks or Carpenter? There's a lot of talk about which one is better etc. I do agree with many that they both are very different films very different viewing experiences. I love most good scifi. Some of 50's scifi can be dated after viewing. I do not think The Thing is one of these films which suffers from time . It holds up splendidly. If you like dialogue you'll love this movie. If you like innuendo fast paced overlapped dialogue great characters  and I don't use that word lightly  you'll love this movie.If you want more suspense a lot more blood and a much more gloomy setting certainly John Carpenter's remake is better in these areas. I own and enjoy viewing both films.Certainly the creature in Carpenter's version is much more frightening and truer to the John Campbell short story from which the story is based. His shape shifting would have been impossible to show in the 50's version with the believability that is possible in today's FX field.Carpenter gives us a setting which is darker colder and more foreboding. A feeling of hopeless and nameless dread pervades the camp. Certainly the notion is clear that this could be the end of all of them and of the world. There's both a lot less thinking and a lot more action to be had here in the Carpenter 80's version than in the Hawks' 50's approach.Hawks by contrast created a feeling of whistling in the dark which dominates the setting. The characters and they are many and varied all have their own particular take on what is happening and what should be done about it. There is a sense of hopeful We can do it. We can solve this problem attitude throughout the entire film. This feeling of let's keep our heads is contagious and very quickly the audience finds itself rooting rather than running.One more point and I think it's a big one. The characters in the Howard Hawks' 50's film are all likable including the heavy  the wonderful Dr. Carrington. All the characters are capable and in many cases quite resourceful and ingenious. Each always maintains a humorous dry wit angle of attack on the situation without resorting to camp or parody seen in most comic film writing today. The military crew members very quickly in the story each displays a comical personality ribbing both the captain and the civil service nature of the military with natural ease. As someone once said a complaining soldier is a happy soldier. So true. This is certainly no military has all the answers flick. The mistakes they make are roundly criticized by all in attendance including the copilot's not so subtle comment about the splitting of the atom yeah and that sure made the world happy didn't it? laughter. Add to that Ned Scott the newspaper man and you've got a nonscientist nonmilitary chronicler character to round out the story and give the audience someone with comparable skepticism about what to do next. Ned is the outsider who is now like us on the inside. The John Carpenter version by comparison has mostly losers populating the story I have to say. From the camp leader Gary on down to the radio operator Windows most of the characters seem more suited as inmates in a minimum security prison than manning a research science station. maybe a reflection of the lack of students going into the field of science in recent years? chuckle And to make the point even more ironic there is no military the usual scapegoats in the Carpenter version. Gary as leader carries the gun and we assume has some militarypolicing role though it is never made clear in the film. These are all scientists with the exception of the helicopter pilot played by Kurt Russell who seems to be the only clear thinking member of the entire bunch. Why none of the actual scientists approach the problem as clearly and logically as the rogue washedup helicopter pilot is also a mystery and in large part a flaw. In Hawks' version Captain Hendry solicits advice from all in attendance frequently asking the scientists and his crew technical questions for which he has no background to answer. This also gives the non technical audience member another way in to the technical side of things. no pun intendedWhy Carpenter chose to have most of the characters unredeeming lazy and in most cases quite stupid and ill behaving is a mystery. I find the characters in the Hawks version much more true to life.With all that said I enjoy both films each for their strengths and for their weaknesses. If you want blood and gore more realistic sets and are not discouraged by fairly shallow characters the Carpenter version is for you.If you want fast paced dialogue memorable characters and you enjoy a cando attitude in dreadful circumstances all done with a minimum of visible gore then Hawks' The Thing awaits you.humbleservant".

	schema:reviewBody "The Thing    AKA The Thing From Another World         By Tom FowlerThe Thing is over 50 years old now and remains one of the all time great science fiction films. Released in 1951 and ghost directed by Howard Hawks Christian Nyby being the credited director The Thing holds up well even by today's standards of shock and graphic violence. A mysterious craft has crash landed in the ice of Antarctica. A team of scientists and soldiers fly to the crash site and find a strange vehicle imbedded in the ice. The vehicle is tragically destroyed by temperature bombs in attempt to thaw the ice and free it. Even so an alien trapped in a block of ice has survived the blast and the team returns to base camp with it for further examination. This is when the psychological aspects of the find and the terror that James Marshall Matt Dillon Arness' monster brings to the screen merge into a great story. The Thing is loosely based on John W. Campbell Jr.'s Who Goes There?'. The scientist ably portrayed by Robert Cornthwaite is dangerously misguided in his attitude toward the creature a creature that he knows no more about than any of the others stationed at their lonely outpost. Cornthwaite believes the creature to be man's superior in every way' a mistaken opinion he would almost lose his life for. Kenneth Tobey who we would see often in this kind of film throughout the 1950's portrays the officer in charge of the camp and represents the opposite view from the scientist that of fear and suspicion. We see just enough of the creature to make him impressive and all of the gore is off camera and well within our overactive imaginations. The creature who was thawed by accident underneath an electric blanket is finally slain at film's end but not without tremendous cost in lives and particularly in the case of scientist Cornthwaite emotional devastation. There are some frightening scenes in The Thing most of them including the monster. The site of Tobey slamming the greenhouse door shut after discovering almost too late that the monster is standing behind it is very effective. A friend has said the site of the monster attempting to wriggle it's hand free generated nightmares for several days. The last scene of the film when the monster runs amuck and attacks Cornthwaite is one of the most atmospheric of the genre. But perhaps the most frightening scene of all to thoughtful viewers is the picture of Cornthwaite's lab where we see alien spores being fed human blood intravenously within the confines of a common wooden box  garden planter. The Thing is indeed a classic and I believe benefited from being shot in black and white. The Kurt Russell remake many years later was done in color and although a fine film in its own right did not offer the sense of isolation and bleakness the Hawk's version did. The running time for The Thing is 87 minutes and if you choose to rent or buy it on DVD or VHS be wary of 81 minute versions. Oh yes as the reporter at film's end said be certain to Keep Watching the skies!'  Not a bad idea for The Thing packs quite a wallop even today.".

A friend has said the site of the monster attempting to wriggle it's hand free generated nightmares for several days. The last scene of the film when the monster runs amuck and attacks Cornthwaite is one of the most atmospheric of the genre. But perhaps the most frightening scene of all to thoughtful viewers is the picture of Cornthwaite's lab where we see alien spores being fed human blood intravenously within the confines of a common wooden box  garden planter. The Thing is indeed a classic and I believe benefited from being shot in black and white. The Kurt Russell remake many years later was done in color and although a fine film in its own right did not offer the sense of isolation and bleakness the Hawk's version did. The running time for The Thing is 87 minutes and if you choose to rent or buy it on DVD or VHS be wary of 81 minute versions. Oh yes as the reporter at film's end said be certain to Keep Watching the skies!'  Not a bad idea for The Thing packs quite a wallop even today.";

	schema:reviewBody "As all lovers of the SciFi film genre knows The Thing 1951 is undoubtedly one of the the finest ever produced. It's almost a perfect movie from a purely technical standpoint. The direction no matter who it was was scintillating moving from moment to moment at breakneck speed. Tiomkin's gutwrenching score highlighted by the extremely futuristic Theremin crushing basses and bleak windswept strings are the epitome of horrorscifi film scoring. The acting is legendary for it's naturally fluid  feel it's backhanded asides and well documented overspeak not matched in many movies before or since. Unlike today's boringly formula ripoffs the station is usually well lit at least as well lit as you would imagine a 1950's Arctic Lab to be aided by the superb efforts of the film makers own lighting crew. This allowed for those brief moments of darkness when the lights were out to have a very real panicking effect. Not only on the audience but the besieged occupants of our Arctic fortress. I also found it refreshing that after the one incident where the Thing is carelessly freed the expedition members  subsequently and intelligently arm themselves as best they can and form into groups. I believe that the creature's first close up appearance is only 3 seconds long but it was enough to make me rapidly exit the living room and stop me from watching this film from when I first saw it at age 7 in 1958 until I was about 15. This chilling scene when viewed in a stop frame mode is astonishing in it's precision and choreography check this out my scifi brethren. A scene my own dear father managed to duplicate with great effect as a joke using our dark and seldom used front porch door which reduced me to a sniveling jellylegged puddle when I was about 10! which in homage to both Dad and Arness I duplicated some 20 years later on not only my son but the cleaning lady and my wife with equally devastating effect. You know  they even manage a little romance without destroying the story truly amazing. Don't we all wish Margaret Sheridan was our girl?But I have written this comment not to just rehash what we all know to be true but rather to pay homage to the one man who ultimately is responsible for the survival of the human race. Bob the crew chief. Yes Bob. In a situation where we have a rafter of genius scientists alongside of battle hardened veteran Air Corps officers and a smart funny gritty albeit nerdy newspaper reporter we are all very lucky to have had BOB the crew chief on the job. I will not enumerate and spoil the fun but his mighty contributions to the survival of this hearty group are something to behold. If you veterans who love this movie as much as I do watch this movie again as we all will watch it this time and see if you don't agree that Bob comes up with 90 or better of the intelligent suggestions. For those of you who have not had the pleasure of seeing this movie it is a must see. From a time when movies gave free rein to our own fertile imaginations it terrified without graphic gore amazed without a gazillion dollars of special effects and best of all entertained at a pace rarely attained by any movie from any genre in any generation.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Thing From Another World is one of the top ten science fiction movies of all time. The original version feeds on our paranoia of the times as well as the fears of the atomic age and invasion from outerspace. Remember Mr. Arnold first saw what was called flying saucers only a few short years earlier. The acting and storyline are tight and first rate. The claustraphobia from being confined inside the North Pole with an alien running amoke is done very well. The cast rounds out the movie quite well with great performances of all of the characters. Granted to soem the movie may seem dated and lack special effects of the remake but the remake does not capture the times and the fear of the so called Reds that this does. The Thing From Another World has to rank in the top ten. As a kid I thought it was one of the better not to mention more frightening science fiction movies up there with War of the Worlds and The Day The World Stood Still. This stands up story wise. Not all science fiction needs to have effects on the order of Star Wars. Sometimes like horror it's what you don't see that can get to you. This is a timeless classic. IT has to be in the top ten scifi films of all time. If you don't rent it buy it. You will love it!".

	schema:reviewBody "One of the popular elements of suspense thrillers has been on the unknown intruder invading a santurary. It's based on our subconscious fear that they place that we feel safest can be turned into the most dangerous. This is one of my favorite scifi film let alone my favorite film from director Howard Hawks. Personally I'm a fan of Carpenter version that story and on a side note is one of my favorite films in general. But this version I really liked because it's good in it's own way let alone different.I really like the music it really works well for the film at times it sounds really eerie and unsettling. However it's the theme song I really like the most which I think is memorable and one of my favorite themes because it's one about menace and the unknown.The suspense I think is great there is a sense of being unsafe. At the scenes when the Thing isn't around you just know in the back of your mind the Thing will come anywhere at any time but the revolving questions throughout the film are when and where. One of my favorite suspenseful sequences are of course the giger counter when a character indicates how high the needle is steadily going up while the blinker is going faster and faster. That blinker you could say represents the pounding of my heart and literally put me on the edge of my seat because it was an indicator that trouble was coming. This of course was an inspiration for the radar scenes in Alien and Aliens you can say it further shows how timeless the film is.I even like the design of the base and the use of light and shadow which really give the film a claustrophobic and dangerous atmosphere. You really feel that on the next turn shadow or the next hallway the Thing could be hiding waiting to close in for the kill. And the fact that this base is located in the middle of the Attic also leaves the element of isolation which means they can't get sufficient help when they need it the most let alone there is no where to go in the cold enviorment and the base is even worse because there are limited spaces to run and hide from the creature. Which unfortunately leaves them with the classic dilemma of being in a rock and a hard place.The characters are solid there not exactly deep characters but you do get to know some of them enough to like the protagonists and care their dialog is solid and memorable it feels like the kind of things you'd talk and say in the real world well sort of. It's true there are a lot of protagonists which is usual a bad idea but it actually works hear because most to all of them have something to do and it's something I don't see enough in the horror genre usually it's reduced down to a small sum of three to one depending on who survives. I really like the character Captain Patrick Henry he's a take charge kind of guy that cares about the people of the base.Nikki despite not having a whole lot to do I think is a solid female protagonist I like that she's not some stereotypical screamer is solid under pressure is smart and has the persona to boot. I like the fact that both the characters Pat and Nikki have some sort of love relationship going on their back and forth I think is genuine.Scotty is a fun character I like that he's not a stereotypical egocentric reporter. Yeah he does desire fame and is restless with the ambition for the great story but he doesn't let that get to his head. And he helps everyone out with their current situation so he not useless. And of course the guy says my favorite quote in the end which has been famous through time.Dr. Arthur Covington is a solid subordinate villain he's sort of like a religious fanatic as we see he's fallen into that classic psychological trap of discovery becoming obsession. He does what he can to sabatosh the protagonists efforts in survival. When he says a line that it's the group duty to die in the name of science I know he's gone to the circus because that's the same attitude a cultist would have toward a false religion and profit. In a way it gets at the one theme in the film about the corrupt side of science science can be used to benefit mankind but when used irresponsibly or for selfish or corrupt purpose it can lead to mankind's extinction.The Thing monster played well by James Arness doesn't disappoint. I like the makeup design which is memorable he's an intimidating brute I remember when I first seen him once the door was opened I though Oh s... and jumped. It's true that he's not in the film that much and we see him in brief periods of time but that works to it's benefit because the fact it's hidden most of the time makes it a force to be reckoned with because it operates in the shadows. It's characteristics are just as menacing because the creature has no heart literally which means he has no conscious so you can't reason or bargain with it if you talk with him face to face. Plus it's got some super strength and is hard to kill which really raises the stakes for the protagonists.Beware and watch the skies you never know what's flying in.Rating 4 stars".

	schema:reviewBody "On the surface The Thing from Another World The Thing for short would appear to be just another of the hundreds of scifihorror films that flooded the market in the 50s. The basic story of the discovery of a UFO near the North Pole with an inhabitant frozen in a block of ice sounds typical for the period. But this film is anything but typical.There are so many positive things to say about The Thing that narrowing them down to fit into a manageable size review is difficult. Very briefly some of the things that impress me about The Thing include the opening title sequence the wonderful music score the sets the amazing kerosene fire scene the terrific jump scare the first time we see the creature and the desolate North Pole setting. Everything about the movie is near perfect as far as I'm concerned.One of the most impressive things to me however is the decision to use the creature sparingly throughout the movie. Because we only catch glimpses of the alien he remains a mystery and as a result more frightening. I don't know if this is the case or not as I've never heard John Carpenter speak on the subject but as I watched the movie last night I couldn't help be think of Carpenter's decision to use The Thing in his movie Halloween. Surely it wasn't a coincidence or a cheap plug for his upcoming remake. Instead I've always felt that the way Carpenter used The Shape in Halloween is much like way the creature is used in this movie. I don't know if anyone agrees but I definitely see similarities.I can narrow down what makes this film so special to me into two words  Howard Hawks. If you're so inclined there are any number of articles you can read on the internet about who really directed the movie  Hawks or Nyby. I don't know and I don't care but it's easy to see Hawks' fingerprints all over The Thing. The most obvious example is the whole dialogue thing. In most of Hawks' movies I've seen the dialogue is incredibly intelligent snappy and witty. It's part of what makes his movies so much fun. Hawks also had a way of getting actors to sound less like they were reciting lines and more like they were having actual conversations. Actors routinely step all over each others' lines and interrupt one another just like real people do. If you've ever seen His Girl Friday you know exactly what I'm talking about. I love it.I could literally go on and on discussing The Thing from Another World. I haven't even touched on the comparisons with The Day the Earth Stood Still released the same year or the treatment of the scientists vs. the treatment of the Army or the portrayal of women or the whole Soviet invasion subtext or the Watch the skies speech or ... you get the idea.

In this instance the idea of the alien entity being a monstrosity that can imitate other life forms is jettisoned in favour of making the creature basically like the Frankenstein monster. It's a super vegetable that requires blood for sustenance and it makes life very tense for the scientists and military personnel at an isolated Arctic outpost when it's thawed from an icy imprisonment.With an intrepid hero in the form of 1950s icon Kenneth Tobey on hand it's a guarantee that The Thing from Another World is going to be a good time. It was a fairly odd choice of material for the producer Howard Hawks who fills the story with overlapping dialogue and a sense of camaraderie among the various protagonists. Unlike the 1982 version where the characters had the means to destroy the creature but first had to identify who the creature was our cast here have to improvise their survival.While any genre fan such as this viewer who'd been brought up on the 1982 John Carpenter film may be more inclined to favour that brand of horror this is still very stylish fun. Hawks's editor Christian Nyby gets the directing credit but it's generally believed that Hawks was pretty much in control of things. The score by Dimitri Tiomkin utilizing the theremin is suitably eerie. There are solid shocks moments of suspense and atmosphere along the way as well as a lively finish.This is a film very much of its time with our military characters very much a dependable bunch of heroes and the scientists most of them treated as highly suspect especially the misguided Dr. Carrington played delightfully by Robert Cornthwaite.A little too much time is devoted to the romantic subplot with Captain Hendry and his love interest Margaret Sheridan but the actors couldn't be more engaging. Tobey Sheridan and Cornthwaite are extremely well supported by a strong ensemble Douglas Spencer as annoying newspaperman Scotty who has the honour of uttering the memorable closing monologue James Young Dewey Martin Robert Nichols William Self Eduard Franz Nicholas Byron John Dierkes George Fenneman Paul Frees David McMahon and Norbert Schiller. A young James Arness in his pre'Gunsmoke' days has great presence as The Thing.There are images here so striking that Carpenter was wise to pay homage to them in his film the line of men encircling the buried UFO and the sight of the burning creature crashing through the building into the snow.It's definitely a different beast in more ways than one than what we would see 31 years later but it's solid entertainment for its own very good reasons.Eight out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Although there were two directors on THE THING or THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD the fact that Howard Hawks got involved adds one more star to his list of first rate movies  and the only one that he did in the area of science fiction. If one thinks of the director of comedies like BRINGING UP BABY or I WAS A MALE WAR BRIDE directing a science fiction film you would be surprised  but then Hawks also did well with crime films SCARFACE and westerns RED RIVER. Apparently Christian Nyby took most of Hawks' ideas and put them to work in the film. Good move Christian!It's now generally assumed that most of the great science fiction and horror films of the early 1950s were veiled discussions of either the Communist threat to America or of the threat McCarthism in this country . But there were strong currents in that period that were not really available earlier periods of film science fiction films. In the 1950s the remarkable if bloodstained achievements in science in the World War radar jet planes rocket bombs the atomic bomb made people more aware of science as never before. Tied to this was the sudden phenomenon of UFO sitings that  whether true or not  were finally being given serious consideration by the media.THE THING is set in a hostile environment  but one that is an acceptable hostile environment for government purposes. Polar exploration had been in the hands of the military from all nations from the 16th Century onward. Such explorers like Martin Frobisher were parttime naval commanders. In the 19th Century it was a rarity for a civilian to get involved Thomas Simpson the man who actually first sited the spot the Northwest Passage would most likely be at was an exception  but he worked for the Hudson's Bay Company. More typical figures involved were Sir John Franklin lost with two shiploads of British naval personnel in 1848 or Lt. Robert Peary later Rear Admiral Peary or Commander Robert Scott. After 1920 the typical polar expedition would be one led by somebody like Rear Admiral Richard Byrd. In 1931 Byrd would nearly die in an experiment in Antarctica regarding isolation in a tent his stove malfunctioned but some of his men found him in time.So the cast here are at the North Pole under joint command of Captain Hendry Kenneth Tobey and Dr. Carrington Robert Cornthwaite. There is also a member of the fourth estate present to report the expedition's results Scotty played by Douglas Spencer. During the expedition's regular work they find the wreckage of an unidentified flying saucer. They also find the frozen remains of a creature. The creature is the title figure of The Thing. If you look closely you will recognize the actor playing this creature is James Arness. While far from his GUNSMOKE role of Marshal Matt Dillon keep in mind that in the 1950s Arness varied western roles John Ford's WAGON MASTER with serious adventure films ISLAND IN THE SKY and other science fiction parts THEM!. He is actually quite effective as the creature especially in his later rampages.As long as the creature is frozen there is no real problem but one of the men makes the mistake of putting a blanket on top of the permafrost icecube the Thing is lying in. The blanket is an electric blanket and it melts the permafrost  thus releasing the Thing. Subsequently it is discovered that the creature is not mammalian like man nor reptilian but an intelligent form of vegetable.The best science fiction films manage to get some convincing dialog in about these points. Carrington and his fellow scientist Dr. Stern Eduard Franz discuss the possibility of intelligent vegetable life forms on earth including plants that eat small rodents. Carrington is fascinated by this creature and realizes that it is actually more intelligent than man is  he in his misguided zeal hopes to actually talk to the creature and learn from it for man's benefit. This does not sit well with Hendry especially after two of the staff are butchered by the creature apparently it's survival is predicated on the use of animal blood. I will go on a limb and say no other 1950s film really dealt with the conflict of pure science Carrington and selfdefense or government defense Hendry as THE THING did. Carrington a Nobelist sees learning as the end and beall of mankind. Hendry sees survival as more important. Most would probably agree with Hendry but Carrington does maintain a type of respect with the audience until nearly the end of the film when he loses it a bit.The cast handled the roles well. Cornwaithe never had a better part in movies and I'm glad to note in his last film he repeated the part. Tobey's Captain is intelligent and keeps the loyalty of both his own men and most of the scientists. He also has several moments when a romance between him and scientist Nikki Margaret Sheridan heats up in typical Hawkian role reversal she plies him with drink while he is tied up to make sure she controls the date!. Spencer's newsman is rather believable his skepticism about outer space creatures gradually dissolving  he has the famous last words of the film Look to the skies!. Spencer also is constantly remembering past assignments in World War II and even covering the execution of Ruth Snyder in 1928. Also doing well in supporting parts are Franz a more rational scientist than Cornwaithe Dewey Martin an electrician who figures out how to solve the danger and  of all people  George Fennimen as one of the soldiers. In short the film is one of the best science fiction thrillers to come along and well worth watching.".

Preliminary scientific evidence rules out the possibility of a meteor.

AT this point Captain Hendry and his crew along with Dr Carrington with some members of his staff depart to the crash scene about 50 miles away. Upon arrival part of an aircraft structure is protruding above the ice and appears to be alien in origin.  Attempts to remove this aircraft using thermal thermite heat bombs proves unsuccessful.  This Flying Saucer is destroyed but its occupant is thrown clear and becomes frozen under the ice.  This body is then removed and taken back to this expeditionary site and put in cold storage.  Everything appears to be under control until an unforseen accident occurs endangering not only the lives ov everyone at this expeditionary site but all human and animal life on the entire face of planet Earth. There are some lighter sides to this Sci Fi drama. I enjoy the good natured kidding that Captain Hendry receives from his men after his girl friend pins an embarrassing not on his chest while he's asleep giving everybody ample opportunity to read it. I also get a kick out of the newspaper reporter Ned Scotty Scott's on going battle with Captain Hendry in trying to obtain permission to broadcastcast his Flying Saucer story to the media and Captain Hendry's refusal to let him until offical Air Force clearance can be given.

Christian Nyby a film editor for Hawks is officially credited as the director. Whoever directed it The Thing is an impeccably crafted movie. It's considered as a Grade B movie probably because of its subject matter but it's one of the best Grade B's along with Them and Invasion of the Body Snatchers.A group of scientists at the North Pole discover something buried in the ice. Unknowingly they bring back part of it to the camp for study.The acting is solid and the characters are given great dialog. Kenneth Tobey is the take charge Captain Patrick Hendry. Robert Cornthwaite is great as the slightly nutty Dr. Carrington. Douglas Spencer as Scotty is fun as the wisecracking reporter always looking for a photo. Margaret Sheridan is Nikki the shapely love interest. James Arness plays The Thing monster. With an ensemble cast of supporting actors. Be sure to rent the DVD version because it has a few scenes between Tobey and Sheridan that were always cut for TV and VHS probably because they were considered a little too racy for the time although now they are just cute.The film has held up well for over fifty years. The film's contributors were seasoned professionals who had worked on major films. The screenplay by Charles Lederer Mutiny on the Bounty Ocean's Eleven Gentlemen Prefer Blondes His Girl Friday is full of crisp dialog. The black and white cinematography by Russell Harlan Red River Witness for the Prosecution To Kill A Mockingbird Run Silent Run Deep makes everything look right. The prolific film composer Dmitri Tiompkin provides a very eerie thereminbased score.After 50 years this movie rightly earns the label of classic.".

I'm not sure that would happen today although the scene still provides a good shock if you're not expecting it but Howard Hawks' film of The Thing is still one of the first and easily one of the best of the 1950s monster movies. Smart dialogue and good acting lift it above all the others except perhaps Them!.Hawks and the consensus is that the film was principally directed by Hawks himself not by Christian Nyby an editor who needed a director's credit on his resume maintains suspense in the most simple and effective way instead of constantly cutting away to show us what the monster is up to or where it is Hawks keeps us with the band of soldiers and scientists trying to find it and destroy it so that we don't know any more than they do. John Carpenter in his remake over a quartercentury later provides more special effects but he doesn't hold the suspense as well.The characters are wellfleshedout stereotypes and the film is as fine a display of good ensemble acting as you'll see in any film let alone a monster film.

You can call me a sentimental sap but Cyborg She does meet every single one of my expectation of what makes a palatable romantic movie never mind sometimes dwelling on the clichd moments especially when the leads share great chemistry and this being a sciencefiction piece to boot too! Jiro Kitamura Keisuke Koide is a loner who celebrates his birthday with nobody except himself going to the mall and picking out his own gift before ending up at the same old restaurant for a plate of spaghetti. It's a routine year after year but in 2007 he chanced upon a girl Haruka Ayase whom he witnessed to have shoplifted from the departmental store and from then they spend the most amazing evening together. Yes it's reminiscence of Serendipity done in the style of Kwak Jaeyoung whom we know better as the writerdirector of the Korean hit My Sassy Girl.Fast forward to a year later Jiro meets the girl again but this time discovers she's a cyborg sent from the future. I guess to most guys this seemed like a dream come true when a girl no matter if she's a fully functional cyborg happened to just drop into your lap again. It's R2D2 with boobs sent to him in Terminator fashion Sorry with clothes on too which means of course that she has a higher calling and purpose to be with him for reasons best I not reveal here but for you to find out for yourself.Being an advance being in between getting to learn how to be a human protecting Jiro from harm and being romanced she's also like a superhero and Cyborg She never looked a minute out of place if positioned side by side with this year's Hollywood superhero blockbusters. Boasting excellent special effects I thought this movie gave another Japanese Film don't click on this link if you choose not to know a run for its money with its rendition of the event being a more realistic one.It has plenty of charming moments within that makes it a perfect date movie and the great chemistry between the leads is what made this work. Keisuke Koide looked like the helpless puppy that he is flitting from moment to moment trying to figure out what his cyborg's true calling is while succumbing unsuccessfully to temptation of trying to get fresh with her. Haruka Ayase on the other hand had her work cut out for her in being an emotionless robot programmed to smile and had moments which mirrored Uma Thurman from My Super ExGirlfriend. Together they share some light hearted moments in a fine balance with the dramatic ones. And as we all know we usually appreciate things a lot more the minute we lost them and for a romantic movie this usually is the case to reinforce certain emotions the characters have for each other.Running slightly more than 2 hours it never for a minute felt longer than its welcome on screen though I had to admit that amongst its multiple endings I thought that it could have ended at any point and still would have made it a bittersweet movie to have experienced. I've no qualms about the ending it decided upon too but meanwhile for those whose hearts would feel heavy at the slightest touch of sentimentalism you'd better pack your tissues with you.I'll admit it this is a movie which I enjoyed thoroughly even though as you know with any movie dealing with time travel that'll be that bit of a paradox involved and here it came in large doses. I'll advise you to accept the timeline presented for what it is because that's the only way linearly in order to enjoy any movie that has this element. Highly recommended stuff since it's been some time I saw a romantic movie and a science fiction one! that just worked. I'll stick my neck out to say it'll likely be featured in my top 10 list of films for this year and I'll put money aside for the DVD as well.For those who want to watch it on the big screen well it's been playing at the cinemas for some time now so you'd better quickly make some time for it.".

	schema:reviewBody "I don't care what anyone says I absolutely loved this film. The villains in this movie were really stupid and the story is really farfetched but I was able to tolerate it since it IS a scifi romantic comedy.From the drama series I've seen Ayase Haruka had always been a horrible actress. However I've always felt the worst actorsactresses perform extremely well in emotionless roles and this was not an exception. Not only that she was fantastic when she finally showed emotion in the human role. Casting was perfect since she also has that strikingly cool looks in addition to her beauty. Koide Keisuke as usual did a very fine job and cameos by various established film and drama supporting actors were very funny as well.The direction for this movie was fantastic. Although I have to admit the future scenes were really cheesy the special effects in general were fun to watch and the whole film was nicely paced. One event led to another spontaneous plot devices I laughed and I cried.This movie is directed by the same director as My Sassy Girl. I enjoy Korean romantic comedies and this movie actually have actors I'm familiar with so it was a blast for me. Although there were some serious flaws in story and time travel paradox I really connected with the two main characters and there were so many memorable scenes thanks to the wonderful direction. I especially liked the repetition of the first scenes from Ayase Haruka's point of view. The days with her sequence with HIFI CAMP's KIZUNA was one of the best insert song sequence I have ever encountered.I guess there's a reason Bruce Lee robot was introduced in the end...

	onyx:emotionText "I don't care what anyone says I absolutely loved this film. The villains in this movie were really stupid and the story is really farfetched but I was able to tolerate it since it IS a scifi romantic comedy.From the drama series I've seen Ayase Haruka had always been a horrible actress. However I've always felt the worst actorsactresses perform extremely well in emotionless roles and this was not an exception. Not only that she was fantastic when she finally showed emotion in the human role. Casting was perfect since she also has that strikingly cool looks in addition to her beauty. Koide Keisuke as usual did a very fine job and cameos by various established film and drama supporting actors were very funny as well.The direction for this movie was fantastic. Although I have to admit the future scenes were really cheesy the special effects in general were fun to watch and the whole film was nicely paced. One event led to another spontaneous plot devices I laughed and I cried.This movie is directed by the same director as My Sassy Girl. I enjoy Korean romantic comedies and this movie actually have actors I'm familiar with so it was a blast for me. Although there were some serious flaws in story and time travel paradox I really connected with the two main characters and there were so many memorable scenes thanks to the wonderful direction. I especially liked the repetition of the first scenes from Ayase Haruka's point of view. The days with her sequence with HIFI CAMP's KIZUNA was one of the best insert song sequence I have ever encountered.I guess there's a reason Bruce Lee robot was introduced in the end... Don't think just feel! This movie is like Doraemon and Nobita except Doraemon is also Shizukachan. Give it a try with an open mind.";

	schema:reviewBody "This movie was actually somewhat of a surprise. I had bought it from Amazon without actually knowing what it was all about. It had gotten fairly good reviews on Amazon plus it was an Asian movie so I decided to give it a go.And now having seen it I must say that Cyborg She was actually a really nice movie. It is a very interesting romantic movie of sorts because it is not your average romance movie. You have Jiro who falls in love with a cyborg that he himself built in the future and sent back to himself in the past. Confusing? Well a bit odd but it made for a really nice story actually. And it worked out quite well. I especially liked the way the movie ended because it rounded up so many questions that you were stuck with in the first part of the movie.The cast in Cyborg She was actually quite good. Haruka Ayase playing the cyborg and Keisuke Koide playing Jiro had really good chemistry on the screen. And I must admit that I was really taken in by Haruka Ayase's performance as the cyborg and they had really managed to present her in a way that made her look sort of artificial.Not sure if this was based on an anime or manga or not but it sure had the feel like you were watching a liveaction manga movie. Thumbs up on that.Cyborg She is one of the more interesting Asian movies I have seen in awhile because it is somewhat beyond the stereotypical stuff that you see in Asian movies. This oddly romantic story will capture your heart and take you along on a very welltold journey. The movie offers everything from love and laughs to thrills and action.If you are a fan of Asian cinema then you definitely should check out Cyborg She.".

	schema:reviewBody "My rating is not really a 10 it is actually 9.2. And I would agree if people say this movie is underrated. This is definitely one of the greatest tearjerkers from Japan. I cried out loud for over 15 minutes when I watched this movie. And I just can't say anything bad about it except it never showed what happened to Jirou Kitamura after the future girl came back for him. But the story was unlike what I have seen before. And for a comedy the climax was actually kind of sad. That makes any fan of romance shed a tear.The story tells about how the movie's resident geek Jirou Kitamura found love in 2 girlsone is a cyborg in 2 separate occasions. Which only emphasizes his average Joe persona in the film in the fact that he falls for a future girl who has quite an appetite for food shoplifts and quite unused to everything and to a heroic cyborg who is at the least ROUGH ON HIM! But that says something In a relationship it is not about finding the perfect partner in life it's about finding the perfect kind of love that you can share with each other.Just to back it up Jirou's love for the future girl led him to spent all his money and time to create the cyborg girl. And eventually changing history that drives the future girl's heart to return to Jirou. The kind of love Jirou and the future girl share for each other was so strong time can't keep them apart. I wonder if there would be an American version someday. Either way this movie is great as it is. Keisuke's character Jirou could very well be at the top 5 in my long list of Greatest Lovers in Movie History. Why? When he had not created his cyborg girl yet he ended up disabled in a wheelchair. But because he loved the future girl so much he waited 65 years in order to see her againin a sense. And because he did his younger self lived his life happily and without regret.This movie created a question for the public How long can a love that was created over a short period of time last?. And the movie had an answer for it FOREVER.".

	schema:reviewBody "What if James Cameron's Terminator were a love story? Sounds ludicrous but that's exactly what JaeYoung Kwak's Cyborg She is  a love story between a hightech cyborg from the future Hayase Haruka and her inventor boyfriend Kitamura Jiro Koide Kesuke. In the year 2070 a kindly frail and physically handicapped Jiro had built a female cyborg in a homage to Terminator the cyborg is a Cyberdyne Model 103 as a personal aide to assist him in his daily life. Equipped with a time travel device Jiro sends the cyborg into the past in an attempt to prevent the incident that crippled him in 2007 a mentally unstable office worker shots him in a restaurant shootout. The cyborg meets up with the younger Jiro and successfully saves him from being shot by the gunman.As Jiro and the Cyborg slowly start to form a relationship the cyborg becomes a bit of a celebrity as she uses her high tech powers to perform a number of heroic deeds she saves a girl from being hit by a car she stops a hostage taker from killing one of his victims saves people from a fire as well as gets into a bit of innocent mischief she takes clothes without paying does the robot in a disco.Jiro and the Cyborg's happy life however comes to an abrupt end as a massive earthquake hits Tokyo effectively destroying the capital. While the Cyborg does her best to save Jiro she unfortunately suffers serious damage during the quake and now Jiro must try and save her.Cyborg She is directed by Korean director Kwak JaeYoung who many may recognize from his popular 2001 hit My Sassy Girl. Kwak's inventive humor and storytelling is again much in evidence here and he delivers quite a satisfying and entertaining movie. While some of the comedy may border on the silly I found myself laughing at some of the visual gags. The film borrows liberally from other scifi films notably Terminator and A.I. Artificial Intelligence but crafts an interesting timejumping centuryspanning love story that is quite effective and endearing.The VFXSFX work was surprisingly very good and top notch especially with the climactic destruction of Tokyo as well as some of the Cyborg's robotic effects.Some of the story's loopy continuity and Back To The Future styled time travel concepts are a bit hard to follow at times but Kwak does make it work in the end and does pull some inventive story twists.Hayase Haruka Memories of Matsuko is alluring and cute in her role as the future Cyborg. She makes for a likable if but somewhat stiff heroine. Koide Kesuke's Pacchigi! Koizora Kisaragi is also likable as Jiro in a Otakuanime geek sort of way. Their love story begins in typical awkward fashion but soon develops into a sweet romance thanks to their nice and controlled performances.Kiritani Kenta Crows Zeo 69 Sixty Nine does a lot of scene stealing as Jiro's goofy college friend. His scene where he gets the Cyborg drunk is fun to watch. The always funny Takanaka Naoto Swing Girls Water Boys also makes a hilarious cameo as one of Jiro's wacky and highstrung college professors.Cyborg She is an enjoyable scifi fantasy that will have audiences hooked from the start and invested in the romance between the attractive leads. While some may find the story a bit melodramatic and the humor a tad forced I liked the film a lot.Note There was some initial confusion regarding whether Cyborg She was in some way a remake or reinterpretation of Chanwook Park's 2006 I'm A Cyborg But That's OK. While both films do share more than a few similarities and themes they are two completely different films and are not connected in any way. Although I am still of the opinion that Kwak was influenced by Park's film no official connection exists as far as I've been able to gather.".

This guy really does have a good record of making romantic movie in different situation. He has his own style of making romantic movie and this is another of his hearth warming clich intrigue and tear jerking movie.The stories about the lonely college student about to find his love that turn out to be the cyborg from the future send to protect him for the unknown reason. Though the story isnt that original but hardly any movie does nowadays so it doesnt quite really bother me anyway it has been execute pretty well though slow from time to time and drag on and never end like AI Artificial Intelligence. And in the end it got a too wrap up ending at least for me.There are quite a few scenes that will managed to delivered what it suppose to bring and in the end if you dont felt bore by it first it will be pretty much a heart touching story that really intrigue you.The casting well I think it was pretty darn good after all it seem to consist of only two main character and a few more that add little to the story. They do pretty much have a pretty great chemistry even though one of them is a robot.Overall I do pretty much like it though I felt it was overlong for it also got a very slow pace but I do pretty much expected from this guy flick. So it was alright by my standard. In the end I didnt felt riffoff so that is a good thing though I highly doubt I will watch it again soon.Recommendation I went to see it on big screen but I highly recommend you rent DVD.Reason To Watch Touching Cyborg is Hot!!

	schema:reviewBody "This is the fourth movie by director Jayyong Kwak that has Kanokyo her as part of the title. He deserves credit for going out of his native Korea to make this movie. He's also the author of this story.Jiro  a not so savvy college student one day sees a beautiful girl at a department store. He later celebrates his birthday alone at a restaurant. The girl he saw at the department store shows up and says it's her birthday as well. She insists on paying the tab but she actually has no money. Jiro doesn't know about this until the manager of the restaurant comes chasing after them. From that point on the girl starts saying things that doesn't make sense to Jiro but he finds that she is following him around from that day on.Many people have complained about the difficulty in understanding this story. Especially the fact that there're two identical looking she one that's a flesh and blood girl Haruka Ayase that gets memory transplanted from the robot she that she auctioned off for 6.2 billion. And another she that's a robot made by Jiro Keisuke Koide in his later life that he sends back in time to save his life and that of others. The real life she's name is not mentioned or why she looks exactly like the robot Jiro made is explained. The matter further gets confusing because the first she that Jiro encounters is the flesh and blood she but she already has the memory of the robot from the memory transfer. The real life she also appears after the robot is destroyed and becomes Jiro's wife.Now if that's not confusing I don't know what is. It's almost impossible to take it all in on the first viewing.But what's outstanding is how director Kwak put life into the character of robot she and all the situation she goes through with Jiro. Although the story is about a robot there is no more heart warming relationship than the ones these two creates.Koreans have one of the highest average IQ in the world according to world statistics. I can believe that. There's something outstandingly refined about this movie. I can't quite put my fingers on it but it's futuristic and human at the same time.A great science fiction love comedydrama that's worthy of becoming a classic.".

The strength of the movie lies in its director's ability to tell a story and convey emotions through these two great actors. The nerd Jiro is very likable who kind of reminds me of quite a few protagonists from several anime moviesshows. The cyborg character oozes with sex appeal the TX from Terminator 3 is not even this sexyand shares great chemistry with Jiro.All I can say is I truly had great fun watching this film. I though agree with another reviewer that it could have made the robotic dance sequence better and more convincing by hiring a professional breakdancer. This is a heartwarming film that will capture your imagination and make you shed a tear. That's something you won't find in a lot of movies today.".

	schema:reviewBody "Similar to The Fountain Cyborg She otherwise referred to as Cyborg Girl or My Girlfriend Is A Cyborg is a feature set over more than one time period and shows how the smallest event can lead to the biggest catastrophes  and the best love stories.Based upon the Park Chanwook film I'm A Cyborg But That's Okay writerdirector Kwak Jaeyong My Sassy Girl makes a feature that is similar to Windstruck which occasionally bore resemblance to the aforementioned film he is most known for directing. Rather than conceiving a feature about a young woman who thinks she's a cyborg Haruka Ayase portrays a woman who actually IS a cyborg.Unlike films that secretly borrow concepts from other movies in the hopes that no one will notice Cyborg She deliberately steals ideas from films like Terminator and Time Cop to create a story that not only makes a mockery of American classics the Terminator references include the blue time bubble and a man hiding a weapon beneath his trenchcoat but creates a powerfully heartfelt romantic comedy in the process.Jiro Kitamura Keisuke Koide is a geek who knows as much about women as I do. Despite been close friends with a fellow college student Kenta Kiritani Jiro spends much of his life alone his own birthday reflecting his life's unflinching loneliness. That is until he meets a young beautiful sassy intelligent humorous young woman Ayase and though they spend only one night together she leaves an impression on him that he can never forget.So you can imagine the shock he receives exactly one year later when the woman he has been unable to stop thinking about returns  only this time she isn't entirely human. Discovering the origins of the woman he begins living with Jiro finds himself falling in love with his robotic housemate. The question remains if a human can learn to fall in love with another can the same be said for a cyborg? Ms. Ayase is brilliant in her role as the cyborg her stiff movements general ignorance regarding society and facial expressions developing a character who truly is a machine yet at the same time is capable of showing enough emotion to notify the audience of the humanity she may hold within. Mr. Koide is as equally impressive as the lovesick Jiro the lustfully passionate feelings he exhibits towards his cyborg companion alongside his angst at being unable to have a typical relationship with her being adeptly conveyed.Upon discovering the woman of his dreams is not only a cyborg but is from the future Jiro says something akin to 'fair enough'. Not bothering to focus on the strangeness of these circumstances the film is able to quickly move forward uninhibited by irrelevant questions however those of you who after viewing the trailer believe the film will be a collection of action scenarios think again. Much of the film works perfectly as a character drama and on every other occasion offers the audience sidesplitting hilarity in the form of uniquely entertaining humor.The effects that accompany a number of the scenes are superbly delivered and though they are not always the same caliber offered by Hollywood they are fabulous all the same and effectively bring more depth to the feature. A moment when the cyborg begins to illicit sparks after taking a swig of alcohol helps establish how she is presently inebriated while another moment when the world around Jiro becomes hazy is representative of him leaving contemporary society behind by entering a portal through time.Although much of the film is in chronological order the feature doesn't entirely conform to this rule the past and future of the characters being provided considerable depth that assists us in understanding the present. This is accentuated by the score and chosen songs which compliment much of the film and assist the audience in comprehending the mood during every crucial moment.Cyborg She's conclusion moreover may leave audiences questioning the ending's authenticity and though there are several possible interpretations that can be exhibited by Jaeyong's decisions the film loses none of its influence. The intensity of the emotions steadily rise until the film's inescapable climax and upon the credits making their way across the screen its doubtful a single iris will remain dry. With this in mind be sure you go into this film with a box of tissues.Despite there been moments in the film that don't entirely make sense Cyborg She is one of those rare features that reminds us the best films seldom have to.".

That is until he meets a young beautiful sassy intelligent humorous young woman Ayase and though they spend only one night together she leaves an impression on him that he can never forget.So you can imagine the shock he receives exactly one year later when the woman he has been unable to stop thinking about returns  only this time she isn't entirely human. Discovering the origins of the woman he begins living with Jiro finds himself falling in love with his robotic housemate. The question remains if a human can learn to fall in love with another can the same be said for a cyborg? Ms. Ayase is brilliant in her role as the cyborg her stiff movements general ignorance regarding society and facial expressions developing a character who truly is a machine yet at the same time is capable of showing enough emotion to notify the audience of the humanity she may hold within. Mr. Koide is as equally impressive as the lovesick Jiro the lustfully passionate feelings he exhibits towards his cyborg companion alongside his angst at being unable to have a typical relationship with her being adeptly conveyed.Upon discovering the woman of his dreams is not only a cyborg but is from the future Jiro says something akin to 'fair enough'. Not bothering to focus on the strangeness of these circumstances the film is able to quickly move forward uninhibited by irrelevant questions however those of you who after viewing the trailer believe the film will be a collection of action scenarios think again. Much of the film works perfectly as a character drama and on every other occasion offers the audience sidesplitting hilarity in the form of uniquely entertaining humor.The effects that accompany a number of the scenes are superbly delivered and though they are not always the same caliber offered by Hollywood they are fabulous all the same and effectively bring more depth to the feature. A moment when the cyborg begins to illicit sparks after taking a swig of alcohol helps establish how she is presently inebriated while another moment when the world around Jiro becomes hazy is representative of him leaving contemporary society behind by entering a portal through time.Although much of the film is in chronological order the feature doesn't entirely conform to this rule the past and future of the characters being provided considerable depth that assists us in understanding the present. This is accentuated by the score and chosen songs which compliment much of the film and assist the audience in comprehending the mood during every crucial moment.Cyborg She's conclusion moreover may leave audiences questioning the ending's authenticity and though there are several possible interpretations that can be exhibited by Jaeyong's decisions the film loses none of its influence. The intensity of the emotions steadily rise until the film's inescapable climax and upon the credits making their way across the screen its doubtful a single iris will remain dry. With this in mind be sure you go into this film with a box of tissues.Despite there been moments in the film that don't entirely make sense Cyborg She is one of those rare features that reminds us the best films seldom have to.";

	schema:reviewBody "In the original Pygmalion not My Fair Lady a guy who was tired of real women tried to create his own. But ultimately wasn't satisfied with her because she was not living and breathing. So he left her and went to a festival then came back and at some point some how she was more so real to him. In Pinnochio Gepetto built a boy puppet because he wanted a son. But was not happy because he was not initially a real boy who could feel emotions. Eventually following a tragedy he became real. This movie has a lot in common with these two stories premise wise if not at the very least structure wise.I have to agree with the first guy who reviewed this movie. This movie is slow paced a bit and near the end I found myself skipping ahead just to get to the end which is actually the beginning. Overall it is a very heart felt movie. But with that being said? It appeals more to the heart than to the brain. You know how most time travel movies always have some plot holes in the logic or motivation of the characters? There are some plot holes here as well.The real spoilersplot holes begin here. I mean for one the very reason why he built the Cyborg girl was to avert being shot up by the gunman. After she had dealt with the gunman shouldn't she have ceased to exist? I mean where's his motivation to build said Cyborg girl if he's no longer shot up by the gunman? Also he mentioned that the way he was able to build her was because he won the lotto that night. Really? what lotto in fact I don't recall him ever buying a ticket for said lotto let alone do I recall him building her so she could still exist in this alternate timeline.Unless it happened 65 years into the future a future which since modern science has rejected the prospect of an alternate dimension is completely unfeasible. Since his body would be no longer riddled with bullets or anywhere near the state it was in when he built her to begin with.Again this is movie is built on more of an emotional appeal not so much logic do they do throw some in there. The logic is not where it shines. I do believe that if anyone will ever build a time machine that the Chinese will do it first if not another portion of Asian community. So no I don't think its too farfetched for such a girl to exist. The thing she does with her eyes is a bit creepy though hard to believe they had her do that.Also in the dance sequence when she was trying to dance robotic? They should have hired a real pop and locker to do the robotic dancing cause she was too fluid with her movements she needed to be more stiff and precise not fluid especially in the arms.".

Then again I don't think this film is right for little kids either because there's a scene where some fat terrorist just starts shooting a rifle at a restaurant and then he starts chugging down gasoline and ends up lighting up on fire. Cheesy effects and super cheesy story. The ending is super ridiculous.

If I saw a movie about rebuilding a foreign country I would not that get touched because I don't know about the country very much.But I know that people in that age did take the biggest part in rebuilding Japan living in a very hard time. They were Japan's most energetic hopeful and strong people in my opinion. Having experienced the war they believed that they can get better and richer if only they made great efforts. They believed in the future.But how about the real today? Are we still able to keep the sunset that the Suzuki family saw? Do we smile innocently like them? I thought of the real world and felt very sorry for the people in the movie.I know that this movie does not portrait the real Japan. Many people aren't so innocent or good and Japan became richer because they sold weapons to the US at the Korean War. This movie is in a sense fantasy. I regard this movie as a theme park When you're in a theme park you probably forget to criticize it and just get fooled by the lies the theme park shows on purpose in order to enjoy. I first thought this movie was a tearjerker but at the next moment I thought it's too nonsense to say that it's just a tearjerker because this movie IS a tearjerker on purpose. This movie is a emotionstirrer for Japanese people who have forgotten to show emotions.I got fooled by the cute lies of the movie and I cried when Hiromi receives the invisible ring by Chagawa when Roku finds that her mother loved her staring the letters she got and when Junnosuke comes back to Chagawa.I could hear cry! cry! from the screen which I usually hate. But this time I was feeling so gentle and tenderhearted that I forget to criticize. Not only me but everyone in the theater felt the same thing. We felt like we were in the 1950s and watching our neighbors. We laughed and cried so loud like in older ages in Japan today when you make a tiny single noise in the theater someone will stare at you angrily. No one scolded kids speaking or older people eating something because I think we became gentle while watching people in old days. Indeed I could feel gentler than usual even finished watching the movie. And at the same time I felt very sad at that there is no such energy in Japan anymore.But I just want to say thank you to the directors for making a movie that I can talk with grandfathers about their youth.".

She's coming to Tokyo to find a job from Aomori. She finds a job at Suzuki automobile shop where she meets Norifumi and Tomoe. Ryunosuke Chagawa is an aspiring novel writer. He's aiming to win the prestigious Akutagawa award but for the time being runs the candy store he inherited from his grandmother and writes novels for the boy's magazine. The story revolves around Rokuchan the Suzuki family and Chagawa in the back alleys of downtown Tokyo.This is the best made of the trilogy so far in terms of story and production. Acting is the most natural and special effects and props most restrained.Based on a comic by Ryohei Saigan the story is about people's life in the Showa period of Japan. It's like watching a museum of that era with live people moving about it. The actor who was doing the role of Chagawa seems to be over acting and all the characters seems to be just wearing the Showa mask except for Hiroko Yakushimaru who played Tomoe. I can feel realism from her acting. Shinichi Tsutsumi was also over acting and Maki Horikita didn't convey flesh and blood country girl who came out to Tokyo no matter how much she spoke the Tohoku dialect.So I couldn't shake the feeling that I was watching a museum display in action. Everybody tried too hard to make it look like the Showa period which made it look unauthentic.But out of the three movies of this title this one is the best made of the bunch.".

	schema:headline " An entertaining pleasant and nostalgic look at Tokyo in the 1950's";
	schema:reviewBody "Who would have thought that director Yamazaki Takashi the man behind such big scifi action films as Returner and Juvenille was capable of directing such a sweet and hearttouching movie about the importance of family nostalgia and community.Set amidst the backdrop of the construction of the Tokyo Tower 19571958 Always San Chome No Yuhi Always  Sunset On Third Street follows a young high school student from the northern prefecture of Aomori Hoshino Mutsuko Horikita Maki a recent Junior High graduate who is now off to Tokyo having been accepted for employment at a prestigious Auto Company. However much to her chagrin and disappointment Mutsuko discovers that the cozy job of her dreams is merely an apprentice mechanic's position with a small struggling auto repair store. It's owner the proud and hottempered Suzuki Norifumi Tsutsumi Shinichi a former soldier and himself a country boy had come to Tokyo with dreams of setting up his own car factory. Norifumi is equally disappointed that his request for a first rate mechanic went wrong Suzuki had misread Mutsuko's resume which stated that she had taken courses in bicycle jitensha repair and not car jidousha repair. Conflicts arise as Mutsuko struggles to learn the car repair business from Suzuki. Her only allies at home are Suzuki's kindly wife Tomoe Yakushimaru Hiroko and Suzuki's rascally young son Ippei Koshimizu Kazuki.Across the way struggling writer and neighbor Chagawa Ryunosuke is also having a battle with harsh reality. Despite graduating from acclaimed Tokyo University Todai with a literature degree he still can't get descent work as a writer. To make ends meet he frequently submits scifi and adventure stories to a weekly Shonen young boys magazine even though he considers it trivial and unfulfilled work. He just barely makes ends meet through sales of kids toys and candy at his grandmother's store which he inherited. His world suddenly changes when the local bar madam Ishizaki Hiromi Koyuki a former dancer asks him to take care of an associate's little boy Junnosuke Suga Kenta. Unable to say no to the beautiful madam Ryunosuke takes in the shy and distant boy. As fate would have it Junnosuke turns out to be a big fan of Ryunosuke's Shonen Magazine work and a fatherson bond slowly begins to form between the two. Even Hiromi soon begins to fall for the nebbish writer after seeing how well he looks after Junnosuke.The screenplay by Yamazaki and Furusawa Ryota was adapted from Saigan Ryohei's ShogakukanBig Comic Original manga comic series Yuyake No UtaSan Chome No Yuhi which told various nostalgic stories about different kids teens and characters living in Tokyo of the 1950s and how they adapted to Japan's ever changing cultural technological and social climate. While the movie does take much of it's inspiration from the manga it also seems very much influenced by Robert Zemeckis's Forrest Gump particularly in the way it played with real historical events and characters in its story. Always... does something similar though somewhat eschewing some factual accounts.The character of Suzuki Norifumi is most certainly based on real life founder of Suzuki Motors Suzuki Michio although his rise to fame is different. Ryunosuke Chagawa is most likely based on 1920's author Ryunosuke Akutagawa the father of Japanese short stories and whose work Kurosawa Akira adapted in the film Rashomon. While I'm not completely certain the character of Furuyuki Junnosuke may also be an amalgam based on real life mangaka comic artistwriters Matsumoto Leiji and Ishinomori Shoutaro. As other have mentioned some of the performances bordered on the frantic and melodramatic particularly Yoshioka Hidetaka ToraSan series Ame Agaru as Chagawa and Tsutsumi Shinichi Lorelei Kyogokudo Drive as Suzuki but it wasn't at all to the point of absurdity just slightly forced. Yakushimaru Hiroko's role as atypical Japanese mother Suzuki Tomoe follows a long string of motherly roles shes played of late Ichi Liter No Namida Bubble E Go! etc. and is definitely in stark contrast to her Kadokawa idol days in movies such as Sailor Fuku To Kikanjyu and Tantei Monogatari. Modelactress Koyuki Alive Last Samurai Kairo is steadily becoming one of my favorite actresses as she always plays interesting characters. As the former dancer turned bar hostess Ishizaki Hiromi she brings likable charm to the role. Her scenes with Yoshioka are heartfelt and you can't help but be touched by their offbeat but tender romance similar to Densha Otoko in some ways.Special mention should be given to VFX SupervisorDirector Shibuya Kiyoko for the incredible CGIminiature work that brought to life the world of 1958 Tokyo. From the architecture to the vehicles to the fashion I was reminded of Peter Jackson's similar eye for detail for his remake of King Kong set in the 1930s. It was absolutely beautiful work and I kept asking myself how they were able to do it they eventually released a separate DVD showing the production. Some of the humor and cultural references may be lost in translation by some such as the mistakes regarding Mutsuko's name RokkuchanNumber 6 or the hype over wrestler Rikidozan or the nostalgia of riding the C62 train before the Shinkansen took over. I kind of laughed at some of the cultural references and jokes that came up concerning House Curry CocaCola and the Taiyozoku Sun Tribe.While some have called the movie a bit overly sentimental in its longings and nostalgia I think that is what made the movie good. Like the classic ToraSan movies it recalls a time when life in Japan wasn't so hectic frantic and chaotic. It was a time where everyone in the various communities did really know each other and helped one another as good neighbors should. Even though I'm a child of the 1980s I still appreciated this look to the past and didn't see it as an overly romantic point of view.".

Set in Tokyo in 1958 at the time of the construction of the Tokyo Tower the story depicts a few families in that neighborhood and the things they go through. It has both comic turns and once in a while sad references. It is also overtly sentimental at times but the emotional power of the film never wanes and it is just a feel great film. The acting is excellent. There are real glimpses into the meaning of family love and caring and just generally sharing your time together. If you think you are going to watch this film and promise yourself you will not be sucked in by its sentiment you are missing the point. Its supposed to make you laugh and cry. Although Tokyo has demonstrably changed since 1958 I went there in May 2008 you wouldn't be able to find traces of this existence this is a period film which just works wonderfully. It was so successful a sequel was done. I'm going to watch that since based on this film alone I want to see what happens to these characters from here. That is how great the film is that one film alone is not good enough to let these characters go. Simply a triumph that deserves all the success it has achieved.".

The character of the doctor who lost wife and a child in war is excellent.The figure of the Japanese who were gazing at the future being captured in the past for a while calls sympathy.If you have never been to Tokyo City in 1960'syou can go now by seeing this movie.";

Always  Sunset on Third Street adapted from Ryohei Saigan's manga has all the adornment of schmaltz as it follows a number of the Tokyo working class in 1958 as following the war and backdropped by a being rebuilt Tokyo Tower they steadily struggle through their lives to a better future. Yamazaki though roots his film in an innocent glorification of the community striving for a common goal as seen through warm sepia tones and golden hues.Among the multitude of the characters Mutsuno Hoshino Maki Horikita who I just have to say remains as one of my favorite Japanese actors is a recent junior high graduate who goes to Tokyo dreaming of a job at a prestigious automobile company only to find herself working as a repair woman in a car repair shop owned by Norifumi Suzuki Shin'ichi Tsutsumi. Across the street is Ryunosuke Chagawa Hidetaka Yoshioka a candy shop owner struggling to make it as a serious novelist and makes up for his literary shortcomings by regularly submitting juvenile stories for a boys' magazine. Hiromi Ishizaki Koyuki a sake bar owner with a shady past receives Junnosuke Kenta Suka a boy abandoned by his single mother to be left in her care and in turn she leaves the boy to Ryunosuke.Taking place in a broadly idealistic and exaggeratedly whimsical parallel reality Yamazaki may often succumb to contrived melodramatic trappings and a few missed comedic notes yet his relentlessly effervescent tale possesses absorbing set pieces and a contagious joie de vivre none so more affectingly displayed by the film's closing shot. An unabashedly giddy fairy tale Always is an ode and a love letter to the city's halcyon days as shared by its inhabitants who are slowly rising from its past and slowly but surely to the age of TV refrigerator and CocaCola.".

	schema:headline " A nice period piece filled with hope of things getting better";
	schema:reviewBody "In 1974 manga writer Ryohei Saigan created a comic called San Chome no Yuhi Sunset on Third Street. The comic revolved around the daytoday adventures in a Tokyo neighborhood in the period of 19551964. The manga is now one of the longestrunning comics in Japan and created an animated series and a trilogy of liveaction films of which this is the first film. The film works best as a period piece. No expense was spared to recreate the era of 1958 Japan. The people of Japan are most proud of that era it was after World War 2 when they had been broken and defeated like a slowburning phoenix with hard work ambitious dreams and their own indomitable will they rise up to stand tall and proud. The film is filled with this spirit whatever tragedies they may suffer they will never give up but keep pushing onwards filled with the hope of things getting better. The story and acting is good and solid. The great appeal of this film are its universal and optimistic cast these are characters you feel you know your whole life the man of the house who works to feed his family the kindhearted housewife the smart but innocent children and so many others. This film gives a little more detail and background to the whole cast while the next two films has two main families to focus on which rather takes away from the ensemble story.The only real flaw with this film is that it's too intimate and anthological for a motion picture it works better in a serial format like a comic or a TV show which it already was. Also unless you have an interestknowledge of Japanese culture it's not really anything interesting I myself came across this only because of the reputation of the manga it was based on. The film ends with a sunset on the residents of Third Street which both signifies the end of an experience and the promise of a new day and new experiences. That is pretty much the core of a slice of life work it's all in a day's work compiling of both the usual and unusual the magical and the mundane but always a day full of incident and adventure.".

It is funny and touching at the right time. The pacing of the movie and some scenes felt like they came out of the manga although it has so much more to offer. The cinematography and music help set a nostalgic feel of what it might have been like in 1950s Tokyo. It is full of spirit and energy where the country is on an accelerated path in rebuilding and redefining itself. There is hint of the Meiji Restoration where the denizens of Tokyo enthusiastically absorb Western cultures from prowrestling to CocaCola. And the building of Tokyo Tower itself a smaller replica of The Eiffel symbolizes the emergence of postWW II Japan  a dichotomy of Eastern identity that embraces Western advancements.The product design and CGIs were top notch for its time and I love how they use the different stages of Tokyo Tower's construction and the seasonal changes to mark the individual story arcs' progression.The movie embraces its manga roots with sincerity all the characters' quirks and social slapsticks remain intact. Horikita Maki's Mutsuko is simply adorable as the country girl check out that rural dialect trying to make it in a big city. The uncommon romance between the gorgeous host girl Hiromi and the oddball writer Ryunosuke. Plus many more delightful details make Always not only a funny snapshot of behavioral comedy but also a touching ode to a bygone era.How can you not love a movie filled with this much heart?".

I'm thinking of course about the failed writer and the boy he takes in  they're so well played by the actors and beautifully so! It does mention the dark side of the economic miracle such as protistution and abandonment of children. No mention is made of the Americans based in Japan and of course the war is mentioned in parts. It does remind me of a film about France I forgot the name... in the 1950's and how things changed such as the introduction of freezers TVS and of course the black stuff  Coca Cola! I'd still watch it despite the criticism and I do enjoy a 'romantic' film. Besides the Americans have made over romantic films about the 1950's so surely it's time Japan made one now!".

	schema:reviewBody "There must have been comedians in the projection booth the night that some friends and I went to see a family friendly film. These particular friends tend to watch only lighthearted material and get upset for weeks whenever they see horror films or intense thrillers. They were totally unprepared for a 'Quarantine' trailer and it shocked them all so badly that we nearly had to leave and get our money back. Maybe it was because of their strong reaction that my interest in the film has stayed so high for the past several months.This week I have seen both 'Quarantine' and 'Rec' the film that 'Quarantine' is a remake of. 'Rec' is not without flaws but it is a very solid and chilling horror film. 'Quarantine' is able to expand on several of the strengths in 'Rec' while falling into a few pitfalls of it's own. Both films are about a TV news crew taping a show about what a night in the life of a fireman is like. A seemingly routine call turns out to be something much more and the news crew is trapped in a quickly quarantined building.Giving credit where it is due 'Quarantine' kept me on the edge of my seat for most of the movie. It lures you in with a very relaxed opening ten minutes but once you reach the building and the cop in charge asks why the camera crew is there the whole tone of the movie changes. The fun and games the lighthearted banter is gone. We only realize how serious it is though when they enter the apartment of an injured old woman. For me the tension starts with the entrance to the apartment and never lets up. Each new segment that the TV crew starts filming holds potential terror. The set design and the lighting are terrific and 'Quarantine' walks a careful tightrope of character action. So often in horror films the audience is yelling with frustration at what characters on the screen are doing because it all goes against common sense. There is a little bit of that early on but 'Quarantine' does a better job of playing to the characters and their panic. Characters die not through naivety or stupidity as much as they do from inevitability and inescapability. The key performance comes from Jennifer Carpenter.The film's greatest strength and weakness at the same time Carpenter is the focus of the camera because of her role as the reporter and it isn't an easy part to play. She is solid for the majority of the film but terror essentially overwhelms her with ten minutes to go and she is reduced to a sobbing shrieking shivering bowl of jello. Would I or anyone else be any better in the situation that 'Quarantine' creates? Hard for me to say but probably not. The problem is that there were three primary acting choices for her to make in the final ten minutes she could play it as a hysteric which she does she could play it as numbing down her fear like the cameraman does in order to try and escape or she could have been so overwhelmed by her fear that she becomes a functional catatonic working on autopilot. Carpenter's choice is probably the 'truest' choice for how people would react. That doesn't mean that it is going to make for good drama. Her transformation from confident and outgoing to hysterical jabbering is so jarring that it feels forced instead of real. The camera man keeps telling her to calm down when they've reached a potentially safe room but she is far beyond the calming down stage and well into the years of therapy one instead. I found it to be just too much and actually pulled me out of the horror and towards comedy instead.'Rec' felt a bit more organic and gritty than 'Quarantine.' The performances are decent in both but you feel less of a connection to the characters in 'Quarantine.' Many are clearly there to serve as fodder with no attempt to seriously develop them. 'Rec' does a much better job particularly when the reporter interviews each of the buildings residents. The five minutes spent in filming those sequences gave more of a stake to the audience into the wellbeing of those characters. That never really takes off in 'Quarantine' and I regret that they didn't follow the lead of 'Rec'. One thing that I thought 'Quarantine' did a much better job of was in plot clarity and how they provided information. The clues to the source of what is going on are much more explicit and come very early in the movie. 'Rec' dropped a few hints for the viewer to put together but relies on the final five minutes to give the major clues about patient zero. What patient zero is spreading is clearer in the remake and I thought the clarity benefited the plot. Of course by the time you find out about patient zero Carpenter's character is beyond being able to help provide the audience with anymore real analytical power. Don't blink or you'll miss everything you need to know.I give the slight edge to 'Rec' but certainly recommend 'Quarantine' to horror fans. It's problems aren't severe enough to detract from a very decent effort.".

	schema:headline " trying to review this without comparing to the original";
	schema:reviewBody "I have to say this whole hysteria of America ruining foreign films is laughable. Yes there are some really bad remakes but that does not effect the original film. You cannot ruin a film by remaking it as the original film is still the same. If you are angry you are angry because you feel that people who really deserve the fame and recognition are not getting it. This is a justified reason to be angry but don't go saying the film has been ruined because that defies all logic of possibility.I must say it's hard for me to review this film without thinking about the original mainly because it is nearly a shot for shot remake. Obviously this takes away from the suspense and overall fear factor of the film. If you have seen the original don't expect to experience the same level of terror that you had the first go round. You're going to know what's coming for the most part. If you haven't seen REC this movie will probably scare you. If you actually have the option of seeing REC first I would do it because I feel that it is still the superior movie. Of course if you live in America your local video store won't have it and you'll have to download it illegally so I guess you're stuck between a rock and a hard place.I actually thought the acting was quite good for the most part. Jennifer Carpenter does a great job playing hysterical women. She did a good job being hysterical in the Emily Rose abomination and she did a good job being hysterical in Dexter. She does a good job being hysterical in this movie as well so kudos to the producersdirectors for making a logical choice to cast her. Her dialogue outside of being chased down by rabid tenants is laughable but this actually makes sense when you consider the fact she's a reporter for a show no one would watch anyways.The main difference between REC and this movie is the cause of the deranged building tenants. Surprisingly I thought they made the story work and it played more on American fears such as government distrust terrorism and viral warfare. The only thing I think they failed on was the choice to use higher quality production. Part of what made REC really scary was the grittiness which gave you the feeling that what was happening was real. Although the camera work is choreographed well the Hollywood quality takes away the grit and leaves you feeling like you've had a few too many before watching.Overall I think this is actually a decent remake. The producers and director realized that the story was already awesome and they didn't try to change it. I think if people would calm down and put aside their national pride and cultural elitism they would realize that these kinds of remakes only help foreign films. How many people knew about REC before this movie outside of a small demographic of people imdb is not the 'norm'? How many people know about that great movie now? Lots of people visit these websites looking for reviews and seeing REC pop up everywhere is only good exposure. Hell if this movie does well you might actually find copies of REC in your local video store and believe me I'd be the first in line to buy a copy.".

If you are angry you are angry because you feel that people who really deserve the fame and recognition are not getting it. This is a justified reason to be angry but don't go saying the film has been ruined because that defies all logic of possibility.I must say it's hard for me to review this film without thinking about the original mainly because it is nearly a shot for shot remake. Obviously this takes away from the suspense and overall fear factor of the film. If you have seen the original don't expect to experience the same level of terror that you had the first go round. You're going to know what's coming for the most part. If you haven't seen REC this movie will probably scare you. If you actually have the option of seeing REC first I would do it because I feel that it is still the superior movie. Of course if you live in America your local video store won't have it and you'll have to download it illegally so I guess you're stuck between a rock and a hard place.I actually thought the acting was quite good for the most part. Jennifer Carpenter does a great job playing hysterical women. She did a good job being hysterical in the Emily Rose abomination and she did a good job being hysterical in Dexter. She does a good job being hysterical in this movie as well so kudos to the producersdirectors for making a logical choice to cast her. Her dialogue outside of being chased down by rabid tenants is laughable but this actually makes sense when you consider the fact she's a reporter for a show no one would watch anyways.The main difference between REC and this movie is the cause of the deranged building tenants. Surprisingly I thought they made the story work and it played more on American fears such as government distrust terrorism and viral warfare. The only thing I think they failed on was the choice to use higher quality production. Part of what made REC really scary was the grittiness which gave you the feeling that what was happening was real. Although the camera work is choreographed well the Hollywood quality takes away the grit and leaves you feeling like you've had a few too many before watching.Overall I think this is actually a decent remake. The producers and director realized that the story was already awesome and they didn't try to change it. I think if people would calm down and put aside their national pride and cultural elitism they would realize that these kinds of remakes only help foreign films. How many people knew about REC before this movie outside of a small demographic of people imdb is not the 'norm'? How many people know about that great movie now? Lots of people visit these websites looking for reviews and seeing REC pop up everywhere is only good exposure. Hell if this movie does well you might actually find copies of REC in your local video store and believe me I'd be the first in line to buy a copy.";

And it is a failure in its end.1 To scare people you need to introduce pauses so there is thriller. In this movie they put too many zombie attacks compared to the original. It was much more explicit than REC so it becomes more a gore funny film than a horror movie.2 You can't choose such a bad actress she screams so much you quickly want her to be caught by a zombie. What a bad performance.3 This is a Hollywood movie it is supposed there is more resources how can the zombies look so fake? the Spanish one was utterly superior. SPOILER The final monster is a joke compared to the original one. Incredible. The original monster was a girl and you could see her breasts Hollywood censored this??? how funny. What about the night vision scene???? It didn't look like night vision at all!!!! It has to look like a negative or something not like a dark version of a normal vision!!!3They skip the most important thing here!!! In the final scene they turn on the tape and NO EXPLANATION OF WHAT'S GOING ON IS HEARD! In the original movie you can hear the guy living in the flat talking about how he kidnapped the girl from a church where they kept her in Portugal about his experiments and how he tried to cure her. It's several recording sessions and you see how desperate he gets because he can't heal her and he thinks he won't be able to keep her UP THERE for much longer. You can figure out he has been a victim of her.So the devilish nuance is lost in favor of the less scaring virus point of view. What made REC so good is that in the end it seems the girl Nia Medeiros is some creature from hell it's not only about an infection.All in all another Hollywood waste of money instead of welcoming foreign movies they copy them and make them a shame.".

	schema:reviewBody "Even at a glance it is clear that Quarantine has boarded the 'fad' bandwagon it two respects. Firstly this chiller joins up with the abundance of remakes that choke the gullet of Hollywood and at an impressively rapid pace I may add duplicating its Spanish predecessor Rec within a year's time. Secondly it is the successor in a line of films some from earlier this year in fact that adopt the handheld camera technique which may soon be classified more accurately as a gimmick to construct a first hand real time account of events. Yet despite succumbing to these popular fixations and the flag of death that is the studios reluctance to screen the film Quarantine is crisp effective horror.When comparing Rec and Quarantine the similarities are glaring. In fact the films are almost identical save a few altered snippets. Which is good in the sense that nothing was lost in translation and although nowhere near as disgraceful as remaking classics or art films it still begs to ask the question why? Alas the average viewer does not wish to read subtitles especially when watching horror so the update went through. Directed by newcomer John Erick Dowdle he makes the most of his debut. Procuring a larger budget then its inspiration Quarantine looks better as a whole despite more frequent incomprehensible shots involving darkness and jiggle cam and is able to incorporate some effects into the production such as a continuous and chilling shot of a person being tossed down a stairwell. Comparisons to 2008's earlier films Cloverfield and Diary of the Dead are unavoidable and remains squarely in the middle a farcry from the ingenuity and atmosphere of Cloverfield but avoids the horrendous acting and scripting of Diary.Mirroring Rec Quarantine begins with a reporter Angela Vidal Jennifer Carpenter who hosts a late night television program. On this particular night Angela and her cameraman Scott Steve Harris are doing a ridealong with the firemen of a local station in L.A. including Jake Jay Hernandez and Fletcher Jonathan Schaech. After a tenuous night of boredom and anxiety they are finally called to the scene of an apparent accident in an aging condo involving an elderly tenant. Things are not as they seem however as soon after the CDC seals off the building with the foursome and the reaming residents still inside. Their reasoning is good it seems as all hell breaks loose as a mysterious rabies virus rips through the building turning those exposed into zombielike fiends. The survivors must work together to battle the infected the authorities and each other.Both films incorporate the inherent problem of the disease itself which seems to frequently shift in its required incubation period but is not really a huge impediment for the film as a whole. The opening act which is situated entirely at the station is both surprisingly involving and witty and works to some extent as character development. The finale is also pulsepounding if not entirely inspired but lacks the sheer terror I felt at the finale of Rec. When breaking it down Quarantine's opening is better then the original and Rec's final act is better then its imitator so things balance out. Each film boast a superb scene mid to late film including the aforementioned stairwell plummet in Quarantine and a scene in Rec involving the same stairwell in which the heroes peer down to see the lower floors of infected peering back eerie stuff. I would encourage horror fans to see both before making their choice and to be honest I haven't quite chosen myself which is superior. Regardless Quarantine takes advantage of a ploy that has not yet become stale and yielding authentic portrayals from its relatively unknown cast and an ominous atmosphere this flick is infectious to be sure.See all my reviews at httpsimonsaysmovies.blogspot.com".

Once again American underlings of the filmpersuasion lacked any real originality or motivation to write anything of their own so they chose to massacre an existing one. That isn't to directly say this movie is horrible. But the strange thing you may notice if you educate yourself is that the ORIGINAL had a plot where as this one sadly comes out with little to NO plot.Now if you like the common films that have no regard to your intelligence or sense of accomplishment that one can get from watching a good film. Like 'One Missed Call' 'The Ring' 'The Eye' etc. Then you will think I have no clue what I am talking about. However if you're not a dolt you will agree and wonder why this movie delivered the higher budget film but removed the plot.The film is 85 it's original. However it does take some originality in developing the 'infection' earlier on in the plot however you really don't get any explanation on much anything. It's like they teased you with it. Although the tease being a very weak attempt at a conclusion.Honestly you cannot grasp the entirety of this film without watching Rec. The same can't be said inversely but both are enjoyable to watch.In conclusion if you just want a driveby horror. Go ahead. If you actually want to have something to talk about with your friends get Rec and this one and watch them back to back with the gang and make it your own discussion.".

That isn't to directly say this movie is horrible. But the strange thing you may notice if you educate yourself is that the ORIGINAL had a plot where as this one sadly comes out with little to NO plot.Now if you like the common films that have no regard to your intelligence or sense of accomplishment that one can get from watching a good film. Like 'One Missed Call' 'The Ring' 'The Eye' etc. Then you will think I have no clue what I am talking about. However if you're not a dolt you will agree and wonder why this movie delivered the higher budget film but removed the plot.The film is 85 it's original. However it does take some originality in developing the 'infection' earlier on in the plot however you really don't get any explanation on much anything. It's like they teased you with it. Although the tease being a very weak attempt at a conclusion.Honestly you cannot grasp the entirety of this film without watching Rec. The same can't be said inversely but both are enjoyable to watch.In conclusion if you just want a driveby horror. Go ahead. If you actually want to have something to talk about with your friends get Rec and this one and watch them back to back with the gang and make it your own discussion.";

This probably won't be the best review you read for this movie but for an avid horror movie enthusiast watching with eyes wide open...this movie was just...bad.Simple plot summary. A reality show that features late night careers is showcasing a fire station. They eventually get a call to a complex with an undisclosed issue. When they enter they encounter a strange old women standing there with blood and spit hanging from her mouth and she's growling. Now for the plot...get together a group of people with absolutely no survival or social skills who all happen to be mentally handicapped. Next lock them all into a complex with each other. Mix in a very unintimidating zombie wannabe virus and let them all run around with their arms flailing about. That's this movie.I'm sorry but this movie was just...stupid and ridiculous. The story is actually really good I hear it is based of some other movie that I've never watched but whatever and could have been executed soooo much better. The acting wasn't really bad just completely without direction. The gore was there but the camera was so damn shaky you could never focus on any of the action. The way the people reacted and the ending was just so pathetic it's unbelievable.SPOILER Really if I'm trapped in a complex with some weird virus that turns people into violent monsters...I would not gather together in a lobby. I would gather the uninfected and secure myself behind one of the very thick well locked doors that the complex offers and wait it out. I would definitely not Try and gather the infected into my arms put my head near the infected persons face lock myself in a room with the infected run after the infected when they go crazy eat someone and take off. These people basically offer themselves up on a platter in this movie and it's just pathetic to watch. The end of the movie is so sudden that the audience actually groaned and stomped out of the theater.DO NOT PAY TO SEE THIS MOVIE it is an OK rent or download but to pay 10 to see it is ridiculous. This movie is more of a 2 but I'm voting a 1 to help offset the idiots who vote this a 8.".

And herein lies the problem...Why would anyone watch pay money for or endorse a film which is a shot for shot remake of another much better film? How would anyone make money out of this from a distribution standpoint? The answer sadly is because we are lazy lazy people who can't relate to anything outside of our incredibly small geography or sphere of influence. If an audience is called to watch subtitles to see a great film like REC you have people lining up to remake it without. Because they know that a quick and effortless buck can be made off the joe shmoe's who can't be bothered or who don't have the mental capacity to both read a subtitle and keep track of images at the same time. Never mind that what they are seeing is a poor second place at least its good ole American actors damnit! This extends further it can't even be set in Madrid! Like the office couldn't be set in England no this must be in LA with second rate actors mediocre translations of the original script and contrived camera work in place of the clever devices and aesthetics which created REC one of the most atmospheric and genuine horror films of recent years.This viewing malaise cannot relate to a film outside of its own time even. Think Gus Van Sant think the remake of Psycho think why the hell did he remake a film shot for shot with Vince Vaughn instead of Anthony Perkins. Because its in colour that's why and it's set in the present and otherwise how could any of these poor saps be expected to follow it.This is at least better than the truly blasphemous remakes of The Ring and The Grudge perhaps due to the lack of gap here between US and Japanese cinematography but there is still this deeper issue in US cinema. The fact that any film without a US passport and contemporary time stamp has to be remade. Or not even has to be but CAN be... and can make money to boot. This is a terrible state of affairs which serves no purpose than to further remove any artistic intent from film in the effort to dumb down content for a quick buck. Texas Chainsaw Massacre Night of the Living Dead Dawn of the Dead Day of the Dead The Hills Have Eyes The Hitcher Haloweeen REC The Grudge The Ring The Eye Psycho... RIP good films all!

	schema:reviewBody "btw...although some are calling this a zombie movie there are in fact no zombies in it. Rabies DOES infect humans. The people who have been bitten in this movie are not dying and reanimating and trying to eat everyone they are supposedly displaying the madness that strikes rabid dogs and running around trying to bite everyone just as the infected dogs will.It's difficult to imagine the reasoning behind some of the positive reviews calling this silly plot line good or effective or even just frightening. If you missed the advertising and aren't aware it's supposed to be a horror flick the beginning won't clue you in. That's actually one of the good points of the film a fairly realistically done beginning informational news piece on the life of a firefighter at the fire station that provides a few glimpses of some of the man characters and allows the development of some liking and sympathy for them before getting to the action. This segment concludes with the reporter and cameraman riding along with the crew on a call involving a paramedic situation rather than a fire that even incorporates the nice touch of the cameraman telling the reporter I can't slide down that pole with this camera! and the two detouring to a run down the stairs to jump on the fire truck. The only bad points to this part of the movie was that it went on a little too long and it's impossible to believe a professional cameraman can't figure out how to focus his camera. After the news duo and firemen arrive at the dilapidated apartment building things quickly go south. the film is so DARK that the supposed tears all the victims show can't be seen and the supposed salivating is actually vomit or blood in most cases. This rabies is scary because it causes disease in minutes instead of in months rabies actually takes 38 weeks to develop in most people and that's do to the physical limits of the virus moving up nerves to reach the brain which cannot be genetically modified. And yes a veterinarian would know that...veterinarians know more about diseases that spread from animals to humans than medical doctors do. They have to...they're the ones most at risk to catch those diseases.The CDC working with the cops somehow seals off the building just after the fire department people and news crew get inside because a man who lived there took a sick pet to the veterinarian and it ran around biting all the other animals who started showing aggressiveness within an hour. Does anyone reading actually think sick animals run around in one big pen in the clinic instead of being kept in separate cages? Well maybe the sick dog was running around the waiting room biting all the other animals being held by their owners? And of course not biting the owners.....? The CDC being notified and showing up the entire length of the country away THAT fast? For an unknown disease that only affects animals remember they said only the animals were showing aggressiveness? Without the local public health people ever being called in? Let's not even mention that rabies doesn't usually take the furious form like 'mad dogs' in humans. But it gets sillier.The CDC comes in wearing moonsuits and start taking samples to see what is causing the problem...with a drill at least 10 long they sink full length in fromt he top of the victim's head! What were they trying to get a sample of his tonsils? BTW rabies in living humans can be diagnosed by a sample of cerebrospinal fluid which only requires a needle and syringe. Oh yeah and don't forget they handcuff the guy to whatever he's lying on first. at his waist level...so of course he sits up AFTER they obviously drilled his brain into mush and bites the other CDC guy unhampered by handcuffs.No end to sheer stupidity yet. The child who owned the sick dog has had a slight fever for hours but suddenly goes nuts and bites half her mom's face off...and the cop runs after her kneels in front of her and assures her things are OK instead of shooting her from a distance and of course gets bitten too. The building superintendent says he has in his apartment the key to a drain cover they can all escape through in the basement while standing in front of glass doors they just shut to keep out an infected guy and gets bitten. The news crew runs up the stairs after getting the key blathering about finding a way out that way although we all know by then its not possible find an apartment full of rodent cages and clippings about doomsday cults and turn on a reeltoreel tape at half speed but can't tell it's voices at half speed. And the absolute corker...the CDC prevent human egress but forgets all about the mice and rats that infest every slummo house in the L.A. area...".

The news crew runs up the stairs after getting the key blathering about finding a way out that way although we all know by then its not possible find an apartment full of rodent cages and clippings about doomsday cults and turn on a reeltoreel tape at half speed but can't tell it's voices at half speed. And the absolute corker...the CDC prevent human egress but forgets all about the mice and rats that infest every slummo house in the L.A. area...";

Obviously no movie is perfect and everyone will have their own views likes and dislikes. If you look at all the other past horror movies this one isn't too shabby. Look a movie entertains you then it did it's job. That's why it's called entertainment. Just because some jackass on the street says it sucks and just because it didn't get many stars doesn't mean it's a bad movie.

A literal remake of Rec a film I wasn't too fond of it is all told from the viewpoint of a cameraman and a reporter Jennifer Carpenter who are shadowing some firemen for the night. When they enter a building where something resembling rabies has broken out the socalled horror begins. I say socalled because there is nothing scary here. It's just noise and chaos. My first big problem with this remake was Carpenter's reporter character  she's arrogant smug annoying loud and unprofessional. She's not a reporter's backside. I spent the whole movie wanting her to die. The handheld docostyle horror film has got to be buried. It has become such a clich. When the filmmakers of Man Bites Dog employed it it was effective. The handheld material was also realistically shot. The professional news cameraman who is shooting this turkey would be pink slipped the moment the network copped a look at his footage. Why do filmmakers think that handheld footage needs to look like a drunk is filming it? Empty horror movies made by and for ADDridden idiots are slowly driving me away from modern horror films. Quarantine should be quarantined for good so it can't infect another human eyeball.".

	schema:reviewBody "Already in the Quarntine commercials they've put the last 5 seconds of the ending and the most scariest part of the film so I already knew this wasn't going to be good. And yes I've already seen REC The Spanish original I watched Quarntine anyways for I hope Americans can actually pull of a good remake one day and nope it hasn't been done with this film.There are 3 main disappointments in this film excluding the fact that it was a poor remake.1. No story what I hated most is that they completely took out the story on the whole situation. It is at the end when they are suppose to realize what was happening to them but they just ignored it. Therefore the movie ends without knowing what caused the infection and what was in the final room especially for those who have not seen the original.2. No characters One of the strongest factors of REC was their ability to let the viewers know each and every one of the people in the building. You knew their names their family their basic backgrounds and personality and you knew the ones end up infected. In Quarntine you wouldn't know who is who who just fell down the stairs and the only names I remember are the reporter cameraman and the little girl.3. No Scare Throughout the whole movie i did not once jump or get even the slightest scare. Mainly I know the story before I watched but Quarntine changed it up quite a bit in scare tactics but it still didn't work. They also decide to have it extra dark throughout the movie yet in REC the rooms were lite and the atmosphere was still scary.Even knowing the whole story Quarntine left me confused in many parts the camera was everywhere. I would of liked it if they included an Asian family as they did in REC no idea why excluded this race. Since I've ranted about all its negative the only thing i find positive in the film is the better make up artists than REC.I believe no one should pay to see this movie and watching the original REC is worth it. But if you're too stubborn to not watch a foreign film with subtitles then by all means stick with this scareless storyless and characterless movie.".

Joining up with a couple of them called out to an apartment building they soon discover something horrific is going on....Quarantine is a an American remake of Rec. This means it has two major problems to overcome. First Rec was to me the scariest movie I've seen in a cinema for almost 18 years the last was The Exorcist III! The second is that it IS an American horror movie remake. Now the track record for this has been awful. Consider the evidence  The Ring The Grudge One Missed Call The Wicker Man to name some. Hell they can't even remake American movies! The Hitcher When A Stranger Calls I still shudder about that one! Prom Night Halloween. So this movie starts with two major points against it.However despite a couple of minor issues and one major one it's not that bad.The reason it works is that the director John Erick Dowdle has taken the scares from the original and simply redone them. In fact the movie is almost a shot for shot remake of Rec! The fact that despite having seen Rec the scares still work is a testament to not only how scary the original was but also how well they've been redone.As I said there are a couple of minor faults. Some of the makeup effects don't quite work. The other minor fault is that the cast while good aren't as convincing as the original cast were. Case in point Jennifer Carpenter as Angela. At the start she's fine but by the end she's a bit over the top in hysterical and terrified mode compared to Manuela Velasco.But the major fault and this one is harder to overlook is that they've changed what is actually going on. In this movie it's suggested that it's a strand of rabies that has caused the outbreak. In the original it's never really revealed what is causing it although events towards the end suggest a possible supernatural cause. But because they've changed it here it means the final scenes don't work as well and don't really fit. And the final shot which was revealed in the trailer by the way again doesn't work in the remake.The movie is slightly longer than the original spending more time with the fireman at the station before the events begin and has a little more emphasis on what is going on outside also but these little changes don't affect the movie that much.How you view this movie will depend on the original Rec. If you've not seen the original then it is a pretty effective scary movie especially the last 15 minutes. However if you've seen Rec then this movie offers nothing new and isn't as good overall.".

He was right. As a movie this would probably rate a 2 given it has zero plot no structure besides randomness and very little production value. However that isn't the point. Everyone in our theatre was laughing and gasping the whole way through  not only were some of the stunts creative see trailer if you need to know but they hid some of the best or worst depending on how you want to look at it but some of the stuff they did took us completely by surprise. These guys do some stuff that won't make it into your newspaper reviews and probably can't even be published here involving lots of things below the belt. However almost 34 of the stunts are fantastically hysterical even if morally condemnable but remember Knoxville's statement and if you are in the right mindset this movie is hysterical to watch. Only about 20 minutes of this movie could have actually been shown on TV so consider yourself warned of what you're getting into  some stuff is disgusting but instead of being repulsed by it you end up laughing at the sheer stupidity of it all. As a person who thought Jackass the TV show was an overhyped fad with only a few funny sketches and lots of unnecessary pain the amount of fun I had at this movie has made me realize that having no boundaries is the best environment for these guys to work in. It's a lot of fun and should be a great comedic fix until the Borat movie comes out. With this movie you may think you know what you're getting but these guys are a few steps ahead of you  I guarantee you'll be surprised by the 3rd sketch. So enjoy and don't worry you won't want to perform almost any of their stuff at home.".

	schema:reviewBody "Johnny Knoxville has gone insane.In the first Jackass he delighted in practical jokes more so than the physical stuff  his opening car rental gag and the later bit involving an air horn on a golf course were more akin to some type of extreme Candid Camera  but in Jackass Number Two he's really off his rocker.Beginning with a sequence where he is chased through a living room by a bull or later when he rides a rocket a stunt which almost cost him his life due to an unexpected explosion from the side of the rocket and especially when he stands willfully in front of a defense mechanism and takes a spray of pellets to the stomach Knoxville is a madman. In the first film Bam Margera and SteveO  notorious party animals  were the daring ones but you know it's pretty bad when you see Knoxville enticing them to do a stunt.This is essentially a series of stunts pulled off by guys consumed by testosterone constantly trying to oneup each other. It will eventually end in death for one of the cast members  in Jackass 2 SteveO nearly loses a leg to a shark Knoxville as aforementioned is nearly impaled with an explosion from a rocket and so on and so forth. Jackass 3 has already been confirmed owing to the success of 2 and frankly I can't imagine any stunt outperforming the bull run in the opening scene of this film  that's incredible footage. It's almost unbelievable and I wondered whether it had been faked but apparently it was 100 genuine. Which is actually kind of frightening. And in terms of extremes Jackass 2 far outdoes its predecessor  it also feels more cinematic than the first film with less of the cheesy titles preceding stunts that were made famous on the original MTV television show.Unfortunately the boys were given too much freedom here and a good number of the gags are simply lame exercises in crudity  I can enjoy the occasional poop gag but watching a man relieve himself on a miniature toilet or see SteveO take beer up the butt yes honestly gets grating after a while. Even the frat boys in the screening I attended  who were enthusiastic when Wee Man took a playing card up the rear and got zapped by a rigged chair  were disgusted by some of the scenes in this film. It's not a matter of getting away with as much as possible  it's a matter of saying Is this even entertaining or funny? Many times sadly it really isn't.But for every lame stunt involving fecal matter and farting on people's faces there are some brilliant hiddencamera bits. Wacky director Spike Jonze Adaptation dresses up as an old woman and hits the streets naked with sagging breasts and no shame. And my personal favorite skit involved Knoxville as an irresponsible old man out for lunch with his grandson letting him drink alcohol and smoke and swear and insult people. That's classic comedy taken to new extremes with the liberties of an Rrating. It's a shame they had to ruin all the great stuff  including a final segment involving an elaborate terrorist prank  with poop jokes along the way.Still there's enough sheer spirit and craziness in this film to merit a viewing and it's really taken the concept of extremity in cinema to new heights.".

In the first film Bam Margera and SteveO  notorious party animals  were the daring ones but you know it's pretty bad when you see Knoxville enticing them to do a stunt.This is essentially a series of stunts pulled off by guys consumed by testosterone constantly trying to oneup each other. It will eventually end in death for one of the cast members  in Jackass 2 SteveO nearly loses a leg to a shark Knoxville as aforementioned is nearly impaled with an explosion from a rocket and so on and so forth. Jackass 3 has already been confirmed owing to the success of 2 and frankly I can't imagine any stunt outperforming the bull run in the opening scene of this film  that's incredible footage. It's almost unbelievable and I wondered whether it had been faked but apparently it was 100 genuine. Which is actually kind of frightening. And in terms of extremes Jackass 2 far outdoes its predecessor  it also feels more cinematic than the first film with less of the cheesy titles preceding stunts that were made famous on the original MTV television show.Unfortunately the boys were given too much freedom here and a good number of the gags are simply lame exercises in crudity  I can enjoy the occasional poop gag but watching a man relieve himself on a miniature toilet or see SteveO take beer up the butt yes honestly gets grating after a while. Even the frat boys in the screening I attended  who were enthusiastic when Wee Man took a playing card up the rear and got zapped by a rigged chair  were disgusted by some of the scenes in this film. It's not a matter of getting away with as much as possible  it's a matter of saying Is this even entertaining or funny? Many times sadly it really isn't.But for every lame stunt involving fecal matter and farting on people's faces there are some brilliant hiddencamera bits. Wacky director Spike Jonze Adaptation dresses up as an old woman and hits the streets naked with sagging breasts and no shame. And my personal favorite skit involved Knoxville as an irresponsible old man out for lunch with his grandson letting him drink alcohol and smoke and swear and insult people. That's classic comedy taken to new extremes with the liberties of an Rrating. It's a shame they had to ruin all the great stuff  including a final segment involving an elaborate terrorist prank  with poop jokes along the way.Still there's enough sheer spirit and craziness in this film to merit a viewing and it's really taken the concept of extremity in cinema to new heights.";

I guess it has to mean more to how much you're fulfilled entertainmentwise by the material. To say that the Jackass boys outdo themselves this time is putting it lightly. Maybe it was around the time that one of them drank horse semen or when one put a leech on his eyeball or when one of them blew farts directly into a another with a space helmet on or when...Nevermind. The point of Jackass Number Two is well there is no point if you're going at it logistically. If anything by logic these guys are out of their bleeping minds. Being fodder for seeingredchargingbulls here and there surrounded by a snake or two I wonder here and there if these guys inadvertently have a death wish in them or at least the instinct. But on the other hand Jackass 2 is at it's best for me in showing how people can actually be liveaction cartoons sometimes very Xrated and crude but cartoons all the same.This was evident for me too already in the first Jackass movie but this time it's almost alltooblatant. What are we to think of Wile E. Coyote's reputation when Johnny Knoxville straps himself to a rocket though this time just for the sake of doing it across a lake not for a roadrunner or in what I thought of as a Beavis  Butthead homage rolling down a long hill inside of a tire? But there are other things that had me laughing very hard at what they were doing. The oldmanlady getups were the best for me as Spike Jonze yes Spike Jonze and Knoxville provided caricatures that are like walking breathing punk'd creations with genitals and breasts all askew. Yet through all the stupidity the insanities and what sometimes just has me going 'huh' the final musical number comes to mind there is at least a good spirit of the oldtime pranksters in them even as they cheat death and get away from it laughing their heads off at each other. Little bits like riding the bicycle with the one big wheel and small little wheel why did people do this or the switcheroo of Bam's father in bed are genuinely clever if still very stupid things to see.Now if you're going into this movie without having seen part 1 it may be a bit naive on your part. It helps to see the first one just to know whether or not this stuff is really for you. Because if you know it is for you Jackass Number Two is probably the picture of the season. If not you may end up either a puking in your seat seriously or b walking out within the first twenty minutes. This is the kind of picture that I who rarely calls for censoring anything could have been warranted a second look for an NC17 rating. On the other hand it'd be wrong of me to say I didn't have a good time for most of the time either even when a gag or joke was weak.".

The creaking bones and pain pill addictions which invariably will come from performing these stunts left me at times shaking my head. At one point in the film Bam Margera turns to the camera and says something about not wanting to do a Jackass Three...as if that wasn't enough....there's a very tired and very drunk Margera at the close of the credits painfully trying to take off his pants while falling into a booby trap set up by the crew. His body wrecked with burn scars and bad tattoos straightens up and he turns to the camera and says This isn't funny anymore. And you know...he's probably right. Yes there are certain moments of comedic genius to be found dressing up as a Bad Grandpa but falling off an oldfashioned bike when you're pushing 35years old is in a way sad. The most horrifying image of the film is a bloated Preston Lacy lying in a pile of garbage cans after doing an unwise slide for the musical number.

I like lowbrow humour. But somehow this seems to lower the bar. The film was truly disgusting with things that I now wish I've never seen. These 'artists' seem to be out to either cripple or kill themselves with their stunts and many of the fecessex 'jokes' of the movie are just so disgusting I can't believe it.I would never want to see this again and I recommend it to no one. If you seem to be compelled to watch this horrorshow that passes for a film do yourself a favour Pick up a book. Enrich your mind rather than fall prey to the stupidity of this crass tasteless exercise in film.";

	schema:reviewBody "Must had cried for a thousand miles. Watching a movie on a 6 screen trapped in a coach seat at 30000 ft high is usually a diversion not a pleasurable entertainment. But strangely enough this simple 3 hankie movie is both engaging and moving.A railway man works at the end of a desolated railway line at the end of his career at the end of his life. Nothing much happens. He does his job at the one man station faithfully. He greets the old familiar commuters with the station name shovels snow off the platform sends the train off with a ritualistic check list. He did this almost all his life with the same mechanical precision. He had a family once. His daughter died at a very young age and more recently his wife died.The lonely widower had a few visitors on New Year Eve. And the news were not feastive.

But strangely enough this simple 3 hankie movie is both engaging and moving.A railway man works at the end of a desolated railway line at the end of his career at the end of his life. Nothing much happens. He does his job at the one man station faithfully. He greets the old familiar commuters with the station name shovels snow off the platform sends the train off with a ritualistic check list. He did this almost all his life with the same mechanical precision. He had a family once. His daughter died at a very young age and more recently his wife died.The lonely widower had a few visitors on New Year Eve. And the news were not feastive.

It's certainly not slow in the sense that there are shots that last for minutes showing someone just meditating. Nothing happening again depends on your perception. In a way there's always something happening throughout the film. Dull? Certainly not and there are many reasons.The story is told in a way that is simple but not simplistic. The main plot for want of a better word fatheranddaughter does not dominate the story and is only sumblimely suggested until close to the end. The main theme the man's total dedication to his job is indeed present throughout but is reflected off and enhanced by many people relationships and events around him. Flashbacks are used effectively. From these various angles and reflections we see the many dimensions of this railroad man who seem to be rather monotonous initially.Ironically the key relationship of this man with his daughter is the most abstract. That it is so deeply moving obscures the fact that he never really knows her as she was dead at infancy. The recreation of the three stages of her wouldbe life is so beautifully done however that the last scene becomes irresistable. A fundamental building block of this relationship is an Asian concept that has no equivalent in the West the concept of loving respecting honouring caring for repaying very poor choice of word but I can't think of another and obeying not necessarily blindlythe parents all embodied in a single word hau. No cheap puns of how? please.There are many other relationships that are equally engaging his wife his lifelong friend people in the small town the orphan whom he cares for. There are funny uplifting as well as poignant moments. Obviiously tears flow free all around in the last scene with his daughter or the ghost of his daughter to be exact. However the scene that really had me choked is another one. This is a telephone conversation he has with his buddy's son who has become a reasonably senior executive in the head office of the railroad company. He is trying to see if there's any way to salvage the scraping of the train service to this remote dwindling mining town but unfortunately there's nothing the young man can do. It's the agonising helplessness of the young man and the railroad man's understanding of the other's helplessness despite his own crashing disappointment that really get me.The cinematography is nothing short of breathtaking. The scenes of the snowcovered dying mining town bring back memories of similar towns in Northern Ontario. The music is wonderful. I seem to remember that the tune his wife is humming along the railway track is Tennessee Waltz.The entire cast is absolutely perfect. When I later saw Black Rain again I realised that Ken Takakura the railroad man played against Michael Douglas in that one. Ryoko Hirosuethe daughter at the last stage got considerable exposure playing opposite Jean Reno in Wasabi 2001. One of her movies that I would highly recommend is Mimitsu or Secret 1999. Without bringing in a spoiler I would just say that her performance in a very challenging role is simply superb.".

It came from young railway men and fellow towns people old alike. The concluding scenes were as moving as any of the others in the film.For train buffs the steam engines are excellent and even the 1 car diesels are good. In my part of Japan the diesels are quite common.Hokkaido is a place where towns are dying and railways are disappearing as the movie alludes to.

	schema:headline " No Diamond Head but excellent Hawaiian panoramas";
	schema:reviewBody "Not many movies have been made that show Hawaii outside of the Honolulu environs. So Diamond Head is a good film just for its panoramas and depiction of ranching and farming on the outer islands. As others have noted the movie doesn't have anything to do with Diamond Head itself. But the title is a colorful beacon for the film much as the crater promontory is a striking backdrop to Waikiki Beach. As others have noted much of the plot is about the racism that existed at the time. The main character King Howland played by Charlton Heston is conflicted over racial differences. He doesn't appear to look down on native Hawaiians or Asians and he comments that the whitesonly club keeps out the people who make the best company. He has a relationship with a Chinese woman Mai Chen played by France Nuyen who seems to be the love of his life and he says so. But he draws the line against interracial marriage in his family. So he won't marry Mai Chen and he can't accept her having a baby. King's deceased wife's sister on the other hand is a hardnosed racist. King raised his much younger sister Sloane played by Yvette Mimieux. She is the catalyst who would bring change into the Howland family by her plans to marry a native Hawaiian whom she has known since childhood. She notes that other mixed marriages take place in Hawaii.Some other factors enter into the plot. King is tabbed to run for one of the first U.S. Senate seats in Hawaii. His mistress Mai Chen becomes pregnant with his baby. How all of this plays out is the substance of the movie. The setting is 1959 and Hawaii has just become the 50th state in the United States. The Howlands own their own island in the Hawaiian chain Lanoalani. They have their own plane to fly to and from their fictitious home. The island is home to a ranch of 250000 acres that appears to produce pineapples sugar cane and cattle. The movie is based on a novel by a Honolulu newspaperman Peter Gilman. But it departs from the book considerably. The screenplay eliminates some major characters who are important in the novel Such Sweet Thunder. So we movie viewers are left without any clear picture of Howland's father wife and halfbrother. We do know that after his parents died King raised his baby sister. He also married and had a son and his wife and son were killed in a tsunami some years before. Since then his sisterinlaw came to live with him to help raise Sloane. With that background I'll leave off comments on how the movie plays out. But I thought movie lovers might be interested in some trivia about Hawaii that relates to the movie plot. The Howland island and ranch are fictitious but Hawaii did have some large ranches in the past. The largest of those the Parker Ranch was established in 1847 on the big island Hawaii. It has 250000 acres and is one of the largest and oldest ranches in the entire U.S. The last of the blood and marriage line of Parker owners died in 1992 and the ranch today is operated by a charitable trust. The Parker ranch mostly produces livestock. While the movie was made and released in 1963 its setting is in 1959. In 1960 the world's largest recorded earthquake struck Chile. The 8.8 or 9.5 temblor created a major tsunami. A 35foot wave struck Hilo Bay on the big island with deadly force. It killed 61 people and destroyed more than 500 homes and businesses in downtown Hilo. The population of Hawaii Island's largest city then was about 25000 and today it's about 45000. Other areas of the islands had much less damage. But Hawaii has a history of many tsunamis. The U.S. Geological Survey lists 50 tsunamis in Hawaii since the early 1800s. Seven of those have caused major damage. The tsunami that took the lives of King's wife and son may have been fictitious. Or the book author may have intended it to be the 1946 tsunami that struck Hawaii. That would have been 13 years before the opening of the movie and seems to fit with King's loss of his family. The 1946 tsunami was the worst of modern history in the islands. An earthquake in the Aleutian Islands triggered it. But unlike the 1960 event for which there was considerable warning the 1946 tsunami struck without warning. It killed 170 people  mostly around Hilo. The bay wave was 30feet high and the maximum wave reached 55 feet at the northern tip of the island.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie was a good one for showing another view point in racism with a wealthy young white heiress who lives in Hawaii getting engaged with a native of the island that she grew up with. Her brother who always thought he was unbiased until it came to his little sister's beau has a big problem with it. Although all along you get the feeling that she's only fond of him after his death she goes on a binge. Not because she's sad but because she's not sad. She states to his brother Dean who she carries a torch for and he also has wanted her for years that his brother must of loved her but all she felt was a blank she doesn't know how to love. She makes him leave her alone but not long after she collapses from drinking an calls out for him. He comes to get her and takes her to his home where they come to terms with there feelings toward each other. Just when another wedding is being planned they fight and don't see each other for months. Until the birth of her brother's baby that he doesn't want when Dean realizes he can't go with out her anymore and comes for her. She apparently comes to realize she could love all along it just had to be the right man and agrees with a kiss. Then her brother King sees and throws a fit telling Dean to take her and riding his horse into the ground. At this point he seems to wake up. And endears himself by going to get his son.There is mention about a incestuous undertone between Sloane and King. There wasn't any sexual tension between them just plain tension. King had go use to her always being is baby sister his pet. He didn't have anyone else in his life didn't want anyone else he just had her. Racism was a big part of his actions selfishness at the forefront. The scene where Sloane is dreaming about skinny dipping reference to an earlier remark made by Dean about the time she jumped into the water buck naked and urged him to join her but he didn't and motioning to Dean to join her and then Dean turns into Paul who runs in and kisses her. When he pulls away he is still Paul and she's smiling but when she opens her eyes he has turned into King and she jerks away in misery and desperation and starts going under the water as if she is drowning. I don't believe this was suppose to be in response to some incestuous feelings that may have existed between the two siblings. It was to point out that King pushed himself into every part of her life. He set out to live up to his name and dominate and rule every part of his life and Sloane couldn't escape him even in her sleep he had become her nightmare never giving her peace. She had feelings of at least a young crush on Dean at an early age and he wanted her as well but from comments he makes later he knew that deep down King was a racist and would not take to the idea of him becoming involved with his sister and it could only cause trouble with the still too young Sloane. She grows up get's with Paul when they are returning from college. She never loved Paul though. Was just attracted to him and the idea of marrying him. King objects to her marrying an island boy. He became violent about is objections Paul is accidentally killed and Sloane is upset because she's not upset. King pushed in between her and Paul and on some level it locked in her mind. King pushes himself into everything in her life even a dream. She can't escape him.I find Dean enthralling and loved the actor's performance. I don't think his upset was because he knew his brother would get trouble from the racial aspect it was because he had feeling for Sloane. I'm sure he was worried for his brother sure. But in a part of his mind he had marked Sloane for himself even though he made up his mind to never have her. It just hit home when he found out about Paul and Sloane. You don't get a time stamp on these events you just know it's been years. He cared about her regardless and when they were thrown together he only put up a slight hesitation before giving in to his feelings. Then of course they both had to be stubborn and fight not talking for months until they were forced into proximity. Which was good in my opinion. Gave Sloane the time to work some stuff out in her mind Dean said there was a war going on in her head and she had to decide who win's and grow up. He realized that what he felt for her was too strong to ignore and he went to get her. I loved his arrogance though it may not have been arrogance maybe he just knew that she would be ready to take his hand if he held it out. He went to get her and it seemed almost a formality to go through the motions of apologizing and declaring his intentions out loud. He even told her You know why I'm here. All he had to do was show up and he did. She wouldn't make the first step so he did. He knew all along it would be that way and she seemed to be waiting. Waiting on herself mostly. She had to be ready. When he took her in his arms and held her tight she seemed happy for perhaps the first time in her life. Like coming home.".

It was to point out that King pushed himself into every part of her life. He set out to live up to his name and dominate and rule every part of his life and Sloane couldn't escape him even in her sleep he had become her nightmare never giving her peace. She had feelings of at least a young crush on Dean at an early age and he wanted her as well but from comments he makes later he knew that deep down King was a racist and would not take to the idea of him becoming involved with his sister and it could only cause trouble with the still too young Sloane. She grows up get's with Paul when they are returning from college. She never loved Paul though. Was just attracted to him and the idea of marrying him. King objects to her marrying an island boy. He became violent about is objections Paul is accidentally killed and Sloane is upset because she's not upset. King pushed in between her and Paul and on some level it locked in her mind. King pushes himself into everything in her life even a dream. She can't escape him.I find Dean enthralling and loved the actor's performance. I don't think his upset was because he knew his brother would get trouble from the racial aspect it was because he had feeling for Sloane. I'm sure he was worried for his brother sure. But in a part of his mind he had marked Sloane for himself even though he made up his mind to never have her. It just hit home when he found out about Paul and Sloane. You don't get a time stamp on these events you just know it's been years. He cared about her regardless and when they were thrown together he only put up a slight hesitation before giving in to his feelings. Then of course they both had to be stubborn and fight not talking for months until they were forced into proximity. Which was good in my opinion. Gave Sloane the time to work some stuff out in her mind Dean said there was a war going on in her head and she had to decide who win's and grow up. He realized that what he felt for her was too strong to ignore and he went to get her. I loved his arrogance though it may not have been arrogance maybe he just knew that she would be ready to take his hand if he held it out. He went to get her and it seemed almost a formality to go through the motions of apologizing and declaring his intentions out loud. He even told her You know why I'm here. All he had to do was show up and he did. She wouldn't make the first step so he did. He knew all along it would be that way and she seemed to be waiting. Waiting on herself mostly. She had to be ready. When he took her in his arms and held her tight she seemed happy for perhaps the first time in her life. Like coming home.";

As we all know several years after Thurmond's death in 2003 at 101 a black woman who was his illegitimate daughter came out with a book about the South's long standing segregationist and Dixiecrat candidate for president in 1948.The film is set in Hawaii in 1959 just upon Hawaii's admission as a state and Charlton Heston comes from a family not unlike the Parkers who still have a ranch on Hawaii's big island that takes a lot acreage there and is the state Ponderosa. Heston's being touted as someone who could be one of their first two US Senators. He's a widower whose wife and son were killed years ago in the famous tidal wave at Hilo and lives at the ranch with his wife's sister Elizabeth Allan and his sister Yvette Mimieux.Having visited Hawaii for a glorious week I can speak to Hawaii's reputation for tolerance but even paradise will have a few racial trolls. Even though he's got a Eurasian mistress France Nuyen of long standing whom he's just put in a family way he objects mightily to the proposed interracial marriage of native Hawaiian James Darren and Mimieux. When his objections become the underlying cause of tragedy Heston's political career is shot to pieces. What might fly in Alabama has no place in Hawaii.During his career Heston also played Thomas Jefferson which came out the same year as Diamond Head. I'm wondering if he didn't channel some of Jefferson into playing 'King' Howland who had a well known backstairs interracial relationship with Sally Hemmings. If Patsy or Polly Jefferson had ever come to father and said they were going to marry some free black man I imagine Jefferson would have reacted the same way as Heston does with Mimieux.Diamond Head is a nice Hawaiian soap opera which could have made some great prime time Dynasty like viewing with a pineapple twist. But it fails utterly in conveying any serious message about racial tolerance. Still you can't shoot a bad looking film on Hawaii and since the cast shot it on location they're all ahead of the game if they got to spend time on the islands. Charlton Heston even got to do it again several years later in The Hawaiians.Besides those I've mentioned look for George Chakiris as Darren's half brother Aline McMahon as their mom and Philip Ahn as a most efficient police inspector. What I liked about what Ahn did with the part is that it could have been played like Charlie Chan and it wasn't.You can never go wrong with a Hawaiian based film. Even the worst films are never bad looking and Diamond Head is far from the worst.".

The actors were lovely men...but looked about as much like they were from mixed ancestry as Shirley Temple! In other words despite a great story idea they cop out and pick the very white actors to play these characters!! What a mistake...and it clearly was a sign of the times in which it was made. Perhaps the producers had a hard time finding mixed actors suitable for the roles...but finding pretty teen heartthrobs seemed inappropriate given the serious plot. My assumption is that the writer probably felt a bit sick about this...but they almost never have any influence on who plays their characters. But I will excuse some of thisfor its day it was rather broadminded. Plus Charlton Heston should be applauded for such a role as he was one of the few white actors who stood along side the Freedom Marchers...so it's pretty obvious that this film meant something to him. After having recently completed BEN HUR and THE BIG COUNTRY he could have chosen any project and chose this. The film is a soapy affair in which a supposedly liberalminded and very powerful Hawaiian man 'King' Howland is horrified when his sister Yvette Mimieux falls in love with a guy of mixed white and Hawaiian blood James Darren. But he's also a complete hypocrite as on the side he has an Asian woman France Nuyen of his own!! And when she become pregnant he refuses to have anything to do with her or the child! Nice guy huh?! What's next? See the film...or not.Overall this is a decent film...though if you're looking for Heston in a better film about Hawaii I prefer THE HAWAIIANS a sequel to HAWAII. The story is interesting and engaging but loses a bit due to the casting and the soapy elements which deter from the film's believability. The worst is some of the dialog particularly some of the drivel given to Mimieux to deliver. Not bad entertainment but that's really about it.".

Throw in a triangle of James Darren Paul brother to George Chakiris Dean and you have a very entertaining movie. Super hot chemistry between Chakiris and Mimieux. Some didn't like the cast. I don't have a problem with it just as long as the acting is good. I even liked the supporting players like France Nyugen as the beautiful but doomed Mai Chen and Philip Ahn as the police inspector. But I have to say the script stank to high heaven. The dialogue was line after line of what I can only think the writer thought was catch phrases. Margaurite Roberts wrote a lot of old westerns. The dialogue would have been perfect for a campy old western but for a modern day setting it was only a distraction from what should have been a very important story line. For instance... My brother knows you were born to the purple but he doesn't know how much you like to wear it. and how can I forget... Look I hit you and I'm sorry. It's been hurting ever since.????? Did she really think this was cool or that real people talk to each other this way. I love the movie but the script? PLEASE!!!!! Maybe this movie could be redone. Anyway script problems and all I still love the movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a big film  the kind of film made from big novels about big ideas about big people like Charlton Heston's character originally written for Clark Gable The King. In fact it reminds me of Edna Ferber's Giant or James Michener's Hawaii. The themes of racism and family strife that motivate the film might have been daring in the early 60s but aren't compelling enough at this point to power the film's entire running length.The big revelation in the film for me was 3rd billed George Chakiris' performance. I never really thought of him as much of an actor but he definitely nailed this role. He's not a man who is unlikable but rather a man who doesn't want to be liked or perhaps who doesn't want to need to be appreciated only respected. At first his pride and resentment seem simply racially motivated and come off as jealousy eventually we begin to see Heston's King the same way Chakiris' character does. James Darren is attractive and serviceable and Heston approaches the role with his usual sincerity and selfsacrifice he's not afraid to gradually turn this respectable powerful man into a heel. Yvette Mimieux has a bit too much of a baby face for the role.... at times it feels like a Gidget movie with her and Darren running around on the beach. But her performance is OK. There's just nothing really compelling or moving about any of these characters. Overblown novelistic dialog doesn't help. The film feels a travelogue with melodrama thrown in like a 20s30s MGM movie with Clark Gable of course! by Victor Fleming or Woody Van Dyke movie but cinematographer turned director Guy Green is no Victor Fleming. There are some awesome compositions but they sort of fly by in the midst of the relatively trite plot directions. The characters take their situations so seriously that one is reminded of Douglas Sirk sans irony.".

On a large screen that alone would have been worth the price of admission. As for that other stuff cast acting directing story dialogue etc. Well this is a soap opera and don't expect too much more except that the plot angles focus on race ethnic relations and class and this gives them a bit more substance than some other soap operas such The Picnic or Portrait in Black. At the time it probably skated the line between being edgy enough to intrigue the audience but not so controversial to be scandalous. Today it comes across as pretty mild although the issues themselves have certainly not disappeared. Nothing and no one is either brilliant or terrible although Philip Ahn's small part is excellent and produces a strong moment. Heston has his huge screen presence but this is not one of his classic roles. There is not enough there for it to possibly become that. Mimieux looks great and her role is as essential as Heston's and is a soap opera archetype. Nuyen also looks great and as usual for her in the 60s melancholy.".

His onenote performance sucks some of the juice out but fortunately this is more of an ensemble piece.This came on late at night and I stayed up because I really wanted to find out what would happen. The story still resonates today. The themes are still around today hypocrisy prejudice stereotypes class etc. But the thing that makes this just a good film and not a great one though is that unfortunate movie habit of the era trying to tie everything up neatly at the end. With all the dramatic events that had gone on prior to the conclusion the last few scenes seem hurried not fleshedout enough. I might not recommend this film as much as the similarlythemed Sayonara but if you have the opportunity to watch it you will be intrigued.

He was from a time when there was no shortage of competent leading men who could look good on the screen AND act.

These are hardly my kind of genre picture  which perhaps explains why I've yet to sit through efforts even as acclaimed as PEYTON PLACE 1957!Incidentally given the title's similarity to another Charlton Heston vehicle which actually preceded this viewing  namely the Western ARROWHEAD 1953  it's no wonder that this isn't a reference to anything in particular and certainly doesn't come up at all in the script! Anyway while the film doesn't have much of a reputation  especially since it came at the height of Heston's epic phase  I found it surprisingly tolerable apart from some impossibly corny dance routines from the locals the narrative is set in Hawaii to which the star would return for the aptlynamed THE HAWAIIANS 1970 which I hopefully also intend to check out in time for this ongoing Heston marathon.Interestingly good ol' Chuck is perhaps at his most unsympathetic here  playing someone who can only be described as selfish pigheaded and a hypocrite! Besides given the actor's controversial latterday political activity and which seems to have received undue attention at the time of his passing it's worth noting that his character in the film is persuaded to run for a place in the Senate because of his influence in the community  but the eventual campaign is botched due to personal scandals having forbidden his kid sister Yvette Mimieux to marry local boy James Darren is implicated in the latter's violent death and himself impregnates Hawaiian France Nuyen!.The cast features a number of current 'stars' whose allure would basically vanish by the end of the decade apart from the aforementioned Mimieux Darren bestremembered for the blockbuster THE GUNS OF NAVARONE 1961 he would go on to play the bewildered protagonist in Jess Franco's eroticcerebral masterpiece VENUS IN FURS 1968 and Nuyen she was often paired with Hollywood leading men in such Asianset romantic dramas there are George Chakiris as Darren's halfbrother who also gets in Heston's hair by falling for Mimieux himself and Elizabeth Allen appearing here as the glamorous sister of Heston's late wife and naturally secretly harboring emotions for him she would later graduate to leading lady for another Hawaiian flick  the John FordJohn Wayne comic romp DONOVAN'S REEF 1963. An important supporting role however is that of veteran Aline MacMahon as the typically indomitable mother figure of Chakiris and Darren's characters.If handled properly such histrionic stuff can be reasonably entertaining especially given their predilection for confrontation scenes this one's well enough done under the circumstances with Darren's untimely demise being handled in a particularly inventive manner but for good measure includes a Freudian dream sequence towards the end! Guy Green was a Brit who after a career as a cinematographer winning an Oscar for David Lean's classic adaptation of GREAT EXPECTATIONS 1946 graduated to directing he seemed to specialize in just this type of slick 'entertainment'  one of these LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA 1962 also with Mimieux is being shown on Cable TV for the nth time this very weekend and which I intend to record  though his work could also go from Oscarworthy 'message pictures' such as THE MARK 1961 and A PATCH OF BLUE 1965 perhaps his most popular effort but which I've yet to watch I do own a recording of it though to the notorious gimmickyyetindecipherable puzzle THE MAGUS 1968".

	schema:headline " Why I defend Street Fighter to this day.";
	schema:reviewBody "Street Fighter is a strange video game movie. The game is an amazing 2D fighter with a wide array of characters from different continents who battle it out for...something.The Movie surprisingly has more plot than you would think. M. Bison Raul Julia in his final performance is now portrayed as a megalomanical super villain who has dreams of causing collapse to the entire world such as killing a large number of hostages unless paid a ransom worthy of Dr. Evil standards creating a breed of super soldiers and kidnapping the Queen of England and create his own world based off of his image. Trust me it is as silly as it sounds.Lt. Guile Jean Claude Van Damme approaches the situation in that he has to save the hostages and hopefully put Bison on ice once and for all thus stopping his plans for world domination.From there on in the movie is basically an almost two hour fan service with various subplots with almost all the characters from the Street Fighter universe. Zangief and Dee Jay work for M. Bison as Muscle and Computer Technician respectively. ChunLi Balrog and E. Honda are all out for get revenge and Ken and Ryu are professional fighters hoping to score a battle against the vain Vega and evil Sagat.Like I said the rest of the movie is nothing short of fan service since all the actors deliver some truly awful one liners aside Van Damme's Guile almost sounds like Tommy Wiseau The Room when you close your eyes and the whole plot itself is actually quite boring.Well why in the world would someone defend this movie then? I'll give you three reasons two are part of the movie and one is a personal thing.1. Raul Julia's M. Bison. A villain who looks rather powerful should be given a great performance. While Raul Julia did die after this movie was over there is no denying that he went out with a bang rather than whimper. His performance is laughably over the top but at no point do you look at his face and see a man who seems to think he's in a movie and as a result he makes the movie quite amazing. If anything he gives us a theatrical villain which for his character works very well.2. There was a lot of room for potential here. Let's be honest writing a movie is easy but writing a good movie is hard. The director Who is also the writer took a fighting video game and crafted a movie out of it and a fairly well done one at that. Sure not in execution but in originality it works.3. It was a movie from my childhood. I was a child of the 90's and as such I can remember my parents letting me watch this at a very young age and it was awesome. Damn the Nostalgia factor but it's what makes this movie really good. I can remember how intimidated I was in the final battle scenes and how cool M. Bison was to me in that over the top Saturday Morning Cartoon style of cool.This movie is a very easy one to attack for just not being good but understand from my point of view even knowing how bad it is having no character development some truly cheesy one liners and awful performances including Van Damme giving a performance that makes him sound like Tommy Wiseau if he smoked cigarettes for ten years and you closed your eyes real tight I still like it.It's cheesy terrible and ridiculous but all you need to know is that Raul Julia delivers some of the best lines for years to come and you know you are dealing with a kind of cult classic when one of the film's greatest lines is This is merely superconductor electromagnetism. Surely you've heard of it. In other words go see this movie if you haven't already.710.".

	schema:reviewBody "Okay so not all of my family agrees on the movie. But I enjoyed it from the first time I saw it on T.V. The two main actors Raul Julia and JeanClaude Van Damme portray their characters well though Kylie Monigue turned me off her character a little. Be in mind that being based on a video game it can not be perfected to follow the games exactly. In general the movie is centred around two forces based in Shadaloo where A.N. Allied Nation hostages are taken by General M. Bison Raul Julia and unless is demands are met he'll kill every single hostage is has. It is up to the U.N. leader military commanding officer Colonel William F. Guile and his army to rescue them. They are joined along the way under unfortunate circumstances by a ninja journalist ChunLi Zang the voice of Mulan her two friends a former sumowrestler E. Honda Peter Navy Tuiasosopo and former boxer Balrog Grand L. Bush as well as two thieves Ryu Hoshi Bryon Mann and Ken Masters Damian Chapa. A good enjoyable movie with some light class actors and a well thought out plot . Okay so not every person in the world will love this but when you want something for a rainy day like it is out here then this is the type of movie I'd recommend. Overall I gave it 1010 because not only is JeanClaude Van Damme one of my favourite actors everyone of his movies entertains me greatly not to mention the awesome fighting scenes. For fans of JeanClaude Van Damme who have not seen many of his movies I recommend that you see The Replicant Timecop and maybe Universal Soldier if you don't mind a little bit of a corny actors based around him.".

	schema:reviewBody "Shortly after the beginning of the disastrous Street Fighter movie we see the words Based on the Capcom game Street Fighter displayed. How ironic then that the movie following is anything but. For a movie that purports to be based on one of the most wellknown arcade games of all time the Street Fighter movie does not so much tell the story of the game as it does rape butcher and mangle it into an unrecognizable form. The Mortal Kombat adaptation while certainly not being a cinematic masterpiece at least stayed relatively faithful to the games.Somewhere along the line in this parade of broken lives and shattered dreams someone decided that the tournamentbased Enter the Dragonlike storyline of the game would never fly with the American moviegoing public. And so it was rewritten becoming a typical American action flick with plenty of huge explosions loud gunfights and thinly veiled rightwing propaganda. A Japanese protagonist? That will never do. Why not cast the Belgian Jean Claude Van Damme as the American Guile and have him become the main character? It's not as if fans of the game are going to mind are they?Street Fighter the movie is a catastrophe. Every character bar none from the games is butchered and rewritten beyond recognition. Chun Li played perhaps the only wellcasted actor in this dreck Ming Na Wen has become a mere reporter with a smirking Balrog and a Hawaiian shirted E.

There are so many incongruities between this movie and the game that it becomes difficult to tell if they are merely the result of the incompetence of the writers or their actual intent. For example were the writers whom I hope are begging for change at bus stop right about now aware that Shadaloo was merely the name of M. Bison's organization and not the name of a fictitious South Asian country? which conveniently rests atop presentday Myanmar? Or were they simply not paying close enough attention to the game's storyline? Who knows?Consider the most egregious example of the screenwriters' disdain for the source material M. Bison walks into his laboratory and addresses one of the scientists there as Doctor Dhalsim. Was Dhalsim a doctor in the game? Do we ever see him fight in this movie? Do we ever see him using his remarkably elastic limbs? The answer to all these questions of course is no. The writer's simply drop in a character named Dhalsim just for the sake of saying they included him. The movie's failing is in its desperation to include every single character to the detriment of the rest of the film. I can only imagine what Akuma would have looked like had the writers decided to include him.Anyone who played through Street Fighter knows that each character had at least one defining personality trait. Ryu was the stoic martial artist seeking to become a true warrior his friend Ken was brash and arrogant Vega was obsessed with beauty Sagat wanted revenge on Ryu for scarring his chest etc. It should come as no surprise that none of these traits appear in any shape form or fashion in this movie and in the rare moment that a character DOES act like their game counterpart it's more often the result some sort of lame contrivance than a scripted personality trait. Chun Li's cameraman Balrog only happens to box. When Ryu and Ken and inducted into M. Bison's army the uniforms they wear just happen to resemble the white and red karate gis they wore in the game. To top it all off M. Bison gives a lengthy explanation of how his magnetic levitation that allows him to perform the movie's equivalent of the Psycho Crusher. It's as if the screenwriters set out to make a completely different movie and were only told halfway through that it was supposed to be a Street Fighter movie.Which brings me to my next point there's little actual street fighting giving fans of the games precious little to chew on through the movie's running length. Whatever fight scenes we get are brief and unexciting and are nothing next to other martial arts movies. Instead we get Jean Claude Van Damme running from scene to scene spewing out pithy oneliner after oneliner gleefully trampling any remaining source material that hasn't already been butchered. Only Raul Julia and Ming Na Wen come through with any dignity left they apparently realized what a turkey this film was and at least tried to have some fun with their roles. Their noble efforts however are sunk by the awful screenplay which should be an example to future filmmakers of how NOT to adapt a video game to the big screen.As an aside note there was actually an arcade game made of this movie.

	onyx:emotionText "Shortly after the beginning of the disastrous Street Fighter movie we see the words Based on the Capcom game Street Fighter displayed. How ironic then that the movie following is anything but. For a movie that purports to be based on one of the most wellknown arcade games of all time the Street Fighter movie does not so much tell the story of the game as it does rape butcher and mangle it into an unrecognizable form. The Mortal Kombat adaptation while certainly not being a cinematic masterpiece at least stayed relatively faithful to the games.Somewhere along the line in this parade of broken lives and shattered dreams someone decided that the tournamentbased Enter the Dragonlike storyline of the game would never fly with the American moviegoing public. And so it was rewritten becoming a typical American action flick with plenty of huge explosions loud gunfights and thinly veiled rightwing propaganda. A Japanese protagonist? That will never do. Why not cast the Belgian Jean Claude Van Damme as the American Guile and have him become the main character? It's not as if fans of the game are going to mind are they?Street Fighter the movie is a catastrophe. Every character bar none from the games is butchered and rewritten beyond recognition.

	schema:reviewBody "I really don't see why most everyone has a problem with this movie. The storyline is solid and is contrary to what most people believe somewhat true to the story. Like it or not Guile and ChunLi are meant to be the main characters in SF2 and the movie reflects this. In the games their endings are directly tied to Bison. Of the remaining 14 characters obviously not counting Bison only one other is Cammy's and that's only because Bison tells her about her amnesia.As for the casting it was very well done. The only problems I sawheard are VanDamme's French accent Dhalsim's casting as a doctor which WAS well done despite being unfaithful to the game T. Hawk's lack of height I think Rainwater is shorter than VanDamme and Chapa's short hair. Otherwise everything else was spoton especially the casting for Bison. Raul Julia is the only person that I think could've done it. He's a fairly versatile actor AND he looks like Bison. A couple other characters were miscasted like Dhalsim but the excellent acting made up for that.The combination of Charlie and Blanka was both acceptable and unacceptable. How? Street Fighter Alpha didn't come out until a year after this film did but both Blanka's and Guile's endings disprove the combination. Getting back to the story it was actually believable for not being based around a tournament like SF2 is. Being forced into a three day timetable by Bison's ransom demands made the movie seem all the more actionpacked to me at least. The scene between Bison and ChunLi in Bison's quarters could've been cut out though except for the part where Bison was about to get his butt kicked by ChunLi. The final battle between Bison and Guile was the most blatantly choreographed yet still exciting thing I had ever seen in a martial arts movie up to that point other than the odd scene from a few Jackie Chan movies.The sound was pretty horrible. Generic rap somehow found its way into the movie in the cage fighting arena scene and I swear I heard it again when I played the godawful SF3 Third Strike. That one should've been permanently shelved. The orchestrated music that made it into the movie was nearly impossible to hear although some of it was vaguely reminiscent of Guile's stage in SF2. The worst part was the lack of music from the game. A symphony orchestra doing all the music from the characters that made it into the movie so no FeiLong or Akuma would've been great. So would have the Amiga CD32 version of Super Turbo if it was out or the arcade version of Super.Many of the characters signature moves are not present. I counted one Hadouken to Vega in the RyuKen vs. VegaSagat fight in Bison's quarters very easy to miss as it's done at pointblank range a few flash kicks minus the special effect and one Psycho Crusher I think that's the name. No Sonic Boom no Shoryuken no anything else.Overall there are a few glaring issues sound and lack of special moves mostly but it's still very enjoyable.710Recommended to Martial arts fans VanDamme fans Street Fighter fansNot Recommended to Street Fighter fans who believe Ryu and Ken are supposed to be the main characters without realizing only three endings out of sixteen people not counting Bison and including Akuma are actually tied to Bison himself.".

I still watch it occasionally and I'm a 19 year old harsh movie critic. Now its obviously no Goodfellas or The Pianist but for kids its a fun movie to watch and is pretty faithful to the games.I still watch it and cannot understand why everyone thinks it is so terrible i only see the massive gunfight between Van Damme and Bisons army as the only terrible part of the movie. Its not oscar material and was never supposed to be.The plot has Bison Julia causing trouble in Shadaloo some fictional pacific rim area I believe. He uses his drug money to fund his army in an attempt to take over the world. Guile Van Damme is a colonel in a fictional version of the UN and is charged with stopping him rescuing some hostages Bison has captured and saving his old buddy. Now its personal.Long story short it obviously lacks in some acting character developement etc. But on the plus side the fight between Ken and Sagat and Vega and Ryu is as good as gold.People may think this movie is terrible but i enjoy it for nostalgic reasons.".

Why is the setting is in a city called Shadaloo? FYI Shadaloo is a criminal organization lead by M. Bison. And the setting should take place around the world! 3. Ryu is suppose to be the main character instead he plays a minor role and along with Ken they're like from the mafia or something. Guile is the main character and plays a major role. What's up with that? 4. Why is Charlie Blanka? Charlie is deadBlanka is young boy named Jimmy. 5. Dhalsim is the master of Yoga why is he a scientist? 6. Sagat is a Muay Thai emperor not a arms dealer. 7. Zangief and Dee Jay are not Shadaloo members they don't have any important roles. 8. Chun Li is suppose to be a Interpol agent E. Honda is a Sumo wrestler and Balrog is a Shadaloo member. They're not reporters! 9. Bison is always getting owned he is suppose to be powerful and psychotic like in the game. This movie almost killed the SF series! I prefer SF2 the animated movie than this. 410 for creativity on the plot NOT rather give it 410".

I was so pumped and excited to finally see this movie. It was almost that feeling that Star Wars geeks get at new Star Wars premiers and then.....the movie started. Ha ha oh man this movie was just so terrible in it's live action format. The characters were poorly embodied by their actors. They weren't dead on either. Doctor Dhalsim? Gimme a break! This movie is just awful. I remember the theater being packed and as the movie kept going I just started to slouch and hide in my seat. I was just embarrassed to be watching this fiasco of a movie. The acting is terrible the plot is terrible everything is a mess. I just couldn't wait for it to end. When it did I just wanted to get the hell out of the theater as soon as possible so that no one I knew would know I just sat through that movie. Avoid this movie at all costs. Mortal Kombat 1 is a far superior movie to this garbage and takes it's approach a lot more serious. Street Fighter doesn't amuse or entertain or even make you laugh it just deserves to get flushed down the toilet. Street Fighter 2 the Animated Movie is a lot better and their characters are identical to those of the video game. No ridiculous flipping kicks by Van Damme either. A 1 out of 10.

Bison Vega dictator of a small nation called Shadaloo. It doesn't help any there's no mention of any tournament and Ryu Street Fighter II's real protagonist is demoted to a glorified cameo along side Ken Masters. Characters like Balrog T. Hawk Blanka and Dhalsim are all after thoughts as well. When you think about how ridiculous just the attempt to portray Blanka think The Incredible Hulk with Lou Ferrigno cheesy was one has to wonder why they made a film at all? For some reason they also attempted to combine Blanka and Charlie from the Street Fighter Alpha series together into one character. If you believe the Wikipedia article about this movie Van Damme and Raul Julia's salaries ate up most of the 35 million budget hard to believe Mr. Spinning Side Kick of Death made 8 million for this crap. Van Damme was also notoriously carrying on an affair during production with costar Kylie Minogue while his thenwife was pregnant. Sadly Raul Julia made his final movie appearance in a throwaway role as M. Bison. Conclusion is that this was a giant greedy cash grab by Capcom. There are some supernatural elements missing like Bison's Psycho Power or Ryu's Hadouken technique which given the aggressive filming schedule the cobbled together screenplay and bad casting choices would've probably looked horrendous in this movie any how. It's a movie to avoid for most unless you are feeling extra nostalgic a first time viewer who isn't bored easily or maybe just a hardcore Street Fighter fan.".

Street Fighter is not meant for kids  it is a JeanClaude Van Damme action movie which to me usually means that it is going to be rubbish. I watched Street Fighter expecting it to be rubbish and I was not disappointed.This movie I just could not take seriously. It was not a comedy and that was what made it worse. The only redeemable character was a tough so stupid that he didn't realise that the bad guy was actually a bad guy. It wasn't funny because it was funny it was funny because it was just so stupid. This movie is one you watch with friends because you just sit there paying out all of the flaws.Some people say Van Damme can't act. Well in this movie whenever he spoke I would wince. If he can't act then this movie proves it. And if he is supposed to be French then what is the accent that he has. The only reason Van Damme draws a crowd is because he is a good fighter but you don't notice this in this movie the fight scenes are rubbish. The bad guy flies around the screen shooting Van Damme with lightning bolts and Van Damme with one kick kills him. And this guy is supposed to be a top notch martial artist. Hey he spends most of the movie fantasising over killing Van Damme and when he does meet him he gets his butt kicked in two seconds. All I can say is that I wish I missed this movie.".

In the course of shooting the film Maria Schneider quit her reasons were that she could not understand and therefor portray the character as was requested by Bunuel. This honesty is to this actress' credit. Then Bunuel took the full logic of the character Conchita as a bifaceted character indeed sometimes cool and calm and serene played by the quietly beautiful Carole Bouquet and on other times sensuous and hot and lustful played by the fiery beauty Angela Molena.Now what can one say about this masterpiece of a film? It is the eternal story of man chasing woman to satisfy his earthly desires and the woman who is sometimes romantic sometimes wild always passionate and selfconscious driving the man mad humiliating him and toying with him then again satisfying his ego and deepest fantasies and even truly loving him. Freud knew it all along. Man and woman are surrounded by inexplicable events absurd surreal strange as life can be. And their game goes on. In the course of the film Bunuel winks and reminds us of his eternal dislikes of the bourgeoisie here in the form of an upper class rich and corrupt diplomat who are genuinely so keen on etiquette and good manners as evidenced by the rat that appears on the main character's dish ! and also the director's dislike of the church establishment and supposedly devout people as evidenced by the hypocrisy of Conchita's mother practically selling her daughter. It's a superb film summarizing the eternal relationship between man and woman amid normal extraordinary events with top class actors under the directorship of Bunuel the genius.".

	schema:reviewBody "I would like to begin by saying that this is one of the most bizarre films that I have ever experienced in my career as a movie buff. I have seen some twist endings some passionately bad French films and even some stalker films but nothing compares to the cinematic genius that I just witnessed. Being a Bunuel 'virgin' I didn't know what to expect coming into this film.I was ready for anything but interestingly enough nothing will prepare you for this film. Deeply rooted in cinematic symbolism we watch as two very interesting devises that are used to bring forth the overall theme of this film. Two devises that I have never seen used in a movie until now.The first is the obvious. Bunuel successfully uses two different actresses to play the same role of Conchita. At first I thought perhaps it was going to be one of those 'twin' doublecross films where these two girls used this older wealthy man for all his money. I was wrong. Similar to the title of this film this is a film about passions and desires. It divulges in the emotion of obsession and the reaction a man can have on someone that he desperately and sexually desires. Mathieu is our possible victim in this story. While both are not the most interesting characters both have flaws and troubles they do provide some structured characters. Mathieu is willing to give up everything for this woman that he hardly knows but is physically attracted to her. It is hard to say that he loves her but he does lust for her. The dual role of Conchita in this film is used for two purposes. The first is as a distraction while the second is emotion. Both Conchitas are different in their own way and are used to push forward the story. Whenever Bunuel needed to convey a different emotion he would bring in the actress that best represented that emotion. At first it was confusing but as the film progressed you began to see less and less separate actresses but instead as one character. It is impressive how Bunuel created this illusion.As I mentioned above there were two devises that I have never seen in a movie before. I explained above about the use of two women for one female role but the second is a bit subtler. I briefly mentioned it above about how these two women one character were used to distract. If you pay attention to the film terrorism is a big part of the universe surrounding Mathieu. While he pines continually for Conchita the world around him is falling apart. Bombings and deaths are at an all time high yet he doesn't really seem to notice this. He is so caught up in Conchita that it seems like nothing else exists. He is oblivious to his surroundings. In fact I would go so far as to say that we are also oblivious to the surroundings. Bunuel does this job of keeping our eye focused on the interchanging women that we sometimes forget or miss the actions surrounding this film. I believe that Bunuel is trying to prove the point that obsession does obscure your vision. It blurs your eyes and forces you to miss crucial elements of your surroundings. It isn't until the end when we are reminded violently of the truth surrounding our characters. I felt that Bunuel was slapping me in the face with that final scene. I had nearly forgotten myself of the terrorism outside but easily he reminded me. This was a spectacular film that really opened my eyes to a completely new way of filmmaking. It reminded me of some of the early works of another favorite director of mine Francois Ozon. Both of these talented artists have their own way of creating a world and an emotion and both do it with some of the most beautiful strokes of their mechanical brush. I would recommend this film to anyone that is willing to experience radical yet provocative filmmaking at its best. You will be impressed.I cannot wait to include this film in my collection to watch over and over again. Thanks to Criterion they have provided a beautiful packaging to this obscure film.Grade  out of ".

	schema:headline " surrealist masterpiece on selfconceit";
	schema:reviewBody "I watched this film with my parents  ended up having an interesting discussion with my mother on it. I'd seen Le Charme discret de la bourgeoisie beforehand which was probably helpful.The translation of the title reads that obscure object of desire which is as relevant a title as could be. It's a surrealist film which is only directly revealed not in the strange dreamsequences Charm employs but rather in a very simple technical element the use of two actresses for a single female lead. The two actresses are interchanged with seeming complete subjectivity. The only easy thread to denote is perhaps that one actress plays the more French side whereas the other plays the more Spanish side  as though the character is meant to be Spanish she grew up partially in Paris. I've read some theorizing that the one of the sides was emotive  the other distracting  which is also plausible.However most of what I want to discuss goes to the core of the meaning of a surreal film. My mom it must be said does not care much for the surrealists. I must admit I never was crazy about Salvador Dali. The problem I think both of us have had to varying degrees is our own base level of empiricism that surreality ignores. Obviously one woman can not be two women in any literal sense. But I think this is where the value of surreality can be appreciated. Surrealism has an ultimate primacy of being able to discriminate completely against insignificant time as I posted on before  even the ability to flaunt insignificant time as significant time. The film itself I feel must be read as symbolic. Neither characters are particularly sympathetic in the sense that neither is particularly human. The male archetype is presented as Mathieu older richer  wanting sex. The female archetype is presented as Conchita which is short for the Spanish name Conception young beautiful virginal but sexually aware. My mom projected literal psychology on both characters as being the opposing parts of a sadomasochistic relationship with Conchita as the sadist. I don't think it's that simple.Conchita continually asserts a nearly narcissistic if not wholly so appreciation of her self  independence. Whenever she feels Mathieu could own her she spites him with her assertions she is physically capable of providing for herself. Mathieu in turn desires Conchita greatly but does not seem to love her. He makes no overtures of marriage  in fact seems very resistant to the idea. Conchita is threatened by her love of Mathieu  the loss of independence it would engender  Mathieu is obsessed with his physical desire for Conchita.Throughout the film Bunuel seems to throw in irrelevant information about terrorism which is only made more silly  surreal by its treatment one of the groups is called Revolutionary Army of the Baby Jesus with a pantheon of other silly acronyms under it  his seemingly repeating this device from Charm. The film I believe depicts what obsessive desires about self do to blind us to the obvious reality around us. In this case Conchita's narcissism  Mattieu's lust make the fact that their world is falling apart seem totally unimportant. Bunuel uses this right up till the final scene.Before I talk about the final scene however I want to establish another subtle surrealist thread through the film. Mathieu carries around a bag through several of the scenes. It is very out of place because it is a cheap rucksack Mathieu is rich and is never given an obvious purpose. It is just a seemingly random rucksack. We find out at the end that this rucksack is filled with lace  lace nightgowns some of which are ripped  bloody. Mathieu  Conchita drop this rucksack off at a shop  Mathieu gestures in amazement how an middleaged woman stitches up a hole in a beautiful bloodstained lace garment shut as if it'd never been ripped.The implication is not difficult to read especially when we see Conchita's reaction which is one of utter disgust. Mathieu is carrying around his past sexual experience  trying to show Conchita that to be deflowered Conchita's virginity is a topic of much conversation does not mean one's delicate feminine beauty is ruined forever. Conchita reacts to this comment by running away from Mathieu. He catches up to her and here is where Bunuel reminds of the outside word they are both blown up in a terrorist bombing. Their explosion is the finale.Bunuel uses surrealism to give a prescriptive ethical message if you are concerned only about your needs you will be destroyed by the outside world which does not concern itself with you. My mom didn't like the idea that this was about gender types because she said it doesn't really apply to any men or women she knows. I feel this is a bit denying but I can admit it's not a literally applied dynamic. It is merely a symbolic message if we took these gender roles to their extremes we would treat each other horribly  have no consideration for the greater good. I admit this is a somewhat simple even didactic message. But I disagree that it doesn't have meaning for reality because it does not represent reality.".

	onyx:emotionText "I watched this film with my parents  ended up having an interesting discussion with my mother on it. I'd seen Le Charme discret de la bourgeoisie beforehand which was probably helpful.The translation of the title reads that obscure object of desire which is as relevant a title as could be. It's a surrealist film which is only directly revealed not in the strange dreamsequences Charm employs but rather in a very simple technical element the use of two actresses for a single female lead. The two actresses are interchanged with seeming complete subjectivity. The only easy thread to denote is perhaps that one actress plays the more French side whereas the other plays the more Spanish side  as though the character is meant to be Spanish she grew up partially in Paris. I've read some theorizing that the one of the sides was emotive  the other distracting  which is also plausible.However most of what I want to discuss goes to the core of the meaning of a surreal film. My mom it must be said does not care much for the surrealists. I must admit I never was crazy about Salvador Dali. The problem I think both of us have had to varying degrees is our own base level of empiricism that surreality ignores. Obviously one woman can not be two women in any literal sense. But I think this is where the value of surreality can be appreciated. Surrealism has an ultimate primacy of being able to discriminate completely against insignificant time as I posted on before  even the ability to flaunt insignificant time as significant time. The film itself I feel must be read as symbolic. Neither characters are particularly sympathetic in the sense that neither is particularly human. The male archetype is presented as Mathieu older richer  wanting sex. The female archetype is presented as Conchita which is short for the Spanish name Conception young beautiful virginal but sexually aware. My mom projected literal psychology on both characters as being the opposing parts of a sadomasochistic relationship with Conchita as the sadist. I don't think it's that simple.Conchita continually asserts a nearly narcissistic if not wholly so appreciation of her self  independence. Whenever she feels Mathieu could own her she spites him with her assertions she is physically capable of providing for herself. Mathieu in turn desires Conchita greatly but does not seem to love her. He makes no overtures of marriage  in fact seems very resistant to the idea. Conchita is threatened by her love of Mathieu  the loss of independence it would engender  Mathieu is obsessed with his physical desire for Conchita.Throughout the film Bunuel seems to throw in irrelevant information about terrorism which is only made more silly  surreal by its treatment one of the groups is called Revolutionary Army of the Baby Jesus with a pantheon of other silly acronyms under it  his seemingly repeating this device from Charm. The film I believe depicts what obsessive desires about self do to blind us to the obvious reality around us. In this case Conchita's narcissism  Mattieu's lust make the fact that their world is falling apart seem totally unimportant. Bunuel uses this right up till the final scene.Before I talk about the final scene however I want to establish another subtle surrealist thread through the film. Mathieu carries around a bag through several of the scenes. It is very out of place because it is a cheap rucksack Mathieu is rich and is never given an obvious purpose. It is just a seemingly random rucksack. We find out at the end that this rucksack is filled with lace  lace nightgowns some of which are ripped  bloody. Mathieu  Conchita drop this rucksack off at a shop  Mathieu gestures in amazement how an middleaged woman stitches up a hole in a beautiful bloodstained lace garment shut as if it'd never been ripped.The implication is not difficult to read especially when we see Conchita's reaction which is one of utter disgust. Mathieu is carrying around his past sexual experience  trying to show Conchita that to be deflowered Conchita's virginity is a topic of much conversation does not mean one's delicate feminine beauty is ruined forever. Conchita reacts to this comment by running away from Mathieu. He catches up to her and here is where Bunuel reminds of the outside word they are both blown up in a terrorist bombing. Their explosion is the finale.Bunuel uses surrealism to give a prescriptive ethical message if you are concerned only about your needs you will be destroyed by the outside world which does not concern itself with you. My mom didn't like the idea that this was about gender types because she said it doesn't really apply to any men or women she knows. I feel this is a bit denying but I can admit it's not a literally applied dynamic. It is merely a symbolic message if we took these gender roles to their extremes we would treat each other horribly  have no consideration for the greater good. I admit this is a somewhat simple even didactic message. But I disagree that it doesn't have meaning for reality because it does not represent reality.";

	schema:reviewBody "Cet obscur objet du dsir or That Obscure Object of Desire marked the final film by Luis Bunuel. It is his cinematographic legacy and can be seen as a reflection of his production. It was totally an unexpected film by Bunuel. He had just made according to himself a trilogy The Milky Way The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie The Phantom of Liberty of films episodic in structure and with no direct plot. That Obscure Object of Desire was much more linear in structure but just as ambiguous and challenging.That Obscure Object of Desire is an astonishing piece of work and could easily be seen as Bunuel's finest film. Like most films by Bunuel this film has a lot to offer and is open for several different interpretations. The film is multidimensional and has got many layers social political and erotic levels. This idea is reinforced by the parallel worlds Bunuel had placed in the film. The new world is the world of Conchita  the world of terrorism Luis Bunuel saw terrorism as the biggest issue of our time and was contemplating questions whether it was justified to kill innocent people to achieve justice. He was thinking about these issues seriously and this contemplating has clearly reflected on That Obscure Object of Desire.Then there's the old world which Don Mathieu represents  the world which is disappearing. Don Mathieu tries to get in touch with the new world but can't and finds himself taking more and more distance to it. I shall depict this a little through an example. The scene where Conchita is having sex actually faking with his 'lover' and let's Don Mathieu watch through the gate. First he stays there then he leaves but after a while comes back. He takes distance to the new world but can't let go of the object of his desire. This idea of two parallel worlds and Mathieu in between of the transition is reinforced by the fact that this film takes place in two different countries  worlds Spain and France. This separation to two worlds is shown to the viewer in multiple images but one quite illustrating one is the picture where first the camera films high skyscrapers  close to heaven but then slowly lands down and reveals cranky shacks on the ground. This theme of dichotomy repeats in the character of Conchita who is played by two actresses. The two different actresses reinforce the emotional charge and elusiveness of Conchita. Carole Bouquet represents the cold frigid side of Conchita and ngela Molina the warm sympathetic side. They represent two contrasts of the character and this highlights the theme of dichotomy. It was common to use one actor to play multiple roles for instance Jean Marais is Cocteau's Beauty and the Beast but to use two actors to play one role was groundbreaking in the history of cinema and it worked incredibly well. This elusive character also represents a very masculine perspective of women volatile and treacherous. But to my mind it has nothing to do with Bunuel's own attitude it just builds up the character and Don Mathieu's Obscure Desire for Conchita obscure because of the elusiveness of the character.The film portrays an artificial world which Bunuel loved to portray as the world of the bourgeoisie. This theme was culminated in one of the most famous scenes in The Discreet Charm of The Bourgeoisie where the characters realize that their life is just an act performed at a stage  their life's fake show only display. That Obscure Object of Desire is told through Mathieu's at times interrupted monologue and at one point one of the fellow passengers takes a clear contact to the camera as he takes a look at us. This contact proves that there is a camera  fiction knows that it is fiction film admits only being a film. The life of the characters is just a movie  just an act.The ending of That Obscure Object of Desire is quite fascinating and left open for interpretation. The film is Bunuel's cinematographic legacy where the circle of his production comes to an end  the music by Wagner in the ending is a reference to Bunuel's first film An Andalusian Dog. There is certain realism in the aesthetics of Bunuel not in the perversions bruises or honest portrayal of violence but in the behavior of the characters and the wounds done by the actions of them. In the films by Bunuel there are many wounds torn but the characters always try to heal them by sewing Belle de Jour Diary of a Chambermaid. In the final scene of That Obscure Object of Desire Don Mathieu and Conchita see a woman sewing a bloody sheet. The woman is sewing the wound of the society healing the wounds done by the characters but also the wound of cinema  torn by Bunuel.After this Don Mathieu and Conchita walk away from the woman and suddenly the entire place explodes. Luis Bunuel adored Fritz Lang's Destiny 1921 and it was one of his very favorite films. It's a film about Death who is tired of misery and agony  Bunuel was incredibly fascinated by this presence of Death and the communication with him. For Bunuel man could only live freely if he let's his life in the hands of coincidence blind chance. But there is one inevitable destiny that awaits us all  death in our bedroom or in the streets dominated by terrorism. The title of the film is obscure elusive and indefinite itself and fits perfectly for this story with no end.".

	schema:headline " Apt title though it does give the movie away";
	schema:reviewBody "spoilersI really wish I hadn't known the title of the movie before seeing it for the first time. The plot is an examination of a walking appetite trying to fulfill itself by subjugating and controlling what it wants.  Buuel brings this to life with Fernando Rey playing an older man who has every need and luxury covered but cares nothing for it if he can't have an enigmatic young woman named Conchita.  Played alternately by an austere beauty Carole Bouquet and an impish vixen Angela Molina Conchita literally morphs away from him every time Rey's character comes close to having sex with her. Until the very end she confounds and frustrates him because she is what he can never have.This is one of those movies that irritate people for several reasons.  As a number of other reviews point out Rey's Mathieu and Conchita are pretty repugnant people.  Simply put the kind of person that expects movies to provide characters who are morally good people to identify with will be as disappointed with Obscure Object as with any Altman or Kubrick film.  It isn't that kind of movie.  The theme is a dark examination of desire asking  is it inseparable from a lust for control?  Mathieu spends most of the movie trying to buy Conchita.  Initially he tries to coax her with food like an animal.  When he learns she's a virgin he tries to buy her off her own mother in a weirdly inverted dowry scene. Once he feels he's got exclusive rights to her in his country house he immediately tries to set her up in his late wife's room  as though she's a new acquisition to replace an old spot left empty.  And finally in the Seville scenes where we see Conchita behind bars several times he tries to set her up as his private stripperwhore.  Conchita feints and rebuffs him at every turn always stringing him along with a promise to love him on a condition he will never be able to meet.  Namely to respect her freedom as a person.But she is the object' in the title and the story is mostly retold by Mathieu himself so it's almost impossible for Conchita to be a human even to the audience.  What anyone can make out by the end is that Conchita is not only coming out ahead in her scam game with Mathieu but that she is locked into a pattern of sadistic control herself.  This quest leads inevitably to a kind of consummation where Mathieu beats the snot out of Conchita.  Buuel films the blows carefully and the scene is uncomfortably long.  Is this the control that Mathieu bought?  As he relates the scene to the people in the train car a wonderful device for the retelling of an amoral story he grins ecstatically as he relates how richly she deserved his attack.  Then just like every other time he's felt like he was getting somewhere with Conchita she turns the tables on him and he finds himself pursuing her.  It seems pretty obvious that violence will continue to escalate and the stakes will be higher the next time Conchita winds Mathieu up.  But before we have to see this Buuel blows them up in a terrorist attack.  Terror and crime exist as background noise during the whole movie. Sometimes seeming to reflect the MathieuConchita plot in news reports and it reinforces the theme of people getting what they desire through violence. A terrorist bomb kills indiscriminately to achieve some desired end and Buuel peppers the film with references to ever more absurd terror groups that could have no rational interest in common.  A mugger by necessity takes what he wants from strangers.  The plot of the movie is almost a literal redistribution of Mathieu's abundant wealth to the squalid Paris suburbs that Conchita lives in and the young drifters she travels with through her elaborate scheme.  And the ultimate act of terror is Mathieu finally getting his hands on the protean woman he's been chasing and beating her into submission.  Well that's the penultimate act anyway before they too are consumed in some other person's desire for something that probably had nothing to do with them.It's a masterpiece.  As questionable morally in its intelligent use of stereotypes as Vertigo.".

	schema:reviewBody "That Obscure Object Of Desire is one of the most influential films I have ever seen! I remember liking it very much when I watched it for the first time long ago but a few days ago I decided to watch it again and found myself completely absorbed in its magnificence and the splendour of suggestive details Bunuel entered into the film. Having two actresses playing the role of Conchita represent two separate moods and even personalities of hers. It is even stressed by the fact that one of them exits the room with one particular hairstyle and enters again with her hair made in a different way. The first Conchita is Frenchlooking shy subtle and demure always with her head bend down in an obedient servantlike manner whereas the other Conchita looks a lot more like a Spaniard with big beautiful eyes and slightly curly hair moody and demanding the dominant side of her personality. There are two more let's say surreal details present throughout the film one of them being the package Mathieu lefts behind at the beginning of the film which appears to be the same as the one out of which the girl in the shop window takes the bloodstained veil and which supposedly contains a bomb that goes off at the very end the other detail being the constant terrorist attacks whether shown directly or by means of radio or newspapers announcements. Apart from the possibility that Conchita herself might belong to a group of terrorists as her friendship with guys who at one point rob Mathieu suggests there is also another point of view considering the relationship between Mathieu and Conchita full of hatred loveattractionrepulsion tension as some kind of a psychological bomb that would eventually explode. As I was watching this film I thought it obvious that Conchita doesn't love or even respect Mathieu and that he's been trying not only to take his money but also to utterly destroy him as some kind of a temptress. However having seen that after gaining the property over the house in Spain as a present from Mathieu and after ditching him in an abrupt manner she still seeks him and torments him I realised that not only he cannot live without her but she as well possesses some kind of peculiar attachment to him may it only be to humiliate him or being humiliated or even beaten by him. Therefore I think there are no grounds upon which the theories that she is only after his money and nothing else might be based. This film conveys the everpresent motif of dualism of human nature the motif that stretches back to The Picture Of Dorian Gray or Dr.Jekyll and Mr.Hyde etc. It is also about human obsession with the possibly the only thing they cannot possess representing one's own Holy Grail in this case the disputable virginity of the main female character. The film does not tell the viewers all men are swine who only want to physically possess women and nothing else nor does it tell all women are devils in disguise who trick men into their spider web playing the card of innocence and virginity. It simply tells the story of humanity bound to its needs fantasies and above all frustrations about things beyond their reach. The sick love?! story of mutual torment and humiliation but also of mutual need and dependence upon one another where the roles of who is the tormentor and who the tormented are not always as clear as they seem.".

This film conveys the everpresent motif of dualism of human nature the motif that stretches back to The Picture Of Dorian Gray or Dr.Jekyll and Mr.Hyde etc. It is also about human obsession with the possibly the only thing they cannot possess representing one's own Holy Grail in this case the disputable virginity of the main female character. The film does not tell the viewers all men are swine who only want to physically possess women and nothing else nor does it tell all women are devils in disguise who trick men into their spider web playing the card of innocence and virginity. It simply tells the story of humanity bound to its needs fantasies and above all frustrations about things beyond their reach. The sick love?! story of mutual torment and humiliation but also of mutual need and dependence upon one another where the roles of who is the tormentor and who the tormented are not always as clear as they seem.";

In Luis Bunuel's autobiography My Last Sigh A fantastic book still in print the director discusses the reason for this unique directorial device and how funny he finds it that so many fans assume that the choices were based on the actresses temperment or his desire to express something obscure. In truth two actresses were used simply because the lead actress quit partway through production after having completed many critical scenes. Luis was beside himself over the wasted time and money in reshooting so he hired a replacement to shoot only the missing scenes and edited them irregardless of who was acting in a given scene. It served him well as the end result was brilliant.".

The director described his film as a story of impossibility to own a woman's body. Luis Buuel claims that there were neither a reason nor an explanation for using two actresses for the same role he just felt that it would be right I don't know why it should be two. It was automatic from the DVD interview. When asked what the obscure object of desire is Buunuel answered I don't know. I think it is the best answer.

	schema:reviewBody "Luis Buuel is still concerned with chastity and sexual morality.  In 'obscur' he concludes a trinity in my opinion after 'fantme' and 'discret' and his career as a director.  These three films represent roughly the films he made in bw 'fantme' represents the surrealism and random dreams of his first films 'discret' represents his critical anticlericism and antibourgeois denouncement and 'cet obscur objet du dsir' represents a number of films in which Buuel expresses his concerns about sexual morality Tristana Belle de jour Journal d'une femme de chambre.  The great Fernando Rey French Connection Tristana Viridiana Campanadas a medianoche and the great cinematographer Edmond Richard Campanadas a medianoche '65 le Procs '63 Fantme libert '74 Charme discret '72 complement Buuel's intriguing techniques.  Even the cover of the video a stitched mouth complements the preceding two a statue of liberty with a limp torch a mouth with two legs and a hat. Unfortunately 'obscur' is not as startling and inventive as many of Buuel's other films it's not one of his best but still very worthy.A man Fernando Rey step in a train throws a bucket of water over a woman and tells his surrounding passengers a professor in psychology a judge a child and her mother who inquire because they're eager to hear the sordid details about how he met Conchita former maid Carola Bouquetngela Molina and tried to win her by paying her's and her mother's bills.  This bourgeois man thinks he can buy her love and her mother's help like buying furniture or like trapping a mouse with a mousetrap.  Those are the premises for a moralistic but incredibly subtle story not a farce about subversiveness.  There is no music in the film apart from the end scene and some flamenco source music.  I do appreciate a film that doesn't need music to emphasize emotions.  That was one of Buuel's many virtues.The mysterious actress Muni appears several times.  But really strange are the two actresses playing the same woman.  They probably represent the two Conchitas one rational and very careful not to get trapped wearing an iron maiden and a white handbag the other with temperament attracted to Mathieu but devious and deceitful with a black handbag just one second after carrying the white one.  In Mathieu's mind Conchita was a hypocrit Rey 'You will appreciate that she deserved the chastisement'.  Or is it only the same woman in the mind of Mathieu?  Are the two Conchitas representing Mathieu's constantly changing mind?  Or did something happen to one of the actresses on the set so that Buuel had to finish shooting with another actress?   Later that day Conchita carries a brown handbag after having thrown a bucket of water over Mathieu she must have made some message clear to him uniting the former two handbags in one ? and uniting the two Conchitas in one? Their relationship explodes eventually.  I'm wondering how that emerged from the novel by Pierre Lous writer of 'La femme et le pantin' 1958.810".

Recounted in flashback  it deals with the romantic perils of Mathieu Fernando Rey was actually dubbed by Michel Piccoli  a wealthy Spanish old man who obtains a gorgeous 19yearold girlfriend called Conchita changing physical identities  Angela Molina and Carole Bouquet  but Maria Schneider walked off the picture in protest at the amount of nude scenes  daughter of a poor woman Maria Asquerino . But Conchita refuses to sleep with him . Buuel's masterpiece filled with drama  surrealism  romance  terrorism  and colorful as well as absurd images . Surrealism and sour portrait upon higher classes  an extreme sexual obsession of an elderly man on a very young woman and their subsequent sexual rites by the Spanish maestro of surrealism  the great Luis Buuel . That Obscure Object of Desire also titled Cet Obscur object Du Dsir or Ese Oscuro Objeto Del Deseo is available with subtitles or dubbed and contains a lot of surrealist images  such as the sack scenes  when a gypsy carries a hog  babyalike  and when it appears a woman mending a bloody nightgown  in fact  this was the last scene Luis Bunuel shot as a filmmaker . Luis Buuel was given a strict Jesuit education which sowed the seeds of his obsession with both subversive behavior and religion  and that would preoccupy Buuel for the rest of his career . Interesting and thoughtprovoking screenplay from the same Luis Buuel and Jean Claude Carriere  Buuel's usual screenwriter  and based on the novel La Femme Et Le Pantin  which has been used as the premise for several other movies  including  The Woman and the Puppet 1920 by Reginald Baker with Geraldine Farrar  La Femme Et le Pantin 1929 by Jacques Baroncelli with Conchita Montenegro  The Devil Is a Woman 1935 by Josef Von Stenberg with Marlene Dietrich  Lionel Atwill  Cesar Romero  and La Femme et Le Pantin 1959 by Julien Duvivier with Brigitte Bardot and Antonio Vilar . Very good performance by Fernando Rey as a middleaged French sophisticate person who falls for his former chambermaid . Acceptable acting from two young beautiful actresses  Angela Mlina and Carole Bouquet  the decision to use two players to play Conchita saved the movie from dropping out . Maria Schneider was dismissed from the film  the true reason was her heavy drug use  which caused her to give a lackluster interpretation and caused tremendous friction between her and Buuel . Pretty good support cast gives fine acting  it is mostly formed by nice French actors  such as Julien Bertheau  Milena Vukotic  Andr Weber and Spanish ones  such as Maria Asquerino and David Rocha . In addition  Luis Buuel cameo  as in 'Belle De Jour' and 'Phantom of Liberty' Buuel does another walkon in streets  immediately after Fernando Rey's first scene  as Luis and his chauffeur are blown to bits on their way to the bank  victims of an unexplained terrorist attack .Thid wry and enjoyable motion picture was well photographed by Edmond Richard and being compellingly directed by Luis Buuel who was voted the 14th Greatest Director of all time . This Buuel's strange film belongs to his French second period  in fact  it's plenty of known French actors . As Buuel subsequently emigrated from Mexico to France where filmed other excellent movies . After moving to Paris  at the beginning Buuel did a variety of filmrelated odd jobs  including working as an assistant to director Jean Epstein . With financial help from his mother and creative assistance from Dal he made his first film  this 17minute Un Chien Andalou 1929 and immediately catapulted himself into film history thanks to its disturbing images and surrealist plot . The following year  sponsored by wealthy art patrons he made his first picture  the scabrous witty and violent Age of Gold 1930 which mercilessly attacked the church and the middle classes themes that would preoccupy Buuel for the rest of his career . That career though seemed almost over by the mid1930s as he found work increasingly hard to come by and after the Spanish Civil War  where he made Las Hurdes  as Luis emigrated to the US where he worked for the Museum of Modern Art and as a film dubber for Warner Bros . He subsequently went on his Mexican period he teamed up with producer scar Dancigers and after a couple of unmemorable efforts shot back to international attention with the lacerating study of Mexican street urchins in Los Olvidados 1950 winning him the Best Director award at the Cannes Film Festival. But despite this newfound acclaim Buuel spent much of the next decade working on a variety of ultralowbudget films few of which made much impact outside Spanishspeaking countries  though many of them are well worth seeking out . As he went on filming The Great Madcap  El1952  The brute 1952  Wuthering Heights The Criminal Life of Archibaldo De la Cruz 1955  Death in the garden1956  Nazarin1958  Robinson Crusoe  Fever mounts El Paso59  The exterminator Angel62  Simon of desert1966 and many others . And finally his FrenchSpanish period in collaboration with producer Serge Silberman and writer JeanClaude Carrire with notorious as well as polemic films  such as Viridiana  Diary of a chambermaid 64  the milky way1968  Tristana 70  Belle De Jour The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie 1977  and this his last picture  That Obscure Object of Desire .".

As Buuel subsequently emigrated from Mexico to France where filmed other excellent movies . After moving to Paris  at the beginning Buuel did a variety of filmrelated odd jobs  including working as an assistant to director Jean Epstein . With financial help from his mother and creative assistance from Dal he made his first film  this 17minute Un Chien Andalou 1929 and immediately catapulted himself into film history thanks to its disturbing images and surrealist plot . The following year  sponsored by wealthy art patrons he made his first picture  the scabrous witty and violent Age of Gold 1930 which mercilessly attacked the church and the middle classes themes that would preoccupy Buuel for the rest of his career . That career though seemed almost over by the mid1930s as he found work increasingly hard to come by and after the Spanish Civil War  where he made Las Hurdes  as Luis emigrated to the US where he worked for the Museum of Modern Art and as a film dubber for Warner Bros . He subsequently went on his Mexican period he teamed up with producer scar Dancigers and after a couple of unmemorable efforts shot back to international attention with the lacerating study of Mexican street urchins in Los Olvidados 1950 winning him the Best Director award at the Cannes Film Festival. But despite this newfound acclaim Buuel spent much of the next decade working on a variety of ultralowbudget films few of which made much impact outside Spanishspeaking countries  though many of them are well worth seeking out . As he went on filming The Great Madcap  El1952  The brute 1952  Wuthering Heights The Criminal Life of Archibaldo De la Cruz 1955  Death in the garden1956  Nazarin1958  Robinson Crusoe  Fever mounts El Paso59  The exterminator Angel62  Simon of desert1966 and many others . And finally his FrenchSpanish period in collaboration with producer Serge Silberman and writer JeanClaude Carrire with notorious as well as polemic films  such as Viridiana  Diary of a chambermaid 64  the milky way1968  Tristana 70  Belle De Jour The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie 1977  and this his last picture  That Obscure Object of Desire .";

Conchita is likewise attracted to Mathieu... except it's not clear if she's just using him and leading him along or if she honestly just wants assurance that his feelings are pure. In other words Mathieu is the loving abuser and Conchita is literally the emphasis on the prudeslut dichotomy. AAAnd so you get to watch them for two hours nearly destroy each other in basically one of the best dysfunctional relationships ever put on screen.Lots has been said about the two actresses playing Conchita. It gets to become pretty obvious after a while but at first it is wonderfully surreal the sort of subtle gesture that Bunuel is an expert at doing. However I think it was more daring having only one person then play Mathieuand especially narrate it. Mathieu's duplicitous nature is such that he is the token untrustworthy narrator and yet it's quite clear throughout the movie that he's talking nothing but the absolute truth. This adds another layer of questions to the proceedings is it possible that objectivity and subjectivity have finally merged? Is Conchita's doublenature only what he sees in her or does she actually change face? And then of course there's the sack. It's always nice when something is pointed out onscreen that leads to mystery but that mystery is never stated. It seems in the end that the sack is really the only object that gives meaning to the narrative.PolarisDiB".

Not this. Eventhe fact that none of the characters are likable isn't a turnoff because they are so obviously just symbols. Nobody is supposed to feel sorry for any of them or see themselves or their neighbors in them.so what was intended? I CERTAINLY don't know. The film is too well done for that. Here are guesses from other people The George Dubya view of Brunel The War between the sexes is not just a game. It is just as much a war as the War on terrorism and to come out ahead on either requires waging fullscale war. Sitting back trying to pretend either can be played with kid's gloves leads to annihilation. Hard to believe that is the point but that fits as well or better with the film than some of these other views.The Andrea Dworkin view of Brunel Given that Brunel dwells on chastity and sexual morality ... Is sex rape? Is stealing virginity stealing? Interesting how horrible news is recited while the torn bloody nightgowns are being exhibited but just as the women begins to mend the holes the radio switches to pleasant music. Are we to take it that man's dominance of women even the act of sex equates with terrorism? Again hard to believe that is the point but that fits as well or better with the film than some of these other views.The bigjack2 view of Brunel bigjack2's comment on IMDb is the best review and the most plausible view. Read it. Vote for it. Get it to the top. It isn't far removed from the Bush view in that focus on the analogy between terrorismanarchy and the war between the sexes. I didn't know Brunel but if big jack2 is right that Brunel held Trotskyesque views this is probably the best analysis.Speaking of views at the top how did people find the one form the film buff from Ohio or wherever helpful? He calls this one of the most bizarre films? Are you kidding me? I don't watch that many films. OK I do watch a high ratio of obscure or artsy films but this film doesn't even make it into my top 30 for most bizarre films I've seen. Mr. Filmbuff says Bombings and deaths are at an all time high yet he Mathieu doesn't really seem to notice this. He is oblivious to his surroundings. Are you kidding me? Mathieu is shown reacting to these events with disgust innumerable times. What? He doesn't leave his career and move form Paris to Timbuktu? Is that what makes him oblivious? Mathieu went on with his life in the face of terrorism just as people do today. Mr. Filmbuff says I would go so far as to say that we are also oblivious to the surroundings ... we sometimes forget or miss the actions surrounding this film. Well I think it is obvious you were oblivious since you didn't seem to notice the innumerable times he is shown reacting to these events but please learn to speak for yourself. The film has so many great scenes. Why has nobody mentioned the scene where Mom asks Mathieu So you want to marry her? and at that very moment a mouse gets his neck snapped in a mouse trap in the corner of the room. Great stuff. Along that line what was the point of the fly in Mathieu's drink? And why did the owner of the club refuse to serve Conchita just after she quit but then the next time he practically prostrated himself for her. What change was supposed to have occurred? Was it the point that she was now known to be living with a rich man so she had to be respected?The other underdiscussed method is the makeup of the strangers on the train. A dwarf a judge a mother and her YOUNG daughter. Firstly why does Mathieu tell this story in front of the young girl? Before she is shooed out of the cabin Mathieu has already dived deep into the warofthesexes aspect. And why a dwarf? A dwarf playing a psychology professor who gives private lessons? Huh? This has to be a slur on psychology professors because this professor interrupts repeatedly to make blatantly obvious points and acting smug while doing so. Is the point that most professors are mental midgets? I don't know. And why is the judge the least judgmental of the bunch?Another question what is obscure? Certainly not Mathieu's desire to pound some poontang or steal some snatch. Does obscure refer to virginity? to something Conchita or the terrorist's want? I'd bet on the virginity angle but who knows? I wish I had the time to watch this film about 10x. I'm sure I'd see something new each time.".

After Bunuel and Schneider constantly argued and never saw eye to eye she left the film. It was tossed around by Bunuel and Carriere prior to shooting that it would be comical to use two woman to portray the obscure nature of the character of Conchita.

Either way one wants to believe one cannot argue that it works to mislead and even distract from the elements of the subplotline and the overall story in general.

	schema:reviewBody "What a queer film this is. It appears to be about the hypocrisy and apathy of the middle classes particularly their sexual hypocrisy as expressed through the infatuation of a rich business man of a certain age with a young and beautiful Spanish dancer.The hero Mathieu spends the film time trying to get Conchita into bed and more specifically trying to achieve penetration. Sometimes she seems up for this sometimes she doesn't. In any case there is always a problem when they get down to it much to Mathieu's frustration. This obsesses him to such a degree that he is almost oblivious to the acts of terrorism that are happening all around him. It's not just in the paper on the radio and on the PA in the shopping centre. He's mugged in a park there's a shooting on his doorstep he's held at gunpoint and his car stolen.To Mathieu this matters little compared with his ongoing bedroom antics with Conchita. Conchita is an unpredictable woman. Is she deliberately torturing Mathieu? In the end Mathieu thinks so and things turn violent. Even then they remain somehow bound together.How did this film come to be so critically lauded? Is it simply due to the crude gimmick of having Conchita played by two actresses who switch between and within scenes? Oddly this quirk loses its strangeness as the film progresses and really adds nothing. The two actresses don't portray different sides of the same person there are no fully realised characters in this film as has been suggested. Conchita is as changeable and contradictory regardless of who she is played by. The film in general feels thrown together.It looks and plays like a mix of early silent comedy 70's soft porn and daytime soap  but not in a good way.This is the broadest satire and not particularly insightful or funny. It has surreal touches. Is Bunuel messing with us?".

	schema:reviewBody "Another Surrealist satire from the comic eye of the Surrealist master. This one a work of a 76 year old. However its fresh and alive with a teasing warm attitude that will give it I predict an eternal duration.What are the bourgeois up to this time? Well the lead male Don Mateo is having dinner at a friends as the bourgeois often do when lo and behold a perfectly charming and quite delectable young chambermaid fills his glass with wine the wrong glass silly girl. Don Mateo takes one look at this fetching young wench and the most basic instincts instantly take hold of him. He decides at that moment he must have sexual intercourse with this member of the opposite sex. As the old adage goes it takes two to tango she she answers to Conchita is not ready to dance. Whoa she says and pushes him away. As with many men who understand their class advantages as a given Don Mateo knows that he has something that adorable sweet sexy Conchita badly needs  MONEY!! Conchita is no fool and her mother and the nuns who educated her have warned her about being on her guard with men who have their dastardly way use her as a sexual convenience and then go on to the next young sex conquest She plays her cards close to her chest and while keeping Don Mateo's libido flirtatiously in a state of excited anticipation she leads him on a merry dance. The name of this dance is That Obscure Object of Desire its 103 minutes long and its delightful to watch.The scene where she goes with him to his country house promising to deliver the goods and then climbs into bed wearing a chastity belt had me in hysterics and that's rare for me. The movie is full of teasing surreal jokes and the absurd conventions of the bourgeois conformist lifestyle are magically presented.Bunuel beautifully illustrates the dance metaphor by making Conchita a Flamenco dancer  a dance of passion and love and then surrealistically turns the convention on its head by showing her moonlighting as a nude flamenco dancer to earn some extra cash. Luis Breton would have been proud of you if he had lived to see that scene. Anyway this delightful entertainment goes through umpteen twists and shifts all maniacally clever until the curtain comes down Unlike Hollywood endings both characters retain their integrity no depressing capitulation of will here.What an up this movie is and so intelligent. Don't waste your time watching the same old false story that Hollywood dishes out over and over again  watch this instead you'll love it!".

The previous reviewer says everything so I will just add that if you can find the uncut version there is a scene with Conchita Angela Molina dancing flamenco in the nude that lasts a good few minutes and is not cut like in the Criterion DVD... this full scene adds weight and more strength to the film and brings home the main character's jealousy more. It is the turning point of the film and it is a shame that it was cut not even keeping the uncut version for adults to see. This is the only scene that was cut from the film and when you consider what is in other films it is difficult to understand why I think the main reason was to obtain a younger certificate for the film. If you are a fan of Angela Molina then check out 'The Eyes The Mouth' to see more of her. It was also good to see Carole Bouquet in 'That Obscure..' in her pre James Bond days. All three main characters are superb actors. Oh how I wish I could find the uncut version!..lol If you know where I can obtain a copy of the uncut 107 min duration please email me at paul22paul22.freeserve.co.uk ..enjoy!".

The same can be said about a few characters the director being one. David being another  there's even physical resemblance between the actor and the real David. They both exist in real life the actor playing the porn director also looks like the original and most of his lines have been taken word for word from the documentary where the prototype is being interviewed in GREAT often sickening depth plus filmed in action as he's interviewing a few newboys and prepping them for the next shoot. I'm afraid that unlike everything else he does and says in Mandraghora the scene of his arrest is fiction something Grodecki desperately wants to happen. The rest however is real.Mandragora itself although erratic until a certain point there are also a few lines that sound forced it's as though the writer was trying too hard to condense the point and jam it down our throats eventually becomes coldly honest in the realistic depiction of its characters' degradation and despair. It's also unique in that it doesn't try to explain anything. We never understand the father's insensitive behavior to Marek we don't get a valid reason why the boy runs away from home. Nothing is rationalized like it no doubt would have been if this were mainstream cinema for example The father is a drunk and Marek left home because he was being beaten or sexually molested.The point to this approach is quite clear  that in real life most things can't be explained and others just happen. That there doesn't necessarily need to be a specific profound reason for a child to run get lost and spiral down into Hell. Mandragora doesn't look for such excuses because they're not relevant. What is is that most of the time kids run away for no good reason which doesn't make the consequences any different. For life to slip through a child's fingers really could be this accidental and this easy which is exactly where the tragedy is.Despite its flaws I highly recommend this movie. However you'll get the most accurate idea of the subject matter and Grodecki's perspective if you watch it along with the much better Body Without Soul.".

	schema:reviewBody "Following the short life of runawayturnedrentboy Marek and his new found friend David Mandragora achieves what many other movies skirt corners in their attempts to achieve. An honest noholdsbarred look at exactly what can happen when one bad decision leads to another...and another. This movie is brutal. No horrific scene cut short including images of rape suicide sadism self mutilation etc..

Marek hates school which he sees as merely a path to be a welder like his father. The father and son collide after another crime spree and Marek leaves home for the big city promises of Prague.Once in Prague Marek is observed by the pimp Honza Pavel Skripal who follows Marek knowing that Marek's future in the city is doomed without Honza's 'protection'. Within a day's time Marek's luck with the slot machines dries up and Honza convinces him to be his 'rabbit'  a male prostitute. Marek's first encounter with an American 'john' ends disastrously and the beaten Marek returns to the streets where he encounters a fellow hustler David David Svec. Together they forge an alliance to escape Honza's compound and begin a life of successful prostitution. They are bonded the probability of Marek's actually being gay and physically attracted to David is strong and together they encounter all manner of unseemly characters involved in the underbelly of Prague's male prostitution life.Characters weave in and out of Marek's and David's life each time leaving scars that grow more visible as does the threat of drug problems and AIDS. They eventually consent to embrace the lowest level of making gay porn where the cruel director forces Marek to be sodomized by David. They are raided by the police and Honza reappears as Marek's nemesis. Through a series of druginduced hallucinations and dreams Marek envisions what his future holds and his descent is stamped. Yet at this point Marek's father journeys to Prague in search of his son discovers his life style is terrified and angry and tangentially passes Marek in a critical final scene that is devastatingly sad.This film is dark frank cruel realistic and sweats with the evil of the belly of the beast that is Prague's underworld. Yet the direction is so fine and equally important the acting by Miroslav Caslavka so sensitive that we as the audience are swept into an overwhelming compassion for these unfortunate lads whose seemingly only hope for a better life is one of humiliating degradation. MANDRAGORA is a no holds barred examination of a dark life that maintains a precarious balance between caricature and character development. Yes it is lengthy at 126 minutes in need of editing in areas has faulty subtitles and a strange musical score by Wolfgang Hammerschmid who extrapolates Puccini's 'Nessun dorma' and Bach's 'Erbarme dich' and 'Ruhe sanft' from the St Matthew Passion for heavy effects and very dark cinematography by Vladimr Holomek but despite these sidebar problems they only slightly mar the overall impact of a very important film.Grady Harp".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie seemed really harsh to me. I guess one of the reasons for that is that the main character Marek looks alike a person I used to know  someone I have lost actually  I won't get into many details. There were quite a few moments of this movie which were astonishing with their way of showing the reality out there. Reality which exists but many are not ready to accept this fact.To me Marek is a normal teenaged boy who needs his own space  he is tired to hear from people who think that they know what is best for him. Unfortunately he should have listened to his dad  a person who surely loves him trough somehow the link between them was lost. There is emptiness in the heart of the boy  caused by the missing of his mother  I did not get if she died before or just left them but somehow the fact she was not there was affecting Marek in a way which make me to think that he was more close to her than to his father.I can not blame him for running away  I myself have considered this opportunity several times and even seeing movies like that  seeing that it could be hard to survive couldn't quite affect my troughs that someday I may do it. The differences between me and Marek  he is more brave than me  he took his decision and acted on it. It is another question if his decision was silly or not  The first sexual scene is very disturbing  I felt sorry for the boy. I was watching the screen thinking Now you have to go back  but at the same time realizing that for him this was not an option. The scene at the bar  when he announced for a very first time his new profession is where you see the way he deals with it. I could hardly forget the way he spoke as he approached the American tourist the way he looked him  it seemed oddly professional  I don't really know what term to use to describe it.At the same time we see the other types of characters  the pimps the boys the clients  they are portrayed in greater details. Somehow even their face expression talked about their personality or at least it did to me.I passed trough a very similar place to this bar in which Marek was approached by the pimp for a first time. And you know as I looked into it  it seemed unbelievable how many were the similarities to what was shown in the movie. The only difference  the prostitutes were girls  but nothing more. When school as over I have to pass that places again and 8 pm doesn't seem like the right time to do it  but I have no choice  after seeing the movie it freaks me out a bit.But on to the movie  it is a masterpiece of Wiktor Grodecki there is no doubt in this. I highly recommend that you watch it at least ones. And may be someday you will be able to make the difference for a boy like the ones shown in this movie  to take him out of his own hell he is living it. Even trough it is hard  as the boys seemed doomed to their destiny.".

Although I wasn't expecting Pretty Womanlike pablum I certainly wasn't expecting to have the scenes from and emotions wreaked by this film haunt me for days afterward. Everything from the scene with the teen girl prostitutes everyone has it to the statue scene to the movie scene to the final shots in the train station platform  bathroom as well as the loneliness desperation fear resoluteness madness cocksuredness apathy greed predation depravity futility inescapability and helplessness...This movie reminded me of Dawn Portrait of a teenage runaway and Alexander the other side of Dawn and the companion movie Sarah T. portrait of a teenage alcoholic Yay the movies I remember from childhood... but was much more graphic and brutal. Unfortunately or fortunately depending on your take on it none of the characters seems to learn anything from his or her experiences and thus none are redeemed redeemable in any way.There wasn't a single completely sympathetic character in the whole film although some of the main characters David Marek the father were fairly multidimensional neither all good nor all bad. The father comes close to being a sympathetic character but even his character is flawed I particularly note his insensitivity to his son's pain and his refusal to deal with the child's emotions regarding the absent dead? run away?. Sure his two bathroom scenes are touching but one can only think of the kitchen scene in his home and how he dealt with his son in the flesh rather than as an abstract idea or through a surrogateMarek.Marek and David are tragic products of their society young men of little skill in a depressed economy trading on their one marketable talent their smoothskinned baby faces and other body parts yet they are likewise unsympathetic. Marek is a runaway but from what exactly? Sure his father is cold and insensitive but the home life doesn't come across as completely untenable. His feeling about his dad seems more like typical adolescent reaction to parental insensitivity but certainly not something to resort to such desperate measures over. David's character is probably the most interesting while he is selfseeking he seems to be a friend to Marek in the best way he knows how but still keeps his own needs forefront if they conflict with Marek's best interest oh well. David is the evolution of Marek as Marek is the inevitable evolution of the final boy on the train platform.Some of the characters are caricatures such as Krysa and his family  home Honza the bar patrons in David's hometown and the johns. They are overblown noting particularly Krysa's arrest scene. This does not detract from the film however as the characters are more like amalgamations of characters than truly single persons.I felt incredibly drained after this film part of this was not because of the characters portrayed in the film but rather for the millions of unseen kids worldwide whose story this could be. From the runaways in the Haight and NYC and Seattle and everywhere else to the children boys and girls whose bodies are sold in the sex tour industry from the people who sell their bodies to try to support their families in postcolonial postindustrial capitalist third world nations to those who sell their children to support their other children this is their story in one way or another.The tragedy of this story is that it is true. Maybe not all of it for everyone but it is true.".

But I sat and watched this and I am totally in love. The acting is very good they portray the emotions you would expect from someone in that situation beautifully. I never usually cry at films but the raw desperation in their eyes made me sob several times.There is one reason that this film didn't get full marks from me and it's a totally foolish Angil reason. There isn't enough of David Svec. I immediately fell in love with him and remained so throughout the film. But too much of his screen time involves him beaten and bloody although thinking now I guess that's just what his character's destined for. And he does wear it very well. So yeah maybe it should have full marks... WATCH THIS FILM 3 3".

Thus it seems very realistic even for those not familiar with the topicsituation and some unpleasant scenes seeming exaggerated are apparently not... Prague is considered as one of the finest cities in Europe but we see only some of its beauty. The main venues are railway stations cheap hotels bedroom suburbs... Still some customers and their dwelling places are wealthy and so the misery of the boys is particularly stressed plus the inclusion of AIDS booze and drugs being accustomed to people in porn and escort business. Due to this and the existence of pimps the real workers never become wealthy but contrary to common belief it is not easy money particularly if your sexual orientation is different. The plot however is not smooth and some performances are excessive although the main characters are well elaborated and boldly performed e.g. Marek David Krysa. The ending is distinctive and witty but a bit fictitious to me. True I am sure that circumstances have changed with the appearance of the Internet with less dealings on the streets and bigger awareness of dangers and diseases but still Mandragora can be regarded as a good warning film to both those eager to engage themselves in prostitution and those eager to take on sex trips to economically less countries.".

It's sole purpose is not in my opinion to shock people into saying I must go and do whatever I can to help help those poor boys. If that it's sole purpose there would not be scenes of sex and full frontal nudity there would be careful editing and avoidance of scenes that might upset some viewers. Whilst the storyline portrays under age boys in prostitution those actors that you see nude or engaged in sex are clearly of legal age.The storyline has similarities to Christiane F which was a film about a young teenage girl who also has to resort to selling herself for sex to get money for her increasing drug addiction. I think the sole intention of that film based on the book was to make people aware of the problem of drug addiction allegedly in the former east Germany at that timeIn this film the interests and sex varies from client to client from vanilla to quite extreme the film would lack entertainment value and the viewer would loose interest without that in my opinion.As a gay interest film there some scenes which could be viewed by some as quite erotic one example where the main actor Marek is nude on a rotating pedestal and a game of pool with strip poker like rules.Clearly exploitation of anyone is wrong and I don't condone the storyline to be acceptable but sex murder and crime attracts viewers and sells movies and books. The film is very brave in portraying the subject matter that it does and deserves a watch perhaps more than once.".

In the story of Marek Nedela Miroslav Caslavka the fifteenyearold boy who arrives in the Czech capital and psychically and physically degrades before turning 16 there are no traces of originality or anything that Grodecki did not show us before in the two documentaries with the added value of seeing and hearing the testimonies said by real characters. Here he tells a story by the book as he follows one by one the steps of Marek's degradation since the day he arrives at the Prague station and is approached by a pimp Pavel Skripal who later sells him to a horny old man. It does not take long before we watch typical scenes the transvestite cabaret the rivalry between the little prostitutes entanglements with the police beatings robberies sessions with a pornographer... This time Grodecki who wrote the script with the collaboration of David Svec a teenager who plays Marek's only friend introduced the figure of a father Marek's working class father but his presence provides little more than moments of crying shouting and beatings.The gimmicky and manipulative aesthetic strategy did not change at all by the third round. For Mandragora the director hired the services of German composer Wolfgang Hammerschmid who at the helm of the Munich symphony orchestra provided him with music from start to finish. Grodecki did not cast aside of course the classics or the little rock and roll numbers here and there. In a strict definition of melodrama the music almost does not stop in this alarming drama. Like the two documentaries it has very few moments of silence or exclusive use of the background noise. Like those other two works Mandragora is not without interest but revels in its own sexist moralism and sensationalism.".

	schema:reviewBody "Mandragora is a very rough uncompromising film dealing with runaway teen boys from Prauge that end up selling their bodies to immoral creepy old men that frequently abuse them. This is presented in a brutally honest and realistic fashion. Mandragora is taken from the point of view of our main character Marek. Marek is a lost wayward boy that runs away from home that was very vulnerable and easy prey for the various unsavory characters that hang out at the train station. He ends up working the streets and is exploited and poorly treated from the very beginning. Marek ends up befreinding the slighty more street smart David and together get in a lot of trouble. Things progress from bad to worst as the film goes on. Marek is a sympathetic character and the consciousness of the film. While he may be incredibly naive he truly is not an inherently bad person. While his decisions are horrendous at best he is victimized and brutalized by the human compost that occupies the nefarious underworld of Prauge. Marek is on a downward spiral path of self destruction and this film pulls no punches in its presentation. Mandragora is an extremely depressing film but is very well done in capturing what these lost souls must endure. This may be the bleakest most depressing film I have ever seen. While this absolutely is a strong film it is not one I wish to rewatch and I am no lightweight. This may be the most bleak and hopeless film I have ever watched. I found this to be more disturbing than even Life Is Hot In Cracktown and A Serbian Film. This is truly rough stuff definitely not for the squeamish.".

The monstrous film pornographer is interestingly no less a caricature as a fictional person as he was as himself see Body Without Soul Some of the surface of the present day Czech republic 2005 is etched away so we see what ordinary life is really like and this is actually more interesting than the whole street hustler drama which we've all seen a thousand times.

Admittedly a lot broods in Czech society and a lot is wrong. But there is a healthy and vibrant gay culture in the Czech republic. There is also a healthy celebrated and established gay porn industry which is not dangerous illegal or questionable. Recently Prague gay porn stars passed through London book stores on a world tour !

Slogging through the relentlessly depressing story I have to agree.Blonde boy protagonist leaves his small Czechoslovakian town to become a boy prostitute. Nothing goes right and he winds up a drugaddled AIDSinfected suicide in a matter of days! Like the exploitation films of yore it graphically depicts the Wages of Sin while simultaneously filling the screen with Sin glorious Sin. It's too bad it's such a downer best viewed in 20minute increments.";

Well thank you I must take a deep breath first... Our young hero is not well acted he is too naive um too stupid... Actually I didn't like him and I didn't care for him...

Now that I got that out of the way I have to add that if you're a fan of Peplums or a fan of bizarre movies you must see this one! There are 4 or 5 unforgettable scenes or elements in it that are amazing and it's the reason why I've rated this 7 out of 10.The story concerns Maciste who gets involved with the mole men a civilization which lives under the surface of the earth because the rays from the sun are deadly to them. One night still on the surface of the earth Maciste saves Bangor from the clutches of mole men. The two beefy men become friends and eventually decide to confront the underground enemy by letting themselves be kidnapped by them so they can be grouped with the slave population of the mole men and start up an uprising from within. The enslaved people are forced to work at a bizarre contraption that powers the whole underground civilization which is ruled by an evil but beautiful queen. Maciste and Bangor are made to work at the MASSIVE wheel thing but eventually their presence causes a revolt and the whole underground civilization falls apart.Suffice it to say the story is total nonsense certainly in the way it is presented. It begs more questions than answers. But who really watches these films for the logical stories hmm? Like I said before there are many highlights amidst the cheese. The first highlight is the teaming of Mark Forest and Paul Wynter. They make an impressive beefy duo. The second highlight is that bizarre wheel contraption which has to be seen to be believed. It's actually quite impressive and yet funny in an engineering kind of sense. Who came up with this design? The third highlight is an incredible feat of strength Maciste Bangor and another friend of the two have to endure layers upon layers of heavy slabs are piled on Maciste's shoulders while both of his beefy fiends are sprawled on their backs next to him with swords just above the two and about to stab them with each additional slab as Maciste cannot keep the slabs up much longer. Will Maciste kill his friends? Will he then be crushed by the slabs? The whole thing is jawdropping. Again who came up with this incredible torture idea that would be right at home in HOSTEL? The fourth highlight occurs when Maciste is put on a conveyor belt yes a conveyor belt by an enemy who wants him to be crushed by a rock grinder. Seeing Maciste holdingpushing against the rock grinder directly forcing the slaves to work harder at the wheel is too much for words.And the fifth highlight and it's a dozy is seeing one of the mole man put to death with the rays of the sun. Though not gory or violent in any way this scene would even make some viewers of today uncomfortable nevermind audiences in 1961 when this film was released we see a near naked man spread eagled writhing and moaning loudly as he becomes exposed to the sun. Uniquely overthetop! Remarkably the film still has other highlights like Maciste killing four mole men with one spear ! or when Maciste and Bangor bring down the whole underground civilization with the big wheel or when the Queen discovers she can live in the sun or the additional torture scenes with Maciste and Bangor.Unfortunately there are also some awful scenes such as when Maciste fights an unconvincing gorillamonster or the many night scenes which are clearly shot in the daytime. And the look of the mole men is not really effective or imaginative in any way shape or form.Anyway MOLE MEN VS THE SON OF HERCULES will never be mistaken as great art but even so I would love to see this film and those scenes on the big screen. I'm sure those amazing scenes would be even more impressive.".

They can only operate above ground at night because they dry up and blow away just like The Mole People in the fire of Ishtar in that film.The albinos doing this are ruled by a Queen who doesn't quite have the pasty complexion they do.

Love unto Death is at times a quiet existential drama and a roundly creative magical realist movie and either way treats the audience to a whole new aspect of the ErosThanatos relationship... or perhaps creates a new relationship that of AgapeThanatos.The beginning is like a bizarre surrealist horror movie. A woman desperately runs around the house while a man lays dying in his beddid she kill him or what happened? Soon that tension is dissolved as a doctor arrives and pronounces him dead but from there a newer stranger drama begins the man wakes up and after being dead the woman and man fall in love to actually quite tragic consequences. Meanwhile their friends who are both priests watch on and submit their own debate into the nature of love faith and devotion.Resnais always seems to have some device to make these sorts of narratives work and what's so amazing about his films is that those devices always work. In this case Resnais intercuts the scenes with shots of snow falling to an arousing orchestral score which fades off and bleeds into the subsequent shots that continue the story. Trapped in this elegiac aside periodically the film develops a rhythm not too unlike an epic poem and I got strange flashbacks to Dante's Divine Comedy from this one despite the lack of direct reference within the movie. Resnais is known as a very poetic filmmaker but this extends past just the cinepoem structure to something that forces a degree of introspection in the viewer which has the possibility to bring to surface some odd recollections.

	schema:headline " The Necessity of Remembrance";
	schema:reviewBody "After going through a huge financial failure in 1967 with Je ta'ime je t'aime Resnais rose back in 1977 with Providence. In 1980 he came up with My American Uncle which was quite a financial success and got even an Oscar nomination for Best Writing. Alain Resnais has always been able of creating something completely original and breaking all expectations shaking the way we look at film and creating new rules. He has always been interested in past and memory he sees memory as an instrument of imagination through which one tries to reconstruct one's past. He has been portraying these time travelers who are in between of past and presence Je t'aime je t'aime who keep asking themselves what happened in Hiroshima and Marienbad Algeria and Spain. L'amour  mort wasn't the first time Resnais dealt with memory and oblivion but unlike in his other films he portrayed our attempt to try avoid remembrance and the necessity of it.L'amour  mort is the director's tenth feature and to my mind represents a certain climax in his career. The film requires its viewer to throw oneself into the wonderfully confusing world of the director and accept his unique rules of the game. It's an ambitious unusual and rich film full of clever insightful details that please the viewer at so many levels.Resnais has always made the unexpected. After seeing Providence 1977 and My American Uncle 1980 I was expecting a somewhat similar film. But what I got was something completely different in a good way since I ended up liking L'amour  mort more than the two mentioned before. Unusually for Resnais the film has got a linear storyline Elisabeth and Simon are a couple deeply in love. All they need is each other and their only friends are the priest Jrme and his wife Judith. One day in the first scene Simon dies but resurrects during the same scene. First he doesn't remember anything about his afterlife experience but eventually things start to come up to his mind a river he had to cross sounds and a melody he tries to catch.The film focuses on discussions about life and death between Simon Elizabeth Jrme and Judith. Simon and Elizabeth don't really believe in God but don't care enough to recognize atheism. Judith is somewhere in between and Jrme is as a priest a fundamental Christian who is unable of commenting anything without a bible verse. Alain Resnais is religiously an agnostic. He doesn't claim that he understands the universe but isn't interested in religious riddles. Resnais has said that L'amour  mort isn't a philosophical film which might be quite hard to believe at times. Since the film has got a strong existentialist touch but perhaps Resnais wanted to highlight that this is more of a film about love. Love and death and how they interbreed.In the end Simon decides to commit a suicide because he is unable to live after experiencing something in hereafter he has to get back there. It is absolutely necessary for him to remember it. When Simon has killed himself Elizabeth finds herself in a dead end  she's a prisoner of love. This brings an intriguing perspective on the film is Alain Resnais depicting the paradox of love and freedom? The characters certainly talk about freedom and this brings us back to the existentialism in the film. Certainly the conception of freedom in L'amour  mort is indeterministic we are not guided by fate but our choices are necessary so we aren't free. Elizabeth is still controlled by her emotions her love for Simon from whom she can't let go. Love is Elizabeth's religion and death guides it.".

Imagine our surprise when moments later Simon refreshed and somewhat recuperated appears to her. Fortunately for the couple the doctor made a mistake in his assessment.Alain Resnais' film is from the period where he was involved in more esoteric matters.

The film is told in brief scenes interspersed by blackness what one can interpret as a trip to the beyond among galaxies or a trip during a dark night in the midst of a snow storm.Mr. Resnais was preoccupied by questions about theology that have no easy answers as Simon is told by a couple of Protestant ministers Judith and Jerome. In fact Jerome offers a sarcastic advice to Elisabeth at a low point in her desperation over having lost Simon. What if there is nothing? he asks her. Elisabeth finds out about Judith own involvement with Simon something she did not even suspect.The director brings back the four principals Sabine Azema Pierre Arditi Fanny Ardant and Andre Dussolier together again. Having worked with them in the making of La vie est un roman must have impressed him to include them in his new film.

In the opening scene Pierre Arditi dies in front of his girlfriend Sabine Azema but then miraculously comes back to life as if nothing happened. It changes his outlook on existence and the two go through something of a spiritual journey. Their best friends Fanny Ardent and Andre Dussollier both pastors at their church try to guide them via their religion but they don't quite buy into the Christian views. This film certainly has its interesting points and the acting is very good. The religious and philosophical discussions are a bit flat and certainly not up to Bergman's level. Whatever I could have enjoyed in this film though is absolutely ruined by a horribly annoying editing gimmick the film is comprised of very short vignettes which is fine but when one of these scenes ends the film cuts to a black background with snow or perhaps dandruff floating around in front of it. A pretty image once but these shots last anywhere from ten to thirty seconds and this must happen a hundred times. I would say these snowy shots take up a good 30 minutes of this 90 minute film. To boot they are accompanied by a loud obnoxious dissonant musical score. Resnais might as well have just shouted BRECHT! between each scene. At least it would have been faster!".

Sure it sounds like a pretty typical finding yourself movie but the characters develop the plot into something special. Topher Grace was excellent in this film. I found him very charming and believable and he was sincere in his role. However Dennis Quaid was really wonderful. His character was likable and you found yourself routing for him throughout. His interactions with his family were endearing and his relationship with his daughter Alex Scarlett Johanssen reminded me of my own father. I highly recommend this movie. 45".

	schema:headline " Great Office Depiction";
	schema:reviewBody "Sometimes it takes a real good movie about a particular topic to notice  that there are no real good movies about a particular topic. The  corporate office is one of those topics.  Millions of us commute varied distances five days a week to plop  ourselves in an office or cubicle and work in front of a high powered  computer to collaboratively work towards a corporation's yearly  objectives.   Yet for all the hundreds of millions of us that go through this process  on a daily basis there have been so few movies that have captured the  stresses the backstabbing and the emotional baggage between both  employee and employer.  Hollywood has tried to make light of the office atmosphere with such  tripe fare as 9 to 5 and Two Weeks Notice but the offices that were  generally portrayed were filled with highend furniture fantastic  looking staff in incredibly expensive clothing and bosses that were  either reviled or secretly sexually doted on.   The lack of a realistic depiction of this environment was in the  forefront of my mind when I lined up at the ticket counter for In Good  Company. Written and directed by Chris Weitz American Pie and  starring Dennis Quaid Flight of the Phoenix and Topher Grace Win A  Date With Ted Hamilton I didn't expect much in terms of an office  environment that I could relate to.  To my surprise I was wrong.   In Good Company starts with the takeover of a sports magazine by a  large assetsucking conglomerate. As with any takeover tensions and  rumors run high amongst the staff of the magazine where the advertising  sales have been headed by Dan Foreman Quaid who himself has devoted  23 years to the organization. But with one swoop of the pen the  magazine is purchased and Foreman loses both his position and corner  office to Carter Duryea Grace a 26year old suit that has  aspirations of kicking corporate ass without taking names.   Dan's initial shock over the situation is only overshadowed by his  complete astonishment of working for someone half his age with no  previous advertising sales experience. He has a family to support   kids to put through college and leaving his post at age 51 for moral  issues is not part of the future equation.   On the flip side of the coin there is Carter the young fish out of  water that openly admits to a stranger on an elevator that he has no  idea what he is doing. But it's a chance of a lifetime. An opportunity  to give himself the life he always wanted  fortune fame in the form  of senior recognition and acceptance. With unsure eyes he gains  confidence in a development strategy. A career is born.  But things go downhill for Carter much faster than his new wingman Dan.  His dream Porsche gets smashed before pulling out of the dealer's lot  and his wife leaves him on the same day. Carter decides therefore to  live out of the office until a rhetorical and sarcastic invitation is  offered by Dan to have dinner with his family.  It is during Carters' introduction to the family that the chemistry  between Dan's young daughter Alex Scarlett Johansson and his new boss  sparkles into a brushfire. When the two accidentally meet in the city  weeks later the relationship goes from a youthful infatuation to a  fullblown romance.   And this is where writerdirector Weitz really impressed me. Both  stories that of the uncertainty within the office and the relationship  between Carter and Alex unbeknownst to Dan are so strong and  interesting that you can't put a label on which of the two is actually  the subplot. Weitz is able to both stories and intertwine their  relationships without having one feel like it is simply a crutch for  the other. This may sound easy but think of all the subplots in  movies you've seen this year and how secondary story lines are there  simply to either give an actor a bigger role or to stretch out the  running time without adding value to the end product.   In Good Company has many good points. The acting by the leads is top  rate and the Grace and Johansson paring could end up being the  HanksRyan of the new millennium. These two above average youngsters  took roles that may even have read clich on the script pages and made  interesting vulnerable characters that seemed to grow years during the  films 109 minute running time.   But what I noticed most was the bit characters in the film and how well  Weitz kept them real and founded in real emotion without going over the  top for purposes of an extra laugh or dramatic moment. The office is  filled with characters of different colors and sizes and they react to  the downsizing with expected anxiety. They wonder what they will tell  their wives. They wonder how they will support their families. And they  leave in a fit of rage feeling betrayed and under delusional  impressions that the company will soon learn they have made a mistake.   In Good Company is one of the best office setting films since In The  Company of Men. Big recommendation.".

When the two accidentally meet in the city  weeks later the relationship goes from a youthful infatuation to a  fullblown romance.   And this is where writerdirector Weitz really impressed me. Both  stories that of the uncertainty within the office and the relationship  between Carter and Alex unbeknownst to Dan are so strong and  interesting that you can't put a label on which of the two is actually  the subplot. Weitz is able to both stories and intertwine their  relationships without having one feel like it is simply a crutch for  the other. This may sound easy but think of all the subplots in  movies you've seen this year and how secondary story lines are there  simply to either give an actor a bigger role or to stretch out the  running time without adding value to the end product.   In Good Company has many good points. The acting by the leads is top  rate and the Grace and Johansson paring could end up being the  HanksRyan of the new millennium. These two above average youngsters  took roles that may even have read clich on the script pages and made  interesting vulnerable characters that seemed to grow years during the  films 109 minute running time.   But what I noticed most was the bit characters in the film and how well  Weitz kept them real and founded in real emotion without going over the  top for purposes of an extra laugh or dramatic moment. The office is  filled with characters of different colors and sizes and they react to  the downsizing with expected anxiety. They wonder what they will tell  their wives. They wonder how they will support their families. And they  leave in a fit of rage feeling betrayed and under delusional  impressions that the company will soon learn they have made a mistake.   In Good Company is one of the best office setting films since In The  Company of Men. Big recommendation.";

Weitz continues to show promise as a director although again he struggles with poor pacing even sometimes dragging the story line. Overall this one will surprise as it is not as formulaic as the previews would lead us to believe. Dennis Quaid Far From Heaven The Alamo continues his resurgence into movie stardom with another fine turn this time as a middle aged ad salesman whose world gets rocked personally and professionally all in one day. Topher Grace That 70's Show is the Yin to Quaid's Yang when he is introduced as his halfhisage with no experience boss. Of course it only gets worse for Quaid as his new young boss falls for Quaid's college student daughter Scarlett Johansson Lost in Translation and Girl With a Pearl Earring AND his wife tells him she is pregnant  despite being past all that. Johansson doesn't deliver the nuanced performance of Lost in Translation but Topher Grace will awaken many to his acting ability check him out in Traffic. Philip Baker Hall David Paymer and Marg Helgenberger are all fine in supporting roles and the great Malcom MacDowell is terrific in a brief cameo as a corporate big wig similar to Warren Buffett. Nice little story that provides a few touching moments and a couple of good laughs. This one should have decent box office appeal while providing a Hollywood anomaly by displaying a well adjusted happy family.".

	schema:reviewBody "Directorscriptwriter Paul Weitz was blessed with a top cast for his comedydrama In Good Company. Here's a film that in some ways resembles and is a bit of a genre successor to The Graduate that 1960s iconoclastic gem. Even the new songs complement the story in the same way Simon and Garfunkel's lyrics melded with the story line in The Graduate. Dennis Quaid as Dan Foreman is in his early fifties a contented manager of a sports mag's ad department. His home life seems almost too good to be true. He loves his wife Ann Marg Helgenbergen and gets on well with his two teenage daughters. The older one Alex Scarlett Johansson in another deep and convincing performance has a tennis scholarship to a New York State public university where the tuition isn't exactly sky high. But she wants to transfer to New York University in Greenwich Village to study creative writing where the cost is very very steep.Almost before you can get into your tub of popcorn Dan is struck with multiple whammies. His magazine is taken over by a megacorporate raider Teddy K and a new ad department honcho Carter Duryea Topher Grace only twentysix years young bounces Dan from his executive office while also anointing him as his designated wingman. Earnest inexperienced foppish supercilious and dangerous in that special way the inept invariably are he poses a real threat to Dan's future. And Dan is worried about his future because Ann announces she's having a changeoflife baby.And then Scarlett meets Carter. You need me to tell you what Dan's next midlife crisis will be? In Good Company could have been just a mildly amusing sitcom. The fastpaced acting and the excellence of the cast  especially Quaid and young she's still a teen Johansson  kept me glued to the screen for the whole showing. And I admit to being troubled by the issues underlying and scenes showing peremptory firings. There's some ambiguity here  is that the only way for a prosperous corporation to go? Dan's pain at losing longtime coworkers is deeply etched on his face but is he more sentimental and loyal than realistic? I don't know. From the vantage point of a tenured academic with lifetime employment I found myself dragged into questions that I think Weitz meant to raise. Well he did anyway.Small roles are well performed by David Paymer as one of Dan's subordinates and Selma Blair who briefly shows up in the beginning as Carter's new wife Kimberly. I always enjoy seeing this fine actress but her talent is wasted in brief roles.And Manhattan restaurants where I eat and stores where I shop are all over the wellshot scenes and that always makes me happy.A very good film.910".

A golden opportunity is handed to Carter when his company acquires another mega company resulting in his placement in the recently acquired Sports magazine division. The Sports publication is seen as the jewel of the newly acquired company and even though he has zero experience with selling magazine advertisement Carter is sure he can meet the lofty goals he boss has set.At what should be his greatest moment carter is troubled as his 7month marriage to Kimberly Selma Blair is falling apart largely due to his workaholic nature and his inability ever to stop thinking or talking about work even when he is on vacation.On the other side of the spectrum from Carter is Dan Foreman Dennis Quaid a father of two daughters and devoted family man who has been a salesperson at the magazine for twenty years and until the arrival of Carter head of the department. At 51 Dan is feeling his years as the younger and ambitious Carter seems to be his polar opposite as well as a reminder that his best years may be behind him. Further complicating matters is that Dan's wife Ann Marg Helgenberger is pregnant with their third child at a time when they both thought children were past them.Despite their differences Dan and Carter work with one another despite conflicts over issues ranging the future of the company to planned layoffs of staff personally picked years ago by Dan. One day after inviting himself to dinner at Dan's home Carter meets Dan's college aged daughter Alex Scarlett Johansson who although only 21 catches the eye of Carter. Months later a chance meeting between Alex and the recently divorced Carter gives rise to a friendshipromance between the two that causes Carter to question his life and envy the family life Dan has been able to create and maintain over the years.Naturally Dan would not approve of the relationship between carter and Alex so they must keep this a secret as there is enough tension in the workplace due to the ever changing business dynamics.What follows is a touching funny and at times bittersweet look at life love business and friendship that does a remarkable job of making the characters not only real but sympathetic as for the most part there are no bad people in this story only those who are confused and unsure about life.The strength in the film is mixed well between a good script solid direction by Paul Weitz and solid performances by all the leads. The pacing of the film is perfect as it never seems rushed and does not drag in parts. Even when two characters are having a simple discussion over how to best approach a client the film always holds your interest. It was refreshing to see a movie that did not take the easy way out and try to wrap everything in a pretty bow at the films end but rather like life left new opportunities and directions as possibilities as after all that is what life is.There is also a very good message to the film about what is really important in life and the need to have priorities rather than title and position as the real measure of success is happiness security and love rather than position and material goods.Easily the best film of 2005 and one of the better films in recent memory..55 Gareth Von Kallenbach sknr.net  Syndicated Publications.".

	schema:reviewBody "I caught this gem on a plane and stayed awake because I really just wanted to watch Scarlett Johansson's lips move. As I found myself being drawn into the story I began to wonder why I had never heard of this gem before  now that I see the tag line I get it she is in no way the central character but just a prop  the real characters are her dad played by Dennis Quaid and her dad's boss played by the kid with the funny name. Both characters are quite believable  and they arc around each other wonderfully. The real central character is the kid who is busting his butt to impress himself and his stiff wife who seems to cringe whenever he is in the room. He is annoying and driven  but clearly on a path that doesn't suit him. His silly marketing ideas actually seem to work for the kiddie crowd and he is placed in charge of ad sales for a respected sports magazine  where he displaces the Quaid character who is himself juggling a ton of pressures since his lovely daughter Johansson is going to NYU and his lovely wife is unexpectedly pregnant. He is dealing with his own ageing his daughters' both coming of age his latest confrontation with fatherhood and now a boy boss  who begins looking to him for guidance but also isn't above threatening him if he doesn't play ball.

As I found myself being drawn into the story I began to wonder why I had never heard of this gem before  now that I see the tag line I get it she is in no way the central character but just a prop  the real characters are her dad played by Dennis Quaid and her dad's boss played by the kid with the funny name. Both characters are quite believable  and they arc around each other wonderfully.

He has a well established team of employees beneath him and is very much respected by his peers.Sports America has been bought out by Globecom and with the take over comes some restructuring and some cleaning out.Enter 26 year old Carter Duryea Toper Grace a Globecom employee given the opportunity of a lifetime to work at Sports America cut their costs and increase their revenue.As Carter begins demoting and firing people he leans to Dan for support because he is young and really has no idea what the hell he is going to do. Dan isn't impressed by the young Carter and never fails to point out Carter's obvious flaws and lack of experience.Carter IS trying he just has no direction. When his marriage fails and his wife bails out because she is apparently not getting any attention Carter begins to get quite lonely despite his financial success. He works his new team on weekends and is pretty desperate for attention.Carter happens to weasel his way over to Dan's house one weekend evening for dinner much to Dan's regret. During the visit he gets a chance to talk with Dan's daughter Alex Scarlett Johansson who is about to start college at NYU. A future encounter on a city street starts a secret relationship ship between Carter and Alex.During this time Carter is firing people left and right at the ordering of his Globecom superiors. Poor Dan is losing his whole team not to mention his faith in his career. He puts up with Carter but doesn't really extend his friendship beyond work.In Good Company works on so many levels. Dennis Quaid is awesome as the fatherly and wise Dan Foreman. Toper Grace is establishing himself quite admirably as a fine young actor. He plays Carter with much more honesty than arrogance. Sure Carter is a young inexperienced hot shot but Grace pulls off the character so that you really do sympathize with him and his dilemma.The chemistry between Quaid and Grace is completely believable relatable and intriguing to watch. The supporting cast of characters are all fine actorsbut the two male leads really nail their characters to perfection.For this reviewer In Good Company reflected what I thought of as a metaphor in the lives of older vs. younger in Hollywood as well as in corporate America. It's as if you have your more mature  well established actor Quaid passing the torch of experience to his younger nemesis turned ally Grace. That's just my opinion of how well these two actors played off each other. After all Hollywood is a corporation in itself.I also thought the movie had a fine  honest ending that leaves the viewer very satisfied. It doesn't try to end on a phony syrupy  sappy note like so much other Hollywood tripe these days.Just a fantastic film..........all the way around.".

His character has charm and dignity throughout events that belittle him. His company is reorganized justified by immature corporate cogs spouting buzz words like synergy. His friends are fired and he is demoted yielding his role to a 26 year old corporate phony Carter Duryea played by Topher Grace.The acting performances were pretty good across the board one of the fine points of this film was Carter's development from selfish to selfless. Scarlett Johansson is as sweet as ever. My only complaint was the happy ending was too contrived for an otherwise realistic movie. I would recommend this to almost anyone but particularly to those who work in large companies.".

I didn't like TRANSLATION at all even if Ms Johansson was lovely in it and couldn't understand why it managed to generate the extraordinary buzz that it did.Now here she is in COMPANY and I'm frustrated even more this time because this film was largely ignored when it was released late in 2004. This is a gem of a movie. The situation is largely believable and the characters are full and human. I particularly liked the first hour of the movie where the story struck a wonderful balance between Topher Grace's Carter Duryea and Dennis Quaid's Dan Foreman. Despite their antagonistic positions both are very sympathetic nice trick. A side noteit's REALLY nice to see Dennis Quaid working again especially when he's getting such a great character to play with And yes Scarlett Johansson is WONDERFUL. At times gawky at times graceful she is a wonderful presence in this film. A brief confrontation between Alex and Dan late in the film is utterly convincing.Yes the story meanders a bit but so does life at times. A good movie can get away with it. Yes the ending is too tidy but it's not so bad that it ruins the effect. IN GOOD COMPANY is a very good comedy about men. Works for me.".

	schema:reviewBody "In an era of megamergers and cutthroat business buyouts it is time for a movie that attacks the inhumane practices corporate America endorses. Writerdirector Paul Weitz American Pie About a Boy has answered the call with In Good Company an unusually goodnatured comedy that questions these practices through an enjoyable story.After the buyout of a company 26yearold Carter Duryea Topher Grace becomes the head of ad sales for Sports America magazine. He takes the job from 51yearold Dan Foreman Dennis Quaid who actually worked his way up to the job. Instead of firing him Carter allows Dan to be his wingman to show him the ropes.Dan has been thrown offguard not only by his demotion but also by the news that his wife is pregnant with their third child. Losing his job is not an option so he assists Carter whose goals are to raise revenue and tighten up the staff by firing people.After Carter gets his promotion his wife Selma Blair leaves him because of unavoidable differences. He loses his direction and clings onto his coworkers because he has no one else. Sometimes he's even found sleeping in his office on the couch.After Dan inadvertently invites Carter over for dinner Carter begins to fall for Dan's older daughter Alex Scarlett Johansson. Their romance is kept a secret from Dan but Dan is not stupid and begins to notice something different in both of them. Thankfully the romance is the subplot and not the focus.What is emphasized however is the bond between two men who slowly accept each other. Carter envies Dan's family and life while Dan copes with the fact that his boss is half his age. Somehow they overcome their obstacles while becoming closer.The person to watch in the film is Grace who lays down the best performance of his career. It's hard to imagine that Eric from That 70's Show is actually a good actor but it's true. He's been touted by Hollywood as a young Tom Hanks and this movie is proof.Quaid also does a reliable acting job with traces of the goodguy father figure he played in The Rookie and Frequency. He uses his face to convey his varied emotions and when he cries we feel it.Not only is the film quite good but it is also one of the most accessible movies to come out in years. Grace and Johansson attract the young crowd while Quaid and Marg Helgenberger who plays Quaid's wife attract a more mature audience.That's not to say that everything in the film is perfect. The third act of the film which features a monologue about losing humanity to corporate greed seems like a compromise between Weitz and the studio. In addition the romantic comedy aspect weakens some of the more focused jabs at corporate America.Company is a film that will invigorate your interest in the movies and give you hope for future of comedies. This is good Company indeed.".

This is the basis of this disarming Paul Weitz's comedy based on his own screen play.The changes that are brought into a company when someone that has no apparent qualifications is put in charge is prevalent within the American way of doing business. How many times have we seen these young upstarts derail a corporation because of their inexperience? More than a few!If you haven't seen the film please read no further.Carter Duryea is picked by his mentor in the conglomerate where he is the rising star and the logical choice to be put in charge of the magazine that has been recently acquired by a business tycoon Teddy K. Carter has no clue of what he is in for. Most of the older staff members are canned but Carter is no dummy he keeps the talented Dan Foreman because he can be used. After all Dan is in his early 50s married with a couple of children of college age and in debt.Carter has no life. His wife walks out on him in spite of the big promotion. Right after that he meets Don's older daughter Alex. She wastes no time in getting him into her college dorm room. Dan Foreman has no idea of what's going on right in front of his nose. After all he dislikes Carter and his ways more than anything else in the world. That's why when Dan discovers the two lovers in a trendy Manhattan eatery he goes ballistic.When Carter's guru has a tragic fall after he has served his purpose and has been used by Teddy K. As a result Carter loses his job as well because ultimately Dan is recognized for his own merit rather than for being the yes man that Carter or his superior were. After all Dan is the only one that asks the questions that no one dares to about the conglomerate losing vision on the magazine.This acerbic comedy sheds a life on corporate America like no other one in recent memory. Dennis Quaid plays a brilliant Dan Foreman the older man. Topher Grace is amazing as the young Carter who gives an incredible performance. Scarlett Johansson plays Alex Foreman a young woman without any hangups who enters into an affair with her father's boss.Beware of those ninety day wonders!".

Things get dicey when his daughter begins to see the young upstart as well as each one discovering something unique about their situation overall. Very funny and surprisingly warm screenplay covers all the bases until its seemingly pat final act. Bravo to the fine ensemble especially Johansson whose natural style is a breath of fresh air.".

Topher Grace has played good as always and I think this actor is capable of being a star in the future. He can manage to pull off great roles and in this movie he did.

Seemingly the director writer was trying to do too many things and cover too many aspects of the story. This meant that nothing was really explored fully enough to give an effective overall message or even a cohesive through line to the film.Performances felt honest enough but I was left feeling like it could have been such a great film if the director had only focused telling one storyline instead of halfexploring a number!I really like Scarlett and Topher and Dennis Quaid whilst having made some poor decisions in the past seemed to really relate to his character and I don't want to think that they are idiots.

	schema:reviewBody "With the huge success of Girl With The Dragon Tattoo and later on Prometheus Noomi Rapace has become a well established actress and if you are interested in seeing her in something closer to her home you can check out this movie. Directed by Pl Sletaune Next Door You Really Got Me it has that strange and almost surreal atmosphere almost surreal more like super surreal so besides the Norwegian vibe you have the surreal one too. Two phenomenal leads Noomi Rapace and Kristoffer Joner create a perfect setting for Babycall. While Kristoffer didn't have much transitions to go to Noomi here had the opportunity to take us on a journey to a mind of a single mother and she did it perfectly. We can understand different states of her mind without any words spoken and follow her mental state as the story develops.Anna and her son Anders have just moved into a new apartment after her husband tried to kill Anders. They now live in hiding and await the final court decision about the custody of Anders. Anna afraid for her sons wellbeing is overprotective and is practically glued to Anders. This will be a problem when it's time for him to go back to school and she nervously accepts this only after being chased away from school grounds. Still in fear that her husband will find them she goes to a store and buys a baby monitor. There she will meet Helge a shy salesman troubled by his mothers illness and two of them will become friends. Trouble starts when Anna starts hearing something that sounds like an abuse and brutal beating over the baby monitor. After consulting with Helge she discovers that this is an interference from another baby monitor only 50 meters away. This is the same time when mind will start playing tricks on her making it extremely difficult for her to get to the bottom of this...Babycall is a strange movie and while some might find it a bit slow it is quite rewarding if you watch it 'till the end. It is a different take on the same thrillerhorror subject so popular in Hollywood but it definitely has its flaws. One of the main ones is the sudden turn in mood towards the end of the movie and relatively confusing story with the heavy lifting left to the viewer.Movie recommendations site RabbitReviews.com  Only movies worth watching".

Anna is scared stiff that they will be found and is under heavy watch by a couple of child care workers. She get's the idea of buying a baby call so that her son doesn't have to sleep in her bed only to find that the baby call picks up another troubled child somewhere in the flat. Anna is really on the edge and maybe her imagination is playing her as well!?This psychological thriller goes under your skin in the sympathy for Anna and the other troubled minds in this film. You want her to relax but still understand how difficult it is when you trust no one.Really great play by Rapace. She gets under your skin. The film is slow paced in a couple of periods only to speed up at times just as real life would be in such a situation. The film is not like you think it will be so this is not your standard thriller. I still think I'd like another ending to this though maybe not happy...Well Sletaune can put another great film under his belt. Always worthwhile and interesting to get sucked into his stories.

I loved Dark water and I liked Babycall as well even though it was a i bit more messy and the plot felt a little too constructed.. But its still good.. Noomi Rapage is great in the role of a young mother on the verge of mental breakdown.. As in many new age horror movies we have a mother moving into a suburban ghetto apartment after having troubles with her ex husband abusing their son just like in Dark water.. She hears some strange screams on her baby alarm and the story starts to unfold.. The atmosphere and the puzzle is well made but the plot to easy figure in big terms.. Screenplay and acting is good.. Story a bit too mainstream for my taste but still thrilling at times for sure.. Noomi Rapage does a very good job lots of tension.. The sceneries and the suspense works but I missed a little originality to the story.. But bottom line and enjoyable ride that could have been better with a more simply story.. A little too many threads for it own good.. Still i give it 7 cause its well done and I am a sucker for subttle slow semi horror movies...".

Let me just say before anything that this isn't one of those inyour face thrillers or even particularly fast paced and racy. It's one of those films that have the really dense stories that most people can't guess the end to. 'The Monitor' shows Noomi Repace playing Anna a overprotective paranoid mother coming out of a traumatic experience with her husband. Her primal instinct is to protect her son but there's something unusual going on around her and the disturbed Anna can't quite wrap her finger around it. The acting in this film is extremely natural and its well written. The suspense is worth the final reveal and is quite rewarding to those who patiently sit through the entire film. If you're a fan of storyoriented thrillers this film is worth watching once.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film as part of the Imagine film festival SFfantasyhorror Amsterdam 2012. The festival website labeled it as horror but I rather concur with the mixed horrorthriller label we see on IMDb. We cannot help feeling sympathy with the mother Anna and her son Anders just having moved to a hiding place where her husband resp. his father cannot find them. We are told this is because of prior domestic violence towards the son. It is the main reason for buying and installing a baby monitor in the son's bedroom. Since he is 11 he would not need such supervision in normal circumstances.Apart from that we see what initially looks like a subplot in the form of a flirtation with the salesman Helge in the home electronics shop where the baby monitor is bought. The relationship strengthens later on when Anna hears alarming sounds out of the newly installed device and seeks his advice as it is not coming from Anders' room. Helge explains that the signal can be picked up from a similar device in the neighborhood. Given that Helge is the only one taking her story seriously and Anna feels all alone with her situation it can be no surprise that she asks for his help. And Helge also feeling alone is very eager to offer some assistance.Anna stumbles on a nearby lake where she observes disturbing things happening on the opposite side. What she sees obviously reminds her of her own reasons to run away from her husband. After rushing through the woods to find the place where it happened there are no visible traces of something out of the ordinary. On later occasions Anna completely fails to find the lake again as if it never existed in the first place. We are as confused as Anna is since several landmarks we saw before along the path to the lake are still on their original spot and look undisturbed.All in all though a few scenes could be improved by shortening some parts I saw an entertaining mix of what was real and what only existed in Anna's mind. After a while we think we are sure what's real and what's not given what is presented to us by the scenario writers. Acting is very good so we are easily convinced by what we see.However one of the final scenes shows aforementioned lake again after we saw with our own eyes that Anna could not find it anymore. It unexpectedly confronts us with a completely different view on the matter no details to prevent spoilers. In hindsight I could remember no pointers that we may have been misled by what we had seen on screen. In other words this was really a surprise for me but of course I may have missed some clues. Yet I think this should not happen in a thriller type of film. Some cleverly planted clues with hints that there might be more to it than what we saw certainly would have improved our viewer experience.".

	schema:reviewBody "This disturbing dramathriller is almost like a sequel to Daisy Diamond the Danish shocker from 2007. They both have Noomi Rapace in the leading role and she carries most of the film. She again plays an unstable single mother but this time of a grown boy not a baby girl. And the setting is kinda the same the desolate and tall block apartment complex and the empty lane which she is constantly shown walking. They are meant to symbolize her own loneliness and alienation. And this is a hint to what ultimately is revealed as a great surprise in the end.This is a typical ScandinavianNorth European picture which focuses on the plight of single mothers who have been victims of their husbands' rage and physical abuse. Anna Rapace moves in to a new place the big apartment block after she and her little son have been victimized by her husband. She feels alone and a little afraid in their apartment. She at first makes her son sleep in the same bed as her but as he soon gets tired of it she buys a baby call device and puts it next to his bed so she can sleep assured nothing will happen to him without her hearing it. One night she hears loud screams that sound like they are coming from a boy. She rushes to his son's room but founds him sound asleep and nobody is there. She then goes to the trade center nearby where she got the device and talks with the salesman about it. He tells her that her own baby call must have picked up the signal from another baby call that is somewhere near her. This only makes her more anxious to find out whose baby call that may be and which child that makes such hairraising noise in the middle of night. In the meantime the salesman played by Kristofer Joner a single man who is just as lonely as she develops an affection for her and tries to get closer to her. But it gets even worse for Anna as she has problems sleeping and finds herself waking up at the oddest places and starts to hallucinate of a place which doesn't exist.The acting is very good by the two main actors Rapace and Joner who are both very believable and effective in their roles. Joner looks his part and Rapace looks her part. There is very little satisfaction to find in this film except for the suspense and dramatic performances. And the way it ends doesn't do much to amend that. In other words it is a very dark haunting and bleak picture which is meant to capture life at its cruelest. Almost the whole movie is like one big constant nightmare and there are a few elements of Polanski's apartment trilogy there obviously. The motherchild vs evil father or evil male entity which persecutes them is a familiar motif in such films. And as such the movie doesn't really break any new ground. It is just a passable dark drama something along the lines of Dark Water but there is nothing supernatural about it. I give it a 6. 6".

It looked thrilling and frightening capturing the feeling of paranoia. But this is not by far a horror film. There are no frightening moments in it at all. But it could still be a good thriller right? Well not great but not directly bad either. It's as mediocre as it could get. It had a lot of opportunities to escalate but it never really did at least not the way I wanted it to. A huge problem I have with Norwegian movies is the acting. There is lot of overacting. There is some of that in this one too. Kristoffer Joner is great as he usually is. Noomi Rapace however I think overacted a little bit. At times she was kind of...too dramatic. This goes for many of the other actors too. They are not that believable. But it's not that big a deal. If a movie is good I can look past that.Some times the movie felt more like a drama. Many times that mix can result in something great but they didn't really pull it off here. I felt it slowed down the movie. It became plain boring at times. One thing that struck my mind was how this movie reminded me of the Spanish horrorthriller The Baby's room. I'm not accusing the creators of ripping it off but I couldn't help seeing some similarities between the two. It wouldn't surprise me if it was a little inspired by it but of course it's two whole different plots. It was just some similar elements between the two.Don't let me keep you from watching it. Norwegian movies are often better received outside the country than here in Norway. That's weird but anyway you might like it.".

After finally leaving her abusive husband Anna Repace and her eight year old son are taken to a secret apartment where he won't be able to find them. In order to help her sleep at night she buys a baby monitor to help her know what's going on in her son's room. One night she is awoken by the sounds of screaming coming from the monitor but the sounds aren't from her son's room. She is left to wonder if it's her imagination or if the horror she is hearing is real. I was looking forward to this one for two reasons. It looked pretty creepy and I am becoming a fan of Rapace. Based off my expectations I have to say that I was a little disappointed. The movie was OK but like most foreign movies it tends to drag quite a bit. The movie is very disturbing and really deals with child abuse in a way that most American movies tend to shy away from. I'm not trying to talk you out of watching this but just be prepared that the movie is pretty slow and shows child abuse in a very disturbing fashion. The entire movie does keep you guessing and on edge wondering what is real and what isn't. The ending does make you rethink about everything you saw and catches you by surprise. Overall disturbing but OK. If you think you can handle it then watch it but nothing to rush out and see. I give it a C.".

The film feels like a mix of Dead Man's Shoes and Martha Marcy May Marlene. The former also has an imaginary brother whereas the latter deals with memory and present. While in Martha Marcy May Marlene the transition between imagination and present worked effortlessly in Babycall it felt like a cheat to me. It felt just as a device to keep me confused right up to the end. Mainly because it's just filmed in a very plain way like in Dead Man's shoes. I wish they had more visual ideas for example in Let's talk about Kevin or in Martha.... The ending I found pretty disappointing because it's basically the typical arthouse dramatic curve  namely going downhill. Death is always the easy way out whereas an open ending with two troubled people would have worked better.".

A feeling she got from her own environment. Born in Macau studied English literature in Hong Kong.  Afterwards Film in London and lives with her husband in Australia.What Clara Law tries to explain in her movie is sort of autobiographic it is obvious that she reflects this on the two protagonists.

Fortunately Clara Law knows what she's talking about and her film is a cinematic poem  sad sometimes disturbing but not depressing I have no idea how could someone classify this as a comedy though. She shows much more talent than other contemporary female avantgarde directors such as the overrated Claire Denis Beau Travail or Lynne Ramsay Morvern Callar. The Goddess of 1967 is a vigorous film that deserves to be discovered. My vote is 10.".

On the contrary it has a very powerful story.  The story is therapeutic it deals with abuse incest and obsession with an ending of recognition and reconciliation but not the kind of phony sentimental type that is typical of Hollywood drama.

Although some of the underlying issues that the main characters have gone through are in many respects very serious and macabre I don't think it was the director's intent to make this a depressing movie which dwells on those issues alone. Goddess is an art movie. It's designed to be visually different and controversial for its handling of subject matter. Blindness incest murder dysfunctionality. An unexpected combination of events against the spectacular backdrop of the Australian outback. Ironically the central character is blind and cannot see all this visual beauty directly. But she somehow finds a strength and sensitivity amongst the far from beautiful physical abuse she grown up with. Somehow with this is intertwined an exfashion model from Japan and a cult car. It's an artistic celluloid canvas. I don't think an average director could put all these elements together and come off with a really watchable and intriguing movie. I love the central character's feisty yet carefree independence. Freespirited female viewers will love this. I think most male viewers will miss the subtlety of the movie's intent and will therefore not enjoy it so much. Makes a really refreshing change from your regular Hollywood flick.".

Rose Byrne is brilliant here as B.G. and really shines in the more subtle moments which are the primary driving force for this Clara Law film.The theme of incest abuse and it's lingering affects through generations make for very heavy subject matter that would otherwise threaten to undermine the film's subtle tone  but it's told in flashback here and works surprisingly well. The comparisons of style to Wenders and Jarmusch are apt since it is precisely the more subtle scenes in this film that resonate more as the viewer gets drawn into the lives and past histories of this unlikely couple. Not a perfect film by any means  the loving yet determinist religious mother Marie could have been fleshed out more as well as the male lead  but the real gem here is Rose Byrne.

On the other hand if you are sick of being able to predict the remaining two and a half hours of the contemporary Hollywood mindnumbing production Clara Law has a remedy for you! Moreover if you have ever fallen in love with a car you would be even more delighted to see that there are people like you out there.The first hint of the cinematic joy that THE GODDESS OF 1967 offers is clear from the first 10 minutes of the film.

Those are compassion honesty and true love. There is one wonderful scene where he teaches her to dance in a lonely bar in the middle of nowhere. To see the joy in the face of someone who has in her unfortunate life rarely experienced such feelings is truly uplifting. I had to watch that scene more than once.

Anyway when he arrives he finds the owners dead and ends up on a journey in the car across the outback with a blind Australian girl yeah it's a road movie. It becomes quite dark and twisted after that and I better not say anymore as not to spoil it. It makes great use of flashbacks which are great stand alone stories and interestingly the flashbacks are shot to look 'normal' whereas the the main story has a strange 'dreamy' look. The look of the film reminded me of innovative HK directors like Wong KarWai and his cinematographer Chris Doyle. Clara uses a lot of visual effects and graphics that work well although sometimes look like vague attempts to be experimental and obvious back projection behind the drivers in the car which I thought was great but alot of people might not like. Dion Beebe's cinematography was great the negative was somehow bleached giving a strange look with unnatural glowing colour. Like Floating life the colours are amazing. Sometimes it's a bit too Australian which might actually put Australian's off the film at the same time be appealing to nonAustralians. It's a bit depressing but you'll get over it. It's a journey into the darkside contrasted by the beauty of the Citroen which leads the journey.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Goddess of 1967 is a maddeningly pretentious film that tries too hard to capture the flair and dynamism of newwave filmmaking without the artistry to back it up. The film's first half is almost unbearable but there are some more conventional moments in the latter stages that lend the work some much needed credibility. Clara Law's directing technique is firstyear film school stuff with a lot of unnecessary appendages that do little other than distract and the story is a fairly stale reworking of tired old themes about betrayal revenge and redemption built upon on a narrative of incest and sexual transgression. The Japanese subplot and characters seem tacked on to lend an air of otherness that seems redundant. The failure of the approach is emphasised by the weak script that often times reads likes poor poetry I was reminded of David Brent's Excalibur. Even Rose Byrne's gorgeous face can do little to make this film watchable.".

	onyx:emotionText "The Goddess of 1967 is a maddeningly pretentious film that tries too hard to capture the flair and dynamism of newwave filmmaking without the artistry to back it up. The film's first half is almost unbearable but there are some more conventional moments in the latter stages that lend the work some much needed credibility. Clara Law's directing technique is firstyear film school stuff with a lot of unnecessary appendages that do little other than distract and the story is a fairly stale reworking of tired old themes about betrayal revenge and redemption built upon on a narrative of incest and sexual transgression. The Japanese subplot and characters seem tacked on to lend an air of otherness that seems redundant. The failure of the approach is emphasised by the weak script that often times reads likes poor poetry I was reminded of David Brent's Excalibur. Even Rose Byrne's gorgeous face can do little to make this film watchable.";

To add further to the shallowness and predictability of this movie the Japanese car buff played by newcomer Rikiya Kurokawa is so poorly developed and pointless that he may as well wear a tshirt saying silly Asian character and leave it at that. The inexplicably touted Rose Byrne's fiesty blind girl with a dark past has slightly more depth but only just. The odd couple with a culture clash on a quirky road trip where they find themselves  c'mon! Haven't we seen this kind of lazy scenario too many times before already? This is third rate film school stuff with nothing new or original to say despite its pretensions. Give this one a miss unless you love cars as much as Boy does.

It was just so much that the rest didn't surprise you anymore.

It's one of the most hilarious stylish and downright insane films I have ever watched.If you haven't watched the first Crank I recommend watching it before you even think of watching this film. It'll give you some good background story and also prepare you for what you are about to see.If you saw the first Crank and didn't like it... do not watch this movie. Multiply Crank by 1000 volts and you get this incredible sequel.The Crank franchise is an acquired taste and this stretches it even for fans.".

	schema:reviewBody "Crank 2 High Voltage practically begs to be passionately loathed by absolutely everyone with the notable exception of antisocial teenage boys. Its rank nihilistic tone is relentless and exhausting. The misogyny is benchmark horrendous. The acts of violence are brutal frequent and often blatantly homoerotic. Its flippant. Its homophobic. Its vulgar. And it feels as much seething contempt for its own narrative coherence as it does for its few prominent female characters.But there is something bracingly brilliant about it. Films this fearlessly unhinged simply do not get made any more and thirty years ago this would've played late at night to packed houses for years on end perhaps aptly bundled with the likes of John Water's Pink Flamingoes.One fact that was suggested by the first Crank is set heroically in stone barely five minutes into its sequel  that directors Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor appear to be completely obsessed with pornography. There is a truly jawdropping amount of flesh on constant display and the film's only female speaking parts belong to a prostitute and a stripper. This lends the film an air of uncomfortable almost lavatorial sleaziness until a bunch of actual porn stars turn up in the middle of a scene starring as a bunch of disgruntled porn stars striking for better pay. Although it hardly passes as satire it does seem like a sly dig in the direction of the producers that populate the Hollywood mainstream who'd surely relish the opportunity to make films like this if only the bastard machine would let them. Ballsout exploitation it may be but if any film lives up to cinema's ancient adage of providing its audience with relentless sex and violence its this one. The second half of the film is where it really flies and chooses to disregard not only its own plot but any care for the patience or expectations of its audience. It goes essentially mad. And for something that was clearly deranged in the first place it'd be foolish for me not to offer up the only advice that will enable you to see exactly what I mean. Go and see it.".

	schema:headline " Crank High Voltage is one of the most overthetop and ridiculously entertaining films of the past 10 years! It's an adult version of Looney Toons and a worthy sequel!";
	schema:reviewBody "Chev Chelios was dead but he got better.Jason Statham returns as the lead in Crank High Voltage and in every way this sequel breaks the rules and pushes the bar to insane new levels sometimes even a bit too far.Three months after his helicopter incident Chelios awakens to see that Chinese blackmarket surgeons are slicing his famed Chelios Heart out made famous by the fact that it kept beating after the events of the first film and replacing it with a surrogate artificial heart so they can keep him alive while they farm more of his organs.Chelios escapes and discovers he has a whole new set of problems his heart is connected to an external battery pack. When this battery pack runs out of juice he only has one hour before his artificial heart stops and he dies. And of course one of the first things that happens is that his battery pack is smashed! Now Chelios has to keep his artificial heart beating with regular volts of electricity to recharge it using anything he can car power outlets jumper cables power stations stunguns whatever he can get his hands on.His goal track down psychotic criminal Johnny Vang who is seemingly parading around Chelios's heart in a miniature cooler and get it back so old friend and medical expert Doc Miles Dwight Yoakam in a returning role as the man who lets the audience know exactly what's going on can put it back in.Chelios is also being tracked by sadistic criminals sent by El Huron a crime lord who has some devious connections to Chelios and his past actions.This film has a very convoluted plot but like the first one it works out rather well. One particular thing I enjoyed is that we spend a little more time with subsequent and secondary characters like Chev's girlfriend Eve the sexy Amy Smart Venus Efron Ramirez portraying the brother to his slain character Laylo from the first film and other characters that come up. It just adds to the plot and gives it more reality in contrast to the literal circus of Mayhem that Mr. Chev Chelios is stirring up.Speaking of returning characters this film certainly has a lot of cameos from characters from movie number one which was a delight for me as a fan. Fans of the first Crank you'll definitely get a kick out of some of the cameos in this entry.Now onto the psychotic weirdness of the film. If you've seen the first film you'll know it used strange tactics like subtitles graphics and nightmarish imagery to put you inside of the heads of the characters. This film expands on that by using and abusing subtitles insane graphics medical films and more on a fairly regular basis. We even get a hilarious pseudoflashback of sorts and it is one of the most abrupt and brilliant segues I've ever seen to bridge two scenes.And on that note I should mention that this film does play for laughs a lot more than the first film. In fact there are scenes specifically written to play for laughs more than for actions. As a fan that may sound disheartening sorry had to make a heart pun but trust me it works. The film definitely teeters on selfsatire at times including a uproariously funny line of dialog where Eve swipes at fans who would call Chev surviving the first film impossible but it keeps it's balance and lets us know that its not taking itself too seriously so the comedy fits right in.WritersDirectors Neveldine  Taylor also step the visuals up a notch. While not as haggard visually as the first film this followup does have some pretty visuals and is betterdirected in terms of camera placement and editing in my opinion and it fits right in with the first one. Their script is also to be commended for being so bold with bizarre characters I didn't even mention David Carradine going all Charlie Chan! insane story lines and one of the most overthetop and unexpected finales I've seen in a long time. This isn't just an action movie it's Looney Toons for grownups! It's the action equivalent of what Evil Dead II was to horror! It's brilliant in it's execution and definitely a step in the right direction for a sequel to Crank not too serious.This film literally left me in awe with its lunacy and action. If you loved the first film then there's almost no way you won't love this entry.I give Crank High Voltage an 8 out of 10 because like the first film it's the ultimate rush and now it's even the ultimate source for laughs! Give this one a shot you'll love it!".

I love the first one quirky does not take itself seriously at all yet you got this sense of danger from Jason's character which kept the pace going nicely and had you on the edge of your seat. Yes it had fast inyourface editing but it worked for the most part and wasn't done too much.Now comes the sequel. You can tell at the beginning when they have Q from Star Trek reading the news like a public broadcaster who really doesn't give a hoot anymore this has gone from any semblance of fun to total and utter spoof with no respect for the original material or the audience.I suppose they had no other way to go after dropping the main character from a helicopter and replacing his heart which was supposed to be full of a virus and only kept alive because of the vast quantities of adrenaline he pumped into it BTW with a bionic one.This my friends is not a Jason Strathern action movie it's a Jason Voorhees one. He's indestructible now. Nothing so much as hurts him. He can drop out of the sky crash a car and go through the windshield have multiple cops beating him up be tortured sustain numerous massive electric shocks catch fire. Apart from saying ouch and 'oh dear' he never gets more than cuts or bruises. Gone is the sense of danger you never feel he's going to have trouble in any scene.Instead we have numerous chasing and fight scenes and lots of boobies which I must admit I liked but unlike the first movie I really don't feel compelled to ever watch this one again because that is essentially the plot. Jason get's a bionic heart then goes after his old one even though the entire first movie was about him having about an hour to live as his heart was full of a virus...one which was never cured BTW and he got a second dose towards the end. I know I'm a stickler for this point but personally I hate Hollywood shoving a You are too stupid for me to even be bothered sign in my face The editing is done by a Mexican on acid who's ticked off MTC doesn't do music videos any more as he tries his best to do every music video ever made in the movie. It's like he can't do a single straight shot! Ever single angle and frame has to be Comlet LY!!! BonKers!! loll look at me I'm creative and special eleventy1'11! There's even a point where they turn into Godzilla monsters! And once you get over that they have a head in water which is still alive!! Yeah of course spoilers...sorry. Please black out the words which will spoil the enjoyment of this movie.If this had been part of a trash spoof franchise like the endless Scary MovieEpic movies etc then at least people could have hired this out at home and injected their heads with glue beforehand to prepare. I could even understand if the first one was as insane as this if it was like Evil Dead 2 or something but unfortunately the original set a standard and as silly as the standard was the sequel washes all over it and drops a big plop on the audience expecting them to chew it all up and say Thank you sir may I have another?

	schema:headline " Crank 2 Is Off The Wall Insanity.";
	schema:reviewBody "After surviving a fall from a helicopter Chev Chelios is kidnapped directly from the spot he landed in and is taken to a place where they remove his heart. He is given an artificial one that requires an electrical charge to keep running every hour or so. Now Chelios is on the run trying to find his old heart and to keep charged. I had an appreciation for the first Crank it was a live action Grand Theft Auto. Creating as much chaos as possible within the running time. It ended perfectly with his death. Crank 2 comes around and ruins that. At least for my own sanity right from the beginning they have a telecaster look directly to the viewer and tell them how implausible all of this is. Could this be the writers and directors telling the audience that this was a studio decision? Crank 2 doesn't hold any punches it goes all out and doesn't stop. It somehow finds a way to be even more chaotic than the original but it sacrifices any kind of logical straight forward story. The first even though it was far fetched seemed like it might possibly happen. Crank 2 doesn't seem to be based in any kind of reality. I do still like the city and world these characters live in. It's just like a video gamecomic book come to life. Statham once again shows us why he is the new face of the action genre. The Rock has moved on to Disney family films and Statham continues to be in films that he knows his fans will love. Crank 2 is violent and obscene. Just like it wants to be Chelios is a despicable character just like he wants to be. Statham plays the role with a bit of charm that makes him likable. Amy smart is here again but she seems even more useless now than before. Was her purpose in this one just to reenact the famous sex in public scene from original? The Crank films are without a doubt a guys film. Crank 2 even more so. Sex violence harsh language and insane sequences like a shotgun shoved up a guy's ass or two characters transforming into Godzilla like creatures it's something that requires a viewer to leave their brain not only at the door but at the door of another house. The comedy is unique and in your face it doesn't hold back with any subject matter. It's degrading to women and homosexuals and maybe even intellectuals. If you liked the first Crank you'll like this one. For what it is worth I dug the craziness of the film. The style it was shot in was fast and dirty that reflects the story and the characters in it.

	onyx:emotionText "After surviving a fall from a helicopter Chev Chelios is kidnapped directly from the spot he landed in and is taken to a place where they remove his heart. He is given an artificial one that requires an electrical charge to keep running every hour or so. Now Chelios is on the run trying to find his old heart and to keep charged. I had an appreciation for the first Crank it was a live action Grand Theft Auto. Creating as much chaos as possible within the running time. It ended perfectly with his death. Crank 2 comes around and ruins that. At least for my own sanity right from the beginning they have a telecaster look directly to the viewer and tell them how implausible all of this is. Could this be the writers and directors telling the audience that this was a studio decision? Crank 2 doesn't hold any punches it goes all out and doesn't stop. It somehow finds a way to be even more chaotic than the original but it sacrifices any kind of logical straight forward story. The first even though it was far fetched seemed like it might possibly happen. Crank 2 doesn't seem to be based in any kind of reality. I do still like the city and world these characters live in. It's just like a video gamecomic book come to life. Statham once again shows us why he is the new face of the action genre. The Rock has moved on to Disney family films and Statham continues to be in films that he knows his fans will love. Crank 2 is violent and obscene. Just like it wants to be Chelios is a despicable character just like he wants to be. Statham plays the role with a bit of charm that makes him likable. Amy smart is here again but she seems even more useless now than before. Was her purpose in this one just to reenact the famous sex in public scene from original? The Crank films are without a doubt a guys film. Crank 2 even more so. Sex violence harsh language and insane sequences like a shotgun shoved up a guy's ass or two characters transforming into Godzilla like creatures it's something that requires a viewer to leave their brain not only at the door but at the door of another house.

I found myself marveling at the creativity of the writers and directors to find new and interesting ways to move the story forward.Jason Statham is back again as Chev Chelios. At the end of Crank we saw him fall from a helicopter onto a car and bounce onto the street. In a fall that would have killed most merely mortal men but we see an eye open as the movie ends.Crank 2 starts exactly where the other one left off. We see a bunch of men scoop Chelios up and drive away with him before even the cops have a chance to figure out what is happening. Then Chelios finds himself in a makeshift operating room they have just removed his heart and installed a mechanical heart with an external power supply. But why didn't they just let him die? Because someone from the first movie really wants to personally see him suffer and die.So most of the movie has Chelios hunting down the person he believes has his heart in a small ice chest. When the battery runs down he has to find unique ways to get a charge back and some of them are very electrifying! But since he doesn't have a heart he can take it.Amy Smart is back as his girlfriend Eve Lydon. In the first movie they had to have sex on the street right in front of a crowd so that his adrenaline would keep flowing to ward off the Chinese poison that had been injected into him. In this movie he has to create some static electricity to keep his mechanical heart going so they end up having sex on a track while a horse race is going on. While that sounds in very poor taste to think about it in context of the movie it is a very funny scene.Dwight Yoakam is also back as Doc Miles who will try to reimplant Chelios' heart if he can find it. Overthetop and very funny is Ling Bai as Ria chasing after her man Chelios. And a key character is nowdeceased David Carradine as the old Chinese Poon Dong.I found the movie very entertaining in a totally absurd way.".

I've never seen anything like it before. IMDb claims the budget was 20M although that seems like quite a stretch. But there is about 1B worth of craziness in it. The makers didn't hold anything back  no restraint whatsoever and it's amazing. Anyone looking to be offended will be. Guaranteed. I've heard of people walking out of movies but this is the first time I ever saw it happen. I wonder if they asked for their  back. I'm pretty sure the theaters are covered from giving refunds there's fine print on the tix or something.Anyway the opening credits are in video game form which I now realize was a signal. Viewers need to forget reality not just suspend disbelief in that routine movie kind of way. These guys throw everything they can think of up on the screen and I kept wondering what drugs they were using during filming. Maybe all of them. Also there's something to irritate everybody. I really mean that I don't think any insult or stereotype or slur was left out. Nothing offensive was held back that I could notice although I've led a sheltered life.Now here's the switch it's hilarious and I mean laughoutloud funny from start to finish. I saw scenes I never saw before or ever expected to see. It starts out so unbelievably crazy that it's actually shocking sorry and then just keeps it up and keeps it going for the entire flick. Dark Chocolate's elaborate eyeroll sequence is one for the ages and is worth the price of admission all by itself.Here's how funny it is SpikeTV showed it and of course had to make countless cuts not just the copious female nudity but the language and graphic violence and so on. Anyway with all that gone it was still incredibly funny and astounding and just totally insane. The ending was a setup for a sequel same way the first Crank was but I honestly don't see how they can top this one. Maybe I'm wrong I sure hope so but it seems to me that they deliberately made it as wild as possible and didn't hold anything back.One last word it's not for everyone. I promise you'll either absolutely love it or thoroughly despise it. There will be no inbetween for this one.".

At the end it seemed especially the case since well Chev Chelios falls out of a helicopter and crashes on a car. Dead? Actually no as case turns out to be.Let's face it  with Crank you already had to suspend disbelief but with Crank High Voltage you'll need to put your disbelief in a microwave and cook until it's about ready to jump out and kick the everloving s out of you. This movie not only doesn't follow logic or laws of physics or biology it flips the finger and goes along on its way like the best video game your friend ever got that he wont let you play.But hell why bother playing when watching it may be even more fun? Chev Chelios who three months after we last saw him has been given a fake heart with a kind of electrical system think of a ghetto version of that thing Tony Stark has as Iron Man after some Chinese dudes took out his heart goes on rampages when properly given the quality electroshock of course like he's the energizer bunny crisscrossed with... hmm the most psychotic hellbent killer one's ever seen outside of the dirtiest and most ultraviolent exploitation flicks ever? Even more to face it at this point Chev Chelios would make Charles Bronson have second thoughts about that sockoquarters.To say that this is a better movie than the first one would not be correct. It's simply not. The first had a clearer story and didn't try to add depth like flashing back to Chev's childhood memory of being on a talkshow as an already ultraviolent hoodlum kid with a talkback mouth still a very funny scene but besides the point. What Crank High Voltage has and this is in barrels and barrels like an outhouse at a circus is crazy LOTS and LOTS of craziness. This had me and at least a good lot of others at the midnight screening I went to howling with laughter. What else can you do as they actually TOP the inpublic rampageofsex scene between Statham and Amy Smart as they get it on because apparently skin friction creates energy doncha know? in front of a full crowd at a race track? Or what about the incredibly streamofconsciousness cutaways to the FyouChevChelios texts scrolling across the screen? Best of all or just so bats mad of all that you will be hitting yourself across the head with a hammer to make sure you're not seeing things are new casting choices. One Clifton Collins Jr is a nice little touch where he gets to basically go all out and I do mean ALL out handlebar mustache included after playing lowkey character parts for years. The other will keep genre fans talking for weeks David Carradine that's right David Bill Carradine is in the movie as the 100 year old gangster who is barely on life support and is given his last chance at life  thanks to Chev Chelios' Chinesepoisonresistant heart. Compared to Carradine's howthehelldidtheygethim casting Bai Ling is just a natural choice as a relentlessly obnoxious Ho' who keeps following Chelios as he's her Kevin Costner. Did I mention the brother of the uh Efren Ramirez's character from the first film is back as a gay turret'sbody sufferer? Add on to this Jason Statham's go for broke attitude with the whole shebang and the fact that the filmmakers behind this film as well as the first one will go to the most extreme lengths to make the most hardened action film and Grindhouse geeks drooling and jaws agape many times over and you've got yourself a completely joyously Gonzo piece of HARDRrated American cinema. Don't go to see it because it might give a message. See it because it's Jason Statham rampaging at one point he turns into Godzilla at a power plant fighting a goon all the way to the last moment... and yes there will be a sequel! Maybe...".

	schema:headline " Everything that's wrong with media today";
	schema:reviewBody "I almost walked out. I watched others walk out.Now you gotta understand that I am not one to walk out of a movie. Ever. Although I was extremely compelled to get out of my seat many times throughout the Crank High Voltage and felt somewhat gross for staying I persevered. I figure I really can't complain about a movie unless I give it a full chance and watch it from beginning to end.I was really looking forward to a funfilled action ride going to this movie. I love the Tarantino films the Guy Ritchie movies the gratuitous special effects shows and extreme camera angles and stylings. Agreed there are some pretty impressive visuals and high speed action. That's where the fun ends. It's what's going on within all these visuals and action that's quite disturbing.The rant I don't know if the theatre I was in had their volume turned up and extra notch or if this movie has it's levels higher than it should but I was glad I had my headphones with me so I could stick them in my ears while I watched. Otherwise my ears would be ringing and in pain today. It makes sense that Crank would have it's levels higher because this is in keeping with the commercials on television a little louder than everything else and definitely louder than necessary especially since the movie seemed like one big commercial for sexism violence poor taste and sensationalism.From cutting own's own nipples off to cutting another's elbows off and calling it sushi from shoving rifles covered in tar up asses to obliterating someone's face with a 6pack cooler I've seen some hardcore films with insane violence in it but Crank doesn't care. It jumps from one sensational image to the next a big fricken festival and no one seems to give a second glance or asks why. The violence really doesn't matter it just keeps happening almost without reason or result. You want a little overstimulation with your violence? How bout extreme closeups fastpaced rhythm editing and gratuitous which indie film camera trick have we not used cuz I wanna make sure and use them all?Okay okay the number of closeup crotch tits and ass shots is quite impressive as well. I've never seen so many shots of impressively focused angles on butt flesh in all it's forms. You can see every dimple and peach fuzz hair on the hundreds of girls' featured butts and man ass too. And it's not enough to just focus in they somehow managed to get all of their actresses to spread their legs or bend over to get that nice up in between the legs shot. Not once not twice over and over the whole film seemed a montage of sluts parading behind gunfire and commercialism. Even the sex scene on the horse track it was like I get it I get it funny ha ha and then it just kept going and going going from bad to just stupid.Which brings me to the real trouble with this flick it is everything wrong with the media today yelling and screaming at you with disregard to taste or creativity or narrative speaking of which it is quite clear they really don't care whether or not you know what's going on or if there is a story to all the madness in a big shiny box with sparkles ribbons bows glitter and and... They took EVERYTHING cool in action movies and indie films and whatnot and smashed it together and got a clown in a car salesman suit to hit you over the head with it while screaming death metal songs in your ear. I LOVE Jason Statham I don't think of him as the clown in the least. Loved watching him just disappointed with the packaging. Removed the class cut the taste. They stole the appearance of creativity and cool the way an ad agency steals a great photo on Flickr and sells millions of dollars worth of shampoo with it after a nice Photoshop job. It did have the pacing of a commercial or MTV video and I kinda felt like I was watching one long loud bad commercial for sexism and violence and don't give a fck.Just ugly.It makes me really disappointed with the direction of the media today. I was disappointed when I came to IMDb and saw what high ratings it got. I know people love this film and I can see why. I guess that's the sad part.".

	onyx:emotionText "I almost walked out. I watched others walk out.Now you gotta understand that I am not one to walk out of a movie. Ever. Although I was extremely compelled to get out of my seat many times throughout the Crank High Voltage and felt somewhat gross for staying I persevered. I figure I really can't complain about a movie unless I give it a full chance and watch it from beginning to end.I was really looking forward to a funfilled action ride going to this movie. I love the Tarantino films the Guy Ritchie movies the gratuitous special effects shows and extreme camera angles and stylings. Agreed there are some pretty impressive visuals and high speed action. That's where the fun ends. It's what's going on within all these visuals and action that's quite disturbing.The rant I don't know if the theatre I was in had their volume turned up and extra notch or if this movie has it's levels higher than it should but I was glad I had my headphones with me so I could stick them in my ears while I watched. Otherwise my ears would be ringing and in pain today. It makes sense that Crank would have it's levels higher because this is in keeping with the commercials on television a little louder than everything else and definitely louder than necessary especially since the movie seemed like one big commercial for sexism violence poor taste and sensationalism.From cutting own's own nipples off to cutting another's elbows off and calling it sushi from shoving rifles covered in tar up asses to obliterating someone's face with a 6pack cooler I've seen some hardcore films with insane violence in it but Crank doesn't care. It jumps from one sensational image to the next a big fricken festival and no one seems to give a second glance or asks why. The violence really doesn't matter it just keeps happening almost without reason or result. You want a little overstimulation with your violence? How bout extreme closeups fastpaced rhythm editing and gratuitous which indie film camera trick have we not used cuz I wanna make sure and use them all?Okay okay the number of closeup crotch tits and ass shots is quite impressive as well.

It's like the producers thought Well Crank went great with the audience lets extract everything that made it big and give 'em some more of that because they're supposed to love it and we're supposed to get cash out of it.I'm going to list some of those things that really put me off...1 The music didn't seem to fit the Crankcinematography at all! the first movie really stood out here at least in my opinion.2 The cinematography itself is an overthetop mockery of what made Crank 1 seem so fast paced. It's nothing but shaky and hectic.3 The idea of Chev needing to recharge all the time seems like the writers desperately tried to find something similar to the first movie. Unfortunately every one of those scenes lacks wit and is pretty much predictable.4 Amy Smarts involvement seems to be reduced to illogical sex scenes and her being topless half of the movie.5 Some minor characters seem to have no reason whatsoever in the movie but to annoy the viewer especially the Asian girl and a certain person suffering from a certain disorder I don't want to spoiler.6 The movie just lacked an interesting and somewhat logical story it's just a vehicle to deliver the Crankness that's supposed to bring in the money.7 The ending including the preceding climax I'd like to call it whatjusthappened? is just so bad! You'll have to experience it to know what I mean .In conclusion there is almost nothing new in this movie nearly every scene can be traced back to a Crank 1 scene. In fact this movie bears such a strong resemblance to the first Crank that it could have really been the first movie if they'd have had the heart idea instead of the poison idea. Only that it wouldn't have been successful...".

I expected very much of this movie but got so disappointed that I felt that I must write this comment like a warning to others not to watch this movie. One of best directed movies that J.Statham played in was Revolver2005 and that movie got 6.210. And I think that this is a bad career move for Jason Statham.";

Before we begin with the actual review let's delve a bit into how this film can possibly make fun of its viewers? Is that even possible without us knowing? I must be full of ! This movie takes all the things that the action film viewer base has been craving and asking Hollywood to massproduce more and more of for the last 10 years evolving films like Day of the Jackal into The Jackal puke. They specifically targeted cheapshot humor by overusing it such as a floating head getting kicked into a pool or wowaha scenarios where people relate to the wit and adaptability of the main character such as someone using jumper cables to recharge a heart or a protagonist standing in front of a trapped villain with a syringe filled with a disabling fluid or oh I remember that.. flashbacks that remind the viewer of things that happened earlier in the film so they can understand how they relate to the upcoming or recently passed scene. I thought it was amusing in the ricocheting bullet psychiatrist scene how they used one of these transitional flashbacks just 2025 seconds after its occurrence in the film.The entire film there aren't really be any cuts lasting much more than 35 seconds or scenes lasting more than 12 seconds. to me was an insidious ploy to debase the entire let's call them newage action film fans desire to pay attention to any one scene let's remember that it may be the audience OR filmmakers at fault for this for more than the amount of time given to the audience to absorb the scene before it was cut off or lazily transitioned into a new one The only scenes breaking this length rule were the horsetrack scene with its use of gratuitous sexuality as well as the psychiatrist ricocheting bullet scene with its overacted sexual tension. Somehow the filmmakers thought these scenes could hold the audience's attention spans for more than the typical 815 seconds per scene.This satire described in the previous paragraph may have been created inadvertently based on other intentions for satire but for me the film held significance in these respects and is duly rewarded 210 stars as I had long before my viewing of this film attempted to destroy every brain cell I had capable of entertaining myself with this movie it has no other value to me than my analysis. However its satire did bring up some interesting points they were nothing anyone paying half attention wouldn't be able to observe simply by following action films descent over the past 10 to 15 years into what they are today.".

	schema:reviewBody "I grew up with both of the Grease films but I must say Grease 2 is my favourite and there are many reasons.  It does have the same kind of formula as the orginal Grease but is dealt with in a completely different way. Danny faniced Sandy back but Stephanie played by the young Michelle Pfhieffer doesn't even give Michael Caulfield a second glance.  Also instead of cars a motorbike is the new 'thing' to have.Michael Carrington a straight A student from England transfers to Rydell High and is immediately put into the 'nerd' category and the TBirds brand him 'Shakesphere'.  He is smart extremely uncool and very shy.Stephenie the leader of the Pink ladies has come back from the summer holidays having broke up with Johnny the TBirds leader having grown out of him.  Johnny is clearly still interested in Stephanie but she doesn't want to know.  Her loyalty to the Birds has faltered as she wants someone even cooler.First day back Stephanie sees the Birds picking on Michael and defends him from that moment on Michael vows to become a TBird and win her heart.So there is the story but what Grease is famous for is the memorable songs and this film has them!  There are 12 songs on the soundtrack and there isn't one that I really skip.  The music has changed since the first Grease as it was made in the decade of the 80's.  Its early 80's rock that you are getting yourself into for the most part.  You have the romanitc songs Turn Back The Hands Of Time We'll Be Together Charades the heavy rock songs Cool Rider Who's That Guy the happygodancing songs Score Tonight Back To School the sweet songs Love For All Seasons and the down right silly songs Reproduction Prowlin'.  These are all songs that stick in your mind and just can't stop singing them to yourself.  All the songs are quality and stand on their own.  Absolutely brilliant soundtrack.What would Grease be without the classic characters?  We have the TBirds who are actually not cool in any way or form its only the leader Johnny who is 'cool' the others just follow his lead.  Johnny is a classic character who makes you laugh over and over again its hilarious whenever he loses his cool.  Frenchy unfortunately doesn't have a big part in the film but nethertheless she is there.  The coach is back but you only see him twice if that.  Mrs Mcgee and Blanche are also back making quite a funny duo as they did last time.  Two new teachers a very sexy female who always has low cut tops on and pays 500 for her hair according to the cheer leading twins.  She falls for the unlikely nerdy substitute teacher Mr Stewart who teaches the immortal 'Reproduction' lesson.  The new Pink ladies have very distinctive characters one of them is obsessed with her nose and doesnt come into it much Rhonda Paulette is somewhat the second leader in my view who has a crush on Johnny she does have her own intentions but she does care for her friends nothing like Riz.  Sharon is a bubbly flirty character who is the prey of one of the TBirds Louis to get into bed. Then there is Dolores Paulettes little sister who isn't a Pink lady but a pink lady mascot she looks about 12 mouthy and carries a skate board everywhere.The performances were actually very good in my humble opinion especially Max Caulfield who seemed very uncomfortable... and that is the way Michael is supposed to be!  He wins me over with those puppy innocent eyes then when he is the mysterious guy he acts completely cool.  Max was a triumph. His voice isn't the best thing in the world but he didn't sing that much anyway.  Michelle Pfhieffer was wonderful as an actress and singer.  When you hear her sing you won't need to wonder why Andrew Lloyd Webber wanted her as Evita in his film musical and NOT Madonna.  She shines in 'Cool Rider'.  The whole cast was believable.  I normally sit back in films and watch peoples performances and dig at them but I didnt do that at all in this movie.This film has a lot of negative feedback as every one compares it to the Original Grease.  My opinion isnt common preferring this one to the original therefore my advice to you is to forget the first movie when watching this one.  It needs a chance!".

	schema:reviewBody "When I was 11 Grease 2 was like crack. It was a classless shameful euphoric and powerfully addictive experience. My sister and I would watch it rewind it and watch it over again and again and again until we passed out or became too confused and hostile to stand one another. So if you are an 11year old girl and you reviewed this film as brilliant or fun or better than the original Grease you have your fledgling adolescent hormones to blame and you can rest assured that this unyielding fixation with utter rubbish will pass.If however you are not a little girl you have absolutely no excuse to suggest that Grease 2 was anything but an inane artless slipshod embarrassment for all who participated in its production distribution andor consumption.For the sake of criticism I will dignify the film now by explaining why it blows 1. In a wellexecuted musical the songs should advance the narrative or develop the characters. In Grease 2 with a few debatable exceptions to the music is obscenely pointless. Most of the songs appear to relate gimped innuendo about sex in an excessive and general way Score Tonight Reproduction Do It For Our Country and Prowlin' without making one concrete statement about any of the film's characters or themes. Plus all of the music is uncomfortably stupid and no one in the cast demonstrates even the crudest semblance of an ability to sing or dance.2. The Tbirds should be badass and if not at least somewhat likable but instead each of them is an annoying wussydufusloser. In the end when Johnny Nogerelli offers Michael the sacred Tbird jacket and initiates him into the gang Michael should kick it to the ground spit on it and duck away to fervently scrub any part of his body that was touched by it. But of course he accepts it as if it is gold because despite the fact that they are a bunch of bumbling meatheads there is no greater honor than to be one with the Tbirds. 3. Since Michael is beautiful smart kind resourceful and above average in everyway his musical impotence notwithstanding it is feasible that Stephanie would ultimately embrace him when he reveals himself to be the man behind the mask. Stephanie on the other hand is a slovenly slackjawed bubble gum smacking dirty sweatshirt wearing gracelessly rude and trashy dingbat. So aside from being pretty I guess she harbors no likable characteristics thus audiences are given no justification whatsoever for the depth of Michael's attraction to her.I could go on and on but I didn't want to mention the gross inferiority to its predecessor since there are apparently so many cranks out there who seem to feel that such a comparison is unfair. I will say this though to those of you who think you want to revisit this mess for old time's sake Grease 2 is an experience akin to reliving your first kiss. Only you are 32 now and kissing a snotnosed 13year old kid with acne and slobby braces. The magic is gone and you are left feeling dirty and disturbed. Trust me.".

So aside from being pretty I guess she harbors no likable characteristics thus audiences are given no justification whatsoever for the depth of Michael's attraction to her.I could go on and on but I didn't want to mention the gross inferiority to its predecessor since there are apparently so many cranks out there who seem to feel that such a comparison is unfair. I will say this though to those of you who think you want to revisit this mess for old time's sake Grease 2 is an experience akin to reliving your first kiss. Only you are 32 now and kissing a snotnosed 13year old kid with acne and slobby braces. The magic is gone and you are left feeling dirty and disturbed. Trust me.";

Especially the Reproductionscene...you can't watch that and not agree that that is one funny part of the movie. I also thought Maxwell Caulfield was GORGEOUS as Michael. I overall give this movie 710.".

	schema:headline " So appalling it exerts a perverse fascination!";
	schema:reviewBody "I used to work in a record store in the late 80searly 90s and one thing we sold a copy of at least every week was the Grease 2 soundtrack. I used to ask the people buying about it and they all acknowledged that it was one of the worst movies but that there is something about it so lovable and that the songs are terrible but there's something about them so charming Now that I've seen the movie I know what they mean.This movie is appalling in nearly every respect but there's just something about itperhaps how brazenly appalling it isthat gives it an almost hypnotic fascination. I love how the producers made only the most surfacelevel attempt to even appear 50s. The clothes hairstyles songs and ways of speaking all scream 80s. I haven't the slightest idea why they decided to dress Michelle Pheiffer in things that essentially look like sweatshirts for the first half of the movie. And she's got on those huge dark glasses all the time making her look like early Debbie Harry. You just really have to wonder. As for the sets I don't think I've ever seen such low production values in a movie released by a major studio. The sets also are brazenly 80s When Michelle is being tutored they are OBVIOUSLY in an Elias Brothers Big Boy! Couldn't they at least have found a 50sthemed diner? There is also a scene showing guys motorcycling through a subdivision that looks like 1985 Westland Michigan and another timemy favoritewhen Michelle and someone are sitting out in what is obviously some municipal park with a huge superhighway with massive 18wheelers barreling by in the background. I really have to take my hat off. What's also charmingly appalling is how the producers made NO attempt to recapture ANYTHING you may have loved about the first movie. And I tell you this movie makes the original look like Gone With the Wind. You really should be required to see both to appreciate what a graceful charming movie the first one is. This is so obviously just a craven cashin by whoever owned the rights that's you Allan Carr! that in some perverse way only makes it the more appealing.Everyone in this movie looks embarrassed but none more so that Michelle Pheiffer. Obviously WRONG in every way for the part and obviously PAINFULLY aware that she's going to look like an idiot on movie screens across America poor Michelle seems afraid to really put herself behind any expression movement or song as though by staying as still as possible she can diminish the damage. The poor girl you can really feel her pain especially as she sings 'Cool Rider' and tries to dance up that ladder and down. The thing about musicals is that the characters have to appear to be transported with joy or anguish to the point that they break out in song and poor Michelle is just so embarrassed that it really clunks. Of course ALL the musical sequences clunk massively. If you're not buying a musical sequence it just looks like a bunch of people idiotically moving around on a set and that's what we got here. Those poor poor individuals.I was amazed how poor the sound quality was. I hear this has been improved on the DVD but it's quite clear that they were aware that these people COULD NOT SING and tried to bury their voices as deep as possible.What else? Well I guess that's about it. Truly poor direction just adds to the general malaise. If you like bad cheesy movies they just don't get any better than this. If you are a fan of the original you should definitely watch this as it'll just make you love the chemistry charming songs and graceful story arc all the more.

The plot and dialogue are fraught with silliness and if you watch carefully there are numerous little mistakes that should have been edited out. Spoiler Michael's motorcycle right out in plain view of Steff with him leaning on it when he's hiding his cool rider identity from her. Some of the songs are especially painful particularly in the ultraserious motorcycle heaven scene and the choreography is just bad. Watching Michelle Pfeiffer dance and sing Cool Rider is terribleshe should not be dancing that way or singing at all. One has to wonder why Crater Face was included as a villain in this film because now his tormenting of the high school students is just sad. Then again I have a soft spot for Grease 2 that I don't have for the too oftshown first film. For one just to get this out of the way Maxwell Caulfield is gorgeous in this movie. If you hate the film you can always assuming you swing that way just watch him. It's not as if his acting is bad and neither is Michelle's though her lines are. And Grease 2 is funny in its own wayyou simply can't watch Michelle dance and sing without laughing. There is a lot to laugh atand even within this musical. Reproduction is fun to watch if certainly campy and a couple of the Tbirds are entertaining Leif Green and Peter Frechette's characters.As I said I have a fondness for this movie that is pretty inexplicable I know. It's not a classic film by any means. Still I'd say if you're looking for a sobadit'sgood that still isn't too incredibly awful to laugh at with your friends Grease 2 is worth a rental.".

The supporting cast of the original has better players. The storyline doesn't seem as convoluted at times.But there's something about this movie that holds on to you. It appeals much more to the age group pictured in the movie i.e. juniorhigh and highschoolers. The song Cool Rider and the scenes that accompany it in the movie rival anything in the original.The dialog is better in places and the interplay between the male and female leads are better I believe than in the original. The original movie's pairing of Travolta and NewtonJohn gave us a dimwit trying to woo a goodietwoshoes girl whose performance was oftentimes wooden and uncomfortable. This one gives us Caulfield and Pfeiffer and the interplay between an intelligent wisebeyondhisyears male lead and the wild child female lead.Adrian Zmed's supporting performance as Johnny still cracks me up and is one of the few performances from this movie that still entertain me as an adult.That's because outside of the performances of accomplished character actors Christopher McDonald Eve Arden and Dody Goodman the rest of this cast is just plain bad. Some of it is bad acting some of it is miscasting and a lot of it is bad writing.What we're left with today 20something years later is a movie that made a really good attempt to build on the original but in the end was the souffl that fell. It's still better than most want to admit but it could have stood a couple of rewrites and a little more attention to detail in the prospective cast interview room.".

OMG I had an instant crush on him the minute I saw this as a girl. I'm 41 now. Maxwell Caulfield British accent great body and those eyessigh! lol I'm probably biased considering that my name is Stephanie.  I think this gets way too much hate. Lighten up people! Enjoy the great music the sexy cast I'll include Adrian Zmed and Michelle Pfeiffer in the sexy category and just have fun! I'll take this movie's lead actors over John Scientology Travolta ANY time! Lastly...MICHAEL!!! hehe Regards from Pittsburgh PA!";

From what I remember from the book Michael was alive and he actually wakes Stephanie up from a daydream or something backstage.  So I think when they decided on this storyline they didn't take into consideration that he was suppose to play the piano.Also if you look closely on the DVD during the luau scene while they are still singing you can see Michael sitting on the edge of the pool eating cotton candy.Hope this answer helped.".

Yes it's silly and a little farfetched but it's not trying to be Shakespeare.  As a musicalcomedy it succeeds on every level.  The music is just terrific.  The song Cool Rider is so catchy and Reproduction is hilarious.  They are my favorite numbers. The story is sweet and charming. The characters are funny likeable and Michelle Pfeiffer especially gives a terrific performance. She had such star quality in this film I have been a fan of hers ever since. I liked how several characters from the original were used and it was also a great idea to include actors from that era such as Tab Hunter and Connie Stevens. This movie is a guilty pleasure for some and I have a feeling that there are more than a few people out there who can sing from memory every song on the sound track!".

With almost no words to say he conveys emotion feeling and meaning with looks and glances. It is almost a mime performance. When the action sequences kick into gear he kicks assand does so in a strong silent matterof fact way. There are flaws. Jason Scott Lee is brutish as a superior genetic soldier. Jason Isaacs does a great impression of Frank Burns from MASH as a weaselly commanding officer and Gary Busey busts a gut and nearly busts his girdle as Todd's mentor.

	schema:reviewBody "In a future society the military component does not have to recruit rather their candidates are chosen at birth culled from nurseries and designated to spend their entire lives in the service of the government. They are given over to the war machine body and soul for no reason other than to protect and serve they have no personal identity other than a name and rank and no autonomy whatsoever.  This is the fate of those whose destiny is predetermined for them in Soldier' directed by Paul Anderson and starring Kurt Russell.  The scenario is hard and bleak as the movie begins by depicting the training of the soldiers during advancing periods of time from   preadolescence to adulthood.  Russell is Sergeant Todd the best of the best and we glimpse his career as he discharges his duties in an exemplary manner in campaign after campaign he is what he was born to be a soldier.  But even the best cannot go on forever and the day arrives when Todd and his peers are no longer the elite.  A new generation of soldiers has been created products of advanced genetics and technology and Todd's generation is suddenly obsolete.  What follows is the story of a man who must fight for his life while struggling to discover his own sense of humanity and individuality traits new to a soldier who has known only two things his entire life  Fear and discipline. Russell gives a commanding performance as Todd the soldier who above all else must obey orders without question while suppressing all emotion and individual thoughts.  He has few lines in this movie but Russell speaks volumes with his eyes.  This role demonstrates that he is in fact one of the underappreciated actors of our times that he can disappear so entirely into the character of Todd is a credit to his ability and with this part he has created someone quite different from any he's done before.  And he's given Todd a depth and credibility that someone of lesser talent could easily have rendered as nothing more than a pretentious and superficial stereotype.  Notable performances are also turned in here by Connie Nielsen Sandra and Jason Isaacs Colonel Mekum.  Rounding out the supporting cast are Jason Scott Lee memorable as Caine 607 one of the new generation of soldiers Sean Pertwee Mace Gary Busey Captain Church Michael Chiklis Jimmy Pig and Mark Bringleson Rubrick. Anderson has delivered an action film with a message a cautionary tale that transcends the genre of sciencefiction.  Soldier' reminds us of the importance of keeping the humanity of our lives intact.  It's an entertaining way of making us consider the alternatives like a bleak future and a world in which good movies just wouldn't make a whole lot of difference.  Much like 1984' and Mad Max' this movie which is ultimately uplifting is going to make you take pause and think about the kind of Universe in which we all must live together and share.  I rate this one 710.".

Sean Pertwee has really done his late father proud by continuing the families noble SciFi lineage.

As far as science fiction backdrops go Soldier was doing things with more design then 90 the genre. The sets costumes and props were all consistent and competently executed I didn't love all of their future military style but I was impressed with the effort. For me this made the movie worth the time it took to watch.Second I'm a Kurt Russell fan. I grew up watching this guy in some of the most memorable movies of my youth ... The Barefoot Executive and his John Carpenter films. Soldier is essentially an action movie and the role of Sergeant Todd is an essential action hero. It's not an award winning role but Kurt musters up convincing emotion with VERY little dialog.Third the fight scenes and battles are well choreographed. This isn't iron monkey or even the matrix but once again it far exceeds the average level of quality in the genre.If you haven't seen it and you like scifi action films pick it up if you pass at your rental depot of choice.

You can count about 10 clichs that the film is building up to but it only delivers on about three of them and a couple of them have a twist to them that lets you know once again that the director hasn't assumed that you are an idiot. Kurt Russell's acting is truely superb and brings a depth from the character that is suprising and rewarding. Recommended if you've just seen something really stupid and want to rebuild your faith!".

	schema:reviewBody "Before poor Paul W.S. Anderson made a fatal misstep with Alien Vs. Predator and was maligned he made a few really excellent genre flicks back in the mid to late 90's one of them being the mostly forgotten and excessively fun Soldier starring a mostly mute and wholly badass Kurt Russell as a genetically bred super soldier who has fallen on hard times. His name is Todd 3465 and he's from the last line of soldiers who are in fact real humans albeit altered. There's a new program moving in wherein actual replicants are produced rendering Todd obsolete. The head of the new outfit is sadistic Colonel Mekum Jason Isaacs in full evil prick mode who wants to do away with anything that isn't state of the art. Todd is thrashed in a one on one smackdown with Mekum's lead soldier Jason Scott Lee and then left to die on a remote planet used only for trash disposal and inhabited by wayward crash survivors who scavenge what they can. Todd is immediately the outsider an unfeeling asset bred only for combat and alien to human qualities. A few among the group including their leader Mace Anderson regular Sean Pertwee and Jimmy Pig Michael Chicklis attempt to connect but it's gorgeous Connie Nielsen who finally breaks the ice. He may be conditioned to kill but he's still a human man after all and there's some base instincts you just can't ignore. Trouble brews when Mekum shows up again that bastard. Now he wants to vaporize their planet on the grounds that the refugees are essentially squatting. Undermining him is Todd's former boss Church an unusually restrained Gary Busey an honorable military veteran who'd love to put Mekum six feet under and restore order. Todd must help his newfound friends fight tooth and nail against replicants and win his superiority back. Russell is a tank in the role letting both silence and action speak volumes a one man old school ass kicking hero of the highest order. The world building and outer space effects are incredibly fun the villains are broadly characterized with the force of a western and the whole film knows what people want for a good time at the cinema. Oohh and fun fact this takes place in the same cinematic universe as Blade Runner and you can listen for the brief tie in reference that only die hards will pick up on. Great stuff.".

What really surprised me was that Kurt Russell did such a great job with an extremely limited role.Imagine trying to act under these two restraints  you have hardly any dialogue and because you are playing a hardass military robot you are not allowed to show emotions using facial expressions!  Howzat?  Kinda like asking a diva to perform a great aria while gagged and ducttaped.  In spite of being verbally and expressionally handcuffed Russell pulls off an incredible characterization.  His robot becomes human in spite of the constraints.  Great job!As usual Jason Isaacs insures that he will go down in history as a great portrayer of the consummate villainthe one you'd love to see drawn and quartered.  Connie Nielsen was sweet soft motherly and gorgeous.  I'm not sure how much of my impression is based on her acting and how much on her physical beauty but it was hard to take one's eyes off her.  Unfortunately Gary Busey's role was too small and limited.  Much of the plot is quite standard with a fair amount of weaknesses but as it does have a scifi comic book feeling I don't see what's wrong with a few weaknesses.  By the end of the story the good guy wins and the appreciative audience receives a great deal of emotional satisfaction. Yes!The sort of feeb who thinks that Russell didn't do a good job of acting is the same sort of feeb who missed the whole point.".

	schema:reviewBody "Nine out of ten might seem like a high mark to give for a straight to video scifi movie that's been vilified at the US box office and roundly criticized as the poorest movie of Kurt Russell's career.I have my reasons.Firstly when you read negative reviews of this film they usually start with the wooden nature of Russell's interpretation of Todd the eponymous Soldier. I'm going to start here too with my surprising statement that this is possibly the finest piece of acting I've seen Russell pull off. Todd is an emotional cripple and suffering from intense PTSD  this movie being written before the phenomenon was as widely recognized as it is now.The portrayal is spot on. Todd is withdrawn uncommunicative and a loner. He suffers from irrational anxiety  keyed to a fever pitch by training that teaches him to analyze every movement and interaction with another human being for signs of betrayal and danger. His hyperfocus brings with it an inability to comprehend the bigger continuum that the tasks he is given to do sit within  there is a scene where he cuts himself slicing carrots and continues to work unfazed not cleaning up the cut or the blood. Many interpret this as a sign of his physical toughness and focus on the job at hand but it is also a sign that he is simply performing the requested task by rote  not comprehending the relationship between the vegetables he's preparing and the food that will be eaten later.Todd's dialog is spartan to say the least  the two big talking scenes he gets are central to the plot of the movie and both underline the bleak nature of his existence. Fear and Discipline we are told. Always. Fear to keep him pumped up to a hyper alert state where the smallest detail will not pass him by keeping him ready to react on a knife edge. Discipline to hold him in check through his fear to overcome it and perform tactically. The inference is that he has no time to think and cannot afford feelings. Many viewers have different interpretations of his reaction to the hug from Nielsen's Sandra  but I believe you have to interpret it from the perspective of a human who's only experience of an embrace is in combat  the trembling represents him suppressing his fight  flight instincts reacting to the fear of being grappled his movement and vision restricted  Fear and Discipline indeed.Then there is the subtext of his abandonment Twice in fact  so representative of the way our society tends to toss infantrymen onto the rubbish heap of society when they've served their terms. 40 of the unemployed are exmilitary in OUR world in HIS it can only be worse. Russell quickly picks up the mantle of Mace's responsibility to his wife and child  desperately in need of a mission even one with such a high likelihood of his death.Then there is the military subtext too  the conflict between Busey's Church and the hotshot from HQ Mekum. Mekum's new men are faster stronger more accurate and aggressive. Any one of them could pound Todd into the ground  but it's not about the tools you have it's how you use them. An incentivized Todd given the freedom to exercise his initiative and acting without the numbing effect of perceived superiority utilizes ambush tactics and sneaky tricks to cut a swathe through the newer unit  sent in without support cover or reconnaissance. It is a reminder that military power cannot make up for a failure in leadership.There are many other subtle themes. When a film is shot and scripted so minimally it leaves plenty of white space for your own interpretations to take root. Watch Soldier with an open mind and see what it teaches YOU.".

His most memorable part however was the character of hard man Snake Plessken in the two Escape films the second much worse than the first and the first notable mainly for Russell. And then comes this gem. Boy does this guy deliver. Not just the action scenes but  in the great tradition of Universal Soldier which arguably this copies from  in the acting as well. You look in his face and you feel the pain of being betrayed by the government. The story is superb in that it builds. In other reviews I have explained the mysterious secret of action movies ie that the brain of the viewer yearns for logic and order. If you deliver fight scenes that have each new fight based on the result of the last one you increase viewer satisfaction. Here viewer satisfaction goes off the chart. Nice riffs and children and violence opposites attract other neat stuff. Folks this is one of the greatest action films of all time and the group rating is just plain wrong. Greetings from both the future and the past the former relative to when this film was released the latter relative to those yet to find this review. Have just seen Soldier for the 9th time. It gets better each time which is more than I can say for the reviews panning it. It is an extraordinary work on so many levels  perfectly layered script a tale of redemption a tale of revenge a tale of young vs old new vs. proved a metaphor for civilization a metaphor for justice and worth. And again a tremendous goodbye from Russell to his fans from an actor who first appeared before the camera as a kid in the 50's and then found the grit here to deliver literally dialog with only his eyes.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have watched this movie about 50 times and enjoy it every time I see it. I disagree vehemently with the haters. I tend to be very hard on movies but just do not get why some people found this movie to be bad. One comment about not being a good plot I think is ludicrous. Kurt Russell was great Connie was also excellent as always as always transitioning from the unfeeling soldier to becoming more human. His demise and his rise from the ashes of the trash heap is stimulating and thoughtprovoking. And the action sequences are great wellthought out and very clean. I never understand why crappy movies get good reviews and great movies get crappy reviews. I had a recent conversation with a very bright Harvard grad who spoke classical Greek was a Latin scholar among his other credentials and an avid movie goer. He trashed all the recent movies I liked and had wonderful things to say about movies that were terrible. I guess people look for different things in film as in other aspect s of life. I think the reason why I liked this movie so much is that in the end the jerks who were in command got what was coming to them and revealed themselves as inferior to the soldiers of both kinds the new and the obsolete because they were indeed heartless and lacked backbone.I suppose one could criticize the people command as being a bit too stereotypical and predictable and onedimensional. But their part of the movie is incidental to the plot. They are supposed to be heartless bureaucrats people you love to hate. Another reason why I love this film is because just about every scene is memorable. There is nothing you need to fast forward over. I can list the scenes and every one is fun to watch and moves the plot forward. My point is that each scene has substance and makes one or more points for viewers to think about as the movie progresses toward its ultimate conclusion1. Opening scene with new soldiers compete with old 2. Kurt Russell soldier dumped on the junkyard planet 3. Kurt meets Connie and family and begins the process of shedding his motionlessness 4. Kurt saves ones of the settlers 5. Kurt lays groundwork for a new generation of settlers who learn how to better to defend themselves in difficult environments 5. Kurt cannot conform and is expelled 6. The troops arrive for maneuvers and attack the settlers 7. Retribution via Kurt 8. Redemption for himself his fellow comrades in arms and the settlers and a new life and a new family Kurt gets the girl and becomes a fatherIt works for me. I know that there many who disagree. I did not realize that this director did Event Horizon another great film. I like them both equally as well.".

As this is the only Tre Supermen film made in the Eighties it looks and feels a bit different than all the others. It also stars only one familiar Superman the verbally challenged Sal Borgese who is joined by two young blood Daniel Stephen and Steven Martin no not the gray haired one as well as a sexy blond FBI agent played by singer Gena Gas. Having traveled to Santa Domingo on the trail of a gang of dirty counterfeiters who are printing fake dollar bills our trio almost immediately gets involved in a very silly fight. Battling about 35 men this action sequence features more reverse shots than your average Six Million Dollar Man episode. Naturally the entire fight was just a diversion so the international villains can kidnap Gena. So the Supermen pretend to be Russian sailors by using the word 'tovarisch' in each sentence just like Colossus. Although there are no children in this film the intended audience seems to be aimed at under tens. The supporting characters look like cartoons the music is repetitive the action is too silly for words and while a couple of attractive women appear briefly much more time is spend watching the supermen change their outfits in their hotel room. On the other hand the drug lord does use a whip on two of his female accomplices but then again he speaks Spanish. As usual two of the three heroes dress up in drag and join a group of women on a yacht and most of the latter part of the film takes part either in the harbor or in the jungle familiar territory in the Tre Supermen series. 6 out of 10".

The use of footage from the producers' other movies for the film's underwater sub action and the special effects of a missile destroying part of a New York skyscraper are a bit distracting but everything else is pretty well done. It would have been nice to have JAG's Catherine Bell in a bigger part. The story isn't deep or anything but it has a good pace that never drags the action scenes are wellchoreographed and the music has a bigbudget feel that helps the film.

	schema:headline " Another Die Hard on a submarine. If you watch it you get what you deserve";
	schema:reviewBody "I like Michael Dudikoff. When he gets something he can work with he's not too shabby. Sadly that's a rarity for him. He's made countless STV films that are beneath him. This movie falls into that category in a big way. There have been plenty of action heroes who have taken a stab at doing Die Hard on a submarine. Dolph Lundgren Steven Seagal among some others. None of them have worked out well. I love Die Hard. It's one of the greatest action movies of all time but not only did it spawn 5 sequels but many imitators. It's been done to death in different ways. I believe Michael Dudikoff did a similar movie to this one called Counter Measures Which I have yet to see in case you are wondering The main problem with this movie like most movies that take place on a Submarine is that it's boring. There are fight scenes but they aren't that good. The villain is laughable. Reiner Schone does a poor man's Hans Gruber. He's as dull dishwater and brings nothing interesting to the part. At the very least he could have hammed it up and had some fun but he plays it completely seriously. Believe it or not it actually didn't start off that bad. I was enjoying Dudikoff's relationship with his son in this movie. They cut it too short for my liking. We also get a lame twist in the finale that comes out of left field. Michael Dudikoff tries hard but he's not enough to carry this movie. There isn't much action it's extremely talky it's poorly acted for the most part and the plot is highly unoriginal. Dudikoff is better than this crud210".

	onyx:emotionText "I like Michael Dudikoff. When he gets something he can work with he's not too shabby. Sadly that's a rarity for him. He's made countless STV films that are beneath him. This movie falls into that category in a big way. There have been plenty of action heroes who have taken a stab at doing Die Hard on a submarine. Dolph Lundgren Steven Seagal among some others. None of them have worked out well. I love Die Hard. It's one of the greatest action movies of all time but not only did it spawn 5 sequels but many imitators. It's been done to death in different ways. I believe Michael Dudikoff did a similar movie to this one called Counter Measures Which I have yet to see in case you are wondering The main problem with this movie like most movies that take place on a Submarine is that it's boring. There are fight scenes but they aren't that good. The villain is laughable. Reiner Schone does a poor man's Hans Gruber. He's as dull dishwater and brings nothing interesting to the part. At the very least he could have hammed it up and had some fun but he plays it completely seriously. Believe it or not it actually didn't start off that bad.

In his filmmaking career he is responsible for some of the most beautiful images ever to be put on a cinema screen.Nostalghia deals with a Russian poet who is in Italy to research the life of a Russian composer who died there.  Accompanied only by his female Italian interpretor who is attracted to him the poet feels strong feelings of homesickness for Russia and he strongly misses his wife and child who stayed behind.This was Tarkovsky's first film made outside the Soviet Union and his first in a language other than Russian but it is still very obviously a Tarkovsky film complete with many haunting images of water and fire.  in fact instead of the beautiful sundrenched Italy we are used to seeing on film here the country is grey wet and shrouded in mist.  As usual in Tarkovsky's films there are many changes between colour footage and blackandwhite or sepia.  Here the poet's memories of Russia are presented in monochrome.As with all Tarkovsky films Nostalghia demands a great deal from the viewer.  It is very slow moving and requires a great deal of patience and concentration.  Also be warned that Tarkovsky did not see cinema as entertainment but as an art form.  I would advise anyone to make the effort and stick with it though.  It is a great work of art.".

This shouldn't surprise an student of Tarkovsky's work since no director possibly with the exception of Ingmar Bergman analyzed spirituality as Tarkovsky did.NOSTALGHIA follows the trekking of a Russian traveling through Italy along with his beautiful interpreter. His purpose for being there does not come to the viewer easily. Most of the scenes in the movie are filled with a lot of silence and even the action that does take place is minimal. Eventually we come to understand that he is there to find some cultural reinforcement for his Russian background. As the film progresses we seem to take on the role of the main character in the story as an observer to events. Throughout his travels he becomes a witness to religious processions theological discussions and the rituals of a Godfearing lunatic. The lunatic played masterfully by Erland Josephson is looked down upon by a lot of local citizens. Apparently in the past he locked his family in his house for a long time anticipating the end of the World. The movie documents his effect on the Russian traveler and the traveler's longing to recapture his spirituality.A lot has been said of the tenminute unbroken sequence where the lead protagonist attempts to carry a lighted candle from one end of a pool to the other. Some see it as utterly boring. Personally I was fascinated. In it we see how the protagonist finally attempts to do something in order to recapture his spirituality. For the entire length of the movie he has been an observer now he is an active participant. To be fair his action does take the form of a ritual not the building of a church or water immersion but then again so much of spirituality is ritual. Tarkovsky correctly identifies how it's the continuity that helps us get through life knowing that some things will never change our strong religious convictions. That's when the protagonist finally comes to realize that action must take place. It's no coincidence that this scene takes place after a demonstration given by the Erland Josephson character. It's an amazing scene. In it he gives an intelligent speech about the desolation of art. It also imparts an important question to the viewer about those who truly make a difference in the world the observers or the insane who try to take positive action on the behalf of others.No praise of any Tarkovsky film is complete without talking about the technical angle of his work. In NOSTALGHIA Tarkovsky is proven again to be a master of beauty carving out beautiful images into the Italian landscape. Even the indoor scenes are beautiful.

I can't even think of any film that I've seen which tries to copy his style. It is inimitable. No one else is as patient. Tarkovsky's pans and zooms can take minutes. The penultimate sequence where a man has to carry a candle for a certain distance without it going out should be horribly boring. Any other director would have used a lot of cutting to produce suspense. Yet with Tarkovsky's brilliant direction without a single cut for nearly an entire reel it becomes one of the most suspenseful and yes one of the very best scenes ever captured on film.In fact the direction's almost too good. This isn't minimalist like some of his previous films such as Solaris and Stalker. It is more like Andrei Rublev not a second goes by that is not stuffed to the brim almost flowing over with brilliant and poetic images. In a way although in a good way this distracts the viewer. I was so bowled over by the images of Nostalghia that I had to watch it twice to understand it it was nearly as difficult the second time around not to be bowled over!. And I totally appreciate that. I was more than happy to explore this film more deeply on a second journey. Thank you Mr. Tarkovsky for making the films that you did. When you sought to fulfill your audiences' lives with your art you came closer to succeeding than any artist could have. Of course you couldn't have made life perfect nor would you have wanted to. For as you said if life were perfect art would be pointless. May my life always be imperfect.".

Are our memories of the past so intimately woven into our perceptions of ourselves that we cannot avoid irrational acts that imperil our future?

Do we take ourselves too seriously or have we overdeveloped our social political and scientific infrastructure to the extent that we are blind to the real world and threaten its existence?

But for some reason I don't find it so although there is the occasional longuer. It's one of the great films of cinema although certainly rather odd. Once again it has an impossibly glamourous Russian wandering about looking moody engrossed in the big issues. In fact the female lead falls for him and is exasperated by his absurd interest in a local derelict. She flashes a tit in erotic frustration which is unusual for Tarkovsky he seems unwilling to really engage in issues of sexuality preferring them to be chaste in an almost victorian manner. Certainly there was some accusations of a reactionary attitude to women for at the start of the film a priest tells the guide that she should sacrifice herself for the sake of raising children. She is made to look rather absurd in the film but in truth so do the male characters. Perhaps it was due to cultural traditions in Tarkovsky's background rather than deliberate misogyny.The Italians didn't take to this film as it did not film Italy in a vibrant manner preferring to evocate the alienation and melancholia of it's Russian lead. Tarkovsky's brilliance as a director is well illustrated in the film where the Russian and the old man talk in a room. The camera seems to turn a full 360 degrees although you don't notice it. The way his characters and objects seem to float in and out of frame is amazing. It's strange but nature seems to perform for Tarkovsky. Even the animals seem willing to be directed a dog staring straight into the camera with an almost unearthly and uncanny presence and stillness. The scene where the Russian lies on his hotel bed and his nostalgia conjurs up his dog in a dream like but also tangibly real manner is powerful and haunting.The problem with this film is that the lead character was not really in exile and could go home anytime unlike Tarkovsky himself so why was he in so much pain? Is it mere homesickness as opposed to the real longing for one's homeland rightly belonging to the truly disenfranchised? But perhaps that is not the issue more that when man finds himself and true wisdom is it too late in the day for him to use what he has learned? The self sacrifice of the old man is a return to an old theme of Tarkovsky's that perhaps only shame can save mankind.There are many eccentric aspects to this film for instance the Russian wandering around up to his waist in water. Also there is a brief and bizarre shot of an angel stomping around outside a house. As it's Tarkovsky you don't burst out laughing. Perhaps he reaches the parts other directors cannot reach.But there are also some vividly beautiful moments. The doves being released in the church and the light filtering through a stream of water in a gutted house. Towards the end of his career Tarkovsky began to question the rigid criteria he used in shooting a film in a way he felt won purity and aschewed the vulgar and trivial but I think he got it right here. A marvelous film.".

I'm sure this has happened to numerous others while they watch a David Lynch film or even one of the various mindbogglers released this past year. But Tarkovsky comes to us with a different approachan approach that I have not seen from any other director. It is an approach that reminds me of reading a poem. You read it onceyou don't comprehend it. You read it againit seems clearer. It may not be until that third reading that it finally clicks. Tarkovsky's images are not there to keep you puzzled they all have a meaning and a purposeyou just need to find what that meaning is. It may seem like there is much work involved and sometimes I would rather work for a film than be bowled over by its tepid scripting and mediocre direction. The one thing you would need above all would be patience because it is not the kind of film to watch halfasleep. The story at times is hard to grasp number one because it is in subtitles. It follows a Russian poet who is on a research mission in Italy with an Italian interpreter. There he is haunted by his past memories of his wife and children. One of the most amazing things I picked up was the subtle use of symbolism. You have to pick the film apart if you wanted to fully understand it and that is something that I enjoy doing. Tarkovsky leaves much to the mind. Such as the dialogue which is subtle as well and attention must be paid or you'll miss small but important details. It merely is there to move the story along softly scraping the surface. Otherwise the images must be analyzed.The camera shots consist of many slow zooms slow pans numerous still shots and semislow motion. Many instances the camera reveals some amazing imagery that is so perfect so beautiful that not only the most devout romanticist could appreciate. Actually the entire film is a series of gorgeous cinematography I couldn't tell you one shot I didn't like. The final shot of the film is incredible. Constructed both metaphorically and physically it shows the poet lying sideways on the ground with the top half of his body propped up with an arm. His dog lies next to him with his head on the ground. The camera pulls back steadily slowly. A house is revealed in the background. The shot pulls out further and the house seems smaller than the poet. When the zoom stops is shows everyone surrounded by tall pillars like the ruins of a temple. Then it begins to snow just a little that image holds for an entire minute before To the memory of my mother' appears on the screen. Puzzling exhausting yet beautiful and exhilarating. The film at many points touches religion and life mostly without answers. Attempting to find those answers is a task well worth the trouble. 12 out of ".

The shot pulls out further and the house seems smaller than the poet. When the zoom stops is shows everyone surrounded by tall pillars like the ruins of a temple. Then it begins to snow just a little that image holds for an entire minute before To the memory of my mother' appears on the screen. Puzzling exhausting yet beautiful and exhilarating. The film at many points touches religion and life mostly without answers. Attempting to find those answers is a task well worth the trouble. 12 out of ";

	schema:headline " Tarkovsky drowning in nostalgia.";
	schema:reviewBody "Nostalgia is essentially a dream play that opens with a hazy monochromatic vision of tranquil reflection which not only establishes the core themes behind the film's title but also informs the key emotional sequences that are here revisited by the central character throughout. As a result of this the film is as much about the feelings of loss and longing as it is about the lead character the homesick Russian poet Andrei Gortchakov who is exiled in Italy with his guide and translator Eugenia on a research mission into the life of a longforgotten 18th century composer. In the hands of any other filmmaker this plot would give way to a series of grand adventures and curious revelations but as we've seen in other films like the majestic Mirror and Andrei Rublev Tarkovsky is a filmmaker unconcerned with the external world of the film who instead turns his attentions inward to chronicle the internal angst and emotions at the heart of these tortured complicated souls.As is always the case with Tarkovsky's work it could be argued that the film has further shades that somehow draw parallels with the filmmaker's own life and works with the exiled main character here becoming the cinematic voice for Tarkovsky's own feelings of loss and nostalgia during the making of this film. Because of this the cinematic depiction of the small Italian village where the film takes place is one of the gloomiest and most barren creations ever presented especially in comparison to the kind of lush summery vistas that we're used to seeing from this particular geographic region. The locations used are desolate dilapidated overrun with moss and ivy and swept in a constant haze of fine rain and morning fog which allows the filmmaker to create a number of slow and haunting visual meditations that further the actual plot... but also help to visualise the innerturmoil felt by Gortchakov at this difficult crossroad in his life. As is always the case with Tarkovsky the visual design of the film is meticulously created and deeply hypnotic with the production design creating an emotional labyrinth for the characters which is then rigorously explored by the camera.The use of cinematography is always an important factor is Tarkovsky's work because it is so vital in creating and then distinguishing between these varying layers of reality fantasy memory and premonition  with the filmmaker employing a variety of techniques from cross cutting between sepiatone and defused colour and the juxtaposition between regular speed and slow motion. The use of those slow mesmerising zooms bringing to mind Kubrick's masterpiece Barry Lyndon and those complicated tracking shots only add to the lingering tension and escalating melancholy that is perfectly established throughout the film's lethargic first act. The film is deliberately slow like the majority of this filmmaker's work with the camera moving at it's own pace in order to linger and meditate on certain images and moments. The editing too is deliberate in it's pace with a number of scenes unfolding with a minimum of two to three cuts per scene Tarkovsky always allowing the slow movement of the camera to do much of the work normally covered by the editing which can on occasion particularly the first viewing become quite tiresome. It does nonetheless ultimately tie in with the inner feelings and emotions so synonymous with the title and is integral to the inner pain felt by our central characters.Into the mix of things we also get a dose of the mystical supplied here by the character of Domenico another tortured soul who's backstory involves keeping his family hostage for a prolonged number of years under fear that the world would end. Domenico like Gortchakov and indeed Tarkovsky is another one of those haunted souls inhabiting an earth they don't really understand whilst questioning their place in the world and the world within the cosmos. Towards the end of the film Domenico will rant atop a statue about all manner of deep theoretical issues before Tarkovsky launches into two of the most astounding sequences he ever created. The first is a brutal and literally jawdropping act of emotional and physical catharsis set to the strains of a distorted Beethoven whilst the other is a long and slow meditation on fate and probably the most iconic scene in this film involving an empty pool a lighted candle and a weary heartbroken Gortchakov.Nostalgia is a deep and thoughtful film best suited to those viewers who are interested in spending some time with a film that takes a great deal of time to fully reveal it's self. Like the majority of Tarkovsky's films it is bleak dreamlike and hypnotic in the way in which the images just linger on the screen waiting to be decoded. Some might be frustrated by the slow pace and the reliance on character over narrative however if you are an admirer of Tarkovsky's best films like Andrei Rublev Mirror and The Sacrifice then you'll be sure to find something of interest here.".

Sometimes the space contains another space either a landscape or a dream space. Sometimes the space contains sometimes it releases. Sometimes it contains water sometimes excluding it sometimes both. Sometimes after you feel you have explored a space thoroughly he languidly reveals a whole new insight. Sometimes it produces spatial impossibilities. Always the notion of space preexists the conceptions we receive. Always the poet's challenge is defined in terms of the elements of built form.I only know a few others of Tarkovsky's work so far but his breadth already amazes though they appear superficially similar. I think I would recommend Rublev' as a first. It makes the work less for a film like this because you already know how he projects the creative angst of the artist from the character into the folds of your mind. How he invents an architectural eye by long continuous shots anchored to the earth even when in a balloon but freely fluid. Always curious always searching.This is a lifealtering work.

The point is that different filming materials can emphasize different perspectives from different people or different periods in the life of the same person.  Luminous or dark.

Nevertheless there are instances where Tarkovsky doesn't seem to know what he wanted exactly and motives stay implicit unfortunately.  But that's poetry.

Anyway there is a strong taste of longing for association of people in the present in the future and even in the past throughout the film.Nostalghia is almost entirely as far the dialogue part of the film goes in Italian language and the music consists exclusively from legendary composers with some experimental touches here and there.  It is on the verge of being arthouse with its sometimes subtle and sometimes experimental light and sound FX.  Even the dog seems to have had acting classes.

The thin plot line is torn apart there is no connection between the plots of exile what a great plot for Tarkovskij this could have been! and the plot of saving the world by sacrifying yourself. Domenico the lunatic is just not fascinating. You feel that Andrej cannot understand Eugenia just as Andrej the director can't. The dialogues are awfully pseudointellectual the fixation on Christian faith just penetrant compare Stalker which is all about faith but without the churches  even God himself speaks. The story of carrying a burning candle through a pool and thereby saving the world can hardly be told without exposing it to ridiculousness. Andrej's death is hardly prepared as young and healthy as he looks this just feels like a deus ex machina. In a word Nostalghia is boring and selfindulgent. Maybe it is not a good idea to name your protagonist like yourself although there was no problem in Andrej Rubljow and letting him read your brother's poems. What could have been great scenes in great films look here like mere selfplagiarisms. And there are scenes where Tarkovskij's genius rises drinking wodka in the bath arches and talking to a child one of the few scenes where Andrej comes to life the final scene with the candle the scene in Domenico's house.

Many filmmakers go to Italy and immerse themselves in the people and the culture the light and the atmosphere. Tarkovsky goes to Italy and he makes it as dank dark and unpopulated as he makes Russia. And while in Italy he has a few things to say about Italiansto explain Russia.Then you can't understand Italy because you're not Italian. A poet goes to Italy to research into the biography of a Russian composer who stayed there for two years and his life parallels that of the composer. Just so Tarkovsky's life parallels that of the main character who is also called Andrei left in Italy surrounded by so much beauty it's sickening he becomes haunted by flashbacks of his family in Russia. Trying unsuccessfully to communicate with his translator get it? and striking a metaphysical relationship with a local mystic Andrei the character struggles with the typical Tarkovskian themes of faith fire personal loss and water among others.Tarkovsky is up to some wellrehearsed tricks here. Long takes with an impossibly smooth floating camera dedicate the viewer's eyes to the imagery. The weather is under the same amount of control. A character enters a new space here it's Italy in Stalker it's the Zone in Solyaris it's the space station in Andrei Rublev it's the society outside the church and only through intense emotional and philosophical struggle can he prepare himself to return to where he's come from. Thresholds stand tantalizingly around but don't often get passed Andrei can walk through a door that leads nowhere with no problem but can only cross a pool with a candle with immense physical struggle. Spaces are separated by black and white and sepia tones. God is always there but never for you.There's some new tricks too. Tarkovsky plays with light a lot in this one and frames that seem to sink into pure black suddenly illuminate hidden images and icons. A compelling sonic disturbance is created in flashbacks to Russia that sound like a tablesaw grinding away at wood The Music the mystic speaks of is warped and fragmented vinyl.Nostalghia I feel is not the Tarkovsky movie you want to see first. First see Stalker or Solyaris or Mirror. Nostalghia removes the transition from Russia to Italy and so the feeling of transition and change is a lot more dependent on the symbolic and abstract sensibilities and previous knowledge of Tarkovsky's imagery will help to interpret it. For fans of Tarkovsky however Nostalghia is a sweet and personal return into his dense and foggy mind or house as Chris Marker calls it the world that only he was able to fully explore.PolarisDiB".

I'll also use this opportunity to say thanks to Cold Bishop and the other morons for taking my texts so seriously  and making me laugh very loudly!Secondly let me explain the high 7.9 rating on IMDb. Only around 2000 people voted and they're mostly film students who FORCE themselves to like movies like this and other pretentious boredomseekers who find thrills in watching grass grow. Nostalghia is the IDEAL film to fall asleep to. I speak from experience.I absolutely loved Solaris and Stalker two brilliant intelligent scifi dramas. On the other side of the Tarkovsky spectrum I was utterly confused by The Mirror  which had zero story to tell though occasionally visually very nice I was mostly bored to tears by Andrey Rublev nearly 4 hours! but thought The Sacrifice his last movie was okay in spite of being in Swedish an unpleasant language.Tarkovsky's two scifi films are based on good novels and this may be the crucial point. It seems that he is pretty much lost when doing his own material. He gets bogged down in his dull poetry and philosophy not bothering to interconnect various parts of the two in a cohesive manner failing to focus on the essentials. Hence all his other nonscifi movies are not much better than all the other pretentious European crap from various Godards Bunuels Bergmans Triers and other overrated lazy geniuses.Nostalghia is an overly pretentious nonstory that is far too selfindulgent even for a European director. If you make movies just for your own artistic pleasure then why even bother releasing them? This twohour snoozefest could have been EASILY cut down to half that length  and it would still not be fascinating. Watching the main character walk around endlessly without saying or doing anything is just GARBAGE filmmaking. Lazy and madewritten by someone who overestimated himself a tad.The positive side to this movie  apart from the fact that it made me fall asleep  are some visually stunning scenes. Especially the long shots of water which are pleasant if a little sleepinducing because they may be TOO pleasant. Tarkovsky seemed to have some kind of an almostfetish for aqua because he filmed it in all its visual and audio glory in nearly ever movie he made.My advice to those who consider this a masterpiece is to stop lying to yourselves about your own intelligence hence to quit being in denial about how you TRULY honestly perceive certain movies. Writing about a movie such as this being a stroke of genius is just one of many ways some people deal with an inferiority complex.Erland Josephson as uncharismatic as he has been in all his Bergman movies is a poor choice for the insane man. Besides what was the point Tarkovsky was trying to make? That he is sane and the rest of us are the insane ones? What a clich idea! So trite. And how about that last scene a 250minute scene it seemed of the Russian character carrying the candle for the insane man? Was this symbolic of something? Trying to save the world? The world needs saving from very pretentious boring movies.Erland's character locked up his family for seven years. Hence he is not only insane but should be put away for life. End of story. What can we possibly learn from Erland? His impassioned idiotic leftwing backtothecaves speech was just dumb. It's something a 17 yearold manicdepressive idealist would write.Besides some nicely photographed scenes there was a pleasant scene where the blonde actress bares one of her breasts.Tarkovsky portrays Italy as a gloomy dark depressing place. I have no idea why. If Italy looks like this what should he do with Russia or Finnland??Sick and tired of Eurotrash classics i.e. bad overrated dramas? Email me if you want to read my totally altered subtitles of Ingmar Bergman's Autumn Sonata Cries  Whispers or Passion Of Anne but also the nonBergman Der Untergang.".

	schema:headline " almost too obtuse with some of its poetry but it's the work of a master nonetheless";
	schema:reviewBody "Nostalghia a film Andrei Tarkovsky directed while he was out of Russia and in Italy is almost as personal if not moreso than his film the Mirror. The main character's first name is Andrei there's mention of a poet named Tarkovsky possibly Andrei's own father if I'm not mistaken the main character while trying to do something else with his time write a biography on a musician is distracted by his personal turmoil over his family who are back in his homeland as was Tarkovsky to a degree he might have been in exile I'm not sure. And on top of this we're given a substantial amount of black and white scenes often either in slowmotion speed or directed by Tarkovsky to seem like such from dreams and memories that call for a time and place that is specific but also ethereal strange and probably symbolic.So why then does the film not work if the creator's soul was poured entirely into it? I think perhaps there is almost too much of a reliance on creating a mood of meditation for there to be total concentration upon the atmosphere that Tarkovsky has created as he has in all of his movies upon which is a sort of world unto itself seen through its filmmaker in a way no other can see it. This may be expected for one already familiar with the director's methods but even still there's so many silent moments so many long takes with the most slight of camera movements so much contemplation in place of dialog there's only a few scenes where we see characters communicate in that manner that it takes a lot out of the viewer to stay with the ideal of spiritual redemption that Tarkovsky is after.Or is it redemption? Is it just simply a quest into oneself? Why does Andrei follow Domenico brilliantly played in subtlenotsosubtle form by Erland Josephsson who cannot be really relied upon as a source of redemption or actual thought provocation? This is a man after all who yells out his speeches to bewildered crowds in a town square and then proceeds to go through a very severe act on himself to Beethoven's 9th no less! There's a lot of mystery to this character Andrei and the actor portraying him Oleg Jankovsky is so subdued and detached at times that his female translator counterpart possibly mad as well can barely get a rise out of him save for the bloody nose. This strange sensation to seek in to a character that Tarkovsky leaves open to much interpretation plus the procession of shots that seem to last for about as long as imaginable makes it an uneasy viewing experience.But at the same time that there's this uneasiness there's also a wonderment that is going on as well. I couldn't pull myself away even if a part of my mind screamed out where's the plot? There's such a strong sense of direction going on the moods created in certain places i.e. the fog over the hot springs at the Spa the darkness in the bedrooms the chilling sensibility to the flashbacksdreams almost in spite of the lack of a really solid story as it becomes less about what happens than about what is in this character the nature of this exile in Italy as it makes Andrei pull into his own existential finale of sorts. That finale as some may have read is extraordinary maybe the whole reason as with Sacrifice's fire finale that Tarkovsky made the movie in the first place the poet carries a candle as suggested by Domenico across a sacred pool and when it goes out he goes back and does this again and again until finally he makes it across. Never a cutaway always intuitively shot by Tarkovsky's cameraman and it brings on a whole other quality that crosses paths between what is fiction in the film and reality in front of the camera.While I praise the film and recommend it it's not the kind of work that someone who isn't familiar at all with Tarkovsky should see as an introduction. On the contrary this might be more worthwhile as the final work in his saddeningly small body of work as its pace and modus operandi can be further appreciated. Grade A".

And on top of this we're given a substantial amount of black and white scenes often either in slowmotion speed or directed by Tarkovsky to seem like such from dreams and memories that call for a time and place that is specific but also ethereal strange and probably symbolic.So why then does the film not work if the creator's soul was poured entirely into it? I think perhaps there is almost too much of a reliance on creating a mood of meditation for there to be total concentration upon the atmosphere that Tarkovsky has created as he has in all of his movies upon which is a sort of world unto itself seen through its filmmaker in a way no other can see it. This may be expected for one already familiar with the director's methods but even still there's so many silent moments so many long takes with the most slight of camera movements so much contemplation in place of dialog there's only a few scenes where we see characters communicate in that manner that it takes a lot out of the viewer to stay with the ideal of spiritual redemption that Tarkovsky is after.Or is it redemption? Is it just simply a quest into oneself? Why does Andrei follow Domenico brilliantly played in subtlenotsosubtle form by Erland Josephsson who cannot be really relied upon as a source of redemption or actual thought provocation? This is a man after all who yells out his speeches to bewildered crowds in a town square and then proceeds to go through a very severe act on himself to Beethoven's 9th no less! There's a lot of mystery to this character Andrei and the actor portraying him Oleg Jankovsky is so subdued and detached at times that his female translator counterpart possibly mad as well can barely get a rise out of him save for the bloody nose. This strange sensation to seek in to a character that Tarkovsky leaves open to much interpretation plus the procession of shots that seem to last for about as long as imaginable makes it an uneasy viewing experience.But at the same time that there's this uneasiness there's also a wonderment that is going on as well. I couldn't pull myself away even if a part of my mind screamed out where's the plot? There's such a strong sense of direction going on the moods created in certain places i.e. the fog over the hot springs at the Spa the darkness in the bedrooms the chilling sensibility to the flashbacksdreams almost in spite of the lack of a really solid story as it becomes less about what happens than about what is in this character the nature of this exile in Italy as it makes Andrei pull into his own existential finale of sorts. That finale as some may have read is extraordinary maybe the whole reason as with Sacrifice's fire finale that Tarkovsky made the movie in the first place the poet carries a candle as suggested by Domenico across a sacred pool and when it goes out he goes back and does this again and again until finally he makes it across. Never a cutaway always intuitively shot by Tarkovsky's cameraman and it brings on a whole other quality that crosses paths between what is fiction in the film and reality in front of the camera.While I praise the film and recommend it it's not the kind of work that someone who isn't familiar at all with Tarkovsky should see as an introduction. On the contrary this might be more worthwhile as the final work in his saddeningly small body of work as its pace and modus operandi can be further appreciated. Grade A";

This isn't something you can watch with half your mind on what you're going to buy at the grocery store. What I love the most about this movie is that you can see the characters thinking.

Tarkovsky uses a great deal of visual metaphores as well you have to pay close attention to what you're watching.

The church scene in the beginning of the movie is one. Then the bath place scene and the scene where the Russian talks with THE MAN in Josephson's interpretation. Yet by the end of it I felt more sad disturbed and hopeless than with any other of Tarkovsky's movies or any other movies in general. What is the message the hidden message behind this film? Why does THE MAN set fire to himself? And did the Russian really manage to save the human kind?It all left me more depressed than I've ever been only Arlington Road and Donnie Darko made me feel the same. And in the end between the strange dream sequences Josephson's metaphysic theories and Yankovsky's grim performance I came out feeling like I was cheated for THE THING. That thing that was there in Andrei Rublyov Solaris and Stalker.Anyway this is perhaps the most existentialistic of Tarkovsky's films which should say something about it's nature and serve as a warning to those who intend to see it. It is a haunting deeply personal and unreserved journey to redemption and knowing this was the director's last Soviet film it adds a symbolical value to the film. Still together with Zerkalo this is one of the few Tarkovsky's films which is impossible to enjoy as it is too dark and painful.910".

Pomponito in San Francisco Bay a great attraction to visit by the way while underwater and interior shots reveal a sub and a sprawling interior that looks like he came from an episode of SEAQUEST. A lot of scenes look rushed like the filmmakers were running out of time and said Let's finish so we can return the equipment before it's overdue. As a result performances are lackluster scenes are choppy and seemed unfinished and just the overall production looks bad. The subplot that runs throughout the film set in Russia always confused me. I could never tell what the purpose of it was what relation it had or may not have had to the events occuring on the submarine. The climactic fight on the deck of the sub between Dudikoff and bad guy James Horan is probably the best moment in the whole film though even it could have been better. But the way the bad guy gets it is actually one of my favorite climax moments from a Dudikoff film. But it's really not enough to save the film or make it recommendationworthy. The DudikoffFred Olen Ray director team faired better with FUGITIVE MIND and THE SHOOTER. If you want a see a good movie about terrorists seizing a nuclear submarine and really the only movie so far to feature that concept that I know of Dudikoff's CRASH DIVE is much better.".

	schema:reviewBody "More madness from the mind of Fred Olen Ray! Can anyone confirm he and Jim Wynorski are two different people? Has anyone ever seen them together in the same place at the same time? Anyway in this underwater escapade that is highly reminiscent of Under Siege1992 ... When Navy medic Captain Jake Fuller's brother is murdered by Russian spies Jake goes underwater to investigate. Even though Jake is a pacifist and doesn't want to fight evil Russians take over the supersub Odessa and plan to blow uptake over the world. Only he and Lt. Swain Wendy Schumacher of skinemax softcore fame here strangely credited as Alexander Keith can save the day so they both board the sub. The Russians and their special gas that makes people vomit yellowish green liquid are no match for these two. Will Fuller and Swain be able to stop Operation Hailstorm and prevent a new cold war? Remember the Wynorski vehicles Desert Thunder 1999 and Stealth Fighter 1999? Just change the fact that those had to do with planes and switch that to a submarine and there you have it. It even has the trademark stock footage we've come to know and love. The Dolph Lundgren classic Agent Red 2000 is basically a remake of Counter Measures and uses some of the same footage. But where did Counter Measures get their stock footage? The world may never know.One of the funny things about Counter Measures is that it is solely cast with celebrity lookalikes. Besides Dudikoff and Schumacher the rest of the cast resemble Tim Roth Michael Imperioli Bob Newhart and Christopher Titus who strangely enough was actually in Crash Dive 1997 the movie to which Counter Measures is a sequel. But the lookalike in Counter Measures plays a different character than the one Titus did in Crash Dive so it must be a weird coincidence.Also in the weird department on the back of the VHS box released in the U.S. on Avalanche Michael Dudikoff's character is said to be Zach Silver. Seeing as his name is Jake Fuller in the film where did this name come from? Apparently someone just made it up. Did they not watch the movie? You don't see that type of error often.Dudikoff turns on the charm when he could easily go on autopilot and let his cool hair do all the work. Instead he brings some funny body language and interesting mannerisms to his character of Jake Fuller NOT Zach Silver. He is as animated here as he was in the awesome TV show Cobra where he played Robert Scandal Jackson.On the negative side there is some jumpy editing as well as some jumbled plotting and cheaplooking sets but all that is to be expected and the presence of Dudikoff and the rest of the cast whoever they may look like smooths it all over. you will probably be entertained by Counter Measures.For more insanity please visit comeuppancereviews.com".

Swain Wendy Schumacher of skinemax softcore fame here strangely credited as Alexander Keith can save the day so they both board the sub. The Russians and their special gas that makes people vomit yellowish green liquid are no match for these two. Will Fuller and Swain be able to stop Operation Hailstorm and prevent a new cold war? Remember the Wynorski vehicles Desert Thunder 1999 and Stealth Fighter 1999? Just change the fact that those had to do with planes and switch that to a submarine and there you have it. It even has the trademark stock footage we've come to know and love. The Dolph Lundgren classic Agent Red 2000 is basically a remake of Counter Measures and uses some of the same footage. But where did Counter Measures get their stock footage? The world may never know.One of the funny things about Counter Measures is that it is solely cast with celebrity lookalikes. Besides Dudikoff and Schumacher the rest of the cast resemble Tim Roth Michael Imperioli Bob Newhart and Christopher Titus who strangely enough was actually in Crash Dive 1997 the movie to which Counter Measures is a sequel. But the lookalike in Counter Measures plays a different character than the one Titus did in Crash Dive so it must be a weird coincidence.Also in the weird department on the back of the VHS box released in the U.S. on Avalanche Michael Dudikoff's character is said to be Zach Silver. Seeing as his name is Jake Fuller in the film where did this name come from? Apparently someone just made it up. Did they not watch the movie? You don't see that type of error often.Dudikoff turns on the charm when he could easily go on autopilot and let his cool hair do all the work. Instead he brings some funny body language and interesting mannerisms to his character of Jake Fuller NOT Zach Silver. He is as animated here as he was in the awesome TV show Cobra where he played Robert Scandal Jackson.On the negative side there is some jumpy editing as well as some jumbled plotting and cheaplooking sets but all that is to be expected and the presence of Dudikoff and the rest of the cast whoever they may look like smooths it all over. you will probably be entertained by Counter Measures.For more insanity please visit comeuppancereviews.com";

	schema:reviewBody "Michael Dudikoff's popularity as an action hero is a mystery that I'll probably never understand but his output on the directtovideo market was pretty consistent even as the home video slump of the late 90s began. 1998's COUNTER MEASURES may be a pretty good vehicle as far as fans are concerned but can be regarded as an average lowbudget adventure for the rest of us. Full of Cold War throwbacks and an agreeable amount of decent action this is the fare of slow Saturday nights or Dudikoff completionists.The story A Navy SEALturnedmedic Dudikoff finds himself trapped on a nuclear submarine commandeered by the crew of a merciless idealist James Horan planning to recreate the Soviet Union by starting a world war.The film is directed by cheapo connoisseur Fred Olen Ray whose economic style is evident in the ample use of recycled footage and the unconvincing submarine set. Beyond this the movie is competently made but registers a notable cheese factor for its laughably patriotic antired overtones an anthemic orchestra kicks in every time we catch sight of a US naval ship while many scenes featuring Russian characters open with a foreboding bellicose score. Villain James Horan is about as evil as the script demands of him but is all the more memorable for it  at least more so than Dudikoff. Dudikoff's sidekick is played by shortlived action star Alexander KeithWendy Schumacher whose conventional role was probably edited to allow for some buttkicking when the producers found out that she puts on a better fight scene than Michael.Speaking of fight scenes they are the heart of this one's action content which is otherwise limited to some shootouts and a hohum submarine battle. The eight fights are middleoftheroad type stuff even when considering the most exciting ones like Keith's twoonone brawl and the unexpectedly sound encounter of Lada Boder. Dudikoff is serviceable and makes grisly use of a corkscrew in more than one brawl but his fights are not only predictable they sometimes go beyond general suspension of disbelief. For example I'd buy that Dudikoff's character can defeat the one played by MMA heavyweight Oleg Taktarov but I have a hard time believing in the ridiculously slow strikes of a fire extinguisher that he uses to do the job.Nevertheless the fact that the movie keeps a good pace and is never boring is enough to buy it a passing score from me. If you're a general action fan and not too disappointed by the fact that the fighter jets featured on the DVD cover don't seem to appear in the movie you may have the same impression.".

But the Odessa has been hijacked by terrorists planning to create a new Soviet Union by launching the Hailstorm  an experimental nuclear cluster bomb that is highly unstable  onto Russian cities so that the Russian military will reclaim the former Soviet states in retaliation. Fuller is drugged  locked into a room while the terrorists make their way to Syria. But Fuller quickly recovers aided by his nurse Swain who has a secret mission of her own planning to counterattack  kill the terrorists.It is interesting what happens in the real world while reviewing a film. The premise of Counter Measures  terrorists plan to force the Russian military into taking over former satellite states in retaliation for a perceived threat  has become somewhat accurate to an alarming degree. But thankfully no nuclear bombs have been used. The film was released in 1998  a good decade  a half before what happened in Eastern Ukraine where rebels determined to prevent the Ukraine joining the EU embarked on a terrorist campaign in order to 'liberate' their towns by illegal means. This little war bolstered by the Russian annexation of Crimea an expected move since the region has Russian warships stationed there became infamous when the rebels using a Russianmade  supplied surface to air missile shot down a civilian jetliner over their skies killing all on board. Russian complicity in this mess is obvious.Anyway back to the film Counter Measures known in some places as Crash Dive 2 is a cardcarrying member of the Royal Oaks studio  is directed by the veteran director Fred Olen Ray who uses a pseudonym here for some reason. As far as action films go the film is a bit of a disappointment due to the rather poor writing skills of Steve Latshaw one of Jim Wynorski's hatchetmen writers  somebody who clearly doesn't do any factchecking when it comes to writing his scripts. Everywhere you look there are mistakes  the Navy SEALs don't use Kalashnikov assault rifles as part of their kit the Russian Navy won't deploy a submarine with a weapon that hasn't been properly tested on board in case of disaster  the US Navy's officers won't go out of their way to confront somebody who has been a decorated SEAL even if he is indeed a 'conscientious objector'. And one thing I thought was kind of silly was the idea of Russian terrorists using a Nazimade nerve agent to kill their victims  wouldn't it be better to use Russianmade nerve gas instead in order to disguise the hijacking? With Latshaw's writing skills factored in Counter Measures is not terribly innovative in any way  the action scenes sometimes go to absurd lengths  key part being the scene where Dudikoff takes on a pistolarmed terrorist played by Jason Voorhees himself  Kane Hodder only to shoot himself in the leg as well as Alexander Keith's semipathetic attempts to fight her assailants despite being shot twice  badly beaten. The story's twists are so predictable that you'll see them coming a kilometre away in advance  the final climax is a little on the implausible side.If I had to make a recommendation it would be to try to find the cheapest copy of Counter Measures around watch it then turn the DVD into a novelty coaster if you're not satisfied with it. I sure did  and at 2 a disc it didn't break the bank.".

When he tells her he found another career woman and is willing to stick it out with her and is engaged to her Beth feels that there is no one for her. And when she goes to Rome to attend her sister's impromptu wedding and after meeting the best man Nick she's attracted to him but after seeing him with another woman she gets drunk and goes into the famed Fountain of Love and takes some coins thrown by people looking for love. When she goes back to New York four men start coming onto her. And Nick keeps calling her asking her out. She later learns that what she didis a no no. It seems legend says that if you take a coin out of the fountain the person who threw it will fall in love with who took the coin. So she has to find a way to break the curse. And she wonders if Nick whom she likes is with her cause he wants to or if he is under the spell.";

	schema:reviewBody "With the release of 2009's moderate hit He's Just Not That Into You audiences proved that with enough star power even the most mediocre of films could make a smash at the box office. Following the trend 2010's first romantic comedy 'When In Rome' hopes to achieve the same success with similar tactics. Sadly if it's level of quality were indicative of how far it's legs will take it the film may have been better off as a straight to DVD release.The star powered film stars such frontline actors as Josh Duhamel Kristen Bell and Danny DeVito with an ensemble of Blisters that seems to never end. Focusing on Beth Harper played monotonously by Bell the movie is a meld of fantasy comedy and a lack of fresh ideas in Hollywood. The film begins the moment that Bell's lead character drunkenly delves for coins in the bottom of Italy's 'Fontana De Amoure' a poor choice which leads to five wouldbestalkers falling in love with her. The rest of the film is devoted to her trying to discover whether the one man she does love Nick Beaman Josh Duhamel is truly her match or merely the same as the rest of the crazed lunatics she's trying to avoid.While the film maintains it's good intentions of romantic comedy lore there are simply too many wincing moments that seem so terribly dated quite often put on display with use of Duhamel's character and the poles that he repeatedly walks into as example. In terms of overall acting audiences may prove genuinely surprised by the lead male's performance as the exTransformer star manages to successfully portray himself as the flawed charmer he is  all despite the massive chasm of chemistry that he shares or doesn't with Bell. In terms of the acting from the 'Veronica Mars' star Bell's fifteen minutes of fame seem to be quickly drawing to a close as she continues her simplistic emotionless portrayal of a girl that is just ever so unique or at least wishes she was.In regards to the nearly nonexistent script there are a few genuine moments that play out as the Director mostprobably intended them too  that is to say that they managed to get a laugh from the audience a sad rarity throughout the flicks 91 minutes  a runtime that seems to drag on for at least half an hour too long. Without a doubt slapstick is the ruling theory of comedy in this film but if one manages to pay close enough attention they may find themselves appreciating some of the more subtle jabs. Likewise the observant viewer will undoubtedly take notice of the plethora of cameos speckled across the film  keep an eye out for the 'Napoleon Dynamite' nod Pedro included.With all this said the film is by no means the worst thing to hit screens in recent memory  said trophy belongs to the more deserved 'Toothfairy'  but it definitely has it's niche audience. A definite date movie movie buffs may want to take a pass on this for the time being particularly with the multitude of OscarBait movies making their way to to screen. For those truly unsure about the flick take a safety  wait until it's release on DVD to give it a go if you play by the rule of 'Kirsten Bell Looks Confused Again it could even make a halfdecent drinking game.".

All I need to do is have an annoying hard working bitter female who has given up on love somehow finds it with bland purse accessory man their romance falls in some way for 10 minutes but they find that they really do love each other and all ends well. Bam I have at least 5 million dollars only problem being that this way is too easy and other directors have beaten me to it. In this case we have When In Rome a wonderfully pretentious and predictable romantic comedy that tries way too hard in the slap stick comedy department. Kristen Bell is still somewhat hot off the more humorous romantic comedy Forgetting Sarah Marshall and Hollywood is testing to see if she's leading lady material. Let me tell you something if this is the first choice she's going to make to prove that she can bank in a big hit movie she failed big time. The movie bombed hoping that this will lead to Hollywood giving up on the stupid predictable plots non existent chemistry between two young hot actors who are getting by on looks and the most bland jokes in the world When In Rome was just a bad movie.A successful and single art curator Beth is at a point in her life where love seems like a luxury she just can't afford. Years of waiting for the perfect romance has made Beth bitter. One day she flies to Rome to attend her younger sister Joan's impulsive wedding. She meets Nick who rescues her in a couple of difficult situations but is just as much of a clumsy clod as she is. They hit it off well and reach a point where both parties take an interest in the other. Just as Beth convinces herself to believe in love again she sees Nick kissing another woman who turns out to be the groom's 'crazy cousin'. Slightly drunk she picks up coins from the fountain of love. She later learns from Joan that legend says if you take coins from the fountain the owner of the coin will fall in love with you. She has to return the coins to the fountain to break the spell.There are times where I really do want to be like my other girlfriends and think that these movies are so cute and sweet it's a curse seeing so many movies at times because I guess I'm the stick in the mud when it comes to girl night and a movie. But I guess it's also a blessing because I'd rather see these movies for what they really are and honestly I hate to say it but these romantic comedies are sick ways for Hollywood to make more money without putting any effort in. Kristen Bell doesn't work well as a lead actress and had no chemistry with the other actors. Her character wasn't likable at all and was so predictable why do all these female characters have to be bitter? Come on Kristen Bell having a hard time finding love? Not completely unrealistic but highly unbelievable still. She has a hard tough boss the cute likable sister who was lucky enough to find love and the typical friends who have to encourage her to find love still. I know what you are thinking as you are reading my comment Why if you hate romantic comedies so much do you continue to watch them? my answer is that I always have a little hope for film when I start watching it but when I see it going in the same direction as the last time when it's just another copy and paste story that's when I give up. I just feel the need to warn the world of this sick plot to get innocent people's money but I guess it's their choice and no I will not recommend this film if my life depended on it and it's forced uncomfortable humor.110".

	schema:reviewBody "Well if you saw the trailers you know the premise girl in Rome decides to pick up coins from a fountain which invokes the original owner when the coin was tossed to fall in love with her....First they missed the comedic opportunity to have ONE of those people be a girl but whatever I guess it is only men who toss coins in the fountain in hope of love.What was on the screen was fine. The actors all gave comedic performances up to that of previous RomCom formula films. The problem with the film is what is NOT there. This film seems to suffer from being over edited and cut down to 91 minutes. We get a short setup to TRY and empathize with the leads and we get no and I mean ZERO background on the other men competing for love other than their career choice before watching them behave silly. At the end we get a very brief explanation of from where each love stricken pursuer life was prior to being hoodwinked but its too late and provides no fulfillment.The movie plays out many jokes and gags that have no pay off since there was nothing behind them. There are a few moments where a punchline obviously had some meaning in the relationships of the characters but seems unfunny as the meat and plot behind the joke is missing.In the end we get a shell of a movie it has a nice frosting but the cake has been stripped!! It seemed like if they had left some of what was obviously cut in the film it could have been really good. But the final product we get lacks anything memorable.Skip at the high priced theater and wait for video.".

	onyx:emotionText "Well if you saw the trailers you know the premise girl in Rome decides to pick up coins from a fountain which invokes the original owner when the coin was tossed to fall in love with her....First they missed the comedic opportunity to have ONE of those people be a girl but whatever I guess it is only men who toss coins in the fountain in hope of love.What was on the screen was fine. The actors all gave comedic performances up to that of previous RomCom formula films. The problem with the film is what is NOT there. This film seems to suffer from being over edited and cut down to 91 minutes. We get a short setup to TRY and empathize with the leads and we get no and I mean ZERO background on the other men competing for love other than their career choice before watching them behave silly. At the end we get a very brief explanation of from where each love stricken pursuer life was prior to being hoodwinked but its too late and provides no fulfillment.The movie plays out many jokes and gags that have no pay off since there was nothing behind them. There are a few moments where a punchline obviously had some meaning in the relationships of the characters but seems unfunny as the meat and plot behind the joke is missing.In the end we get a shell of a movie it has a nice frosting but the cake has been stripped!! It seemed like if they had left some of what was obviously cut in the film it could have been really good. But the final product we get lacks anything memorable.Skip at the high priced theater and wait for video.";

It makes you think Should I get out and ask for refund? The answer is yes. There a few decent moments during the 75 minutes that this movie actually runs but it is difficult to appreciate them because there are so very many BAD moments. 75 minutes? Yes. Imagine what was left on the cutting room floor. And not just bad moments moments that fall flat on their face which are made worse because you know that they the writers director producers thought these were going to be great laughs. Of course I could be wrong and the professionals mentioned above simply didn't care. They were getting a paycheck whether this movie was awful or not.I would have given this movie 1 star but I gave it two because both Kristen Bell and Josh Duhamel impressed me. It makes me sad to think that it is possible these young promising actors are going to have this terrible movie on their resumes. It would be even worse if some studio doofus who didn't see this movie ends up saying That Kristen Bell she can't carry a movie. 'When In Rome' proved that. Such a shame to waste talent like that.Wait to see this wreck on cable and when you see it on cable I bet you don't make it through the whole 115.".

	schema:reviewBody "12 out of When in Rome actually looked pretty decent judging by its advertisements and the cast wasn't too shabby either. I thought I'd leave my brain at the door and enjoy the film for its silly nonsensical ride. It turns out that When in Rome is every bit as typical dry and unfunny as every romantic comedy you've seen. Even when the film has its moments which are very minimal the energy that was once there had been drained out. The problem isn't that the film is formulaic and predictable because that's what we've come to expect. The problem is that this film has no energy and basically no backbone. But the main issue is its script. The jokes couldn't feel more forced empty and missing more punch lines. For a comedy you'll laugh maybe twice if that. Although here's the million dollar question What's redeeming about this movie? It's formulaic it's tedious it's predictable it's nonsensical it's hollow and its energy has been drained.Stop me if you've heard this before Beth Bell is a workaholic which basically corrupts her chances of finding that perfect man. Beth goes to Italy Rome to see her sister get married to a man and there she meets the one which is Nick Duhamel. She picks up coins from the fountain and there a group of men fall in love with Beth but there's a problem. She only loves Nick and the men keep ruining the chance of her being with the one. But another issue arises. Does Nick really love her back or is it just because she picked up his coin from the fountain which makes people fall in love?When in Rome's main issue is the dialogue. Not one piece of dialogue is noteworthy memorable or even watchable. The dialogue is completely inane and pretty much below average. The script is also another issue. The script is dry as predictable as it can be and simply just awful. On a 1 to 10 scale 1 being the lowest 10 being the highest the predictability level for this one is easily a 10. I can see every scene coming from a mile away. Did I mention it's a chore to sit through? Well at least the performances are watchable.Overall When in Rome is nothing special and in fact feels so much like every other film out there that's it's pointless to see it. It's bythenumbers predictable and disposable. There are a lot of flaws and very few redeeming qualities. I expected a mediocre film but I also expected a fun time which I didn't get here. Wow what ever happen to the good romantic comedies? When in Boredom is a rental at best.".

Legend says that when a coin is picked up the person who threw the coin will fall in love with the one who picked it out of the water. She picks up 4coins and a casino chip.This actually isn't too bad but there were some annoying things the singing off camera as the movie opens and more singing as we travel from NY to Rome some sight gags really didn't work and were too commonplace we always see the same things and are really tired of them and some runaround conversations that go nowhere and are not funny as intended. The writers should key in on Seinfeld dialogues and learn from them. But there are some very good lines in here among the players and that is where most of the comedy is. And and yes some sight gags did work and were funny. How about that? Figure it's about 5050 on the sight gags. Kristen Bell looks a lot like Julie Bowen at times and Josh Duhamel were very good together. Sometimes these comedies don't go anywhere because we do not care for the main characters but here we do. We like Beth and Nick Duhamel. Nothing was overdone by the rest of the cast and they performed well. Don Johnson as Beth's father came in from time to time and it was good to see him. He needs another show like Nash Bridges or somesuch or some big time movie. SomethingSo the interesting twist is that the 4men who threw their coins in the fountain are now in the U.S. and stalk Beth to win her love. And here goofy and silly things happen but keep in mind that goofy and silly things are mandatory for a Hollywood comedy. It's like a law or something. And Beth believes Nick  also now in the US  is the one who threw the casino chip.So all in all not bad. Can you figure out how the spell of the legend can be broken? Thought so. Me too. Violence No. Sex No. Nudity No. Language No.".

Basically a film starring Kristin Bell as Elizabeth Martin looking for love and stealing some coins in a fountain at her sisters wedding in Rome. Something spellbinding happens to the folks of the coins that she took. You folks can figure it out. Typical klutzy protagonist muddling through life yet hard to identify or rout for her to be happy. The slapstick in this film  was unoriginal.This was a clean filmso more folks can see this. Actually that is probably a bad thing. My vote is still with Pedro and certainly not for this awful movie.".

It has a good cast in it but they are all wasted. It tells the story of a woman who's dedicated to her job as a curator and is trying to impress her boss with an art exhibit she is planning. When her sister gets married in Rome she becomes drunk and takes out 5 coins out of a fountain that people throw in to find love. As a result of taking those coins all of those men fall in love with her and all happen to live in New York city. Throughout the movie the people who think there in love with her try to woo her with unfunny results. Even the twist about the guy she likes wasn't clever and could definitely see it coming. Do not waste your time with this movie. It is hands down the worst movie of the year and don't' see anything taking that title away from it and it's on January".

Sadly with most romcoms I expect this but the script was equally atrocious as it was unrealistic. Who approves this junk and greenlights it for filming? All they needed was a script consultant and it could have been 200 better. Please don't read on if you want to see and enjoy this movie these are spoilers. First why do all the female leads in NYC based romcoms have the same job? Are they always an event planner of some sort? And since when do young adults ever have apartments like that? Blows my mind.A few examples of easy changes a consultant would have made that could have saved the movie. Make her job at the museum a curator's assistant that is getting her first big break with this exhibition not a young curator. Next the movie could have started with a short highlights real of all the guys who have broken up with the Beth character. Additionally there should be a scene explaining Nick's clumsiness and it could illustrate that he becomes less clumsy when he is around her since we have no clue why he is madly in love with the Beth character. Near the end when she finds out she can give the coins back to the guys to break the spell why does she feel bad about it? She hasn't connected with them at all this should have played out differently she should have been excited to hand the coins over then after giving them back THEN she could feel bad because she sees that having their coins made each of their lives better but she wouldn't know this till after giving the coins back. Also why does the dorky coworker take the coins? It doesn't help the plot and it's stupid. She could have left them and the Beth character would still need to get to the museum in order to give Nick's coin back. And lastly at the end when she runs out of the wedding and he finds her in the fountain they should run back into the church and yell just kidding! Get married and have the party. The movie should end at the dancing and when she throws the bouquet the dorky coworker should catch it and then end up kissing the wookieloving friend. Duh. God this is so easy. Please someone pay me instead cause your script sucks. PS I was so disappointed that I joined IMDb.com in order to leave this review. Enjoy.".

I'm sure both of these actors will do some more drama in the future.What the film lacked was subtlety. It was so frenzied and tried so hard to be cute that I felt a bit edgy in my seat. I wanted to say Just relax and let me find out more about who these people are. Even a few more quiet scenes with heartfelt dialogue would have sufficed.But I guess the makers were committed to a formulaic approach. The price they'll pay for that is that the movie will quickly fade from your memory.

I have seen a lot and i mean it.. a lot of movies some in languages i do not understand with no subtitles but then i could read the faces the expressions and feel the soul it laid out in front of you to be experienced. This i would rate as a great feelgood movie. I've written a very few reviews but this was a situation i had definitely had to put up my views. Maybe the actors were not fancy maybe there were no special effects maybe there were no whimsical erotic shots but the movie was special the actors were plain played plain no attempts to play special overreact overact nothing in excess nothing less. And those mildly comic scenes come as bonus tickling you subtle when you already are so involved with the movie flow. One of such ticklers is the scene when Beth tries explaining to these 4 guys that the reason they're so in love with her is a supernatural spell they're under and is not natural. The lightning strikes in the background taking everyone's attention and in an instant this streetmagician guy Lance played by Jon Hedger tries explaining he did not do it.. totally comic. I would strongly recommend the movie to all. Rating 9 or 8.5 at least.".

	schema:headline " The Passion of the Robe";
	schema:reviewBody "The Robe 1953 is interesting on at least two counts 1 the film takes its place as the first ever CinemaScope theatrical release and is therefore worthy of close study by all motion picture students and 2 the film depicts the Passion of Christ as the inciting action that triggers the subsequent plot development and as such threads that part of the storyline with a genre stretching back over 1000 years where we find the first extant Passion Play scripts other than the Gospel records themselves of course. This again makes the film worthy of study by film students and theologians alike.The story of Christ on film is more important historically than may at first might appear. At either two or three reels the first ever full feature film is arguably claimed to be the The Passion Play 1898 filmed in New York in 1897. The 'greatest story ever told' has hit the screen regularly thereafter perhaps most famously in recent years with Mel Gibson's masterly personal tribute The Passion of the Christ 2004.I will now comment briefly on some of the technical and visual aspects of The Robe. The camera work majors on long shots and it is interesting to analyse how each shot is framed for all that width of screen. The camera is mostly static and shots have longer than average duration the compositions really are not designed for a lot of movement. This gives the film that famous epic style that goes for the grand sweep both visually musically and emotionally. There is not a lot of internalisation within the characterisation  it is the literal width and scope of the production that grabs attention. The filmic style is not very personal however. It really is as if we have the best seats in an outdoor drama on a massive stage.As you view you may wish to make a note of the shots that seem to work best to the modern viewer. In the early part of the film for instance just before the Passion sequence Demetrius runs toward the camera in search of Jesus after he's been beaten down by the Roman guards outside the gates of Jerusalem. An old lady sitting behind him on the cobbled pathway has just finished tending his wounds. The shot is terrific and works for modern audiences very well. Unlike a lot of the film where much of the direction seems to be subjected to the demands of the CinemaScope process this shot contains a dynamism that beguiles the film's age. Why? Because it uses the three dimensions of the set along with arresting and dramatic movement as Demetrius runs diagonally toward the camera and beyond us toward the Crucifixion which we see in the next sequence.Another sequence that really works well is the chase in the second half. It is arguably the most dramatic sequence in the entire picture and certainly uses CinemaScope to best effect as the horses thunder toward the audience. Over fifty years later and it would be hard to better.By contrast most of the film is played out in tableaux form with action taking place across the width of the screen on lavish but shallow sets. The camera is a passive observer unlike modern 'epics' which usually use very fluid camera setups along with computergenerated imagery CGI. The actual crucifixion masterful in what it does not show by the way is indeed an actual still life tableau and could have easily been lifted straight out of the Oberammergau passion play. I do not say this to put the film down  this actually is a brilliant move as it makes the action faithful to the genre of the passion play which originally was played out exclusively through short tableaux.In this writing my aim has been simply to help you consider alternative ways of viewing this and other historic motion pictures. Particularly you may wish to take note of the sometimes unusual way the film uses a framing b shot length c staging d camera movements e the use or rather the almost total lack of use of close ups and 'cutaway' shots f lighting and the g music score and dialogue. Of course there is much more to note the use of dissolves and fades which helps underline the 'epic' grandeur of every sequence. And I've not even touched on the story line or the acting. Question how might it have played as a silent movie?In today's postmodernist society the Passion play formula with its emphasis on objective truth may well gain renewed importance since the narrative of Christ's passion may be in danger of becoming yet one more voice crying in a commercial wilderness devoid of ultimate human and Godly values of truth goodness and conviction. The story of Jesus stands out as unique however it is viewed. The simple reason the story of the Passion indeed IS unique! Which is one reason why I consider it a 'genre' in its own right. I contend therefore that The Robe is an important contribution to American cinema both theologically and cinematographically one among a select number of motion pictures spanning over one hundred years of history that every student should have opportunity to view and discuss at least once whilst still in full time education.A sidebar The Robe really needs to be watched in 'letterbox' i.e. in the original format which on a small display does not do the picture justice. With HDTV coming along look out for a digital rerelease that will restore the original to its pristine glory. Also a sidebyside comparison with the Academy format version  shot at the same time  would be beneficial. Best of all of course arrange to get it screened in your local art house cinema and see it as it is meant to be viewed on the big screen.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is my pick for Easter. Almost all the objections and criticisms to this film can be waved away with the not so simple explanation that it is after all only a Hollywood studio 1953 adaptation of a Lloyd C. Douglas novel. So forgive the clichs and the big set piece swordfight and the chase scene and the goofy ending where the hero and his girl literally walk up to heaven to the yodeling of a choir of angels. Instead be thankful for wonderful sets the very fine musical scorethe interesting characterizations and the solid photography and direction. This was the first Cinemascope movie released.Marcellus Gallio Richard Burton is a swaggering slightly debauched Roman Tribune from a good family who is exiled out to provincial garrison duty after insulting the future Emperor Caligula Jay Robinson. He lands in the sinkhole of Jerusalem for what turns out to be a very short stay. But before being recalled to Rome he is given orders from Pontius Pilate to carry out the execution of Jesus. Marcellus loses his reason after taking part in the crucifixion. The movie then follows his travails as he seeks to regain his sanity by finding and destroying Christ's robe  A relic that he feels is at the root of his affliction. Richard Burton received an Oscar nomination for this role though this is clearly not his best work. I like Burton however he seems to have trouble in this picture in doing much more than projecting a rather sullenif sometimes eloquent petulance. He doesn't stray very far from this grim pose whether he is the playboy in Rome or the slack and dissolute officer in Palestine or the tortured madman being interviewed by Emperor Tiberius Ernest Theisger in Capri. Even his later rebirth as a convert to Christianity doesn't serve to perk him up very much. Maybe the real problem with his performance is that he often has little to say ..... the best dialogue in the movie is given to some of the fine actors around him. If you enjoy looking at beautiful young women who personify grace dignity and intelligencethen watch Jean Simmons as the love interest Diana. She has several nice speeches throughout the movie my personal favorite being her sentiments of loyalty for the mad Marcellus as expressed to Tiberius When you won a battle Sire you could expect to receive the admiration of your men...but when you lost...what would you have given then to have the eagles raised in your honor and your name on every man's lips?. It's disappointing that she gets preachy at the end of the film and makes a clumsy conversion to Christianity that yields her only instant martyrdom. Victor Mature is good as Marcellus' Greek slave Demetrius. A single wordless glance from Jesus in an encounter on Palm Sunday is enough to set him on the path to Christianity. He attempts to warn Jesus of his impending arrest stumbling on to the suicidal Judas in the effort and even begs Marcellus to intercede for the condemned man. He later heaps justifiable abuse on his master and on all that Rome represents. He is afterwards rescued by the reborn Marcellus and lives to appear in the uninspired sequel to this movie.Jeff Morrow Paulus is unheralded but great as the grizzled and cynical veteran officer subordinate to Marcellus. Morrow is often allowed expository observations about the passing scenes in Jerusalem while all Burton can do is listen and frown. Paulus offers Marcellus some practical advice before they go to carry out the execution order against Jesus. He encourages Marcellus to drink his wine and when he hesitates Paulus chides him with This is your first execution isn't it?What? Never driven nails into a man's flesh before? Paulus clashes with Marcellus much later  after the latter has converted and they engage in a sword fight but not before Paulus taunts his former superior with Make me obey Tribune you outrank me but I earned my rank every step of the way in Gaul Iberia and Africa against the enemies of RomeMake me obey Tribune. If you're fool enough to try. Oh! You are a fool! I've split more men from head to foot than you see in this square. Needless to say....our lusty Tribune does make him obey. Thesiger as Tiberius and Robinson as Caligula are excellent. Thesiger dominates the screen with impressive theatrical flair and Robinson projects just the right amount of arrogance instability and menace as Caligula. I have seen some reviewers complain that Robinson goes over the top as Caligulabut let's face it....Caligula did have some issues and you would have to scale Everest to go over the top on him.

	onyx:emotionText "This is my pick for Easter. Almost all the objections and criticisms to this film can be waved away with the not so simple explanation that it is after all only a Hollywood studio 1953 adaptation of a Lloyd C. Douglas novel. So forgive the clichs and the big set piece swordfight and the chase scene and the goofy ending where the hero and his girl literally walk up to heaven to the yodeling of a choir of angels. Instead be thankful for wonderful sets the very fine musical scorethe interesting characterizations and the solid photography and direction. This was the first Cinemascope movie released.Marcellus Gallio Richard Burton is a swaggering slightly debauched Roman Tribune from a good family who is exiled out to provincial garrison duty after insulting the future Emperor Caligula Jay Robinson. He lands in the sinkhole of Jerusalem for what turns out to be a very short stay. But before being recalled to Rome he is given orders from Pontius Pilate to carry out the execution of Jesus. Marcellus loses his reason after taking part in the crucifixion. The movie then follows his travails as he seeks to regain his sanity by finding and destroying Christ's robe  A relic that he feels is at the root of his affliction. Richard Burton received an Oscar nomination for this role though this is clearly not his best work. I like Burton however he seems to have trouble in this picture in doing much more than projecting a rather sullenif sometimes eloquent petulance. He doesn't stray very far from this grim pose whether he is the playboy in Rome or the slack and dissolute officer in Palestine or the tortured madman being interviewed by Emperor Tiberius Ernest Theisger in Capri. Even his later rebirth as a convert to Christianity doesn't serve to perk him up very much. Maybe the real problem with his performance is that he often has little to say ..... the best dialogue in the movie is given to some of the fine actors around him. If you enjoy looking at beautiful young women who personify grace dignity and intelligencethen watch Jean Simmons as the love interest Diana. She has several nice speeches throughout the movie my personal favorite being her sentiments of loyalty for the mad Marcellus as expressed to Tiberius When you won a battle Sire you could expect to receive the admiration of your men...but when you lost...what would you have given then to have the eagles raised in your honor and your name on every man's lips?. It's disappointing that she gets preachy at the end of the film and makes a clumsy conversion to Christianity that yields her only instant martyrdom. Victor Mature is good as Marcellus' Greek slave Demetrius. A single wordless glance from Jesus in an encounter on Palm Sunday is enough to set him on the path to Christianity. He attempts to warn Jesus of his impending arrest stumbling on to the suicidal Judas in the effort and even begs Marcellus to intercede for the condemned man. He later heaps justifiable abuse on his master and on all that Rome represents. He is afterwards rescued by the reborn Marcellus and lives to appear in the uninspired sequel to this movie.Jeff Morrow Paulus is unheralded but great as the grizzled and cynical veteran officer subordinate to Marcellus. Morrow is often allowed expository observations about the passing scenes in Jerusalem while all Burton can do is listen and frown. Paulus offers Marcellus some practical advice before they go to carry out the execution order against Jesus. He encourages Marcellus to drink his wine and when he hesitates Paulus chides him with This is your first execution isn't it?What? Never driven nails into a man's flesh before? Paulus clashes with Marcellus much later  after the latter has converted and they engage in a sword fight but not before Paulus taunts his former superior with Make me obey Tribune you outrank me but I earned my rank every step of the way in Gaul Iberia and Africa against the enemies of RomeMake me obey Tribune. If you're fool enough to try. Oh! You are a fool! I've split more men from head to foot than you see in this square. Needless to say....our lusty Tribune does make him obey. Thesiger as Tiberius and Robinson as Caligula are excellent. Thesiger dominates the screen with impressive theatrical flair and Robinson projects just the right amount of arrogance instability and menace as Caligula. I have seen some reviewers complain that Robinson goes over the top as Caligulabut let's face it....Caligula did have some issues and you would have to scale Everest to go over the top on him. A decent attempt is made in this movie to highlight the virtues of honesty and charity exhibited by the early Christians  Betta St John is featured as the crippled Miriam she sings a song of the resurrection.

	schema:reviewBody "The Robe comes from a tradition of historical biblical fiction about a peripheral incident andor character. It is in the same vein as BenHur and Barabbas films adapted from a similar source.In this case it is Jesus's robe that he wore to the crucifixion. It is recorded that while He was on the cross waiting to die Roman soldiers idled their time away by casting dice for the only possession He took to his death his robe. The lucky winner turned out to be Richard Burton a tribune recently sent on assignment because of a running feud with the Emperor to be.The run in with Caligula was over a slave purchased by Burton a Greek named Demetrius played by Victor Mature. Both Burton and Mature are exiled to Judea and they arrive just in time to see Jesus enter Jerusalem. Mature becomes converted to Jesus's teachings and Burton is driven mad by the enormity of what he has participated in. The Robe was written by Lloyd C. Douglas who was an ordained Lutheran minister and who turned to writing at the age of 50 with his first best seller Magnificent Obsession. His writings were of the Christian inspirational variety and he was a very popular American writer right up to his death in 1951. Richard Burton got one of his Academy Award nominations for his role. Jean Simmons as Diana who was the main source of his rivalry with Caligula gives a good understated performance of the woman who stood by the man she loved and his fate and passed up a chance to be an Empress.Jay Robinson as Caligula got most of the notice. Although John Hurt in the I Claudius series is probably now the definitive Caligula Robinson's performance holds up very well indeed. A substance abuse problem curtailed a promising career and though he did come back it was not the same.The Robe was 20th Century Fox's first film in its new wide screen process of Cinemascope and really should be seen in a letter box version at home. Richard Burton is always good and elevates whatever film he's in.Though in this case the subject matter is elevated just about as high as it can get.".

Although the focus is not on Jesus directly it is through the great talents of the actors writers and director that the focus IS placed back on Jesus' effect on the lives of the movie characters.There is not a single performer in this film who is not brilliant. Richard Burton turns in a superb  convincing performance as Marcellus the Roman tribune whose life is a meaningless series of women and wine until fate gives him faith. And there is no more beautiful actress ever than Jean Simmons as Diana. I even named my only daughter Diana because of the effect that this character had on me as a child Diana defined beauty to me. But my favorite by far was Victor Mature's Demetrius a role which was so beloved at the time that the sequel of Demetrius and the Gladiators began filming soon after The Robe was released to critical and popular acclaim. Mr. Mature's portrayal of Demetrius a Greek slave who would only see Jesus yet be changed permanently by His glance helped develop my faith in me as a child.All of the other performances are excellent and uplifting. It is a great movie to watch with the family and explain all the different ways faith was given to each of the characters. It is a visually stunning film with beautiful and haunting music score by Hollywood musical genius Alfred Newman and one that stands the test of time I've been watching it for over 40 years.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am a big fan of these types of movies. I love movies like BenHur The Greatest Story Ever Told Samson and Delilah and Spartacus. The movies that took place in ancient Rome had so much going for them. They had great actors directors cinematography and music. They also never needed to use computer animation. I was always very pleased. Only I can't say I was pleased with the Romans wearing purple and black in Gladiator. But anyway this movie has it all. There is nothing I can say that's bad about it. It has a great story that pulls you in. When you watch it you feel as if you are there. You feel everything that the actors are feeling and the music helps to set the mood. Jay Robinson is pretty good as Caligula but sometimes he is way too over the top. His performance as Caligula was better in Demetrius and the Gladiators. Jean Simmons is a very good actress. I like her a lot in this movie and in Spartacus. I think she deserved some type of recognition. Victor Mature was very good too. Michael Rennie was another good actor in this movie. He seemed so perfect as Peter. The one that stood out was Richard Burton. He did a great job. I could go on and on because the whole cast was great. I read that Tyrone Power was originally approached for the lead. I think he could've pulled it off. He was a very underrated actor. I have many favorite parts. I love the scene when Victor Mature is trying to find Jesus so he can warn him and he runs into to someone. I won't say who. I like the crucifixion scene. It was very well done and Victor Mature shows his great acting in the scene. I love the scene when Richard Burton finds the robe. He was afraid of it but when he holds it close it has an effect on him. The ending is outstanding. It is well acted and ends happily. Burton without a doubt deserved his Academy Award nomination. Sometimes he overacts in scenes when he is yelling but other times he really looks like he belongs in the role. This movie probably didn't win much because there was so much competition. Many other great movies were there. From Here To Eternity a big favorite of mine and Shane another big favorite of mine were nominated. The actors that were up for it were all favorites of mine too. I can't really decide who deserved it. Burt Lancaster and Montgomery Clift were both great in From Here to Eternity. It's tough for me to choose between those two and Richard Burton.Everything about this movie is great so be sure to check it out. I can watch it over and over and never get sick of it. Check out this classic this epic. It has it all. The Robe is a timeless classic. You will not be disappointed.".

Though yielding on occasion to the Hollywoodisms of the time e.g. the crack of thunder when Judas reveals his name it nevertheless still evokes a reverence surrounding the Crucifixion that's never been equaled in any other biblical film aided in part by the majestic music. The next scene in which Victor Mature as the slave Demetrius stands in driving rain and curses Marcellus Richard Burton and the Roman Empire is one of the most powerful scenes in film. The robe by the way is not magical as another user would tell us but an ordinary garment that wields power only because it is too vivid a reminder of the horror and guilt Marcellus carries for crucifying an innocent man. It is his acknowledgement of this act and the powerful words of forgiveness from the cross that change his life. DVD widescreen is magnificent.".

The next scene in which Victor Mature as the slave Demetrius stands in driving rain and curses Marcellus Richard Burton and the Roman Empire is one of the most powerful scenes in film. The robe by the way is not magical as another user would tell us but an ordinary garment that wields power only because it is too vivid a reminder of the horror and guilt Marcellus carries for crucifying an innocent man. It is his acknowledgement of this act and the powerful words of forgiveness from the cross that change his life. DVD widescreen is magnificent.";

	schema:reviewBody "I had mixed feelings watching the Robe. By all means it isn't a bad film but it isn't great either. While there are some good things there is a lot wrong with it as well.PROS The plot about a Roman officer winning Christ's robe in a game of dice during the Crucifixion is a nice idea to work with and comes off decently on screen. The film for its time has nice production values with lovely costumes and sets. The Robe is best known for the first film to be shot in CinemaScope which was put to effective use here. The music is very good and the acting is decent. There have been times when I have found Richard Burton wooden but there have also been films like Nineteen Eighty Four where he has been remarkably good. Here he does look handsome in Roman garb. Jean Simmons rest in peace has been better but she looks lovely as Diana and does a decent job acting. Torin Thatcher is a marvellous Senator Gallio while Jay Robinson is unforgettably melodramatic as Caligula.CONS There are things wrong with this film and unfortunately pacing comes at the top of this list. This is not the first film to suffer from this problem but The Robe seems to move at only one speed which is slow and ponderous. The film is also very awkwardly directed by Henry Koster and the dialogue ranges from adequate to laughable as if the writer was being very careful in order not to offend. Victor Mature has a tendency to take it TOO seriously as Demetrius and in a rather uneven performance it shows. There are also parts where the action and romantic subplot are a little unconvincing and where some scenes are overlong.Overall worth watching in general but I don't necessarily recommend it. 510 Bethany Cox".

It's nice to see a proJesus movie something almost extinct since the 1960s. Yes here is a film that unabashedly treats Him with reverence. Richard Burton plays Marcellus Gallio a Roman tribune who takes part in the crucification and then becomes transformed into a Christian. He is won over by the impresses witness of his slave Demetrius Victor Mature and other Christians who amaze Burton with their unselfishness and forgiveness. Christ's robe too has a profound effect on Marcellus.Michael Rennie was wellcast as Peter. I wouldn't be the least surprised if the reallife apostle had that chiseled face that Rennie exhibited. Too bad his role was so short in here. The actor who played the villainous Calgula  Jay Robinson was very good in that his incredibly annoying voice alone made you despise the man!Even for Believers such as me this film dragged in too many spots and is not a film I'd watch numerous times.

The film demonstrates the power of faith without being preachy. It provides strong sets and action but doesn't over do itself in it's presentation.

	schema:reviewBody "THE ROBE is a reviewer's nightmare a film whose sum falls substantially short of its parts.  Overall this is a great story with BurtonRobinson doing a Luke SkywalkerDarth Vader impersonation that will resonate with younger viewers unaquainted with Sophocles or Dante.Unfortunately  Jean Simmons and Victor Mature do their usual convincing impersonations of a glacier and Richard Burton after a promising start overemotes so much that he appears to be in need of an enema or shock therapy.  Throw into the mix the watery Christianity subtext and you have recipe for cinematic narcolepsy or the subject of future midnightshowing laughfests.  The fact that Hollywood felt it could justify this mess by throwing in the story of the Crucifixion reverently dipped in requisite shades of scarlet and violet and sanctimoniously dripped over us like so much visual Holy Water is more than enough to merit contempt.  But there is a saving grace.What sets THE ROBE apart and keeps the whole creaky contrivance going is Jay Robinson's maniacal performance as the insane Emperor Caligula.

He's only on screen for about 10 minutes of a twohour film but as Judi Dench proved in her Oscarwinning performance as Queen Elizabeth I 7 or 8 minutes of screen time can make or break a film.  Robinson's subsequent hellish descent into drug addiction and anonymity make his performance that much more poignant.  It was ironic to see in his autobiography that he'd found solace in religion.

	onyx:emotionText "THE ROBE is a reviewer's nightmare a film whose sum falls substantially short of its parts.  Overall this is a great story with BurtonRobinson doing a Luke SkywalkerDarth Vader impersonation that will resonate with younger viewers unaquainted with Sophocles or Dante.Unfortunately  Jean Simmons and Victor Mature do their usual convincing impersonations of a glacier and Richard Burton after a promising start overemotes so much that he appears to be in need of an enema or shock therapy.  Throw into the mix the watery Christianity subtext and you have recipe for cinematic narcolepsy or the subject of future midnightshowing laughfests.  The fact that Hollywood felt it could justify this mess by throwing in the story of the Crucifixion reverently dipped in requisite shades of scarlet and violet and sanctimoniously dripped over us like so much visual Holy Water is more than enough to merit contempt.  But there is a saving grace.What sets THE ROBE apart and keeps the whole creaky contrivance going is Jay Robinson's maniacal performance as the insane Emperor Caligula. Intentionally overthetop in a voice like oiled velvet shreiking his inadequacies Robinson seizes control of the 3 scenes he's in and never lets go.I'd give this film a 5 out of 10 just to watch Robinson's performance.

The first thirty minutes or so where the film is exploring slavery and tyranny in the Roman empire is quite witty and sparkling. Unfortunately the movie moves to Jerusalem and goes to hell so to speak. Suddenly the acting starts to resemble a sixth grade religious school play and all suspense and tension disappears.The story tells us that apparently there was a Jew named Jesus and he had this magic robe. When you touch the magic robe you become a Christian. This means standing straight up and solemnly talking about your master Jesus who healed the sick and taught you to love everybody. It also gives you the power to kick Roman butt. Unfortunately whoever does not touch the Robe turns into a sadistic moron who can only say things like crucify the Christians. Richard Burton is handsome in a gay sort of way and quite good as the Tribune Marcellus. The only problem is that he is a lot more likable and fun before he becomes a Christian. As soon as he becomes a Christian he turns into a slightly psychotic hypnotized creep.Jean Simmons spoils another great epic with another 100 sexless and wooden performance. Just like in Spartacus and Guys and Dolls she proves herself again the worst actress of her generation.The whole effect of the movie is not quite as bad and ridiculous as Mel Gibson's Passion but it comes pretty close.".

	schema:headline " Falls a long way short of the really great epics";
	schema:reviewBody "The historical epics which were so popular in the fifties and early sixties frequently had a religious theme. Some were based not always faithfully on stories from the Bible The Ten Commandments Solomon and Sheba Esther and the King while others tried to convey a Christian message indirectly. Thus the central character of Spartacus is treated as a metaphorical Christfigure and The Egyptian draws parallels between Christianity and the monotheistic religion of Atenism which briefly flourished under the heretical Pharaoh Akhnaten. The Robe is one of a number of films which deal with the early days of the Christian Church and its persecution by the Roman Emperors. The most famous film of this type is Ben Hur but others include Quo Vadis? The Silver Chalice and The Fall of the Roman Empire. The stories told by such films were normally fictitious they were often based upon oncefamous novels but were set against a background of historical fact.The plot of The Robe is essentially similar to that of The Silver Chalice which was made the following year. Both concern a sacred relic of Christ in The Silver Chalice this is the cup which He used at the Last Supper whereas in The Robe it is the robe which He wore at His crucifixion. Lloyd Douglas who wrote the novel The Robe said that he did so to answer the question what happened to the Roman soldier who won Jesus' robe through a dice game? In the story this soldier is Marcellus Gallio the military tribune who commands the unit that crucifies Jesus. He is in some respects an unlikely hero for an epic. The heroes of such films were normally strong confident men of action like BenHur or Spartacus but Marcellus is not really a career soldier. He is an upperclass playboy a gambler drinker and womaniser who owes his exalted military rank to the influence of his father an important senator. He enjoys little respect among the men he commands although he gets the better of a centurion who dares to challenge his authority in a memorable swordfight one of the film's few action sequences. He is only sent to Judaea because he has offended Caligula heir to the Emperor Tiberius.After the Crucifixion Marcellus is overcome by feelings of guilt and haunted by memories of the man he has crucified loses his reason believing that Christ's robe has bewitched him. To help him overcome his mental problems Tiberius sends him back to Judaea where he meets an idealistic group of early Christians and finds himself drawn to their religion. As one might expect in a fifties epic Marcellus eventually becomes a Christian himself as do his sweetheart Diana and his servant Demetrius. Demetrius was to become the hero of his own film Demetrius and the Gladiators a sequel to The Robe. This sequel was unusually based on an original screenplay rather than a novel although it used some of Douglas's characters. Douglas had in fact written his own sequel The Big Fisherman but the studio did not own the film rights.The film contains a number of historical inaccuracies. The Roman province of Judaea is referred to anachronistically as Palestine. The historical Tiberius was a cruel and dissolute tyrant but is portrayed here as a benevolent elder statesman. His wife appears here as the Empress Julia although in fact Tiberius divorced Julia for adultery long before he became Emperor and by the time the film is set she had been dead for many years. The Jews never believed that the Messiah would be the Son of God that is a purely Christian concept. Most importantly the Emperor Caligula although undoubtedly tyrannical never persecuted the Christians as he is shown doing here during his reign only a few years after the death of Christ the new religion was far too insignificant to pose any threat to the Roman state. The first organised persecution of Christians took place under Nero.The leading role is played by Richard Burton in the first of his three epic films. The others were Alexander the Great and Cleopatra. It is scarcely Burton's finest hour and he did not really deserve his Oscar nomination but he acquits himself reasonably well as the complex hero Marcellus. There are also decent performances from the lovely Jean Simmons as Diana Ernest Thesiger as Tiberius Michael Rennie as St Peter although it is difficult to imagine this ascetic philosophersaint ever having worked as a fisherman and Jay Robinson playing Caligula as a ranting carpetchewing and slightly camp megalomaniac. Victor Mature as Demetrius is impassive but impressive like a gigantic statue. Rennie Robinson and Mature would all get to repeat their roles in Demetrius and the Gladiators.Demetrius and the Gladiators is in fact one of those sequels which is rather better than the film that inspired it. It offers more in the way of spectacle than does The Robe and has a more interesting storyline raising some important moral issues about pacifism nonviolence and Christian forgiveness. With a less stolid actor than Mature in the leading role it could have been a classic. The message of The Robe by contrast never gets much further than Christians Good Pagans Bad and although the conflicted central character of Marcellus does offer some complexity any attempt at moral depth goes out of the window with the simplistic sentimental ending to the story. The Robe is certainly better than The Silver Chalice I cannot think of an epic which is actually worse than that ridiculous film but it falls a long way short of the likes of BenHur or Spartacus. 610".

Stone Otto Waldis.....Director Henry Koster Screenplay Gina Kaus Phillip Dune Albert Maltz.From 1953 Director Henry Koster's The Robe was a successful adaptation of the novel by Lloyd C. Douglas. Hollywood had yet to see such Biblicaltimes epic as The Ten Commandments '56 and BenHur '59 but The Robe represents early 50's cinematic escapism. Audiences flocked to the movie theaters because Hollywood was threatened with the new television medium. The Robe is almost 3 hours long full of grand spectacle high drama and all in stunning Technicolor. It stars a young Richard Burton who was only beginning to bloom as an actor Victor Mature who made a career out of playing muscular Samsontypes he had appeared in Samson and Delilah '49 under the direction of Cecil B. De Mille the beautiful Jean Simmons a popular British actress and Jay Robinson as the wicked Emperor Caligula. Richard Burton portrays Marcellus Gallio a noble Roman senator who is assigned to oversee the Crucifixion of Jesus Christ of Nazareth in 33 A.D Israel. He leaves behind his lover the noble lady Diana Simmons and brings with him a newly bought Greek slave Demetrius Mature. At the Crucifixtion Marcellus believes he has been cursed for touching Christ's robe. Demetrius takes the robe and flees from his master. Through the years Demetrius becomes a Christian by living among the faithful disciples of Jesus among them Saint Peter Michael Rennie. But Marcellus is determined to find him and make him pay both for his desertion and the curse of the Robe upon him. But instead through witnessing the peaceful and happy life of Jesus' followers he too becomes a Christian. The old Emperor Tiberius dies and Rome has a new Emperor the megalomaniacal tyrant Caligula. Caligula does not tolerate the Christians who worship Jesus as King and finds them to be traitors to Rome. Before long the lives of Demetrius Marcellus and Diana are in danger. This film was not as successful as the forementioned Biblical epics but it was a fine film in its time full of all the usual Oscarworthy aspects such as the excellent dramatic acting superb cinematography courtesy of Leon Samroy and dramatic soaring music by Alfred Newman and authentic period costumes by Emile Santiago. The Robe was so successful that a sequel was made the following year Demetrius and the Gladiators which follows the story of Demetrius the slave. Even if you have already seen the greater Biblical epic films this one is worth watching as well. The ending always gets to me. It has a powerful story about hope and faith underneath despair and darkness. This is not only a film of special interest to Christians but to fans of old Hollywood epic films. The only possible downside is the fact that it may be inaccurate to ancient history. Caligula was a later Roman emperor and the Emperor at the time of Jesus was Rome's first emperor Augustus. But it may not matter when you consider the hardhitting drama that unfolds in the film.".

Neither Fred Astaire nor Ginger Rogers wanted to get too stereotyped as being the other's partner Rogers especially took roles specifically to get away from being typecast as one half of a dancing team but watching them dance you really couldn't imagine their names coming apart in conversation. It will always have to be 'Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers' because their dancing takes your breath away. The fact that it is incredibly technically complicated is itself astounding... what makes it all the better is that they make it look so darn easy and natural.Astaire plays Jerry Travers a professional dancer who meets and falls in love with Dale Tremont Rogers. He tries very hard to woo her by filling her room with flowers and singing her through a storm the beautiful Isn't This A Lovely Day. Dale unfortunately mistakes him for her friend Madge's husband Horace Hardwick played with acerbic relish by Edward Everett Horton. The comedy of errors continues for most of the film since Dale continually mistakes Jerry for Horace regaling Madge with 'Horace's' attempts at romancing her and her costume designer Alberto Beddini is therefore convinced that Horace is the one he must 'kill'so as to avenge Ms. Tremont.The plotline itself is slightly fantastical littered with just enough eccentric characters to have you falling off your seat laughing at some of the things they do and say. Erik Rhodes as Beddini for example has some of the best lines in the filmI'm arich and apretty... He practically steals the show which is hard given the presence of veteran scenestealers like Horton and Helen Broderick as Madge Hardwick. Although the comedy of errors arising from the mistaken identity wears a bit thin after a while it does provide some absolutely topnotch comic moments. Take the scene when Madge urges Dale to dance with Jerrythe look of utter uncomprehension on Dale's face when Madge keeps urging them to dance closer is most certainly one for the DVD pause button. Aside from the dancing which is sublime and undescribable'Fred  Ginger' is something you have to see in action for yourself to believe the score is brilliant. Irving Berlin has penned some of the most beautiful songs ever and here we have just a small but certainly representative sampling of them with Isn't This A Lovely Day Top Hat White Tie and Tails and of course Cheek To Cheek... a classic by any standard.What Fred  Ginger lack in palpable explosive chemistry along the lines of that shared by Tracy and Hepburn or Bogart and Bacall however they more than make up for in their perfect synchronicity with each otherthey're perfectly in tune through every dance sequence and that's a delight and amazing to see. Overall the film is a bit uneven coasting along on the charm of its dancing leads. But it's most certainly one that's worth watching quite simply so you can finally say that you've seen a FredGinger movie and now know what all that fuss was about. Because goodness there really is nothing quite so magical as when Astaire takes Rogers in his arms and spins her around a dance floor defying gravity and all laws of motion. Physics means nothing when it comes to these two...".

A lucky pairing with Ginger Rogers a film star in her own right in Flying Down To Rio 1933 led on to a series of smash hits throughout the 1930's.  Top Hat was the third film the couple made together and for this one RKO Radio started getting serious bringing in the legendary Irving Berlin to write the sparkling songs.This picture was preceded a year earlier by The Gay Divorcee and is a repeat prescription of that successful formula  wealthy elegant characters frivolous lifestyles lighthearted love and sumptuous dance numbers.  It is not merely the storyline of 'Divorcee' that is repeated here  alongside Fred and Ginger several of the cast members reappear. Edward Everett Horton was the lawyer Egbert in the earlier film and here he is Horace the impresario but is still Fred's bumbling buddy.  Eric Blore was the wisecracking waiter now he is the sarcastic valet Erik Rhodes plays Italian buffoons in both films  Tonetti in 'Divorcee' Beddini here. Watch out for the girl florist ... it's Lucille Ball two years into a very long and busy showbiz career.The film's first number is Fancy Free an amiable little ditty which sets the prevailing tone of easy gaiety.  Fred leads into it very nicely his speech becoming more and more rhythmic until he lifts off into song.It's A Lovely Day has a great tune witty choreography a thunderstorm and a superb bandstand set.  Yet the song everyone associates with this movie is Top Hat White Tie And Tails it doesn't involve Ginger at all but Fred makes up for that by being in breathtaking form his performance exuding athleticism grace poise and assurance.Ginger gets her turn to sing with The Piccolino a song designed to accord with the plot's Venetian setting.  It is the weakest number in the movie and Ginger sings it without conviction.In order for the plot knots to unravel it is necessary for Horace to be kept apart from his wife Madge for 24 hours even though they haven't met for weeks and they are staying in the same hotel.  This is highly artificial but such flaws are rendered negligible by the sweeping climax of Cheek To Cheek the splendid finale in which Fred and Ginger get to dance as lovers.Verdict  Immortal stylish music and dance.".

	schema:reviewBody "TOP HAT RKO Radio 1935 directed by Mark Sandrich marks the fourth teaming of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers and considered by many to be their best collaboration. A reworking in plot from their earlier outing of The Gay Divorce 1934 TOP HAT in fact the most admired of the two could easily pass as a partial remake rehash or possibly a sequel mainly due to the sameness in the casting of Edward Everett Horton Erik Rhodes and Eric Blore from The Gay Divorce also directed by Mark Sandrich.

	schema:reviewBody "Top Hat is a terrific musical about mistaken identity that pushes the joke to the limit but never takes it self very seriously. Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers are perfect as actors dancers and pals in this engaging comedy with several great dance numbers.Astaire does a great solo with male chorus line to Top Hat and teams with Rogers in The Piccolino Isn't It a Lovely Day and Cheek to Cheek. All excellent. During The Piccolino number they seem to be having so much fun it's contagious and it seems like the entire number is done in ONE TAKE! Costarring are 4 great actors who all turn in splendid performances. Helen Broderick is Madge the frustrated and wisecracking wife. Edward Everett Horton is Horace the henpecked but conniving husband. Eric Blore is the valet and Erik Rhodes is Beddini. Each gets hisher turn in the spotlight. Broderick was the perfect older woman as sidekick Horton and Blore are a great comedy team of scene stealers and Rhodes has a ball fracturing English. Lucille Ball has a bit part as the florist's assistant.Central of course are Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire. The Cheek to Cheek number is a classic and is fun to watch the feathers fly off Ginger's dress. My favorite is The Piccolino especially when it breaks into a swing number and the dancers can really cut loose. Great fun.One drawback is the UGLY set decorations that are in the same style no matter where they are. It's all that whiteonwhite stuff with hideous Greek decals and floral sprays everywhere. Even the scenes in Venice are all white right down to the gondolas. And just why are people swimming in the canals?".

	schema:headline " A Very Entertaining Astaire and Rogers Showcase";
	schema:reviewBody "Of the ten films Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers made together Top Hat is the one that best demonstrates their many talents and which presents a memorable impression of their unique inspiring partnership. Although they were great dancers they were really so much more Their work represented a standard of excellence it conveyed an image of exciting beautiful romance and they made it seem as though the fantasy world of Hollywood was accessible to everyone.The story lines for all ten films are weak. Some have more credibility than others but even the pseudobiographical films made later in their partnership are contrived overly sentimental and trite. RKO crankedout a script like Top Hat simply to accommodate the hot team of Astaire and Rodgers. They didn't allow time to do better. In addition to the stars good direction and fine work from both the supporting actors and the various technical people transformed the lean script into satisfying entertainment.Ginger Rogers brings a great deal to the shallow women she is asked to portray. Her acting accounts for much of the success of the Astaire and Rogers movies because she approaches every line every idiotic incident every emotion with the same professional integrity she would give to the finest material. She is a hard working disciplined actress always completely in character and in turn completely believable. In great part we believe the stories simply because of her.Her singing and dancing skills are excellent although not as dynamic as her acting ability. Fred is definitely the lead in singing and dancing. That she is able to follow Fred's dancing with both technical and artistic agility attests to her talent and even more to her professionalism. She earned a reputation as Fred's greatest partner because on many levels she can approach his greatness. They work as one toward a common goal.Fred Astaire was an established Broadway star when he began working in Hollywood. He had already defined his artistic persona and had concentrated on three major areas Demeanor Musicianship and Dancing. Fred is a most unlikely romantic lead. He has comely but ordinary looks that diminish under close examination too high a forehead too large features too pale and smallframed. Yet on the screen he projects a charming elite image that more than compensates for the banality of his physical person. These qualities derive from Fred having developed the most exquisite manners. He is the most poised the most polite the most confident of men. Those fine traits combined with his everyday looks make him a romantic lead anyone can believe in by association as well as by example.He also developed an exceptional ability to interpret music. He finds everything the composer has written. It's not just a matter of reading the notes or of keeping the right tempo. He finds the essence of the song its deepest meaning. He has a pleasant small voice with which he sings splendidly. Every word is given full value both musically and literally. The music is fully appreciated and fully communicated. In Top Hat his excellent musical talent is beautifully demonstrated in the song Cheek to Cheek. Written in a high register Fred scales the music with impressive virtuosity never failing to convey the full meaning of the song.His gift with music extends with perfect appropriateness to dance. As a choreographer and dancer his work is one hundred percent original. His ability to find the very core of the music creates interpretation that is never obvious never expected and seeded with a genius that is unparalleled highly aesthetic and always inspiring. It is unfortunate that he has been labeled a perfectionist because it is a misunderstanding of his objectives. The word perfectionist tends to have an underlying negativism. It suggests triviality fanaticism rigidity. None of those factors exist in the work of Fred Astaire. His objective was perhaps to some degree unconsciously to achieve a level of quality that equaled his genius. In order to get to that point it was necessary to rehearse and rehearse to make everything just right in the same way that all the stokes of a Matisse are as they need to be or all the chisel strikes of a Michelangelo create a unified artistic achievement.In Top Hat when Fred finishes singing the lyrics in the Cheek to Cheek scene he and Ginger segue to an open area where they perform a beautiful fascinating dance. It is a highly romantic sequence performed with impressive technical skill. At the end Ginger's reaction clearly shows how it wasn't just dancing but a type of lovemaking that satisfied the mind and the soul. It is notable how much they were able to communicate symbolically through movement.For me Top Hat showcases the many talents of Fred and Ginger more fully than the other nine films they made together. It also has excellent production values. However it should be noted that the other films also have exceptional dance numbers of equal and sometimes even greater merit than those in Top Hat. It is definitely worth seeing all ten of the Astaire and Rogers films preferably in chronological order.".

Not to take away from Astaire  Rogers' beautiful balletic grace but no one ever gave more comedy more modestly yet more professionally than Edward Everett Horton. His triplebarreled name alone suggests haughty dignity and sniffing puritanism and his role in this film as in so many others gives him ample scope to screw up his mouth in petty disdain look aghast at social blunders and sputter in disbelief over the foibles of others while generously ignoring his own idiocies.  Horton is a reactor one which boosts a fairly pedestrian plot to the Moon  beyond.  Like Margret DuMont with the Marx Brothers there is something about the pernickity Horton that begs us to tilt his top hat and fling a banana peel his way just for the delightful reaction we are sure of getting.  Perplexed or chagrined the hatchetfaced Horton is a monument to the lost art of supporting clown  those dumb bunnies and prissy busybodies that used to inhabit movies and give them life  breath even when the bigshot stars were off the screen.  Horton had impeccable timing in delivering a line or flashing a doubletake  you feel he could just as easily count the nanoseconds between the neutron pulses of an atom.  If he seems to intrude too much into the musical numbers of this movie it's simply because the directoreditor must have been overly fond of his coy mugging.  I recommend that music lovers rewatch this film and concentrate on Edward Everett Horton.

	schema:reviewBody "'Top Hat' is a classic 1930s dance musical. The film positively reeks with class and the winning partnership of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers is impossible to overlook. The two stars had performed together three times previously Flying Down to Rio 1933 The Gay Divorce 1934 Roberta 1935 and would later do so on a total of ten occasions. As of this moment I've only seen one of these films but if 'Top Hat' is anything to go by I have a lot of great titles to track down. It's rather peculiar that until recently I would actively avoid anything that features characters suddenly bursting into song for no particular reason but classics such as this one and 'Singin' in the Rain' are gradually overcoming my aversion towards the musical genre. Mark Sandrich who would direct five of the dancing team's outings presents the audience with a glittering world of wealth class and elegance helped along by the potent chemistry of the two leads and a memorable selection of musical numbers written by Irving Berlin.The storyline in 'Top Hat' is relatively basic a lightweight screwball comedy with an assortment of misunderstandings and mistaken identities but it's very entertaining. Of course some of the plotpoints are rather contrived and require a bit of suspension of disbelief but try and find me somebody who gives a damn. Jerry Travers Astaire is an American Broadway dancer making his London debut for producer Horace Hardwick Edward Everett Horton. Following an uncontrollable latenight urge to start tappin' in his hotel room Jerry comes to meet Dale Tremont Rogers who is initially repulsed by him but is later won over by Astaire's boyish enthusiasm and charm not to mention some wellexecuted dance moves. However an assortment of unlikely scenarios leads Dale to believe that Jerry is the husband of her good friend Marge Helen Broderick and his perceived infidelity leads her to seek somebody else's hand in marriage namely the pompous Italian dress designer Alberto Beddini Erik Rhodes.Of course the story is entertaining to watch but the film's main assets are its remarkable dance numbers. As opposed to many other musicals the sequences in 'Top Hat' have a certain intimacy about them. There is no quick editing or unusual shooting angles but instead the camera is settled at enough of a distance for us to fully see both performers and then it just sits back and allows the two stars to do what they do so well. Additionally because each of the songs is integrated almost perfectly into the plot except for The Piccolino which seemed a bit outofplace the musical interludes complement the storyline and vice versa. Choosing a favourite song would be next to impossible so I'll just declare that No Strings Isn't This a Lovely Day To Be Caught in the Rain and Top Hat White Tie and Tails are all massively enjoyable to watch. The film's most famous number Cheek to Cheek has since become one of American cinema's most beloved musical scenes and subsequent directors have regularly employed it to add emotional resonance to their own works see Woody Allen's 'The Purple Rose of Cairo 1985' and Frank Darabont's 'The Green Mile 1999'.".

The film's most famous number Cheek to Cheek has since become one of American cinema's most beloved musical scenes and subsequent directors have regularly employed it to add emotional resonance to their own works see Woody Allen's 'The Purple Rose of Cairo 1985' and Frank Darabont's 'The Green Mile 1999'.";

	schema:reviewBody "Fred and Ginger in one of their best at mid career almost a remake of The Gay Divorce. The music is by Irving Berlin and includes Isn't This a Lovely Day and Cheek to Cheek. I can't imagine how Fred and Ginger managed to grind out these demanding films. The actors showed up at the studio at 4AM. And Fred Astaire was a perfectionist. He used up thirteen canes while filming one number Top Hat. He had his most notable argument with his partner over a feathery gown that Ginger Rogers had designed since the feathers had a tendency to fly off during spins and stick to Astaire's dark evening clothes. And dancing itself physical stamina aside involves compelling self discipline. What looks so easy  so IMPROVISED  on the screen is actually worked out in minuscule detail beforehand with each step and each PART of each step thoroughly memorized and rehearsed. Berlins' lyrics are above his usual standard I'm steppin out my dear To breathe an atmosphere that simply reeks with class. And I trust that you'll excuse my dust when I step on the gas. Reeks with class pretty good.Astaire made it even more difficult. Before him and after him for that matter there had been Busby Berkeley he of the overhead camera shot and the unfolding flower imagery. Astair had proclaimed either the camera dances or I dance so his numbers were shot with as few cuts as possible and from eye level only. An exception occurs here during the climactic Piccolino although Astaire isn't in the shot and it was the last time a Berkeleyesque shot was to appear in one of his films. These ensemble dances were organized by Astaire's colleague Hermes Pan a name that suggests its owner had just waltzed out of Andy Warhol's Factory but that in fact was the real name of an ordinary midWesterner who just happened to dance well.I don't know how Irving Berlin could pump out songs as if they were hamburgers at a Sonic Drivein either  and winners too like White Christmas and dozens of others. The guy couldn't read music any better than you or I can. And he could play the piano in only one key and only on the black keys. He had a custom piano built that mechanically transposed the melodies into other keys. It's like a chimpanzee picking up a paintbrush and producing The Last Supper followed by Three Musicians and so on with scarcely a Big Eye painting among them.You've got to see this thing if only for the art deco sets blindingly white huge accented with black. The Greek keys and sinuous French curves follow one another sequaciously. The walls are white the furniture is white the telephones are white. Only the glossy floors and some of the wardrobe are black. Venice here looks like an expensive and sterile twostory set in an RKO studio. The dialog has more cutting witicisms than usual. Talking about a carriage horse Astaire tells Rogers that his sire was Man O' War. Who was his dame? asks Rogers. I don't know. He didn't give a Rogers slams trap door. And Rogers What is this power you have over horses? Astaire Horse power.And the supporting players like Eric Blore Eric Rhodes Edward Everett Horton Lucille Ball and Helen Broderick. They were all typecast of course. The men tended to be effete which served to emphasize Astaire's genuine everyman quality. It must have been reassuring to see the same actors play variations on the same themes. Their descendants are the TV actors we've come to know in supporting parts  the Ted Baxters and the Fred Mertzes and the  well the Fred Dalton Thompsons? Can I say that here? In the 1930s the audience had to wait for a year to see their favorite character actors. Now we get them once a week.What gets me about this series is that the people we see are all so terribly rich. They all wear gowns and tuxedos and fly around from London to Venice to Paris and stay in the fanciest of hotels  and this is 1935 with the world in the grip of a depression. It seems far too glib to claim the audience wanted an escape from the dreariness of their real worlds too facile. Warner Brothers at the same time was producing films that reflected the dilemmas of the workingclass audience. It would be interesting to know if Top Hat and its clones attracted a somewhat different audience from say I Was a Fugitive From a Chain Gang. Too late to know.Alas though the movie ends tragically with everyone in Venice dying of cholera.Just kidding.".

	schema:reviewBody "Top Hat although the most successful of all the AstaireRogers movies of the 1930's is however the most hard to swallow.The songs and dances are as wonderful as ever especially when provided by the great Irving Berlin and executed by such consummate performers as Fred and Ginger but it's the storyline that lets this one down. In short it's entertaining enough but it's just not believable enough.Fred and Ginger are Jerry Travers and Dale Tremont who as ever meet under acrimonious circumstances and as ever put down their weapons kiss and make up and fall in love. That's before a case of mistaken identity makes Dale believe Jerry is actually Horace Hardwick erring husband of her very best friend Madge played as brilliantly as ever by Helen Broderick.Here is the plot down point as I find it hard to accept that after falling in love after dancing together in a rain soaked bandstand to Irving Berlins 'Isn't it a Lovely Day' that they didn't deem it necessary to introduce each other. Apparently the unimportant matter of somebodies name means nothing when it comes to true love. They obviously believe their romance can survive with the occasional 'Hey you' or a far from personal grunt.Jerry is determined to woo her and put right any wrongs and in true stalker style follows her all the way the Venice resort to which the ever elusive Miss Tremont has escaped too.Again despite the fact that Jerry Dale and Madge all meet at a poolside caf and have a rather long conversation Madge under the impression that this is Jerry and Dales' first meeting also neglects the preliminary introductions with Jerry instead fanning the flames of the fire by declaring his love and respect for Madge and the impact she has on his life which the rest of the film goes on to show as none whatsoever.In fact the only person who goes out of his way to ask who anybody is Alberto Beddini Erik Rhodes Dale Tremont's fashion designer and wouldbe boyfriend who unfortunately finds and threatens to kill the real and completely innocent Horace Hardwick played by the ever watchable Edward Everett Horton.See what I mean I practically pulled my hair out by the roots in pure desperation the first time I saw this movie but as ever it is the dances that really make up the missing magic.Fred delights us with two wonderful solo numbers 'Fancy Free' an energetic tap number around a spacious London apartment and 'Top Hat' a song that has over the years become Fred's signature tune and a routine where he made the ensemble of top hat white tie and tails his very own brand name of swelegance although many have said in real life he hated wearing the outfitWith Ginger he performs the aforementioned 'Isn't it a Lovely Day' and the films finale the The Piccolino which was again an attempt to recreate both The Carioca and The Continental a concept that was later dropped from future movies.But without doubt the highlight of this musical is the Cheek to Cheek number in which Fred and Ginger perform one of their best routines around a deserted Italian veranda falling in love all over again.Although the scene and the dancing is faultless it was the routine that caused most of the off screen problems between the two. It is the now notorious ostrich feathers incident. These feathers can be seen quite clearly floating from Ginger's self designed evening gown onto Fred's suit and no doubt up his nose. Despite the bad feeling it caused at the time according to Ava Astaire it became a lifelong joke that the two would laugh and reminisce about whenever they spoke.Forget the story just watch the dances they are great.".

	schema:reviewBody "I do not watch musicals to hear music. For a musical to be enjoyable the music should be an embellishment of a story that is otherwise fun to watch. Dancing is the same thing. Beginning sometime in the 50's most musicals leave me flat  precisely because they don't have a good storyline because they emphasize music to the detriment of the story and because they routinely interrupt the flow of the film to just burst into song. There are some wonderful notable exceptions of course  Singing in the Rain 7 Brides for 7 Brothers My Fair Lady The Sound of Music... But give me the musicals of the Golden Age of Hollywood any time the story always seems to come first  just think of The Wizard of Oz the musical that nobody ever thinks of as a musical.Give me a musical that features Fred and Ginger. In fact give me almost any film with EITHER Fred or Ginger  especially Ginger! And if the story is predictable who cares? It is the journey the telling not arriving at the destination the predictable ending that counts. This is the key to storytelling  cinematic and otherwise  that both film makers and movie goers understood and appreciated when Hollywood was the Dream Factory. A film entertains by the deftness with which a story is told  the cleverness of dialog the development of characters and their interaction. It is not necessarily a bad thing that the outcome is predictable.Neither is it necessarily a good thing that a story is unpredictable Hollywood has since produced a lot of original unpredictable garbage.This is Fred and Ginger at their very best. Their chemistry was never better. The dialog musical numbers dances costumes and sets are all tops. This film is like a fabulous screwball comedy with song and dance featuring two of the very brightest stars in the history of Hollywood in peak form. My favorite Fred and Ginger routine of all time  dancing and singing the immortal Cheek to Cheek will delight you. Let Top Hat take you on this delightful journey as an illustration of Golden Age musicalmaking at its finest! Top Hat is Tops!".

	schema:reviewBody "When my parents use a metaphor for a film too old to watch they say Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers are in it. Since I watch silent films with relish Astaire and Rogers singing and danching cheek to cheek are positively contemporary from my point of view though there are many ways one is reminded these swingers were kicking about 15 years before my parents were born.'Top Hat' is great fun. The two dancers defy gravity in a way that looks improbable to eyes who have seent he making of Hong King wirefu movies. There is a grace and ease that is not of this world. The smiling and cheering of dancers who should be sweating and panting from the physical exertion is as unreal as everything else about the story that is told. But this is really happen for a 1935 camera without cuts and edits does not lie.Beyond the dancing there's very little to write home about. The plot is as silly as they come and probably would not pass the morning conference of script writers of a bad Argentinian soap. What's so dissonant to our postwar postseveral wars eyes is that everyone seems so damn happy they have so much to smile and dance and sing about. Don't these people pay bills? In reality that is what this film is meant to do let us look into a world without worries. Those looking at it first time round in 1935 had much to worry about. They are the people of Grapes of Wrath and of Modern Times the depressees who lost everything and could afford no luxury but the movies every week.Musicals gave them a magical world they could escape to and if that magical world was anything like reality it would not be worth paying the ticket for.I suppose if you wanted to tell a story where people break into song and dance every few minutes you could not really have much to do with reality even if you wanted to.Consider the set for what is meant to look like Venice in the second half of the film. It looks like something out of a Disney park an American interpretation of a longago seen postcard retold and magnified to seem even more otherworldly in children's eyes than Venice in any case really is.Though you'll raise your eye brows a few times at the sheer improbability of the plot turns and you won't laugh the second time the characters take a Stan Laurel doubletake today's humour is too fast to leave place for people who expect to be funny because they're slow on the uptake you can't help smiling when they're dancing. The sheer joy of Astaire and Rogers in their art form is infectious.".

The plot is as silly as they come and probably would not pass the morning conference of script writers of a bad Argentinian soap. What's so dissonant to our postwar postseveral wars eyes is that everyone seems so damn happy they have so much to smile and dance and sing about. Don't these people pay bills? In reality that is what this film is meant to do let us look into a world without worries. Those looking at it first time round in 1935 had much to worry about. They are the people of Grapes of Wrath and of Modern Times the depressees who lost everything and could afford no luxury but the movies every week.Musicals gave them a magical world they could escape to and if that magical world was anything like reality it would not be worth paying the ticket for.I suppose if you wanted to tell a story where people break into song and dance every few minutes you could not really have much to do with reality even if you wanted to.Consider the set for what is meant to look like Venice in the second half of the film. It looks like something out of a Disney park an American interpretation of a longago seen postcard retold and magnified to seem even more otherworldly in children's eyes than Venice in any case really is.Though you'll raise your eye brows a few times at the sheer improbability of the plot turns and you won't laugh the second time the characters take a Stan Laurel doubletake today's humour is too fast to leave place for people who expect to be funny because they're slow on the uptake you can't help smiling when they're dancing. The sheer joy of Astaire and Rogers in their art form is infectious.";

Complicating the mix are a jealous count for whom the girl works and an opinionated butler working for the impresario who is then paid by the dancer to spy for him instead. Mark Sandrich directed the goings on in sprightly fashion with Pandro S.

Hermes Pan and Fred Astaire devised the intelligent choreography and half a dozen fine arrangers helped to make the music work. The sunny disposition of the story with its reliance on a simple misunderstanding allows the smallish cast to develop their characters unusually fully for a musical. Fred Astaire is lively young and likable and his dancing has seldom been better. Ginger Rogers generally seems comfortable with her demanding role as dancer. singer confused lover angry young woman and bewildered participant. Edward Everett Horton is very properly stuffy Eric Blore as his butler successfully sarcastic and Helen Broderick makes a delightful and able sarcastic wife in a role that only Eve Arden could have bettered.

An intended musical climax to the film the elaborate Piccolini as written by Irving Berlin and sung by Ginger Roger is a mistake despite its competent arrangement. However it is the only sour note in an otherwise expert trifle one played winningly and presented beautifully in my judgment. The opening comedic scene in a London Men's Club Astaire's first meeting with the butler the Italian sequences the stage numbers and the hotel room and hansom scene are all memorable.

With that said this film used to frustrate me to no end because of its waferthin plot of mistaken identity. When I first reviewed it I couldn't get past the plot as if the plot should have carried the day. That was major impatience and intolerance on my part. Thanks to repeated showings of this one as well as the entire RKO series on TCM I have recently viewed this again and allowed myself to just indulge. Indulge in the marvelous banter that Astaire and Ginger Rogers have even when he's supposed to be annoying her in their first meetings. Quips that include Buy yourself a new hat I prefer being in distress and perhaps my favorite line when Rogers asking Astaire about the female pedigree of the horse he's driving inquires with who was his dam? he retorts with I don't know miss he didn't give a d!! That is brilliant scripting especially for an otherwise Grated film. So even as he politely annoys her in their first exchanges it's obvious that she's quite intrigued by him. And when they later dance in a gazebo in a glorious rainstorm as strangers who begin to fall in love we fall in love right along with them. But then there is that 'mistaken identity' thing that goes on for the entirety of the film. And usually it's here that I write off the film but if I did that then I could not acknowledge the brilliance of 'best friend' Helen Broderick who as the third member of this alleged triangle tosses off some of the best deadpan punchlines in the film. I could not acknowledge the two Ericks Blore and Rhodes who make the roles of frustrated valet and wouldbe rogue absolutely hilarious. And I could definitely not acknowledge the stunning Irving Berlin music and routines from the Top Hat shooting gallery of chorus boys to the sublime elegance of the featherswathed Cheek to Cheek pasdedeux. In retrospect I can't get too worked up about the plot of this film because it was 1935 and the middle of the Depression. Most films were light and decidedly cheeky during this sad period in history. If this film prompted some of the team's best boxoffice receipts in their 10film history and went on to garner an Oscar nomination as best picture it must've been doing something right. I still prefer the plots of other AR stories like Swing Time or even Shall We Dance a bit more but as a poster before me stated I should acknowledge that in terms of the mistaken identity formula it's quite brilliant.".

	schema:reviewBody "A point not often raised by other reviewers of Top Hat is how much of a benchmark this film was in the career of Irving Berlin. Top Hat marked Berlin's return to Hollywood with a new appreciation for the business end of the motion picture industry.Berlin had been there in the first three years of sound and wrote a few songs for the screen. He didn't like writing and seeing his work integrated into the scores of other films he didn't like seeing his work ending up on the cutting room floor as was the case in Reaching for the Moon and he didn't like just writing the songs and seeing them tossed every which way into a film.With Top Hat Berlin began a tradition of total control. After that it was extremely rare to hear a nonBerlin note in any score he wrote. He was as in on the creation of the film as he would have been on the Broadway stage. And he retained copyright control of his songs which was usually not the case the studio did. The man was a first class businessman as well as our greatest songwriter.This was the fourth teaming of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. With these two RKO started rivaling Warner Brothers and MGM for quality musicals. With Fred Astaire they had not only a great dancer but a star who worked hard in the creation of those numbers. The Piccolino number that he and Ginger do at the finale certainly rivals any of the stuff Busby Berkeley was doing at Warner Brothers though it is not as surrealistic.Irving Berlin wrote and integrated five outstanding songs into Top Hat. The aforementioned Piccolino No Strings Isn't It a Lovely Day To Be Caught in the Rain and Cheek to Cheek. The last was one of Berlin's most popular songs still done today by would be Astaires. It was nominated in the second year of the Best Song Oscar category but lost to Lullaby of Broadway.My favorite number here is the free and easy Isn't It a Lovely Day To Be Caught in the Rain. Fred and Ginger make that informal number under a gazebo so natural it's positively infectious. A whole lot of this cast was retained from the previous AstaireRogers outing The Gay Divorce. Edward Everett Horton Edward Blore Erik Rhodes and Helen Broderick simply repeat their roles from the previous film.So when you're caught in the rain at home with your significant other you could do worse than watch Top Hat. You'll be dancing cheek to cheek and soon.".

Standard but lovely fare here the kind that would define all of the duo's films silly plot boy meets girl and it's not straight forward and of course a simmering sexual undercurrent that comes with the chase between the sexes.Songs come courtesy of the magnificent Irving Berlin aided by Max Steiner belting show stoppers like Cheek to Cheek Isn't It A Lovely Day and the sublime solo cane Astaire showcase that is Top Hat White Tie and Tails. Gorgeous sets enhance the piece such as an art deco Venice arrangement but ultimately it's the charm and artistry of the leading pair that shines the brightest. Coming as it did during the Depression era Top Hat and the even better Swing Time a year later really were and still are tonics for the people I find it almost impossible to not lose myself in these types of pictures and the audiences of the 30s clearly felt the same as me.

	schema:reviewBody "With the nation in the midst of economic ruin who were better at lifting our spirits and making us smile? Why Fred and Ginger of course. I've got a feeling we'd better start watching their old movies again. Is Top Hat better than Swing Time? People have been staking out their positions for years. Me I think both represent the height of the AstaireRogers magic all wrapped up in some of the greatest songs ever written for Hollywood movies and with incomparable choreography and dancing. So I just flip a coin to decide...but I make sure I always use the coin with a head on each side. The story in Top Hat is inconsequential. It's all about Jerry Travers Fred Astaire an American dancing star in London who meets Dale Tremont Ginger Rogers the girl who charms him. It's love at first sight for Jerry but not for Dale. There are misunderstandings reconciliation comedy relief and...well who cares? The point is that in Top Hat both Astaire and Rogers have classic Astaire and Rogers characters to play he classy and without a major worry in the world she down to earth and a little hard to get. The plot is light sophisticated and moves quickly. The comedy relief provided by Eric Blore Edward Everett Horton Erik Rhodes and Helen Broderick often is genuinely amusing We are Bates! I will never allow women to wear my dresses again! and doesn't become tiresome. The songs by Irving Berlin are among the best he ever wrote and are so spotted within the movie that it seems we keep moving from exhilaration to exhilaration. That said the point of an AstaireRogers film is the dancing and then the way things happen through the dances and the songs... No Strings introduces us to Jerry in one of those wonderful all white art deco hotel suites where sophisticated people hang out. He tells us in song just the kind of freespirited guy he is...no strings and no connections no ties to my affections... and then moves into a fast and complicated tap dance all over the room. Just watch how Astaire perfectly picks out a counter rhythm with hand slaps against a shelf while he taps. Isn't This a Lovely Day to Be Caught in the Rain is a total charmer. In a gazebo Jerry tries to woo Dale. After singing the song he does a few steps and she hands in her pockets in her riding breeches surprises him by taking him on. A little challenge dance starts...and then we're off into one of those great wooing dances that only Astaire could create. The longer they dance the more we see how taken with each other they're becoming. They move from an easygoing beginning into a mutual and happy recognition that something serious may be happening. Then the rain and the thunder start and we're off again. When the dance is over we all know something seriously happy really has taken place. I think this number also is a fine example of how Berlin could craft a great song where the lyrics are so conversational it's too easy to overlook the skill he had in placing them into the music Isn't this a lovely day to be caught in the rain? You were going on your way now you've got to remain. Just as you were going leaving me all at sea the clouds broke they broke and oh what a break for me. I can see the sun up high though we're caught in a storm. I can see where you and I could be cozy and warm. Let the rain pitter patter but it really doesn't matter If the skies are grey. Long as I can be with you it's a lovely day Top Hat White Tie and Tails is a classic Astaire stage number a marvelous song impeccably delivered. Watch how he gives his head a little shake of sheer joi de vivre as he gives us that inimitable Astaire walk. Then it's on to all those 20 chorus boys in tuxes being mowed down by Astaire and his cane. The dance shifts from light to dark to light again. And watch how Astaire slows down the dancing and unexpectedly strikes several poses in silhouette. Great stuff. Cheek to Cheek is simply in my opinion one of the finest love sequences set on film. Astaire sings the song then the two of them launch into one of the great dance duets where the song the dancers and the choreography come as close to romantic perfection as you're likely to see. Even the feathers on Rogers' gown cooperate. The Piccolino is the big production closer an attempt to match the craze the Carioca in Flying Down to Rio set off. For sheer Hollywood sound stage spectacle  a Berlin hit song at least 30 dancing couples a singing chorus gondolas on canals a dish of veal that rhymes with piccolino and everyone in gowns and tuxes  it's hard to beat. Fans of Astaire will find invaluable Arlene Croce's The Fred Astaire  Ginger Rogers Book and John Mueller's Astaire Dancing The Musical Films.".

I can see the sun up high though we're caught in a storm. I can see where you and I could be cozy and warm. Let the rain pitter patter but it really doesn't matter If the skies are grey. Long as I can be with you it's a lovely day Top Hat White Tie and Tails is a classic Astaire stage number a marvelous song impeccably delivered. Watch how he gives his head a little shake of sheer joi de vivre as he gives us that inimitable Astaire walk. Then it's on to all those 20 chorus boys in tuxes being mowed down by Astaire and his cane. The dance shifts from light to dark to light again. And watch how Astaire slows down the dancing and unexpectedly strikes several poses in silhouette. Great stuff. Cheek to Cheek is simply in my opinion one of the finest love sequences set on film. Astaire sings the song then the two of them launch into one of the great dance duets where the song the dancers and the choreography come as close to romantic perfection as you're likely to see. Even the feathers on Rogers' gown cooperate. The Piccolino is the big production closer an attempt to match the craze the Carioca in Flying Down to Rio set off. For sheer Hollywood sound stage spectacle  a Berlin hit song at least 30 dancing couples a singing chorus gondolas on canals a dish of veal that rhymes with piccolino and everyone in gowns and tuxes  it's hard to beat. Fans of Astaire will find invaluable Arlene Croce's The Fred Astaire  Ginger Rogers Book and John Mueller's Astaire Dancing The Musical Films.";

However it bogs down with the standard storyline of mistaken identity which goes on and on and on. It just gets really annoying after awhile. Ginger Rogers and Helen Broderick continually mistreat and make accusations against their men. Then when they find out their mistakes they never apologize or act like they did anything wrong! At any rate it's always a pleasure to watch Rogers and Astaire dance together but these stories......yeech! At least Edward Edward Horton added something to the story. The dialog is very dated and for the millionth time you see marriage treated with no respect. Overall you can find a lot better AstaireRogers movies than this overrated turkey.".

	schema:reviewBody "Watching TOP HAT again I found myself completely spellbound. I'd seen it years ago in college and forgotten about it but seeing it again realized how much I love it. Any film that follows Shakespeare's formula  The course of true love never did run smooth  is really wish fulfillment in the literal sense for us all. It always seems that we had a clear shot at winning the heart of a lost love if we had been a different kind of person less given to the darker side of our nature. What strikes me about TOP HAT was Fred Astaire's persistence at wooing Ginger Rogers. It's done wonderfully as their dancing together supposedly spontaneous so graceful as to appear effortless establishes that the two are made for one another sharing in the same soul. When turmoil and mistaken identity befall the lovers and cause their separation the anticipation of their ultimate reunion is almost unbearable. Boy meets girl. Boy loses girl. Boy fights to win girl back. Classic stuff  the most basic archetypal story of the myths the persist in every culture apparently a story written into our genetic makeup. Has there ever been a lover as determined as Fred Astaire to win back his lost love? And yet his demeanor is almost careless so strong is his faith in the ultimate undeniable nature of Love. True Love as a force of nature. Inevitable. Melting away any and all opposition  Erik Rhodes' hapless ineffectual suitor Rogers' moral outrage at what she assumes to be Astaire's philandering nature even Rogers' loyalty and dedication to her best friend Madge Helen Broderick who she wrongly believes Astaire to be betraying. My favorite scene is when Astaire and Rogers are reunited in Venice and Rogers still believing Astaire to be betrothed to Madge who sits only a few feet away from the couple and despite all her righteous indignation at his presumed faithlessness is nevertheless overcome by the ecstasy she feels as they dance in one another's arms. It is the most erotic most impassioned love scene I have ever seen on film. She surrenders completely to the demands of love as we all must do or wish we had. Movies of course are not real life. Unlike the predetermined lives on the screen we mere mortals have a free choice that often betrays even our most innermost desires and needs no matter how hard they pound on our stone cold hearts.".

And whoever OK'd his screen tests should be punished for it. Of course that's not to say that anyone else in this movie can act either...the acting is on par with that of porn or the reenactments you see on those crime TV shows.I've never acted a day in my life and I know I could have delivered lines better than the actors did.To really accentuate the poor acting the writing was ridiculous both storyline and scripting. It's really hard to believe that this script actually made it past the person writing the check to fund this piece of crap.The fight scenes aren't much better either...between the heat seeking arrow scene and Randy Couture doing some MMA training with his body guards it took me about 20 minutes to realize I wasn't even going to have a little fun watching this thing.I loved the Mummy movies but I thought the first SK movie was pure cheese and this one ups the ante even further. It's really hard to believe Stephen Sommers the original writerdirector of the Mummy was involved in this one.".

There's no possible way to enjoy it if you take it seriously... but there's also no reason to take it seriously! But has there ever really been a good serious film in this genre? Precious few maybe none.Somewhere early on I got the idea that the movie felt pretty much exactly like playing a DD module and that mental picture actually really worked for me  it felt nostalgic. Once I had that in my head it was easy to favorably compare the film to many other films that have tried the same thing and failed much much more horribly. I have turned off many other contenders. Notice I'm still not saying that this film was good  just much less bad than a lot of films of the same general type. I'm saying it was good for a B movie.It was good for a B movie especially because the acting and script were not gratingly horrible. Okay the wrestlerdude king was as stiff as a board I can't deny that. But the young fella and whatshercuteface were actually pretty good and the scribe guy wasn't so horrible either. They seemed to be comfortable and having fun in their silly little roles and they were actually responding to each other not just reading the lines. That's way way more than you can expect from most B movies.So seriously don't take this film seriously. Of course it's not good. If you want to watch this sort of thing cut it some slack and have a good time. You could definitely do worse!".

	schema:reviewBody "Don't take this film too seriously  the filmmakers obviously didn't. Although it's set in a period long long ago most of the characters look talk and act VERY contemporary. Equally contemporary is the use of bullet time in some of the fight scenes! I wouldn't count on it for a lesson in mythology either hmmm and I thought the Minotaur was killed by Theseus!. And there are a few too many scenes where the characters are simply walking around while we're waiting for something to happen. On the bright side Russell Mulcahy is an experienced Bmovie director and the film delivers enough spectacle with clear cinematography and some imaginative special effects the best being the transportation from the labyrinth to Hades. The script is basically yet another quest for vengeance story but it does have a nice doubletwist at the end. Oh and I hope we'll get to see more of the breathtakingly beautiful and exotic Karen David in the years to come. Wow what a woman. Smart move to put her and the also beautiful and exotic Natalie Becker on the DVD cover  without those two I would never have rented this film. 12".

	schema:reviewBody "The Scorpion King 2  Rise of a WarriorI honestly think that the current rating of 3.8 is not doing this movie justice and I will try to find words why I think so. The action which I would say is most important here was actually pretty well done at least as far as a PG13movie can do it that is the fights were well choreographed and slowmotion was used quite effectively. I would exclude the scenes of Randy Couture wrestling down his opponents because I wasn't aware that the Egyptians invented the WWF as well. As for the characters they were likable although clich then again so were the characters in the first movie. At least they were not the type of unlikeable idiots one has to deal with in many horrormovies or comedies. They were all well cast with the exception of our hero's mother who looked totally out of place for the setting. Also I have to say I never quite felt the charm that some reviewers attest Dwayne Johnson in the first part. I thought he did not do well as a main character at least in this kind of movie. I would even go as far as saying that Michael Copon looks the part better than The Rock does. The set design and costume design were good. The weapons and armor looked real enough to appear to be more than toys real enough to suspend one's disbelieve. As for the setting I'd say you can't go wrong with desertandEgyptianstyletemples.On the other hand the story was predictable and there were some plot holes but overall it could have been worse especially towards the ending I was even quite surprised. And it has been done worse in countless other movies of this kind. It's just an average youngboyrisestoherostory and for 90 minutes of entertaining what can be wrong with that? Unfortunately and that is a big letdown to call the special effects average would be already exaggerating. They are only slightly above Playstation1Level especially in some crucial scenes. But also here you will find worse.So all in all I rate this movie 6 out of 10. It's not as good as the first part but if you liked the Mummymovies if you liked the first Scorpion Kingfilm andor if you simply like swordandsorcererflicks and I do give it a watch.".

It was BAD. It was like watching a TV series pilot episode of Young Hercules. THe BAD  Horrible effects. the CGI is bad. At times CGI for the creatures look like old Ray Harryhausen stopmotion effects. Don't know if this was intentionalthe producers wanting a more classic look to the movie or just the result of unskilled CGI artists or low budget.  Bad script and wooden acting. I have no idea why Randy Couture's is up on the DVD casing in such big letters. HE CAN'T ACT and He's given terrible lines!!! Sargon comes across as some Dragonball Z villain reject. Other lines for other characters in the script make the movie sound like a Saturday morning cartoon.  predictable stock characterization. The hot warrior chick comic relief Asian guy quirky englishmanhe's supposed to be Greek in the show sexy evil goddess etc etc. Been there done that. BORING.  Been there done that story. The good  THe director. THe direction especially the fight scenes are excellent. This director seems to be able to make the most of the movie's small budget and at least provide some interesting action to counter the uninteresting story. It is thanks to creative directing that the low budget of the movie is not so easily seen at first glance.  Michael Copon the actor who plays young Scorpion king. Though he doesn't look like a young Rock At least he tries to mimic the way the Dwayne theRock Johnsonin the previous SCorpion king movie moves acts and speaks. He even flashes the Rock's eyebrow thingy move during the movie. 1 last comment. AFter watching this seems that either the Mummy Returns has their history wrong or THe Scorpion king Mathyus is a really silly man. During his life he fought a A warrior king who made a pact with a dark god in exchange for eternal power and ends up as some scorpion monster b A warlord with a marauding legion of troops that go around conquering citiesAnd by the time the flashback at the start of Mummy Returns happens Mathyus is doing BOTH those things. Commanding a marauding legion which conquers cities AND making pacts with dark gods resulting in a Scorpion monster transformation.A bit of trivia Mathyus at first wanted to travel to Egypt to get the spear of Osiris to defeat Sargon. But he is convinced to go to Greece instead for a different artifact. The Spear of Osiris is what Rick O connell used in Mummy Returns to kill the monster Scorpion king.".

At times CGI for the creatures look like old Ray Harryhausen stopmotion effects. Don't know if this was intentionalthe producers wanting a more classic look to the movie or just the result of unskilled CGI artists or low budget.  Bad script and wooden acting. I have no idea why Randy Couture's is up on the DVD casing in such big letters. HE CAN'T ACT and He's given terrible lines!!! Sargon comes across as some Dragonball Z villain reject. Other lines for other characters in the script make the movie sound like a Saturday morning cartoon.  predictable stock characterization. The hot warrior chick comic relief Asian guy quirky englishmanhe's supposed to be Greek in the show sexy evil goddess etc etc. Been there done that. BORING.  Been there done that story. The good  THe director. THe direction especially the fight scenes are excellent. This director seems to be able to make the most of the movie's small budget and at least provide some interesting action to counter the uninteresting story. It is thanks to creative directing that the low budget of the movie is not so easily seen at first glance.  Michael Copon the actor who plays young Scorpion king. Though he doesn't look like a young Rock At least he tries to mimic the way the Dwayne theRock Johnsonin the previous SCorpion king movie moves acts and speaks. He even flashes the Rock's eyebrow thingy move during the movie. 1 last comment. AFter watching this seems that either the Mummy Returns has their history wrong or THe Scorpion king Mathyus is a really silly man. During his life he fought a A warrior king who made a pact with a dark god in exchange for eternal power and ends up as some scorpion monster b A warlord with a marauding legion of troops that go around conquering citiesAnd by the time the flashback at the start of Mummy Returns happens Mathyus is doing BOTH those things. Commanding a marauding legion which conquers cities AND making pacts with dark gods resulting in a Scorpion monster transformation.A bit of trivia Mathyus at first wanted to travel to Egypt to get the spear of Osiris to defeat Sargon. But he is convinced to go to Greece instead for a different artifact. The Spear of Osiris is what Rick O connell used in Mummy Returns to kill the monster Scorpion king.";

The secondary characters except for the wooden Sargon add another positive as does the pacing but still small change.Then there's the scene with Astarte in the cave  bordering on camp but underplayed just enough to work and work well with her flowing wardrobe transforming from seductive open robe to warrior armor and back again. The scene flirts with disaster at every step yet avoids falling into the pit Layla spends a great deal of time vocally dangling above. The counterpoint between Layla dangling with commentary and Astarte flirting with Mathayus comes close to being a B movie gem. All of the elements from dialog to editing gel elevating all of them to a greater whole.That isn't to say that is Oscar material but for what it is it works extremely well.It does suffer when compared to The Scorpion King or Conan but both of those movies represent the pinnacle of the genre.

There were too many inconsistencies with an already established story line such as overly and inappropriately pushing the scorpion concept the Akkadians and our hero's brother. Furthermore the story tends to be rather choppy pushing to get to the action and making the action and special effects the main focus. However an impressive cast did a nice job with their performances. There were some great fight sequences including a terrific girls' fight and well done special effects.You will enjoy this film if you lower your expectations before pressing the play button.".

The straight to DVD release and lack of adds for it didn't help my outlook. I was also completely unfamiliar with the actors too not having seen them in anything.Lo and Behold I actually liked this one better than the first one and that had the actors I've heard of! The chemistry between the actors in Scorpion King 2 was one of the strong points of the film. The Greek philosopher and the main male and female leads are what save this film from being a disaster.The script is fairly clever  fun. Although it was often anachronistic to the time period the movie is set in and this detracts from the experience slightly.In comparison to the first Scorpion King movie there were more sets and effects and in my opinion they were better executed too. Though they still made me feel like I was watching a somewhat costly episode of Xena or Hercules.Anyway it's a solid B movie. If you go in with high expectations of this being like the Mummy movies you will be very disappointed. If on the other hand you like B movies and lighthearted sword and sorcery romps akin to the aforementioned made for TV programs or the first movie in this spin off series you just might be pleasantly surprised if you give this film a chance.".

What it does lack however is a satisfying ending and a subplot that would given an added depth to the characters. I still think it deserves a 5 rating as it's different than most movies it doesn't follow the standard 'stupidpeople walking straight into doom' recipe. It's beautifully shot at locations that I'd love to see in real life. It did get a notch or two higher for the effort. If the last 15 minutes of it had been a bit more scary and gruesome I'd definitely would've given it a 6 or a 7. If you are after a Texas Chainsawkind of deal you are most likely looking in the wrong direction but if you are not then this might tickle the fright in you just enough for it to be worth renting.".

But Turistas is better viewed when you're not expecting it to be that great. There were a few parts I thought were somewhat dumb but the acting isn't bad. All of the actors are in their late 20's to early 30's which I thought was good because I did NOT want to see another dumb teendriven horror flick. But I don't see Turistas as a horror movie. It was a thriller that was actually somewhat scary which is something that suspense movies these days lack terribly.The parts I didn't like about it were overlookable. Like in the underwater scenes I thought the acting could have been a little better but in the long run Turistas isn't a failure. I think there are much worse movies that could be on the Bottom 100 like Lady In The Water for example. So if Turistas is showing now at a 2ndrun house near you you should go see it. Hopefully you won't hate it as much as typical IMDb folk do. They're all idiots anyway.".

I have just seen this film on DVD I am Brazilian and I totally disagree with this position. First of all Turistas is fictional based on the urban legend or reality of traffic of human organs and the story takes place in Brazil the same way this theme is approached in London in Stephen Frears's Dirty Pretty Things or the violent Hostel is in Slovakia. Second director John Stockwell seems to be absolutely familiarized with the usual behavior of simple people from the Northeastern of Brazil and the way of thinking of average tourists. They give hospitality to tourists they are friendly they like to party and dance the prices of food and lodging are very low the bus drivers do not respect the traffic laws even the use of drug to rob incautious tourists therefore he discloses the reality in a magnificent landscape. Further there are many funny lines in Portuguese. The sinister theme has a good and logical approach and the performances are great and realistic only the conclusion is weak in the plot. Of course the fate of the backpackers is fictional and the possibility of an incident like this happen is practically null. Welcome to Brazil actually a nice place to be visited. My vote is seven.Title Brazil Turistas Tourists".

I watched the movie and it was very very good.It had a great story line that was believable and made it more creepy. When something exciting was not happening it had great visuals of Brazil. It had some intense scenes also. It also had a lot of shocking parts u would not expect. I really liked this movie. Better then hostel definitely. It shouldn't have a bad rating. At least should have a 7 or 8. Worth watching.".

I mean its nothing more than average even know I thought it did have some originality. Any average horrorslasher fan would probably enjoy it it's no worse than wolf creek or hostel. The film did a good job of setting their tones they did a good job at pacing and they managed to do a good job with the intensity. The camera works a little frustrating at first but you get used to it and it ends up working for the film. The deaths and special effects aren't the most amazing at looking realistic but they did a good job with their budget. I also really liked how they developed the characters in this but they could use less gore I mean I know thats whats getting the audience for some reason lately but it didn't feel necessary and they kept a gross scene on for just too long.Overall Don't get me wrong this movie isn't excellent but its not as bad as everyones saying it is. If you liked wolf creek hostel into the blue or the descent then you'll probably enjoy this it's worth a look.".

A bunch of young tourists from Australia the UK and the US are left high and dry when the bus they are traveling in is destroyed and their personal effects are stolen. There are no points for guessing what happens next. There are elements of Dr. Butcher MD in this beautifully shot horror pic that lavishes attention on the hot bodies of its female stars. It is not as violent or as gory as the recent Texas Chainhsaw Massacre  The Beginning but director Stockwell who played Arnie's best friend in Christine does a great job of building the suspense. By intercutting the situation the turistas are facing with what the bad guys are up to Stockwell creates an atmosphere of impending dread and hopelessness. There is a gory scene in which a stomach is cut open in graphic detail Men Behind The Sunstyle and organs are removed and there are also a couple of vicious assaults but the name of the game here is tension. Some of the underwater material is gorgeous to look at recalling the mood of Argento's Inferno and the jungle setting is unsettling. Although the film runs out of steam towards the end and spends a bit too much time underwater it is nevertheless a very decent horror pic set in an exotic milieu and enhanced by some gruesome realistic scenes of violence.".

It draws out it's characters well sets up moments of suspense for the horrors that will come and keeps the viewer interested due to it's beautiful cinematography.Once the terror and violence actually begin which doesn't happen until the last third of the movie no less it goes way downhill. For one it was marketed as a torture movie but there is barely any of it! Sure there's a brutal killing here and there but when it came to gore this film was very tame. Second the cinematography in during the night scenes was awfulwith the chase scenes and violence barely viewable. You could not tell what was happening on screen and all of the viewers of the film were lost with what was going on. Third the last third was extremely predictable. You could tell who was going to die and when. The main villain who ironically looks like the President of Iran is not well drawn out and the climax of the film is pitiful.There is however fine acting jobs done by all involved and a particular death scene that made me squirm in my seat due to its brutality and intensity. When the chase scenes and violence were actually viewable of which it rarely was it actually was pretty intense. However the actual deaths were not save one or two and the dumb decisions made by all of the characters may be the stupidest yet to grace the screen this year.It's sad. Turistas had potential. It started off great but just went in the wrong direction I guess. I have never seen a movie that fell so much on its rear.".

Alex Josh Duhamel his sister Bea Olivia Wilde and her best friend Amy Beau Garrett hear about a cabana bar just down the road from passersby and decide to go to the bar instead of waiting for the next bus to arrive. They find the bar on an alluring beach. The women put their bikinis on and run into the water with the men behind them. They are having the time of their lives in the sun and surf. When night falls they begin to party with the locals by drinking and dancing all night. They awaken with their faces in the sand the next morning and discover that the bar is deserted and all of their possessions have been stolen. They start walking to the next town where they meet Kiko Agles Steib who takes them to his uncle's house which just happens to be a 10hour trek in the jungle. Kiko shows them a beautiful underwater cavern with air pockets that they dive into and begin to explore. What they don't know is their adventure in paradise is about to become a terrifying one.My Comment If you want to see three hot chicks in bikinis the whole movie and beautiful scenery of Brazil along with some petrifying situations and gory blood scenes this is one movie to see. The storyline has its share of action and chase scenes with great suspense. If you are claustrophobic about being underwater and inside a cave you will not like some of the scenes because you will find yourself gasping for air as if you were there. The scene where Amy is being operated on is so graphic that you may want to turn your head. This horror thriller will keep you on the edge of your seat because you won't know what is going to happen next. I know that this movie has convinced me that I don't ever want to go to Brazil. However if you do go to Brazil my advice to you is to take the plane not the bus. Fox Atomic Run time 129 Rated R810".

	schema:reviewBody "I was really shocked when I logged onto IMDb and saw the user rating for this film at a 3.2 out of 10. You've got to be joking me!? This film wasn't even close to being that bad. I'd say that it deserves at least a 5 out of 10 average but I personally would give it much higher of a rating. Turistas follows siblings Alex Josh Duhamel and Bea Olivia Wilde and Bea's friend Amy Beau Garrett who are traveling in the beautiful country of Brazil. After being in a neardeadly bus crash they meet another traveler Pru Melissa George and two European brothers and decide to head down to a popular beach spot while waiting for another bus. They end up staying longer and partying all night but awaken on the beach and realize they were drugged. After getting in trouble with some locals they go with a man who they met on the beach Kiko to a secluded house in the jungle to spend the night. Little do they know a psychopathic surgeon is awaiting their arrival and they have been lured there to become unwilling organ donors for other Brazilians who are awaiting transplants through the black market.I have to say that I was actually really pleased with Turistas. The ridiculously low user rating is a mystery to me because as far as I'm concerned this was an aboveaverage horror film that is much better than the most recent entries in the genre. Often compared with Hostel but much more similar to Wolf Creek if you ask me this film is light years better in my opinion this was a really entertaining film. The plot isn't entirely original  young adults pursued by a psycho in a foreign country. It's been done before many times but the tropical setting and the twisting of the plot mainly the reason the tourists are being killed really makes this film stand out. Rather than a slasher movie this is much more of a survival horror film and a suspenseful one at that. The pacing was nicely plotted as well and I was never uninterested always a good thing. The tension slowly builds during the first forty minutes or so and after that all hell breaks loose. Another thing that really made this movie stand out from others though was the setting  the crystal clear waters misty jungles and amazing Brazilian beaches were beautiful. While it may not be your typical horror film setting it's made use of here and is some great eye candy. I also have to mention the underwater cave sequences which were amazing to look at but also really claustrophobic. I couldn't even imagine being in the petrifying situations these characters endured.Surprisingly the acting in the film was really good also. Josh Duhamel an up and coming new star is the male leadolder brother and plays the part well. Melissa George of the Amityville Horror remake is an Australian traveler who becomes friends with the group and she was excellent. Olivia Wilde plays Duhamel's younger sister and Beau Garrett plays her friend. I thought all of the acting was actually very believable and while some of the more minor characters were a little underdeveloped the characters and the actors playing them were all very good. My only real complaint about the film would be a couple editing issues. There were a couple of times that I was confused as to what was going on and the time could have been addressed more clearly but overall these were very minor problems that had no effect on the film. Unlike other films similar to this Turistas isn't over done in the gore department  there's enough suspense and sufficient shocks to keep the film scary. Granted there are a few grossout scenes but nothing as ridiculously violent and unbelievable as what you'd find in Hostel. Overall Turistas is a suspenseful surprisingly believable and very fun horror movie. It has some slick imagery and a beautiful setting plus the storyline is really well written. Some may call it a rip off of Hostel but I personally think it was heaps better  some may strongly disagree but I thought Hostel was pure garbage. Anyway the point is if you like intense survival horror movies Turistas could be a really nice treat. Ignore the currently low user rating this film isn't even remotely as bad as it's made out to be. A solid 810 pushing a 9.".

Slammed with tanned bodies and topless television actresses Turistas brings a new low to the Horror genre that seems to be an easy moneymaker these days. The plot about some tourists who get robbed on a paradise beach and are then used for organ donations does seem interesting on paper but thanks to Stockwell's incompetent direction this lowbro catered adventure leads nowhere quick. Among the eight or so tourists that get trapped in this third world torture scenario none of which deliver noteworthy nor engaging performances most of them get killed so quickly we forget they were part of the caiparinia loving bunch to begin with. Much of the film has the fastpaced choppy editing attributed to its lack of competency lending to some of its unwatchable traits. No doubt there is a huge demographic that will eat this film up especially between the ages of twelve and seventeen. Others looking for the Hostellike imagery putting the premise aside will be greatly disappointed. There are a limited amount of shocking bloody scenes only making Turistas more of a teen film as the on screen deaths become less almost as if they ran out of funds half way through the production.Turistas definitely does not live up to the hype and extensive marketing campaign that has lead up to its release. Unfortunately it seems once Hollywood sees a decent idea they steal it gear it toward an easy to please demographic and then make it look glossy forgetting all about the substance along the way.I wonder what other country they will pick next to be the subject of Hollywood's torturing tactics. Towards the end of the film Stockwell does somewhat redeem Brazil's dignity that was lost all throughout  despite the films on screen excuse being the white man's colonization of the Portuguese speaking country. Overall Turistas is a forgettable attempt at making a rigid franchise. Fox Atomic has allot of work to do before they decide to revisit this terrain.".

The best thing about this movie was its ability to use Paranoia. Not necessarily the Hitchcock form but still for a big budget horror movie its vibe and atmosphere is very solid. I found myself being a little scared for no apparent reason which is a good thing for a horrorslasher to do. overall good movie good young acting great scares and just a cool movie to chill and watch with some friends. check it out.".

Therefore I've rated this one comparing it to other horror movies hence the 8.The main problem of this movie was its promotion. It did sell itself as a gore movie and put itself in the same category of Hostel. But this is not the case. If you really want to see a gore movie with torture blood and gross stuff for the major part of the film go and see Hostel I personally found the plot in Hostel interesting but the rest of the movie too unrealistic and kept laughing most of the time The acting in Turistas is quite good and contrary to what other comments wrote this is quite realistic and nobody is really making stupid choices. The good guys are not the usual stupid ones with the Ok let's split in small groups ! kind of line and most of their decisions are taken because there is no apparent danger or because the danger yet is obliging them to take a specific route. The villains are not all heartless whose unique goal is to kill people just because well.... they are the villains I wouldn't classified this movie as a gorehorror one but would definitely put it in the adventurehorror category. Please note that there are some gore moments as seen in Hostel but the difference is that they do not take the major part of the movie. The adventure is quite good and if you have claustrophobia or plan to travel to Brazil I wouldn't recommend Turistas. They are 2 or 3 mistakes in the scripts such as things that are not there and then appear from nowhere but I won't spoil the movie telling more.I noticed that some comments wrote that there was a dark part where you don't see anything. Once again this movie is quite realistic and they did not switch on the light in the middle of the jungle but you can see what's going on I saw it on DVD not at the cinema I remember watching Superman Returns at the cinema and not being able to see what was going on at the end. Finally this is true that the end in not unpredictable but this is not the kind of movie where I would expect a twist at the end. Simply because I found it quite realistic But I would still go back to Brazil !!!.".

The audience gets to meet the bad guy long before the leads do not to give anything away but he takes out one of his own guys in one of the nastier kills I've seen lately  actually I saw nastier in Saw III but this was more real so it is nastier to me. Our leads arrive at the evil doctor's house and we then see one of the most protracted blood and gore scenes that have seen the inside of a movie theater in awhile. A few of the good guys escape the doctor and his goons in a very tense and gory but somewhat uninventive escape sequence as far as the deaths go except for a scene with a sickle chopping into a guy's foot from below. They make their way to a river which starts to flow underground. As they swim into the underground river the water levels start to fill entire cave and there is one of coolest underwater chases that I've ever seen. They are sucking air out of tiny air pockets in the top of the caves to keep going. Don't know exactly how they shot this. Another cool bloody fight and death where a guy impales on a pointed rock hanging from the roof of the cave when he comes up for air. The survivors meet up in an underground cave where the river ends and are chased down but the bad doctor and his henchmen. Cool ending which I won't give away the details but you do get to see the doctors brains. This is a very cool movie  combination of the gore of a Saw or Hostel with great action chase sequences and awesome scenery and photography. 910".

	schema:reviewBody "After getting to the movie theatre my girlfriend and I checked the times and were left with a decision. See Saw 3 or see Turista. After speaking to the dude working on the ticket booth we weren't any the wiser if Turista was going to be a good movie or not. We still unfortunately picked it over Saw 3 though. Having seen Saw 1 and 2 which were OK movies and my logic that Saw 3 would be out on DVD soon we thought we would go with something different. Big mistake! Don't waste your money on this movie if you are looking for a movie with scare factor. Never in my life have I been so bored! It goes like this. A group of tourists 6 to be precise get stranded in middle of nowhere after their bus crashes. After getting drunk drugged and robbed and still stranded with nowhere to go they are tricked into going off to a house they believe they will be safe to stay at that conveniently has no roads leading to it in the middle of the Jungle where it is obvious they are to be operated on by an evil doctor and their organs sold to the black market after the references made to tourists going missing and organs being sold in the beginning plus we see the doctor working in the hospital and you can see him in the reflection of the girls pupil in the preview that they conveniently played just before we watched the movie. The build up to the finale was painfully boring and long pretty much like reading my review except you don't have to pay for this and it wont take you 90 minutes to read it yet feel like 4 hours. It should have been a small section of the film but it was in fact the majority of the film with what felt like 10minutes of rushed supposed survival horror at the end. The truth was though that there was no suspense or fear in any of the movie. My girlfriend and I stayed in the hope something would happen when the doctor villain of the piece arrived at the house but again we were very disappointed. I.e. As the doctor operates the only scene in which he does anything like this on one of the American girls Amy removing all her organs it isn't scary. It's just gross. She is drugged and you don't get the feeling that she is in any pain. It to me was just a lame scene. On the preview and at the start of the movie the way in which it showed these scenes was scarier then the actual way they were shot in the movie itself. The preview is very misleading!! It has a girl talking as if she is begging for her life before being operated on. This does not happen! In fact I think they took scenes of dialect etc and mashed them together to make the preview. Don't let the preview fool you. This movie is terrible! It felt like we were in there for about 4 hours to get to this finale of events which were poorly scripted and unbelievable. It isn't a movie in which you are waiting to see who is going to get operated on next or is going to disappear. It's a hash of a film. The next part im going to describe was badly scripted and unbelievable in my opinion. Liam wants to go back for his buddy Finn but Alex says no it's too dangerous. To me this wasn't believable. Alex's sister's friend is in there and as far as he knows she is still alive. They have travelled all that way to Brazil together. What man would leave a girl he knows there and run off into a jungle in the pitch black in which you wouldn't know where the hell you were going anyways. Its just the same old unbelievable rubbish but it doesn't have you feeling jumpy or fearful like even some of the poorer flicks do it. I just sat there thinking when will this rubbish end! They do go back but again they get into the situation where they chose to run instead of stand their ground again. Who would run into a jungle when you know you wouldn't have anywhere to run to and the people chasing you would know the land a hell of a lot better. You have a man with a spike screaming in pain above you so instead of take the handgun you have and putting two in his chest you run away and wait for him to recover take his rifle and shoot one of you in the head! A real story line as people keep saying this movie felt more realistic the others which I think is quite a joke comment would have meant they stayed and fought the doctor and his couple of dumb goons and used the helicopters radio to call for help. For me this movie was just another sh movie that didn't make any sense wasn't scary had flawed story was way to long in the build up and had a shite ending The water cave scenes went on for to long was to dark and there was only one man chasing three of them under water yet they still ran! The very end was even dumber. They all behaved as if nothing had happened boarding the plane. It almost felt as if it was a happy ending. But to me it just felt like unrealistic behaviour. You wouldn't have thought Alex and Beau had lost their friend Amy as they got on the plane. I can't believe that anyone has given this movie a high rating! All I can say is you must be very easily scared if you found this movie even remotely scary! To any normal people out there give this movie a wide berth! It sucks.".

I had heard somewhere forgive my forgetfulness regarding the source that Turistas was a scarier and better movie than Hostel. These two friends of mine saw Hostel and loved it I was not impressed with Hostel. So I thought we might all like Turistas.This movie develops so slowly that I was dying waiting for something to happen. And it wasn't like the good kind of waiting where everything that is happening leads up to thrills and chills and becomes a very important part of the plot. The plot of the movie could have been done so much better. Turistas is nothing close to Hostel which again I was not impressed with.There are no scary parts whatsoever. The nudity in the movie is sparse and simple so if you are looking for or expecting more than that you will be disappointed.I was so embarrassed to have suggested this movie to my friends. I feel like it was an absolute waste of time and money and unlike others here I only spent 5.75. It isn't even a movie worth saying at least I've seen it. If you think Turistas is a good film I really think you haven't seen much of anything that is actually good.".

These two friends of mine saw Hostel and loved it I was not impressed with Hostel. So I thought we might all like Turistas.This movie develops so slowly that I was dying waiting for something to happen. And it wasn't like the good kind of waiting where everything that is happening leads up to thrills and chills and becomes a very important part of the plot. The plot of the movie could have been done so much better. Turistas is nothing close to Hostel which again I was not impressed with.There are no scary parts whatsoever. The nudity in the movie is sparse and simple so if you are looking for or expecting more than that you will be disappointed.I was so embarrassed to have suggested this movie to my friends. I feel like it was an absolute waste of time and money and unlike others here I only spent 5.75. It isn't even a movie worth saying at least I've seen it. If you think Turistas is a good film I really think you haven't seen much of anything that is actually good.";

Enter some shady characters desperate for some black market body parts...Turistas is a swiftly moving thriller that really grabs one from the beginning and only grows more intense throughout. At the same time the film really avoids the horror clichs very nicely and turns out a twisted and unpredictable story. While comparisons between Turistas and Eli Roth's Hostel are inevitable this little horror ride actually has much more in common with the excellent 2005 horror film Wolf Creek. Much like that film Turistas is a thriller that relies upon suspense and tension rather than on brutal violence and gore. Although it does have its share of cringeworthy moments with some occasional graphic images. Also Turistas is slickly filmed in a kind of documentary style that makes the occurrences on screen all the more believable  and more startling. The filming locations are fantastic the story is very edgy the cast is solid and the suspense is wellcrafted. In short those that enjoy gripping horror films like High Tension Wolf Creek Hostel etc. will find this film a worthy ride. It's one of the best sleeperhorror films we've seen this year!  12 out of ".

His role is not only believable it is I may be exaggerating as always perfect. It's a memorable film with one of the best soundtracks I remember from a nonmusicalfilm. Maybe the strength given to some scenes by the perfectly chosen songs is one of the reasons you must watch the film. It will tear off some of your memories or maybe it will call your own adolescent back to tell you some things you and I should never forget.".

	schema:headline " I cannot say I am crazy for this film";
	schema:reviewBody "Crazy is a German 95minute movie from 2000 so this one is already over 15 years old. It is among the most known works of writer and director HansChristian Schmid and he got many actors in here that will be recognized immediately by German film buffs. This includes Stadlober Klauner Schilling Manzel MllerElmau Hummer Herfurth very first career performance and Lara maybe others too. As this film is already approaching the twodecade mark most of these were still pretty young at that point. The film won several awards and score more nominations also at the German Film Awards where it was picked as one of the three best movies of the year. I cannot share this praise though. The film's biggest strength is realism. It does not try to depict a world or a life that always results in happy endings. It shows struggles and successes at the same time. All the characters are flawed and fight their own problems even the minor characters. It is probably Stadlober's careerdefining performance so far and this film turned him into a bit of a star that he hes not stayed until today. But Bravo etc. were all crazy for him back then. So yeah I personally do not see great range or talent in him so I am not surprised by the path his career took. And his character was also a major problem for me here in this film. There is so much emphasis on his disability really but honestly nobody really hated him because of that or discriminated against him. It's tough to feel for 'him I think when apart from one scene maybe there is no discrimination at all. Same can be said about Schilling's character. I personally found him really unlikable and I find it difficult to understand that we should cheer for his friendship to the protagonist with all the mean stuff he does to everybody around him. All in all I felt Schmid was pretty focused on writing human characters with flaws and he somewhat managed to hide the flaws this film has at the very same time and sometimes it feels like they are as justified as the imperfect characters.As for the story this is the tale of a teenager who struggles with school especially maths but much more struggles with lack of acceptance. At least that's how he feels it is. This also includes his relationship with girls and you can wonder if he will get the girl of his dreams or if he will succeed and make it to the next grade. Just remember realism is king in here. Anyway another problem I had with the film is how the character interacts effortlessly and in such a selfconfident manner on many occasions even with the girl he has a crush on. I think it did not fit the struggling shy introvert character that the protagonist was depicted as early on. But that's just my personal perception. Same goes for the cookie wanking scene. I found it really gross to be honest. I am not sure how realistic it is if people really do stuff like that at the age of 16 or so. I know I didn't. But maybe it's just me and here again my dislike is entirely of a subjective nature. Overall I think none of the performances or the script wowed me at all and I feel the negative outweighs the positive. I cannot agree with the awards attention the film received or with the IMDb rating here. Thumbs down from me and I don't recommend it.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is a portrait of the halfspastic teenage boy Benjamin who has to visit a boarding school because of his lousy marks in Math. He didn't make the best experiences in life before and got serious selfesteem issues. After a rough start at his new school he starts making friends falls in love with a girl and does some American Pieish teenage stuff.Beside some comedy elements the film is told in a very serious way focussing on Benjamin and his problems.If you already don't like this story outline save your time and watch something else. If you do please be aware of the following1 Benjamin is a total loser. Whatever he does he does it terribly wrong and then he goes for selfpity all the time. For me he wasn't that kind of charming loser who you can feel sympathy for and laugh with. Instead he and his behavior really annoyed me and with my own teenage years not so far behind I could barely stand watching.2 The film hardly tries to be realistic and the story seems to be but from my experience the characters just aren't except for Janosch maybe. And yes I know this film is based on an autobiography written by a 17year old  but having some experiences with German schools and German youth myself I don't believe him.3 Showing the sexual awakening really is an important thing for a film with this subject. But I doubt that teenage boys do an Ejaculate on the cookiecontest where everyone has to hit a cookie with his sperm during massmasturbation in the woods and the loser has to eat the spermwet cookie afterwards. Although it kinda amused me in a contemptible way it's nor funny neither underlining the serious attempts of this film.4 There's a subplot about Benjamin's family and his father betraying his wife  still I don't know why it's there and where to put it. It just bored me.Well I personally hated this film for having the character of Benjamin being without a message concept scheme whatever and it's failing attempts to be dramatic and serious. However I can image that some people may find it sensible and touching. If you liked The Other Sister you'll probably like this one too. I hated both.17year old boys shouldn't write an autobiography and if they do it doesn't seem to be the best idea to make a film out of it.2 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Eye 2008 I knew going into the theater that this would be a bit scary. OK maybe traumatizing. I had a LASIK procedure done a couple of years ago and although I wasn't blind beforehand I did have pretty bad eyesight. I know a bit about the trepidation  perhaps even outright terror  one feels before undergoing an operation on one's eyeballs. I still get a little skeeved when I see a closeup of eyes come to think of it.Jessica Alba plays Sydney a blind concert violinist who has a double corneal transplant and of course things go wrong. Not with the surgery itself but with the psychological aftermath  she sees dead people. And dead things. And undead. And so on it looks like she's tapped into a spiritual world or something. No one else can see what she's seeing which is par for the course in movieland but all of the demons and smoke and fire and other sfx seem extremely utterly real to Sydney.Alba is excellent showing that she has more than just two or three talents to show the world. Her Sydney is appealing in her vulnerability Alba a beautiful young woman manages to make you feel as if her character could indeed live in your world less glitzy starlet more threedimensional person. Of course she's still a knockout and she IS a supremely talented musician and she DOES live in a superposh apartment in a high rise but still. Alba shows wonderful range from tender to fragile without giving up any sincerity. The movie hinges on her ability to sell the audience on her character's Everywoman to a point status and I think she delivers.Some of you may be thinking you've already seen this movie before when it was called Blink. In Blink Madeline Stowe played a young woman who lost her sight as a child as did Sydney and then grew up to be a talented violinist after a new eye operation temporarily restores some sight she sees things. Just like Sydney. Huh. Still this isn't a redo of Blink it's a remake of a Chinese film called Gin gwai. Asian films have made the rounds of Hollywood in recent years The Ring The Grudge Dark Water and although the remakes usually don't have the subversive bite of their original counterparts some of them hold up rather well when inundated with hightech CGI. The Eye does use special effects but it uses them  pardon me  to great effect you're not overwhelmed with attentiongrabbing CGI.The biggest debit in the movie is the love interest Sydney's doctor Paul Alessandro Nivola who seems dull and unimportant although his believing in and trusting Sydney is a linchpin for moving the plot. He just seems vacant and stiff hardly a commendation of Nivola's acting abilities. Think of a younger Dylan McDermott. On the other hand a good counterbalance to Nivola is Parker Posey as Sydney's concerned sister who although she doesn't immediately buy into Sydney's rantings does empathize and attempt to understand a bit better than the hunky doctor.Overall The Eye is a tense shudderfilled movie that manages to dress up a recycled plot with deadon performances and evocative cinematography.".

	schema:reviewBody "The infinite monkey theorem states that a monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter for an infinite amount of time will eventually produce the works of Shakespeare. Coincidently this same theory applies to the onslaught of Asian horror remakes that is stomping Hollywood into submission. If enough of these films are remade then eventually one will be acceptable and alas it has happened.The Eye starring Jessica Alba is directed by two relative first timers by the names of David Moreau and Xavier Palud and they can certainly create a film that boasts certain elements of stylish direction. Unfortunately along with the good it seems that all of this style of remake fear deviation from a backbone template. Not to give anything away to those who are not familiar with Asian horror remakes but one element that is consistent is that the basis of all the evil happenings is from a spirit looking for salvation of some sort. While The Eye does choose to spin this clich slightly it is afraid to go all the way.Suffering from total blindness after a childhood accident young beauty Sydney Wells Alba is given a chance at an eye transplant that will allow her to see for the first time in decades. Not surprisingly she begins to see things that ought not to be. Aided by an appointed shrink played by Alessandro Nivola they confront the visions and try to track the donor eyes back to their sinister source. This journey is bounds more intelligent then the average horror story and the standard for dumb decisions is cleverly hidden by the fact that Sydney is fully or partially blind for most of the film. This presents a cushion of forgives per se as her lack of sight can lead her into frightening situations without appearing ignorant.And there are certainly some frightening boo moments uniquely accentuated by a well used pallet of sound. There are also exactly three expertly executed scenes worthy of recognition. The first is a scene in which a blurry eyed Sydney looks into the mirror for the first time with creepy consequences the second features a member of the undead accompanying her in an elevator and the third takes the form of an intervention between a mother who has recently lost her son. If The Eye had presented more scenes of this Claiborne it certainly could have been something special. Instead the ending descends into the mediocrity which at first seemed more then acceptable but took off into a sixth sense meets final destination action spin off which although still thrilling did not fit the tone and atmosphere of the former acts. The blurry vision that is used early on with some skill is overused by the end the flashbacks replace the more effective quick cutbacks and it simply does not hold onto its success.This is however Alba's best performance and although not saying much this shows there is hope for her future acting career. While more films like The Eye would be welcome I think it better to forfeit the Asian remakes all together then to wait for the monkey's second draft.Read all my reviews at httpwww.simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review The Eye";
	schema:reviewBody "So I haven't watched the original Eye movie by the Pang Brothers but I guess with remakes these days it doesn't really matter since most of the time the Hollywood remade version pales in comparison with the original despite having a bigger budget bigger stars and of course better visual effects. And what almost always seem woeful is the attempt to try and recreate the atmospherics for a spook fest that Asian horror had perfected and I'm inclined to suggest that they should adapt the storyline since there's a creative dearth of ideas but leave the mimicking of mood at the door.This is probably the first movie that Jessica Alba marquees and comparisons would be abound for those who've watched the original to compare her to Angelica Lee's performance. But really I don't think it matters since all you need to do is to look scared. As blind violinist Sydney Alba escapes the need to act blind given the cop out of using shades coupled with the fact that her transplanted eyes allow for the camera to be out of focus for the most parts.Things start to get interesting when she begins to see shadowy figures borrowed straight out of Pulse yet another Asian horror remake and these all get conveniently debunked by her doctor Paul Alessandro Nivola who stars as the hopeless formless Gavin Harris in the Goal movies because if you're blind for so many years your brain needs some major time out to absorb all the new sights you're constantly bombarded with. So goes as with standard horror fare that those who can see spirits when others can't are classified as nutcases. Alba's no scream queen as the proceedings don't allow her to exercise her lungs and I swear there are just too many of those waking up from nightmare moments and the clock ticking around 105am.But credit is due though to the scenes which aim to frighten and some did hit the mark even though they're the usual tools to surprise from the bag of Boo tricks. There are to me a major unexpected moment which I had to nod in acknowledgement of not seeing it coming I had thought otherwise but unfortunately that was it. The latter half of the journey became a road trip movie which seeked answers coupled with Hollywood's preoccupation of having to explain and show everything leaving little to your imagination since everything was spelt out. While the story's not at fault the way it's presented made this look like a standard mystery thriller without the mystery and without the thrills.And the finale was a little lacklustre as it seemed to be styled in Final Destination fashion making it look like it had no more rabbits to pull out of the hat. The Eye had plenty of neat visual effects and although there are some beautiful stunts involving glass shards and the walking through of objects special effects alone do not make a horror movie spinechilling. Looks like there's some major sty in this eye.".

If you are expecting a lot going into this movie it will not be good but if your just looking to see a movie and thinking its going to be good you might actually like it. Pretty much the whole entire beginning and almost all of the middle was boring and just had very sudden scenes that would get you to jump out of your seat. The rest of the movie was when it started to kick up and get good. Jessica Alba finally started to find out what she had to do and what was going on with her and people around her. Thats when the action started and it had you on the edge of your seat. For the most part it was pretty slow moving and boring but then it kicked up it was good. If the first hour of the movie was like the end it would have of been an excellent movie. So if your looking for a pretty scary movie with lots of things that pop out at you go see this. The story was actually pretty good as well. The fact that it made you wait to find out why she became blind was well done. The acting job Jessica Alba did was good as well. The visual effects for this movie were also awesome.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Eye is a supernatural horrorthriller about Sydney Wells Jessica Alba an accomplished violinist who lost her sight at the age of five. But with advanced medical technology Sydney is able to undergo a corneal transplant procedure which would restore her vision. After the surgery though the fact that Syndey can see the world around her doesn't matter to her anymore because along with it she is seeing ghostly visions and witnessing horrific events from the past and the future. It begins to seem that Sydney is taking on the traits of the donor of the eyes and she must uncover her identity to stop the visions and put the donor's spirit to rest.While I haven't seen the original Chinese version I can say this was a decent horror flick. It's a PG13 horror flick yes but it's rather sophisticated for being so. Most films in this type of league have reputations for being notsogreat a couple of examples that I can agree with would be last year's The Messengers and this year's One Missed Call both being films that completely missed the mark. But this was better than a lot of the PG13 thrillers that are out there and it is easy to see there was some solid thought and work put into it. The story while it is a remake is intriguing. The entire idea of an eye transplant is a scary thing to begin with and the supernatural element carried along with it is clever. I really thought the pacing in the film was great it evened itself out when handling the suspense and scares with the dramatic elements and was gradual up until the end.There is some really great creepy imagery as well and some neat cinematography and that's where most of this movie's strength is. There are some genuinely eerie visuals in this movie most of them unlike any I've seen before and there are some clever shocks and scares as well. I even have to admit that I jumped a couple of times and was slightly spooked so I have to applaud the direction because they did a good job with that. I also immensely enjoyed the sequences where we get to see through the lead character's eyes blurry vision and all which was a neat way to put the audience in her shoes as her life spirals out of control after the procedure. I'm really squeamish when it comes to anything involving someone's eyes too as many people are I'm sure so a few moments did get my skin crawling.I'm not going to lie this movie does have some standard clichs but manages to be at least halfway original in some aspects. The acting is decent nothing remarkable but Jessica Alba makes a likable lead here. Parker Posey is good too as her older sister although her part is pretty small. Alessandro Nivola plays the role of the doctor who initially doesn't believe anything the Alba character is saying a role we know too well but does what he can with it. Also notable is Chloe Moretz of The Amityville Horror remake playing a young cancer patient. The actionlaced ending was a little flat if you ask me and the revelation of the ghost's discontentment was wellthought out but also a little flat. I'm not going to harp on it though because I felt there was sufficient effort put into this and I for the most part enjoyed most of the movie.Overall in my eyes pun intended The Eye is a decent horror movie. It's not perfect by any means but I can say it's better than most of the PG13 horror flicks that have hit theaters in recent years. All in all it's a bit above average and worth seeing if you like this sort of thing. It serves a few good scares and some interesting ideas managing to be halfway refreshing compared to most horror films lately. I'd also like to add that this was far better than the atrocious remake of the Japanese horror movie One Missed Call which was released about a month before this. So if you were put off by that mess of a movie I'd say give this one a chance it might surprise you. It did me anyway. 710.".

	schema:reviewBody "The biggest problem with The Eye is not that it is a remake of one of the most insipid and dull Hong Kong supernatural thrillers ever made Gin Gwai but that it isn't any improvement over the original either.The consensus appears to be that this film is just boring. Boring isn't a strong enough word to describe it though. It's tedious dragged out and makes you want to stab yourself with a fork to stay awake for the 97 minutes running time just in case anything happens at all.I watched the original a few years ago and didn't really like it so I was hoping that there was going to be some new angle to this. Unfortunately apart from changing the locations the names of the characters and a few subtle plot differences it was actually worse.I can't blame the actors for this one. Jessica Alba is alright to look at and there is no doubt that she can act and look worried really well. The story here was just so thin and the dialogue was so bad that nobody could have made any more of it. Alessando Nivola however plays such an unconvincing doctor that I would actually dread to have someone like him involved in any postsurgical recovery process in real life. Shouting at your patients and telling them that they are wrong a couple of days after they've had cornea transplants is not a good bedside manner! There were a couple of moments where I thought that things would pick up. A jump scare involving an oven fell flat though and the others disintegrated into horrible messes of CGI. There was no tension no suspense just no atmosphere whatsoever. It could have been a daytime TV show about boiled eggs for all the emotional impact it had.The ending was just like a deleted scene from Final Destination. The whole movie is supposed to build up to this final act as an explanation of why Sydney Wells is seeing things in the first place but it just felt tagged on and was very rushed. It didn't really make any difference though because I'd already written this whole film off after the first ten minutes anyway.I'm not sure if anyone would like this film. It's not going to appeal to fans of the original and for older horror fans it's just like a very bad version of Eye from John Carpenter's Body Bags 1993. It's very dated and that's a terrible thing for a new film to be.".

Alessando Nivola however plays such an unconvincing doctor that I would actually dread to have someone like him involved in any postsurgical recovery process in real life. Shouting at your patients and telling them that they are wrong a couple of days after they've had cornea transplants is not a good bedside manner! There were a couple of moments where I thought that things would pick up. A jump scare involving an oven fell flat though and the others disintegrated into horrible messes of CGI. There was no tension no suspense just no atmosphere whatsoever. It could have been a daytime TV show about boiled eggs for all the emotional impact it had.The ending was just like a deleted scene from Final Destination. The whole movie is supposed to build up to this final act as an explanation of why Sydney Wells is seeing things in the first place but it just felt tagged on and was very rushed. It didn't really make any difference though because I'd already written this whole film off after the first ten minutes anyway.I'm not sure if anyone would like this film. It's not going to appeal to fans of the original and for older horror fans it's just like a very bad version of Eye from John Carpenter's Body Bags 1993. It's very dated and that's a terrible thing for a new film to be.";

	schema:reviewBody "If you're looking for a pulsepounding horror thriller you won't find that here. If you're looking for a spooky ghost story you might want to move on. If you're looking for blood  guts  body parts don't even waste a minute of your time.The Eye isn't so much a horror flick as it is a supernatural drama.This film is a remake of the 2002 Chinese The Eye which I haven't seen so I can't and probably shouldn't compare the two. I thought this was a nicely done film more of an intimate character study than a scary gotcha flick. In that respect it's similar to The Sixth Sense and not just the story. Like The Sixth Sense which was a slow moving psychological drama that just happened to have dead people in it The Eye takes a personal approach as well. And while that may bore the audience members who are expecting some screams it ultimately results in a film with a little bit more to say than your average screamer.Jessica Alba Sydney does a great job of playing a woman who has been blind since age 5 a loner someone who doesn't seem to have many connections with people and she likes it that way. The underlying theme is that her blindness makes her feel unique exempt from the real world. When she regains her sight after 15 years by a corneal transplant it's not necessarily the wonderful experience you'd expect. There's a scene when she comes back from the hospital to a surprise party and the scene is filmed with unsettling distorted closeups of strange faces. It perfectly expresses the confusion and claustrophobia of not just a blind person gaining her sight but that of an introvert being forced into society. That enough could've been enough for a feature length film how a woman deals with the gift of sight which she doesn't really want. But it doesn't end there. She starts seeing dead people too.While we never really feel like Sydney is in any deadly peril there are a few very effective surprises which I gotta admit quickened my pulse a few notches. Also the shadow men were very creepy and if you want to see a real shocker check out the bonus features where we learn that the shadow men are not cgi graphics but it's an actual dude... a sort of living skeleton who looks just as bizarre in real life than on screen.The 2nd half of the film becomes a mystery as Sydney tries to figure out why she's getting these disturbing visions and what she's supposed to do about it. Again no hair raising car chases or shootouts here just a thick atmosphere of the unknown.Like I said I haven't seen the original Chinese film but I can tell that the American filmmakers were trying to add a degree of backstory. In the bonus features they talk about the science of cellular memory the idea that donated organs possess characteristics that are imparted to the new recipient. So I can assume that this is less of a visceral shocker like the original? as it is an intellectual approach. There's also the psychology bit I mentioned above. And it also touches on the idea that artists musicians  creative thinkers are more sensitive to supernatural events Sydney is a concert violinist. In short The Eye sacrifices the raw approach of a typical actionhorror flick and instead replaces it with more of a slowmoving scientific or rational approach to the supernatural.Depending on your preference that's a good or bad thing. I can go either way depending on my mood once in a while I like to think whereas other times I just want to see Freddy slice some people to ribbons. The Eye definitely falls on the thinking side of that scale. Other thinking horror flicks I recommend are Exorcist III one of the BEST The Others with Nicole Kidman and of course The Sixth Sense.".

My opinion is that the Eye wasn't anything special just another cheesy and stupid horror movie that 14yearolds waste 10 dollars on. Just watch it on show time for free. It was just one of those horror movies that where everyone dies except for the main character.

Also this film won't be much for those without a knowledge of classic crime films of the past from the '40s to the '80s. Many parts of this movie parrot scenes from Fatal Attraction Body Double etc. It takes several viewings to catch most of the inside jokes.Armand Assante is the smooth private detective and Sherilyn Fenn is his attractive and loyal secretary. Kate Nelligan Sean Young and Christopher McDonald add to the fun. To be frank I enjoyed this more on the first viewing than I did on the second. After watching it twice I thought the film would have been better had it been cut 1015 minutes and it's only 90 minutes. However I am not knocking it it's a fun movie.".

Armand Assante is incredible as Ned Ravine super sleuth and lawyer. Sherilyn Fenn as Laura Lincolnberry Kate Nelligan is Lana Ravine and Sean Young playing Lola Cain.

	schema:reviewBody "Fatal Instinct 1993 Starring Armand Assante Kate Nelligan Sherilyn Fenn Sean Young Christopher McDonald James Remar Tony Randall Michael Cumpsty Clarance Clemons...Director Carl Reiner...Writer David O'Malley Released in 1993 this comedy spoof film is top notch in much the same lines of The Naked GunLeslie Nielson movies and or the earlier Airplane! which means there are endless sequences of visual jokes even if they are unbelievably unrealistic. Armand Assante yes a serious actor in a comic role really works although they could have easily used Leslie Nielson for the part stars as the victim of the scheming Lola Cain Sean Young who will stop at nothing to see his marriage ruined. She is a parody of the psycho bitches played by Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction and Katherine Tramell played by Sharon Stone in Basic Instinct. She hams it up as a scheming evil temptress. Like the title suggests the movie is a cross between Fatal Attraction and Basic Instinct. Those were the two most standard thrillers during the early 90's period. Both films starred Michael Douglas as the target of a scheming sexually powerful and psychotic dangerous woman. The laughs keep on coming as the obvious parodies are executed. I.E. the famous Interrogation Scene in Basic Instict the murder in the bath tub and the cooked rabbit in Fatal Attraction. Also on here are parodies of Sleeping With The Enemy starring Julia Roberts and Patrick Bergin a 1991 thriller about a husband who is obscessed with his own wife and who likes to have his own things in the house arranged his way. same element here only funnier! This movie is really great comedy and really will take you back to the 90's. The 90's is long gone and many were too little to remember everything in detail. But it was a time in which movies were full of thrillers. I wish they had made a spoof of The Hand That Rocks The Cradle on this film too. It was a time of laughing at criminals and their schocking crimes. Remember the Melendez Brothers ? Remember Lorena Bobbit ? And let's not forget the secret plotting of Tonya Harding against Nancy Carrigan. All this happened in the 90's. This was the time of the O.J. Simpson trial after all. I really recommend this movie. Many can easily dismiss it as cheap comedy but there are some genuinely comic moments such as Armand Assante and Sean Young's lovemaking scene the final part of the movie is funny too. A must have for fans of comedies of the 90's.".

Like the title suggests the movie is a cross between Fatal Attraction and Basic Instinct. Those were the two most standard thrillers during the early 90's period. Both films starred Michael Douglas as the target of a scheming sexually powerful and psychotic dangerous woman. The laughs keep on coming as the obvious parodies are executed. I.E. the famous Interrogation Scene in Basic Instict the murder in the bath tub and the cooked rabbit in Fatal Attraction. Also on here are parodies of Sleeping With The Enemy starring Julia Roberts and Patrick Bergin a 1991 thriller about a husband who is obscessed with his own wife and who likes to have his own things in the house arranged his way. same element here only funnier! This movie is really great comedy and really will take you back to the 90's. The 90's is long gone and many were too little to remember everything in detail. But it was a time in which movies were full of thrillers. I wish they had made a spoof of The Hand That Rocks The Cradle on this film too. It was a time of laughing at criminals and their schocking crimes. Remember the Melendez Brothers ? Remember Lorena Bobbit ? And let's not forget the secret plotting of Tonya Harding against Nancy Carrigan. All this happened in the 90's. This was the time of the O.J. Simpson trial after all. I really recommend this movie. Many can easily dismiss it as cheap comedy but there are some genuinely comic moments such as Armand Assante and Sean Young's lovemaking scene the final part of the movie is funny too. A must have for fans of comedies of the 90's.";

Over ten years later I have seen all these movies so I thought Hey I'll give this movie another try.I recently saw it again and still thought it was terrible. I read a review Roger Ebert gave of it and he gave the movie one and a half stars. Roger in my opinion was being too nice.Carl Reiner has directed some great movies i.e. The Jerk but this is easily his worst. The jokes in the movie ranged from mediocre to just flat out awful and predictable. One of the worst is in the courtroom scene when the bailiff calls for a ten minute recess. Sure enough the gag was that everyone went outside and played. Get it? Recess? Ha ha not! Comedy is indeed hard but this movie shows that editing your scripts is always a good idea. The kind of humor when the cast acts seriously while the gags speak for themselves worked well for movies like Airplane Naked Gun and Hot Shots but not for this movie. I can't say if it was the acting the jokes or the sheer dislike for the characters but something just wasn't clicking. I'm just curious as to how the cast members felt about this movie as they were doing it. Armand Assante in some scenes looked as if he was ready for Carl to yell CUT! any minute. He did not look comfortable doing this comedy. Sean Young looked like she was trying to have fun with it and is pretty convincing in some scenes. Above all though something went terribly wrong with this movie. If you want to rent this movie I would suggest not paying any more than one dollar for it on video.".

There are numerous laughoutloud jokes and scenes throughout the movie like when the characters suddenly begin talking in Yiddish yet there are those that desperately try to be funny but aren't such as the entire court room scene near the end. This movie is considerably funnier if you have watched the dozens of movies Fatal Instinct is spoofing. If you've not seen them however you will not be lost in the story. You'll merely sit there not realizing that you've just seen a comedy bit.As for the rest of the movie it's filmed on what appears to be a shoestring budget. But then again there's nothing in the film requiring a big budget to begin with. The cinematography feels cheap and the direction is sometimes boring but the actors particularly Assante provide great performances. The storyline is ridiculously boring and there are some spoof jokes that seem incredibly out of place and unfunny such as when Sean Young's character takes the Ravine family rabbit for a roller coaster ride a la Fatal Attraction.Good jokes in the dialogue and original if cheap side gags distract from a poor overall screenplay. This isn't the best movie in the genre but it holds it's own. This movie is probably even better than one or two of the Naked Gun films. Fans of the genre will be thoroughly entertained by it. Others might not appreciate the humor.".

Fatal Instinct isn't the best of movie takeoffs but it does have some moments that made me laugh. The funniest thing about this movie is watching Armand Assante do comedy. Here is an actor who usually does drama and when I saw him in one scene where he's dancing around in women's high heel shoes I couldn't help but laugh. Sean Young is also very funny as the blonde bombshell who's also the femme fatale of the picture. Kate Nelligan and Sherilyn Fenn don't fare quite as well as Young as Assante's evil wife and secretary respectably but it's still fun to see them here in this movie. Carl Reiner direted this goofy film as he tries to go for the type of film his onetime partner used to make Mel Brooks. Both filmmakers haven't fared as well lately like they used to. Over the years Brooks has fared better at comedy spoofs than Reiner has but Fatal Instinct is at least better than Brooks' last two movies 1993's Robin Hood Men in Tights and 1995's Dracula Dead And Loving It. However this could have been a great comedy which it ain't.12 out of four".

This is what you might call a relationship movie moved along by scenes involving lovers who may or may not be separated by deception a parent and child trying to patch up a well patchy relationship before it's too late and old friends just trying to survive in a world they've almost outlived. The cast works well together and makes you hope that everything will turn out well for all of these characters. Casper Van Dien as the writer turned repo man turns in a performance that is smooth funny sexy charming and even subtle. Johnny Rico a romantic quoting Swinburne? Tarzan writing poetry? Well yes. It works. Bobby Moritz may have a slick side but you believe that he can be redeemed by love. Back To The Future's wildeyed crazy man as a cranky but toneddown and ultimately lovable retired rock star? Well yes again. After all he's dying he's not supposed to have the nutty professor's manic energy and purpose and Christopher Lloyd shows that he has more gears than overthetop. Roger Daltrey is almost unrecognizable but still likable as a seventies leftover who has neither cut his hair nor lost his talentor stopped drinkingand Lauren Graham as the woman Bobby may or may not be destined to love forever plays sassy but vulnerable very well. The only scenes that are funny are the ones that are supposed to be everything moves right along you can actually care about the fate of the characters and the ending jam session is a blast.

	schema:reviewBody "Anyone who has rented more than two videos knows that you can't always rely on the words on the back of the box to give you an accurate description of the movie within. So this time you'll get a nice surprise. This is not a big splashy movie. There is one short funny chase but no car chases and although there are a few guns in evidence no one comes anywhere near getting shot. This is what you might call a relationship movie moved along by scenes involving lovers who may or may not be separated by deception a parent and child trying to patch up a well patchy relationship before it's too late and old friends just trying to survive in a world they've almost outlived. The cast works well together and makes you hope that everything will turn out well for all of these characters. Casper Van Dien as the writer turned repo man turns in a performance that is smooth funny sexy charming and even subtle. Johnny Rico a romantic quoting Swinburne? Tarzan writing poetry? Well yes. It works. Bobby Moritz may have a slick side but you believe that he can be redeemed by love. Back To The Future's wildeyed crazy man as a cranky but toneddown and ultimately lovable retired rock star? Well yes again. After all he's dying he's not supposed to have the nutty professor's manic energy and purpose and Christopher Lloyd shows that he has more gears than overthetop. Roger Daltrey is almost unrecognizable but still likable as a seventies leftover who has neither cut his hair nor lost his talentor stopped drinkingand Lauren Graham as the woman Bobby may or may not be destined to love forever plays sassy but vulnerable very well. The only scenes that are funny are the ones that are supposed to be everything moves right along you can actually care about the fate of the characters and the ending jam session is a blast. A charming and funny love storyjust like the box says.".

Another thing that bothered me was Jessy spending the last night of her father's life with another guy thinking about her father but that was it. She hasn't seen him in 3 years she came to L.A. to be with him yet she spends her time looking for the cat cooking for the date... That would make sense if she and her father were fighting but they're not. She loves him he loves her and yet he spends his last night with his best friend and she with a lover.

	schema:headline " The dynamics of a multiethnic Paris middle school class skillfully recreated";
	schema:reviewBody "Laurent Cantet Human Resources Time Out Heading South shot multiple improvised takes of real students and a real teacher using three cameras to make The Class Entre les murs a remarkable new film about what happens over the course of a year between a single collge junior high or middle school class in the multiethnic 20th arrondissment of Paris and their French teacher. The accomplishment has been recognized the film won the Golden Palm at the Cannes Festival this year. It is the opening night film of the New York Film Festival at Lincoln Centerits US premiere.Franois Bgaudeau who plays the teacher Franois Martin wrote the book about his own classroom experiences that Cantet based this film on and also collaborated on the script. BgaudeauMartin's pedagogic method is to stand his ground in the frequent verbal battles that happen in class. He's fast supple sometimes ironic. He is not perfect his tendency to challenge and engage while it keeps things lively can also lead to confrontation and negativity. At one point he uses a slanderous word ptasse translated in the subtitles as skank for two of the girls who have been unruly as class representatives at a meeting with teachers and a confrontation that follows with the undisciplined Soulaymane Franck Keita leads to the latter's expulsion and embarrassment for Martin when his language becomes known to his colleagues. On the other hand despite constant challenges dialogue happens even about such arcane matters as French subjunctives.The unique value of this film is that much though not all of it takes place directly in the classroom and involves real instruction and learning. So many films about schools don't have that and the efforts to convey believable classroom moments in narrative features even good ones are often feeble. Here there are all kinds of classroom discussionsabout whether the kids want to reveal themselves in selfportraits whether Martin is gay rival football teams national loyalty The Diary of Anne Frank even Plato's Republic which a rude outspoken girl Esmeralda Esmeralda Ouertani reveals she has read her sister's school copy of.In a contemporary French context one thinks of Abdel Kechiche's also prizewinning Games of Law and Chance L'Esquive which has kids from a similar French banlieu neighborhood it also focuses on how the emigrant kids encounter classic French linguistic culture as the school project is to put on A 18thcentury play. In Kechiche's film there is more variety we get intimate looks at the home lives of various characters their interactions out of class and the principals' love conflicts. Cantet focuses only on the class and more briefly on gatherings with other faculty and in the school yard never showing the kids at home or by themselves or indeed ever straying outside the school. On the other hand Cantet captures the real classroom dynamic. Of course this story is specialized too it only shows French class but the students are also taught by half a dozen other teachers whose work we do not see. Ultimately this is perhaps more about the teacher than the students important though they are.Interesting contrasts come through the multiple identities represented African Caribbean Moroccan Turkish Chineseand unspecified whites who may be a slight majority among the class' two dozen students but aren't often heard from it's the troublemakers who emerge most prominently. The Chinese boy Wei is the best student even though he is deferential about his abilities and shy about his speaking abilities. There are inklings of the fragility of French residency for new arrivals. News comes later in the year that government agents have seized Wei's mother because she was illegally in the country. At a faculty gathering a woman teacher who's just announced she is pregnant touchingly proposes a toast and makes two wishes that Wei will be okay and that her child will be as smart as he is. Rumor has it that if Soulaymane Franck Keita fails in school his father will send him back to the bled the old country which is Mali.The disciplinary actions that lead to Soulayman's expulsion bring bad vibes to Franois's classroom. But as the film jumps forward to the end of the year good feelings seem to have returned and the teacher gives out copies to the students of a booklet he's had made of all their selfportraits with photographic illustrations which is well received. A shocker comes though when at the very end after students have talked about what they've learned in school that year one girl comes up to Franois privately and tells him that in all her classes she has learned nothing and understood nothing. Franois' adeptness almost fails him when faced with this confession. Needless to say this is no feelgood To Sir With Love movie. But what's positive about it is the vibrancy of the social dynamic and the fact that communication really does happen with challenge and response ceaselessly on both sides. It's fascinating how the kids catch up the teacher and how he for the most part successfully parries their thrusts and perhaps even convinces them to some degree of the value of standard French in a mulitcultural France.Cantet has used improvisation with nonactors before notably in Human Resources which shows a factory labor struggle that divides a family. The notable thing here is how authentic and seamless the classroom action appears. Students constructed personalities close to but different from their own. Events are telescoped as in Franois Bgaudeau's book. Up to 7 or 8 takes were used to hone a segment but according to Cantet the young actors got back into the spirit of things so successfully that they could be intercut seamlessly. The result is maybe the liveliest and most naturalist reinvention on film of a contemporary public school classroom in all its volatility and variety. And since blends of documentary and narrative often represent the cutting edge today Cantet's achievement seems a very uptodate one.".

	schema:reviewBody "At the 2008 Cannes Film Festival two movies were able to give viewers a vivid glimpse of the very real social context they dealt with. One was the Italian crime drama Gomorra based on a nonfiction bestseller about the Camorra's dealings. The other which received the coveted Palme d'Or although Gomorra is a tad more riveting is Laurent Cantet's The Class the original French title translates as Between the Walls which some described as the new Dead Poets Society for obvious reasons. The comparison is legitimate but a bit weak mostly because The Class focuses less on the Greeek tragedy structure typical of schoolset dramas. Instead it gives an incredibly accurate idea of what really goes on in an average school class.Cantet's film is based on the eponymous book by Franois Bgaudeau a former teacher who decided to inaugurate his writing career with a memoir of sorts recounting his experiences in a middle school in a Parisian suburb. Not surprisingly when word of a cinematic adaptation came out Bgaudeau wanted to be involved contributing to the screenplay and taking on the lead role virtually playing himself.Well not really there's a degree of fiction in his character at least in the fact that his last name is Marin. Everything else is spoton though he gets along with his colleagues has an intelligent teaching plan and is generally considered a good French teacher. Still that doesn't mean there aren't problems in the class especially when most of the 13year old kids in there are foreign Moroccan Chinese etc.. Situations range from a new student struggling to fit in to troublemakers refusing to pay attention and it looks like some of them might not make it to the end of the academic year.The magic of The Class is of course that it doesn't feel like a movie but like something real tangible  a slice of life if you may. This is because Cantet prepared the film by selecting thousands of real students for the various parts and then going through a yearlong improvisation exercise with those who made it to the final cut. In this case though improvised doesn't equal loads of swearing like in Judd Apatow's body of work even if some of the lingo used by the kids is on the stronger side but things people say and think when they're going through that delicate period of their life. There isn't really a point in talking about performances save for the adults who are nonetheless teachers in real life. These people particularly the young ones aren't acting they're living. And that is a beautiful thing to behold.It is said that movies and life do occasionally merge. Few examples are closer to the truth than The Class it's not a biopic it's not a documentary. It's a lesson.".

	schema:headline " A beguiling stimulating feature film on education resembling a documentary";
	schema:reviewBody "It is not often that you come across a movie that has as its lead actor the very writer of the novel on which the film is based. Laurent Cantet's intriguing film The Class has in its lead role of the class teacher the novelist and coscreenplaywriter Francois Begaudeau. That's only the first surprise the film pulls on the viewer.If you went to into the film theater without knowing much about the film you are likely to think you are watching a documentary. That's the second surpriseit is not a documentary.The film is apparently a semiautobiographical story of the novelist and lead actor Begaudeau. Begaudeau himself was primarily a school teacher before he morphed his own life into a novelist journalist and an actor. But wait a moment. Even director Cantet's parents were teachers. Therefore it is not surprising that the intimate knowledge of the teaching and the filmmaking processes get married seamlessly within the film and this contributed substantially to the film being honored as the first French film to win the Golden Palm at Cannes in 21 years!Cantet allows the viewer to study the process of educating a fresh class of bubbly and streetsmart adolescent kids in a Paris suburban school. Classroom education today in many parts of the world has evolved from the dictatorial British format where the learned teacher lectures and the student imbibes what he sees and hears. Today teaching in progressive schools is more democratic where the teacher allows student participation where the student is encouraged to talk and become an integral part of the education process contributing knowingly or unknowingly and democratically to the education of other students in the class just as much as the teacher. It is not without intent that one of the bright Internetsavvy kids in the film brings up the subject of Plato's Republic into discussion but then the intelligent viewer is forced to recall that teaching for Aristotle's own students centuries ago was democratic and peripatetic. Begaudeau the teacher is flummoxed and that's precisely what Cantet the director of the film stresses to the viewerthe very quality and process of imparting knowledge today is dissected. Plato wanted a philosopher king to provide for the common good. He also believed democracy would just lead to mob rule which is basically an oligarchy. Cantet appears to ask the viewer if the teacher is the Platonic philosopher king. Aristotle studied under Plato and disagreed with Plato on almost fundamentally everything. Cantet's film introduces parallels of bright adolescent kids being educated in the classroom as Aristotle would have been in Plato's class. Begaudeau teaches his students often like Plato would while adopting the peripatetic approach of Aristotle's own teaching style though confined within the four walls of the class.The film is demanding of the viewer. The film is definitely not everyone's cup of tea.To a casual film goer the movie would resemble a live recording of a highschool class of boys and girls with a teacher probing the minds of his students made up of different backgrounds races religions and representing various continents. There are tense moments hilarious repartees behind the scene meetings of teachers evaluating students parent teacher meetings and even stocktaking of a year gone by in the school. The film's content can disappoint some viewers looking for conventional action sex or heavy intrigue. Cantet's approach to cinema is far removed from the typical Hollywood film. Yet Cantet and the screenplay writing team that included Begaudeau urge the viewer to zoomout hisher mind from the microscopic events taking place within the confines of the four walls of classthe ethnic tensions the psychological warfare and the social criticismas they are equally likely to take place in the wider world outside the class beyond the school even beyond France. That is the beguiling aspect of Cantet's film.The innovation apart what is extraordinary in this film? One the film clearly indicates the classroom has evolved from the classroom of To Sir with Love or Dead Poet's Society. Today teaching adolescents is no longer a simple task. Students are wellaware of current social and political issues thanks to the Internet and related technology. Teachers need to be aware of several bits of information and trivia to be on top of their class. Second The Class progresses to reveal manipulative student behavior towards their teachers that British cinema revealed decades earlier to us. British films such as Absolution 1978 with Richard Burton and Term of Trial 1962 with Laurence Olivier are vivid examples. Unlike the two entertaining British movies all the action in Cantet's The Class is restricted to two school roomsthe actual classroom and another room where teachers interact among themselves or with parents. Third the film grapples with the question of the broader issues of equality within a classroom a school and elsewhere in society. Fourth the film is about current issues of integration of different cultures that perhaps confront Europe Canada and Australia more than it does in the USA. Africans and Asians are now citizens of France but do they get understood by the majority? A student Suleyman says in the film I have nothing to say about me because no one knows me but me. How many teachers allow for twoway communication in a class? The film presents a growing challenge for educators of today. Can we go back to the days of Aristotle or do we prefer to learn under the teacher who dictates? Are we providing the turf for democracy or for dictatorships to emerge in society from the lowly classroom? This is a sensitive film meant for filmgoers expecting more than frothy entertainment. The two final shots somewhat similar of the film graphically and silently capture the entire case of the film that preceded those shots. That was truly remarkable.".

	schema:reviewBody "Whether you respond positively or negatively to The Class it's hard to argue that it is authentic to a very great degree. This isn't some Hollywood pablum starring Sam Jackson or Hilary Swank or even Dangerous Minds. This is taken and starring from the horse's mouth a teacher who taught in the more multiethnic areas of Paris and via Cantet's direction and it involved me like few films about the educational system ever have. No little drama involving the students or rather crucial for that matter lack any significance for the audience because from the moment we enter the classroom with Mr. Marin the camera keeps an eye on the details. Nothing is left out that might make anyone teacher or the variety of student look less than human. No one comes out at the end of The Class looking like they've reached the top of the world and no one's a real hero or villain. At worst and it's a sad but very true little moment one kid says simply to Mr. Marin at the end of the last class that nothing was really retained from the past nine months.After seeing The Class it brought back so many memories of school like the 400 Blows the Class reminds us how absolutely rotten it is to be a 13 to 15 year old schoolkid but unlike Truffaut's film this is about an institution and its functions right in the heart of the matter. The teacher in The Class real life teacher Franois Bgaudeau casts such a convincing portrait because he doesn't have to really act or try to pretend he's a great teacher. He just is. He cares about all of his students deeply but he's also firm when he needs to and knows for the most part how to reach them without going too far or coddling. It's a fine line he needs to walk since the class made up of an ethnic melting pot as the saying goes is smart and intelligent and at its best we see this class participating and really in the grip of stirring conversation even when it's about something that Mr. Marin has to handle with tact like when a student asks bluntly if he's homosexual or when he has to deal with a young black girl who is slagging in participating in class.It's the kind of naturalistic filmmaking that works because it's a synergy of the personal of what is very well known and felt and learned about this world and how to observe it. Some might say it's a talking heads movie with a pretty basic style but the direction is wise by never getting in the way. Seeing these kids faces and seeing the dynamic of conversations go on behind the closed doors of the faculty some of these conversations sometimes heated or just intense are amazing not because of conventional dramatic power of onesideversusanother but because of the thought put into these people how tough decisions have to be made under certain circumstances.It's strongest as a character piece but also as a minor revelation into the bittersweet lot of teaching in an area like the 34 in Paris. There's a student who is troublesome doesn't do work is disruptive but Marin wants to try and reach him. Another complication occurs due to a blowup against a couple of chatty girls who were the class reps at a faculty meeting and it sets a small chain of events that emphasizes chiefly how untenable the situation is and at the same time why it shouldn't be. This most major chunk of the film about the student's possible expulsion is one thing that makes The Class become even more absorbing than before but it should be pointed out that from scene to scene nothing is left to chance. The cinema verite approach makes things move emotionally but unsentimentally nothing is left for us to see these characters as what they are which makes it so rewarding and heartbreaking when things happen as they do in movies. At one point something seemingly minor is revealed a Chinese student learning French little by little may lose her mother to deportation. Not minor it's all apart of another school day. A".

	schema:headline " Slice of Life in a French Classroom";
	schema:reviewBody "I watched another French film in a row after Il y a Longtemps que Je T'aime. Entre Le Murs known in English as the Class is the French bet for the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar and also the first French film to win the Palm D'Or of the Cannes Film Festival in 20 years. It is simply begging to be seen so I did despite knowing nothing about its subject matter.The Class turns out to be a documentarylike movie about the tense interaction between teacher and students in a French multiracial high school. In particular the film follows French grammar teacher Francois Marin who would like to think of himself as a progressive teacher who employs the interactive and selfdiscovery classroom technique rather than by traditional lecture style.However most of his students are disturbingly belligerent frank and disrespectful. The main conflict is with a particularly insolent Mali boy named Souleymane who has violent outbursts in class. But there are other students too from Tunisia Morocco China the Caribbean etc.. all of whom with their own personality and issues which the teacher has to deal with.Everything in this film is very realistic indeed. It becomes even more personal after knowing that the lead actor who played Mr. Marin is Francois Begaudeau who actually wrote the semiautobiographical book about his experiences as a teacher as well as adapted his own book for this film's screenplay. This is another instance when I am sure a lot of the richness of the language interplay will be lost in the subtitled translations.A lot of people will find this film boring because of the two hour length the single setting within the school and no additional personal side stories about the teachers and students. But with my recent foray into the theory of Education in Graduate School this film is quite an eyeopener about how different the school situation is these days. Definitely this film has no Hollywood story arc and uplifting ending. It just tells the situation as it is. And that is precisely where its strength is.".

	onyx:emotionText "I watched another French film in a row after Il y a Longtemps que Je T'aime. Entre Le Murs known in English as the Class is the French bet for the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar and also the first French film to win the Palm D'Or of the Cannes Film Festival in 20 years. It is simply begging to be seen so I did despite knowing nothing about its subject matter.The Class turns out to be a documentarylike movie about the tense interaction between teacher and students in a French multiracial high school. In particular the film follows French grammar teacher Francois Marin who would like to think of himself as a progressive teacher who employs the interactive and selfdiscovery classroom technique rather than by traditional lecture style.However most of his students are disturbingly belligerent frank and disrespectful. The main conflict is with a particularly insolent Mali boy named Souleymane who has violent outbursts in class. But there are other students too from Tunisia Morocco China the Caribbean etc.. all of whom with their own personality and issues which the teacher has to deal with.Everything in this film is very realistic indeed. It becomes even more personal after knowing that the lead actor who played Mr. Marin is Francois Begaudeau who actually wrote the semiautobiographical book about his experiences as a teacher as well as adapted his own book for this film's screenplay. This is another instance when I am sure a lot of the richness of the language interplay will be lost in the subtitled translations.A lot of people will find this film boring because of the two hour length the single setting within the school and no additional personal side stories about the teachers and students. But with my recent foray into the theory of Education in Graduate School this film is quite an eyeopener about how different the school situation is these days. Definitely this film has no Hollywood story arc and uplifting ending. It just tells the situation as it is. And that is precisely where its strength is.";

	schema:reviewBody "It's my time of year to take in the best foreign language movies of the last twelve months and Entre Les Murs renamed rather than translated as The Class is one of the best. The movie is based on Franois Bgaudeau's memoir of a year teaching in a Parisian secondary school. The school is in an immigrant area and the students are a mixed bunch of both genders spanning most of the globe's ethnicities and all of the globe's enthusiasms for learning ie some want to and some don't. Monsieur Bgaudeau's task  as teacher Mr Marin is to try and translate French classical language education into something that seems relevant to 21st century disaffected youth. It's an interesting movie fictional yet based on facts mostly improvised by the young cast and shot like a flyonthewall documentary using mobile highdefinition cameras yet staged. How to present Voltaire and The Enlightenment to streetwise fourteen year olds whose parents are threatened with expulsion from the country or whose personal failure may result in repatriation by the parents who are supposed to be on their side? How to talk to parents whose cultural and language divide is an abyss between them and the teacher and how to do it all in a spirit of equality respect and intellectual rigour? It must ring a bell with teachers the world over  they signed up to teach the subject they love and find themselves working instead as psychologistscounselorssocial workersdisciplinarians and quasi probation officers to just try and keep everyone under control. It's not that the students are wicked or evil just undisciplined and rude and  one suspects  generally abused by a careless world in which kids are two a penny amongst 6 billion plus people. The film follows a long and respected tradition of movies about the gifted teacher bringing out the best in a mixed bag of kids but is more real immediate and less schmaltzy than most of the genre.I'm not a teacher  couldn't do it if you paid me a million  per year  so I'm not about to indulge in smart alec remarks about Mr Marin's methods but I did feel that his attempts to be fair with his students and to treat them as equals might have been a bit misplaced and that some heavy handedness and distance might have been better if he actually wanted to implant facts. Funnily enough I am writing this review after reading an article online about how 'self esteem' education in the UK is leading to a generation of narcissistic children who are becoming unteachable and whose parents refuse to accept that their children are anything less than perfect. Narcissism doesn't seem to be the problem for most of Mr Marin's class. They possess more a brittle and occasionally touching defensiveness and an inability to grasp why a classical education has any relevance to their lives. And who can blame them? But I came away from this movie with a feeling which I have often felt before  here where I live in the USA and have put two children through the public education system  that we are producing whole generations of overconfident underachievers.The young cast of The Class are fabulous. Apparently all pulled from similar circumstances to those they portray the script was largely 'workshopped' prior to shooting. The knowledge that there are youngsters out there who can be taken from real life to achieve performances of this caliber cheers me up immensely and makes me think there is hope for the world. Gripping movieGo see.".

Why do we insist on teaching formats that are miserable for both teacher and student? Why do so many parents blame the school and so few take an active supportive role? This is the story of Francois Begaudeau who also wrote the book upon which director Laurent Cantet's film is based.Begaudeau is a junior high teacher in a working class multiethnic Paris school where the teachers have resigned themselves to the fact that most of the students just don't care to learn. We get an incredible amount of classroom time showing how the melting pot of cultures has so much to offer yet seems impossible to tap into.Also fascinating are the teacher meetings and discussions that occur away from the students. We see no joy in these teachers and most seem just beaten down. The film offers no solutions it strictly acts as a peek inside the institution.While we are left to our own accord to pick sides or dream of alternatives I continue to ask the same why questions over and over.".

After 128 minutes the passage of which I wasn't even conscious being so absorbed in the film I emerged with a one word answer different. A neutral word neither better or worse just different.The Class is very much like a documentary can even be seen as one being based on a novel that is in essence an autobiography of French referring to both his nationality and the subject he teaches junior high school 13 14year olds teacher Francois Begaudeau. What the audience is intimated to is one academic year in his life at a school in a working class neighbourhood in suburban Paris. While it does not seem to be as rough as Harlem it is more ethnically diversified  Caucasian African Asian Arab and more. To most of these students who have no problem conversing in daily colloquial French the elegant French grammar he teaches is as alien as something from outer space.The first thing I noticed about this film is the very long scenes in the class room to such an extent that you begin feel that you become part of the class. One might have thought that one would get bored but quite on the contrary you are so absorbed in it that you hardly notice the passage of time. There are about halfdozen students that you get to know very soon plus halfdozen more you begin to recognize. It soon becomes fascinating as you just like Francois are trying to understand each of these very different young men and women. They can be variously cheeky introvert rude subtle nave pitiable funny.. It is mesmerizing to see how Francois handles each different challenge not without his own emotions but always rational objective and lovably stubborn.While the teacherstudent interaction is the soul of this film it offers more  interaction among teachers particularly in a disciplinary meeting considering an expulsion as well as between teacher and parent. There are delinquent students opinionated teachers equally opinionated parents but there are no real villains in the dramatic sense. Characters are presented to the audience from real life with all their shortcomings and good qualities. To be able to bring real life to the screen in such an engaging way makes its Palme D'or award well deserved.".

Set in a tough Parisian neighborhood The Class winner of the Palme d'Or at Cannes and nominated for an Oscar for Best Foreign Film explores the frustrations felt by both teacher and student when the standard classical curriculum appears to be irrelevant to children from workingclass immigrant families.Though Francois tries to employ innovative techniques such as having the children ages 14 and 15 write a selfportrait most of his time is spent in discipline.

The students are bright but rebellious and their give and take in the classroom belies the fact that they know they are up against a system that has not been set up in their favor.Souleymane brings the class to a halt when he asks the teacher about the rumor that he likes men which the teacher denies but learning is difficult in a situation where the students show little respect.

Accompanied by his mother who speaks little French Souleymane becomes the central focus of the film when it is debated whether or not he should be expelled from the school.Another disturbing incident occurs in the teachers lounge when one of the teachers expresses his bitterness and despair about trying to teach students he refers to as animals. Cantet spent many months attending Begaudeau's class and cast real students recruited from a neighboring junior high in the role of their counterparts. The Class is a brave film in which there are no heroes or villains and no Mr. Holland's Opus to send the viewer off feeling uplifted. While the acting has some rough patches the dialog which is largely nonscripted always feels authentic. The only lesson to be learned is that there are no easy solutions and Cantet does not offer any other than to suggest that inspiration like happiness may lie only in moments.".

The documentary style feel to the film aided not only the intimacy of looking into the classroom but also into the lives of the students and teachers. It was refreshing to see the human side of a teacher portrayedone that is fallible not always saying the right thing despite trying to do the right thing...which is often what all people struggle with.

The documentary style feel to the film aided not only the intimacy of looking into the classroom but also into the lives of the students and teachers. It was refreshing to see the human side of a teacher portrayedone that is fallible not always saying the right thing despite trying to do the right thing...which is often what all people struggle with.

	schema:headline " Interesting as a story of one teacher's experiences";
	schema:reviewBody "You might question if sitting in on a a racially mixed class of junior high school students ages 1315 from a working class neighborhood in Paris is something you would want to do. I have to admit that this did not sound all that exciting but this movie held my interest more than I expected. The original French title Entre les Murs between the walls is more appropriate than The Class since 99 of the story takes place inside the a single school and most of it within the confines of a classroom where French teacher Franois Marin Franois Bgaudeau holds forth. Marin has his work cut out for him since his class is an amalgamation of a wide spectrum of temperaments ethnicities and abilities. The class is so diverse that I wondered if it is at all representative or whether the students chosen for the film were not picked to accomplish the diversity effect. It surely makes for a lively classroom experience but a reservation I have is that it tempts us to make general judgments about the status of the French educational system when in fact it is the story of one teacher one class in one school.Marin's teaching style is designed to actively engage the students in their schoolwork as well as in conversations about themselves. His main assignment for the year was to get the kids to write about themselves not so much autobiographies but what they liked and didn't like what they felt they were good at and what not so good what they liked about themselves and what they were embarrassed by and so forth. Marin seemed to have a sincere desire to know his students personally and that is the hook that kept my interest since I came to want to know more about these students too. But Marin's relaxed style comes with problems since it allows his students to be more assertive than is desired and results in frequent loss of focus on the task at hand. For example one of the students asks Marin in class if the rumor is true that he likes men. Marin handles most such questions with finesse but he is not above getting involved in some heated debates and saying things to his students that a teacher should not say. Given the diversity in the student's abilities it is hard for Marin to know what level of difficulty to choose but his getting into the minutiae of grammar like the distinction between the imperfect subjunctive and the imperfect indicative seemed quite out of place in a class where many of the students could hardly read French and had a minimal vocabulary. However in spite of Marin's failings his class was so fractious that I came to view him with some respect for his persistence in trying to teach these kids anything. Near the end of the film Marin asked each student to tell about something he or she had learned in any of their classes and the response was less than inspiring. One girl said that she had learned nothing even though Marin was able to draw her out one boy fumbled around with trying to state the Pythagorian Theorem and another struggled with a fact from chemistry and so forth. I came away feeling that not much was learned in the way of formal education but the fact that Marin and is colleagues were able to shepherd these students through a schoolyear where much was discussed arguments had decisions made both bad and good by both students and teachers and students from different backgrounds bounced off each other was maybe the most significant learning achievement. These mostly underprivileged kids had to sense that Marin was trying to do his best for them. After the final class had been dismissed and Marin was getting ready to leave the last girl to leave came up to him and said that she felt that she had learned nothing in any of her subjects. Marin tried to convince her otherwise but was not very successful. I found this closing note to be quite sad but then I thought that at least this girl thought enough of Marin to approach him with her confession.If education is the foundation of a civilized society then I wonder what role these students will play in such a society. Lest one think that the class dealt with in The Class is a recent phenomenon see the 1955 movie Blackboard Jungle.Watching the making of extra on the DVD is well worth it. In many ways the actual kids are more winning as people away from the movie set than they are in the film. Seeing the whole class honored at the Cannes Film Festival was moving and I am sure was an experience these kids will always treasure.".

	schema:headline " The Class a Class Act";
	schema:reviewBody "We've all seen movies where a a charismatic teacher turns around an underperforming class which comes to adore him. Think To Sir With Love Dead Poets Society and so on.There's no magical Hollywood ending in The Class it's gritty real movie about one teacher and his French class in a middle school in a poor Parisian neighborhood. Many kids are from immigrant families from places like Morocco Mali and China. We follow the teacher and class through one academic year.The teacher Mr. Marin has been at the school for 3 or 4 years. He's had some of the kids in previous years but he doesn't quite understand the kids for all his obvious good intentions. Nor do the kids understand him nor are they willing to give him the benefit of the doubt.On the first day a history teacher asks Mr. Marin if maybe they could coordinate the history his class will be covering with the literature selection that the French class will do. Mr Marin shoots down one suggested book after another as too hard for the class including Voltaire's Candide. And Candide is one of the most accessible French novels around. This sure seems like an unconscious judgment that the kids are not capable of this.Right off there's a culture clash between the teacher and the kids. He writes a sentence on the blackboard to demonstrate a vocabulary word using the name Bill and one girl challenges him asking why he always uses honky names in his examples. He asks them what names they would like to see him use and the class deliberates this. They eventually come up with a name they like better.We see him attacked by the kids as he explains the imperfect subjunctive If I were you... It's used more in French than English but still not exactly an essential in the French language either. But still to write well and get a decent office job it's one of those things that matters. But the kids complain that they've never heard anyone use the subjunctive in their lives. So Mr. Marin has to make the case that there is ordinary spoken French of the neighborhood but also the spoken and written language of the majority French culture. And you have to be able to navigate among the various French languages. Absolutely true and yet not something that seems very real to these kids.We get to know some of the individuals in the class better. Wei is a Chinese boy older than the rest. Selfdeprecating about his poor French which didn't sound that bad to me...but maybe it was just his modesty. Wei works hard and is respectful to the teacher. Suleymane is from Mali. He doesn't come prepared to class most of the time. He's generally withdrawn  angry. When kids do selfportrait projects Suleymane wants to do one mainly with photos from a digital camera. He's better at visual images than with words. Mr. Marin helps him a bit with this and posts the finished project on the bulletin board. Suleymane is flabbergasted that the teacher wants to display his project because he thinks the teacher really doesn't like him. He doesn't get that for whatever strictness Mr Marin has and whatever punishments he might mete out he's really on Suleymane's side. Esmeralda and Khoumba are two girls good friends who are smart selfassured and are in a running tug of war with Mr. Marin over respect. He thinks that they are insubordinate and disrespectful. And they think he is disrespectful of them.Things get ugly when after class he demands an apology from Khoumba for what he sees as her disrespect. And things turn even uglier when he calls Esmeralda and another girl ptasses a word that can mean stupid tarts or skankssluts. He means the first meaning which is mildly pejorative but of course Esmeralda thinks that he is dissing her in a big way with the second meaning. Events spiral out of control when Suleymane comes to the girls defense and in a verbal match with Mr. Marin he gets so angry that he leaves the class without permission accidentally hitting Khoumba with a piece of metal on his way out. This chain of circumstances paves the way to an expulsion hearing for Suleymane.What works so well in this film is that nobody's the hero and nobody's the villain. Just human beings struggling in an imperfect educational system. Across a cultural divide. A BIG cultural divide. Franois Bgaudeau who wrote the book the film is based on and the screenplay and is himself a teacher more or less plays himself. He gives a wonderful performance willing to show himself warts and all. And he shows the rough and tumble way a teacher has to keep control of a confrontational class. Especially if he is not going to just be the strict disciplinarian but try to connect with his students.The kids are not young professional actors but real kids from similar backgrounds who auditioned for the parts and then were given acting lessons. Some of the content was improvised by the kids and Bgaudeau. This looks and feels like a documentary but it's really a work of fiction bringing into sharp focus how the French educational system serves or doesn't serve kids like these. Laurent Cantet is a director looking for an honest portrayal of classroom dynamics. He works hard to get portrayal where things don't always work but there's no simple way to pin blame. The subtle dynamics of people within an institution.I found myself mesmerized. I don't know if everyone will be so interested in a classroom movie. But if you think you might be don't miss this powerful film.This won the Palme D'or at Cannes in 2008 with a unanimous jury.".

The black students in the film are all from countries that were colonized by the French which adds to their antagonism toward the teacher and their feeling that he is antagonistic toward them...To be frank though it's the directors style and the improvisational nature of the script that you will either love for the realism it creates or hate for the natural complexity it creates.".

	schema:reviewBody "I recently saw this at the 2009 Palm Springs International Film Festival. this film is based on the semiautobiographical novel by Francois Begaudeau who wrote the book and the screenplay and stars in the title role of a French teacher in a Parisian school filled with inner city at risk youth comprised of French and immigrant children to France. The teachers at the school keep tabs on the unruliest of the students and dismiss them as troublemakers and unable to learn in a classroom environment. Begaudeau takes a good guytough guy approach and tries to be one of the kids as their mentorfriend but his plans don't always work the way he envisions and sometimes backfire. This is shot in a documentarystyle with rapid fire dialog from the students and teacher and tight close shots of the actors. It's a small film done on a low budget from director Laurent Cantet and is too long of a film as your interest wanes after about 30 minutes. despite being too long it fails to fully explore and develop some potentially interesting characters and basically comes from nowhere and goes nowhere. It was a packed theater with every seat filled at my screening and I looked forward to seeing this but came away disappointed. I would rate this a 5.5 out of 10 and could not recommend it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Some excellent films have won the prestigious Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival over the years Apocalypse Now Pulp Fiction Gate of Hell MASH Taxi Driver and many others. Entre Les Murs The Class doesn't seem worthy of such an honor. It is boring amateurish and comes off as dull.Entre Les Murs 2008 is a drama directed by Laurent Cantet and stars Francois Bgaudeu as a French teacher at an intercity school for troubled children in Paris. All the students have a distinct cultural background including African and Chinese. Conflict arises between the teacher and students as the plot unfolds.Monsieur Marin Francois Bgaudeu a French teacher tries to teach a multicultural group of juvenile delinquents. He constantly seems like he's on the verge of slapping every one of them. Some students in particular that give him a hard time are Esmeralda a girl who acts incredibly disrespectful towards her superiors and Soulymane an African boy who gets in trouble and is on the brink of being sent back to Africa. The film details the 9 month school year from beginning to end. Sounds exciting doesn't it? Entre Les Murs is interesting in the fact that most of it feels very real but that's only because it is. The film's star Francois Bgaudeu wrote a novel of the same name detailing his experience as a teacher at a school for young hoodlums. In this regard his acting seems very natural and fitting for the part. I like some of the scenes between him and the students because it does feel like the way many students argue with their teachers. It was an interesting idea but it was poorly executed.Entre Les Murs had an interesting concept that just doesn't make good cinema. It really did not need to be a narrative film. They could have taken the same idea and made it a documentary or something. I have nothing against foreign films. I have seen other French films along with some Italian and Japanese films.The French can make some great films they practically invented modern filmmaking with Les Frres Lumires and the Georges Melies short films made over a century ago but this time it feels like they are trying to simulate the average school day. Although some of the acting was decent and it probably had good intentions at the end of the day it's just a bland uninspired mess. It looks like the film was shot with a cheap camcorder it lacks any nondiegetic sound and it's just not very good. I would recommend the film if you are an insomniac and your Ambien isn't working. I give it 3.510.".

He was the winner of Britain's Got Talent a few years ago. He is a great dancer and his character is the only interesting one in the whole film. If you want a good dance film then skip it.

	schema:headline " Excellent display of a fusion of dances with a highly contagious feelgood atmosphere";
	schema:reviewBody "For people who did not manage to catch Street Dance 3D 2010 it should come as good news that this sequel has no relation with its predecessor other than two returning acts Flawless and George Sampson. Street Dance 2 uses the dance scene in Europe as its backdrop introducing a number of dances and adopting pretty much the same pattern as Street Dance 3D. However compared to the original this movie has a greater focus which is to showcase the fusion of street dance with a popular Latin dance form salsa.The storyline albeit cheesy has a lot more punch and is more focused centred as it is around a distraught Ash Falk Hentshel who after failing terribly at a dance battle is scouted by Eddie George Sampson. The duo subsequently comb all over Europe for the best dancers to form their dance crew with the aim of beating the 'Invincibles'. They chanced upon a salsa dancer Eva Sofia Boutella who eventually became crucial to their success. In between there is some drama here and there including the obligatory love story. However those looking for some sparks will likely be disappointed as the romance is as clichd as it gets. Nonetheless as mentioned earlier the movie does have the charms a dance movie ought to have which are essentially supported by the dance sequences and the music. For instance the difficulty of combining salsa and street dance was brought out through how Ash acquired the steps by taking lessons from Eva. A street dancer who is trained to express himself as freely as he could now needs to be disciplined and take into consideration of a partner to display elegance and passion. All these are complimented with a good mix of contemporary groovy dance mixes that engages the audience into the performance.Also towatchoutfor is Sofia Boutella who makes her feature film debut here. The French hiphop dancer takes on a whole new different dance form yet shows no sign of being an amateur and comes off as a complete natural certainly one of the highlights of the film. As you would probably expect Ash will end up being the hero who overcomes and emerges from his past failure to prove his worth. The grand finale is undoubtedly the climax of the whole visual experience. The dance routines were electrifying a definite treat for all. The joy from the triumph was also very genuine and contagious.Still what remains as a really shortcoming for dance movies is its limited appeal for the uninitiated perhaps a more solidpacked storyline and drama would enable it to broaden its appeal. www.moviexclusive.com".

It's all about the passion of the street dance and the street dancers. It's also about the Latin American dances like Salsa Tango.As the main lead pair Sofia and Hentschel are hot and the Director has used the canvass of beautiful city of Paris and specially Eiffel Tower to catch in camera the development of the hero as only an acrobatic stree dancerselling pop corn getting humiliated by Vince the invincible to a sensitive and perfect dancer with his heart in his dance.Sofia is the main attraction with her seductivepassionate and perfect body language enormous energy and yet an alluring femininity about her persona. She overshadows Hentscel in emotional scenes and dialog delivery. Hentscel's only plus point is his welltoned body and amicability. But otherwise he seems to be a total miscast  with his impassive attitude and a noticeable effort of acting. With some one more aggressive and powerful the movie could have been even more effective.Tom Conti as Sofia's uncle is adorable. But it is George Simpson who really looks naughty and fresh. all other supporting team members are fit for their roles and skills.Editing and cinematography is good. i liked the soundtrack with a fair mix of sentimental and hip hop. This movie is a real Niagara and you have to just be a part of the whole processto enjoy it fully !And don't ask how did they manage to travel practically all over the world to assemble their crew when they are just some lower middle class boys without any substantial income ? The director shows only once the duo travelling with goats but otherwise it's the air travel all the way ! In his overambitious handling the script writer probably forgot this practical point".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review StreetDance 2";
	schema:reviewBody "Assemble a crew with dance abilities and you can have a dance film. Step Up showed how street dancing can be viable for the big screen and the European's Street Dance movie continues into its second edition this time becoming a little bit geographically encompassing with the narrative traversing almost all of Europe during the opening credits to recruit a series of dancers for yet another moviestory. It can't get any more blatant than that but like any genre film the kick is in the strength of its unique value proposition and with so many moves that can be amalgamated and combined there is a possibility for infinite sequels.The flimsy story if there's ever a need for one for films like this follows the disastrous efforts of an American boy Ash Falk Hentschel a popcorn seller who fell on his bum when challenging the top crew team known as the Invincibles during a competitive dance off. Eddie Geprge Sampson a returning character from the earlier film sees Ash's talent and convinces him to head a crew that they will assemble to take on The Invincibles again during an upcoming European dance competition in 8 weeks time. They get a crew easily due to Eddie's contacts with an eye for keeping it multiethnic multireligious and multicultural. So a rag tag crew assembles and to add some flavour and sensuousness to the group Ash and Eddie recruits Eva Sofia Boutella a Latin dancer to help them all learn how to sizzle on the floor.Is this film unrealistic? For the most parts yes but it's something of a quibble that will plague any genre film that adheres strictly to an established working formula. Unless someone in the crew has a trust fund to tap from everyone seems to be surviving on dance and eating air. But that's the least of our concerns where they get their sustenance from as all we need to see is to see them dance and all real world troubles will be instantly forgotten. And we really don't care about their backgrounds and such  efforts to add depth to characters all fall flat  except to see them work together to execute slick choreographed moves against beat bobbing music that will leave the nondancers amongst us astonished at how dance helps to contribute to toned bodies and rock solid abs.As a film directors Max Giwa and Dania Pasquini's efforts showed a little bit more maturity than their earlier Streetdance film especially since it now got the knack of 3D. The first film went straight for the format and found itself rooting the camera to the ground for the most parts and like the worst of dancers being extremely rigid in its capture of every dancer's movement or moving the camera in bullet time format while freeze framing the dance action. Most of the time it was set square to the action so that everyone and everything has a chance at flying toward the screen. There's no need for that now although there were subconscious efforts to try and maximize value for those who paid top dollar for 3D but otherwise it can be done without and the camera now breathes a lot more moving around with bold angles to do justice to efforts by the dance choreographers in coming up with innovative creative moves.What got worked into the story was of course its much touted fusion of Latin Dance and Street Dance with the usual storyline going where practitioners of either just cannot fathom how they can work together because of differences in philosophies and practices but soon find it within themselves to respect the other form and to blend styles and attitudes together to come up with something unique and new that opponents have no answer to. But that is only if opponents were actually given an equal amount of time to showcase what they can do. With the story so focused on Ash Eva and their crew little time gets devoted to the other teams even during the expected big bang finale that the story just had to find a technical loophole for the final dance battle to occur. Which works when the runtime had to be strictly kept to under 90 minutes.If I may file another complaint on the story it would be how the formula had to be followed to a T with the expected rift caused between the leader and his troops coming from what was thought and mentioned as a sense of quitting and letting everyone down when I felt that if they had pounced on the opportunity of not letting the enemy gain some intel on one's secret weapon and moves it perhaps could have been a little better and narratively less jarring with characters keeping to their motives and objectives rather than to let formula dictate how events have to strictly unfold. Especially since it involves an exchange of bodily fluids the scene before.But as a genre fan that wait for the finale was worth it although my favourite dance routine has got to be that DrukenMasterKungFu inspired moves that must be seen to be believed!".

	schema:reviewBody "The first film was a brilliant British dance movie that celebrated the talent the country can offer especially from those performers made famous in Britain's Got Talent and I was certainly intrigued to see if a sequel could be just as much fun and entertaining. Basically street dancers Ash Falk Hentschel and his friend and manager Eddie George Sampson have recently been defeated in a big street dance battle by one of their big rivals and they want to make up for this and win the trophy at the big European street dance competition in Paris France. It is after they gather some of the best skilled street dancers from around Europe that Ash and Eddie managing to get everyone they ask including Steph Stephanie 'Lil Steph' Nguyen Junior Akai OseiMansfield Legend Niek Traa and Skorpion Brice Larrieu they think they need one more thing to make their routine different and innovative. That is when they meet Latin salsa dancer Eva Sofia Boutella who has an exuberance in the ring and on the dance floor Ash is sure that her passion the flair and excitement brought by the Latin rhythm and the mix of the two cultures together can create a great routine to blow everyone away and he also grows feelings for her. After so much practise ideas for what to include and a little help from Eva's uncle Manu Shirley Valentine's Tom Conti the team are ready to battle against their main rival in a head to head battle the rivals allowing them to try and beat them despite having the trophy and in the end the mix of Latin and street dance wins over the judges. Also starring Ali 'Lilou' Ramdani as Ali Delphine 'Deydey' Nguyen as Yo Yo and Flawless as The Surge Crew. It is a shame that Diversity do not appear again in this sequel but Sampson returns and gets more time on screen Flawless do appear don't I don't think were on long enough and the new addition of Boutella to the gang is most welcome. The cool and concise choreography with great routines are still what you watch it for I will confess that I didn't feel as thrilled with the story and overall feel of the film compared to the predecessor and again you forget it was a 3D film but it is certainly a dance drama to be seen. Songs featured in the film include Queen's We Will Rock You LP  JC remix Jessie J's Domino Dappy's Rockstar Superbass by Nicki Minaj Mama Do the Hump by Rizzle Kicks The Motto by Drake feat. Lil Wayne Taio Cruz's Troublemaker Bright Lights by Tinchy Stryder feat. Pixie Lott Unorthodox by Wretch 32 feat. Example and Bass Down Low Static Revenger Remix by Dev. Very good!".

Is there any chance that i can sue asylum for a bag of popcorn and can of coke that i spent in those 7 minutes of my life that i wasted on this?? I understand problems with low budget movies technical aspects of it all but Flash Gordon was a low budget movie a century ago and compared to this is a master piece. Now i seriously suggest to avoid this insult to a movie industry world wide at all costs. And this is coming from a guy who endured an ex girlfriend sobbing after Leo di Caprio in a theater with wooden chairs for 2 and a half hours just to see Titanic sink. I can endure pain but i just found out my limits!".

The sets are ridiculous the military installations are positively laughable. The only people in this film that actually seemed to pay attention to their job was the wardrobe department but then military uniforms do not require that much imagination. Why does syfy create this rubbish? I suspect it so that people will turn of the television and go outside in the sun for a few hours. At least that would be a reasonable justification for making this film. Considering watching this film  it is not even bad enough to be funny  just don't and say you did.

The big budget scifi flick Battle Los Angeles has just hit theaters and a day later Battle Of Los Angeles note the Of in the title people  totally different film! airs as the SyFy Channel's Saturday Night Original Movie. I wonder how many people were dumb enough to tune in thinking that they were going to be getting the real blockbuster for free. If so  joke's on you!! Anyway I haven't seen the real Battle Los Angeles but what I've seen in the trailers it appears to owe a lot to Independence Day and therefore so does Battle OF Los Angeles. In both versions a giant spaceship drops out of the skies over the City of Angels apparently impervious to all Earth weaponry. In the real movie the only ones who can do anything about the alien invasion are a platoon of toughasnails U.S. Marines. In the Asylum version it's a small band of Air National Guardsmen stationed in the hills.It must be said that the special effects in the first ten or fifteen minutes of Battle of Los Angeles actually look somewhat promising. While still characteristically AsylumSyFy Channel cheap the invasionbattle scene that opens the film looks like they at least put some kind of effort into it. I would imagine that the majority of the film's small budget went into that sequence as the rest of the film doesn't come close to measuring up to it. From here all resemblance to the real Battle Los Angeles ceases. Instead of Aaron Eckhardt and Michelle Rodriguez we get Kel Mitchell yes the former Welcome to Good Burger can I take your order? guy from Nickelodeon and Nia Peeples. Nia is a swordswingin' Area 51 ass kicker aging gracefully in a Resident Evil style cat suit who leads the band of military survivors through the desert random observation have you ever noticed how many Asylum films deal with a small band of survivors traveling through the desert? I'd say it accounts for a good half of their filmography!to a final showdown on board the alien ship. I realize this plot description is rather vague but then that's because as far as I could tell the film had no real plot to speak of. It's basically a series of random fight scenes stuff lifted from other better movies lots of people running guns being fired and stuff blowin' up in the Asylum's trademark laughably cheap CGI and a whole lot of ridiculous dialogue. Shoehorned in for no apparent reason is a fighter pilot from 1942 ? who is not what he appears to be a grizzled old airman who tries to shoot down alien ships with a Colt revolver and advanced alien weaponry that looks like it came off the shelves of ToysRUs. In short if you tuned into this movie thinking you were getting the real Battle Los Angeles then you deserve what you got. Bad movie fans who are in on the Asylum's joke will have a hoot and a holler picking apart the usual round of inconsistencies such as Peeples' suddenlyappearing eye patch and technical errors. Sit back with a six pack and enjoy. Judging from the reviews I've read of the real Battle Los Angeles movie this Asylumized version is probably more entertaining anyway.".

I couldn't do it and in fact had to go see the real Battle Los Angeles today due to feeling so grimy from the previous night. The story if you can call it that is a fusion of Skyline and Battle L.A. and several other films the acting is worse the horrible with a script so poorly written I can't believe anyone green lighted it.

Everyone reduces the speed of their cars to a near crawl to rubberneck across the road the twisted remains of a tragic car crash.And if you're looking for the movie equivalent of a multiple car pileup look no further than 'Battle of Los Angeles' by Asylum Studios. In fact I've actually turned into a bit of a junkie for these spectacularly bad movies by Asylum Studios and am seriously considering buying DVDs of all the movies they've made. If there was an academy award for 'Ballsiest Choice of Movie Title' these guys would win it every year hands down. 'The Terminators' 'Almighty Thor' 'Alien vs Hunter' '2012Ice Age' 'The Day The Earth Stopped'. If there was a 'Duping the Public into buying the wrong DVD award' they'd win that too.The barnyard production values are almost reminiscent of a school play. You could almost picture a school teacher desperately trying to get some enthusiasm from the actors who would rather be doing something else. The story itself is from the same cookie cutter mold as are most alien invasion movies nowadays. Aliens either want our planet it's resources or maybe they've just started receiving the 1st broadcasts of Americas Got Talent and believe that the humane thing to do would be to put us out of our misery.In any case don't try to make sense of this one. Stop being a critic for a while and just enjoy this movie as it cranks up the hammy acting senseless action and moronic story telling to the max.This is poor movie making at it's very best.".

It is obvious that they pulled out all the stops and went WAY over their 3000 production budget possibly by as much as 20. Now I like a schlocky scifi flick as much as the next guy as long as the idea is either original or entertaining. This film is neither. The plot is a direct rip off of several recent big budget filmsthere is no character development the actors seem to have had around 20 minutes to read through their scripts the sets are cheesy with the majority of exterior shots filmed in either the abandoned enlisted housing complex of a decommissioned air force base or a sand and gravel pit. The special effects look as if they were done on some kid's laptop while doodling during 7th grade study hall. But worst of all it takes itself WAY TOO SERIOUSLY.

	schema:reviewBody "For a SyFy movie then Battle of Los Angeles was actually somewhat surprising. Why you may ask? Well first off all the effects in the movie were actually decent enough except for the explosions from the hand grenades. They were the weakest explosion ever. The alien spacecrafts and vehicles were actually nicely made except for the weird robotlike vehicle that was fashioned from a modern day bombremoval unit. That was just hilarious.And for an invading force of aliens with the ability to travel through space wouldn't you think they had some firepower beyond projectile bullets? That was also hilarious.Similar to the World Invasion Battle Los Angeles this movie wasn't overly rich on a solid story. You were just thrown into the chaos and were left to sort out the ends yourself.For some reason we never saw anything from the streets you would assume that there would be chaos on the streets with people panicking police and military mobilizing but no that was not be. Instead we get less than 10 soldiers taking up arms lead by some antisocial overly angry and cursing officer. I have never heard of an officer addressing his subordinates in that manner. I wonder what they were thinking with that one. And to top it off throw in someone who auditioned for Kill Bill but didn't make the cut. What was up with the outfit the character Karla wore and wielding a katana? Wow!And one thing that did amuse me was when they were inside the mothership getting squished then Karla knew exactly how to work the machinery of the alien technology and save the day. Marvelous entertainment value right there!Lots of similarities between Battle of Los Angeles and World Invasion Battle Los Angeles. Coincidence? That is up for us to decide now isn't it? The acting in Battle of Los Angeles was actually adequate. Of course nothing to harvest in any awards but it was bearable to behold. Again with the similarities between World Invasion Battle Los Angeles you got a macho lady Theresa June Tao and Michelle Rodriguez. Another coincidence in actress choices?Truth be told then Battle of Los Angeles is actually one of the more impressive SyFy movies but it just suffered from having no real solid storyline and that it had too much in common with the World Invasion Battle Los Angeles movie. And that pulled the movie experience way way down. But it was a refreshing step away from their usual big and mean monster movies.Of course you know what kind of movie this is you have the ending figured out right from the very beginning of the movie. It is just that much of a stereotypical movie.".

If it had been played for humor it might have had a chance  at least to the extent that it already was able to produce howls of laughter at how silly some of the scenes were when played on the level.";

I made myself sit through the whole thing 90minsbecause a I just spent real money buying it 2I hoped it would get better it didn't. I watched this movie in the afternoon and nearly fell asleep after 10 minutes. Painful. Pathetic. Trash. There is no character development at all. Result you don't care about the characters or what happens to them. No plot development things happen but no reason is given. For example a sword wielding ninja girl appears Nia Peepleswho is actually quite cool. Who is she? Why is she there? Why does she have a sword???? Other examples are why are the aliens invading why did they appear suddenly from 1942 to present day is this time travel?? why does no one trust the young pilot to fly but seem keen to give him command on the ground? why does the captive alien want the clueless pilot to fly his ship and attack the aliens? I could go on forever.....like it felt watching the film. Lots of long pauses over extended shots of nothing happening I can't believe there was actually a script and it seems offthecuff no editing to speak of. At times I thought it was trying to be a spoof but I think the script was just so bad it made you cringe not laugh. Good points Nia Peebles is quite good  I felt really sorry for her being trapped in this awful film. There was potential here to make a great low budget 'cult' style scifi with some interesting characters but instead they tried to make a bigbudget ripoff. The trailer is 100 better than the main feature. The DVD actually contains a blooper reel they could have included the entire film! You can make a list of all the movies it's trying to homage Independence Day BattleLos Angeles Speices Alien Starship Troopers Terminator Platoon War of the Worlds the list is endless sadly they forgot to copy the characters and plots too so all you end up with is a total mess. If you buy this film don't resell it. Burn it. Please!!".

	schema:reviewBody "So I'm reading this book called Something's Alive on the Titanic by Robert Serling the same author who wrote The President's Plane is Missing Air Force One is Haunted and Someone's Something is Something except I made that last one up.Anyway the book is about a team of adventurers who dive to the Titanic only to discover a monster down there. And we know this is true because of all those 1912 newspaper stories that quoted survivors saying Thank God the Titanic sunk because there was a monster on it. See what I did there? I made that up too.Anyway again I bring this book up not just because its plot is perfect for an Asylum film if you're reading this Barry Van Dyke you're welcome but because it inspired me to coin the phrase riproaring stupidity.And so here we have Battle of Los Angeles in which an alien ship literally the size of Los Angeles starts blowing up the city for no good reason and the military responds by sending a few hot chicks in fighter jets to check it out.Soon the fate of the world is up to a halfdozen or so ragtag soldiers because the rest of the U.S. military apparently has better things to do than save the world from an alien invasion.Once the plot is established thus the film requires only that you just sit back and enjoy the riproaring stupidity. For instance The impossibly gravellyvoiced sergeant who barks out phrases like These ain't the Rooskies! and stoically fires his service revolver at a squadron of flying saucers blasting lasers at him. The tanklike robot with a machine gun on its head that looks like an amalgam of a Dalek and a vacuum cleaner that the aliens sent to kill a neighborhood of people. For some reason. The platoon leader who clings to life despite clearly being shot about 9000 times by the Dalek vacuum. The fighter pilot who can't seem to shake the flying saucer on her tail until she bravely ejects taking out the alien ship when her plane's windshield flies into it. The World War II pilot who shows up in a Corsair 68 years after being abducted by the aliens who seems really really cool until later in the movie when we find out something very very stupid about him. The samurai babe. 'Nuff said.We're soon introduced to one of the aliens and learn the real reason they're here and to be honest it's a rather nifty one which I won't spoil for you here but is easily learned on Wikipedia.Battle of Los Angeles is a mockbuster of the mainstream film Battle Los Angeles and if you dolled out good money at the theater for the latter when the former was a buck at Redbox find someone to stoogeslap you. Thanks to The Asylum riproaring stupidity doesn't have to cost a fortune.".

I needed a movie to psyche myself up and I was so inspired that it made me sweat in a rubber suit and starved myself till I droppedthankfully I don't do that anymore.

I needed a movie to psyche myself up and I was so inspired that it made me sweat in a rubber suit and starved myself till I droppedthankfully I don't do that anymore. Bottom line is this film is all about gloryand everbody dreams about glorifying themselvesand Louden Swain is no different. I also like to mention that this film has one of the best movie soundtrackcompilations ever better than Rocky and who wants to listen to Survivor over and over again.";

	schema:reviewBody "While I bought the soundtrack to 'Vision Quest' while the movie was still new I didn't bother to see the movie until recently. While a great soundtrack and a braless Linda Fiorentino was quite appealing the 'high school wrestler' plot didn't interest me at all. A few years later after seeing the sappy Matthew Modine in 'Married to the Mob ' I lost all interest in 'Vision Quest'. However after catching I wish Linda Fiorentino in 'Men in Black' and finding 'Vision Quest on ENCORE I thought 'What the heck? It's free.' So my wife and I snuggled in and watched. We were glad we did. Sure Modine was sappy but so was his character Loudan Swain. Loudan's a goofy kid who just turned 18. He's also smart and athletic and decent. He's a wrestler and he plans to beat the best high school wrestler in the state. Loudan wants this not for glory or awards he just believes he can do it and makes a superhuman effort to lose the weight required to compete in the champ's weight class. His buddy Kuch who fancies himself an American Indian observes Loudan is making a 'vision quest' for self discovery. During Loudan's journey and 'rite of passage to manhood' he meets Carla a street smart sexy girl three years his senior. Loudan falls for Carla and now has two dreams to fight the champ and to win Carla.Daryl Ponicson 'The Last Detail' 'Cinderella Liberty wrote the fine incisive screenplay from the novel by Terry Davis. The movie has a lot to say about life and how dedication leads to genius. The language is rough but quite natural. Linda Fiorentino has the movies funniest line which refers to the 'Holland Tunnel' but J. C. Quinn who plays Modene's chef friend has the most poetic monologue regarding Pele and soccer. Even though things don't work out exactly as Loudan expected he's uplifted and exhilarated and you will be too. The outstanding soundtrack contains music by Tangerine Dream Journey REO Speedwagon and Madonna among others. While the songs were not written for the movie except probably the Oscar worthy 'Crazy for You' they work extremely well. Credit director Howard Becker 'The Onion Field' 'Sea of Love' for getting the best from his talented cast of actors and musicians. 'Vision Quest' is not a great movie but a good one. I give it a '7'.".

They have love relationships they have classmates they have to deal with the teachers and coaches as well as their own family plus they have to deal with their own teammates each week who may want to take over the top position at their weight.As one who had over 100 high school matches 15 years before the making of this movie I can confirm that there is no better movie than this about high school wrestling. When you rate this movie you should not think about how good it is among all other movies rather you should rate it solely based on its ability to achieve the objective of accurately portraying its subject.I guess that some would think Louden is not a team player but wrestling is an individual sport no matter how others would want to portray it although if you win your team gets points.

Recently I saw the DVD on sale for 7.99 at Best Buy blatant plug for Best Buy? and I said what the hey.I suppose with ten years more wisdom behind me it allowed me to watch the movie with a more critical eye. And allowed me to see how untrue to life the movie really was. Granted it's not Saved By the Bell fake. You know where Slater eats a preweigh in cheeseburger and proceeds to pound a supposedly tough opponet in ten seconds while wearing no headgear and Vans. If it wanted to be more realistic the story would go more like this. Four days before the match Lowden Swain checks in at 180 pounds. He then proceeds to go get five sweatshirts and a garbage bag which will make up his outfit for the next couple of days. All eating will stop from here on out. Three days before the match. Lowden is probably down to about 177 lbs at this time.  That's a good start but not enough. Lowden proceeds to mess with the wrestling room thermostat cranking it up as high as it can go. The end result with 40 other guys sweating in the room is a temperature slightly higher than a June Day in Saudi Arabia.  Two days before the match. Lowden is at 172 pounds. But oops he had a bite of postcoital pizza. He's now back at 174 pounds. It's your own fault for messing up your metabolism so badly Louden.One day before the match. Lowden works back to about 170 lbs. From now on he won't be allowed any liquid or food. With the exception of Jolly Ranchers which he'll use to generate saliva that he can spit out.Day of the match. The bottle Lowden has been hocking into is now nearly full with Jolly Rancher spit. He's still half a pound over so he stands on his head for a half hour or so while spitting. It's time for weigh ins. Louden you're over. What were you thinking wearing a TShirt to weigh ins? Take it all off and try again. After you make it you can eat that deli sandwich you've been saving. Kick Kuch's ass and coach may even take you out to Sizzler afterwards so you can get a week's worth of calories back in your system. But be ready on Monday the pain starts again.This would probably be a pretty horrible movie though and what Lowden does to cut weight really isn't the most important part of the script. Elmo points out what this movie is about It's not six minutes it's what happens in the six minutes. Which is part of it but not all of it. As my old wrestling coach pointed out incesantly if you believe in something hard enough and are willing to work for it you can make anything happen. I'm quite sure if they ever make Vision Quest II Lowden Swain will be a Doctor in Outer Space.Anyway after watching Vision Quest for the million and first time I proceeded to get off my butt and run three miles. It's been ten years since I last donned a singlet and headgear. But that doesn't mean there aren't other things out there for me to conquer.".

Vision Quest is not a campy scifi flick nor is it about a sweaty muscle head frolicking around in a leotard to Cyndi Lauper it's an entertaining tale with hints of the irreplaceable 1980's luster that most of the great films from that era provide.Louden Swain is sort of a goofy character but he's authentic and ironclad. Louden drives through the experiences of youth with all the wonder and ferocity anyone could hope for. A combination of solid writing and acting render him a palpable character who's easy to empathize with. The northwestern city atmosphere helps.Linda Fiorentino puts out a relatively deep character and her looks don't hurt anything. There are some good performances elsewhere happily there really aren't many two dimensional characters to speak of.Initially the movie feels a little kitsch but if you stick with it you'll find it's more about coming of age and romance than sports. Not really a mindblowing script or anything too memorable but not at all a bad way to blow ninety minutes.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film which features Madonna about the time she hit it big stands as the only major studio work about high school or collegiate style wrestling. The film tells the story of Louden Swain a high school senior who has been wrestling for barely two years. Because of his balance and natural gifts he's already a state champion and the best in his weight class. But that's not enough. The tall and lanky wrestler played by Matthew Modine decides that the path to glory is to starve and sweat himself down two weight classes so that he can challenge the unbeatable 3time state champion Brian Shute. Shute trains by walking up and down stadium bleachers holding an 18 inch wooden telephone pole.For Swain making weight is a long and arduous process consisting of constant running and frequent nosebleeds. Swain's sanity and competence are questioned by everyone else in his drab suburb of Spokane WA. Meanwhile his only inspirations come from a beautiful feisty 20something wild flower named Carla played by Linda Fiorentino who drifts into town and bunks with Swain and his dad for a while.All in all there are a lot of problems with this film. First off the writers have little understanding of Wrestling as a sport. Matches end for no reason and scoring is inconsistent. In one scene the home team forfeits the match simply because the away team has taken the lead meaning the last couple wrestlers forgo their matches. Anyone who knows Wrestling remotely knows that this doesn't happen. Imagine your hometown baseball team is down 100 in the 3rd Inning. Even the Cubs would finish that game.Also like with Chess champions in Wrestling are never made in a matter of two seasons. But inaccuracy and uninformed fantasy aside there's more.When not starving himself and risking his health to reach his goal our hero is babbling on about virtues and character. Yet in one scene he tries to force himself sexually on his house guestlove Carla before she punches him in the face prompting nosebleeds again only to have it brushed under the rug when she shows up to cheer him on at his wrestling meet.In the end boy wins girl boy beats the unbeatable champion and returns to high school and a normal diet. But Vision Quest will leave you and anyone who's not an anorexic nerdy sexually deviant excuse for an athlete wondering what the hell you've just watched for two hours.But social issues and hangups aside Vision Quest is just a bad bad film.written by Andy Frye MySportsComplex.blogspot.com".

Shute is probably the coolest villain of all sport movies and his scene with the pole and bleacher walk makes every schoolboy thank god they never wrestled him. Louden is your unlikely hero but its realistic when you grow with him and watch him work for it. The acting in this movie is nothing to marvel at but it does not hold or distract you from a great story. Even though i rated this movie a 7 it is one of my favorites and is a true hidden gem.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm not a Gus Van Sant fan but I have to admit Paranoid Park got under my skin it's a fascinating film. His adaptation of the novel by Blake Nelson both GVS and Nelson are from Oregon and their oeuvre is centered around American Teenland allows GVS to do a sort of smallscale contemporary American version of Crime and Punishment. As in Dostoyevsky GVS uses a gruesome killing deliberate in Dostoyevsky accidental here as a motif to expose the nature and process of guilt self punishment youth conventions repressed emotions social and moral malaise in his society.Gus Van Aschenba... uh I mean Gus Van Sant's fascination with teen boys is taken to the hilt in Paranoid Park as he follows his unfathomable TadzioRaskolnikov the introspective sexually ambiguous and emotionally muted skateboarder named Alex played by Gabe Nevins whose blank Botticelli face and blas demeanor hide his character's soulsearching turmoil. The swooning voyeuristic camera follows Alex so closely and so insistently that it seems it's trying to penetrate and discover under those expressionless features and monotone voice the complex feelings that Alex is struggling to understand and keep under control especially after tragedy strikes when he kills a security guard in a terrible railway accident.The thriller plot is cleverly built but of lesser importance it's Alex's existentialmoral crisis and GVS's concern with America's misfit kids that really matter in Paranoid Park. The serpentine camera dances around the skateboarders in slow motion  la Wong KarWai observing their beautiful air arabesques and their gravitychallenging leaps that seem to reach for cleaner oxygen above groundstuck conformity and ordinariness. The adrenalineaddicted skateboarders of Paranoid Park live in a sort of adolescent purgatory where time also seems to loop growingup which includes the possibility of going to war is postponed and it's no wonder we see some overaged teens there like the older guy who takes Alex to the illfated freight train ride.But Paranoid Park is more than a sympathetic portrait of a certain American youth the kind that we don't often see in American movies. It's also a freespirited aesthetic exploration visually contrasting film textures focusoutoffocus shots marked impressionistic style the trademark but still hypnotizing slowmotion shots of cameraman's Christopher Doyle rhythmically witty editing and we can thank all our gods it's only 85 minutes long and aurally GVS uses a VERY eclectic soundtrack  classical music folk rock hip hop French concrete music and a lot of Nino Rota  like a teen zapping his iPod. I was especially puzzled at GVS's extensive use of Rota's score for Fellini's Juliet of the Spirits. At first sight and sound didn't seem to match at all but then it's true that both Alex and Giulietta are closedin dissatisfied emotionally repressed misfits trying to cope with their loneliness and malaise by learning to confront and accept their personal ghosts  though by the end of their journey we may fear for their mental sanity.Another fascinating aspect of Paranoid Park is that GVS shows mature fairplay about his traumatic failure with the Psycho remake also photographed by Doyle. Most obviously with two scenes that directly revisit Psycho the cardriving scene in rainy weather with nonstop music on the soundtrack  a sign of the upcoming ominous events and the magnificent shower scene this time in extreme close up and extreme slowmotion with running water flowing through Alex's long hair forming a translucent medusalike image of mesmerizing beauty electrified by a crescendo effect of apparently rattling waterdrop sounds mixed with loud bird chirps remember bird sounds also inspired the legendary Bernard Herrmann's staccato shower murder theme in Psycho as Norman Bates was a bird taxidermist. There's even the same shot of Alex slowly gliding down against the wall in the shower as Marion Crane in Hitchcock's classic.Both in Psycho and in Paranoid Park the shower scenes are a bodysoulcleansing ritual the climax of each film and a turning point for the protagonists for Marion Crane it's unexpected death punishment for Alex it's the decision to keep silent about his crime selfpunishment. As in Psycho there is the observation of guilt underneath innocent appearance Alex Marion Crane and Norman Bates look perfectly innocent and repressed sexuality both Alex and Norman are sexually numb though aware they're attractive to women. And as in Psycho there's the unfailing intuition of a detective here played by Daniel Liu who looks like an Asian Martin Balsam and whose eyes are so different one from the other  one is lidless accusatory fixed the other is heavylidded worldweary understanding that when he stares at Alex he seems to figure out both sides of the boy. The main weakness in the film is GVS's portrayal of females. It's obvious Alex couldn't care less about his hysterical cheerleading girlfriend determined to get rid of her virginity but did she have to be portrayed as an insufferable bore? And did Lauren McKinney who plays the girl secretly in love with Alex have to be so unflatteringly photographed? compare her cruel closeups with the slowmotion parade of gorgeous skateboarding ephebes at the school. And need I say Alex's mother as in Psycho is only seen out of focus far in the distance or from behind? this time around we DO get to see the face and body of a father in a GVS film  and man it's a scary vision.Even if Paranoid Park isn't your cup of tea one has to admit GVS is a rarity among established contemporary American filmmakers he has through the years been brave enough to stick to his thematic obsessions young male beauty the loneliness of nonconformism the failure of the American dream and the traditional family the complexity that lies under the apparent numbness and superficiality of American teens and put them in films that  while certainly not for all tastes  get more fascinating as they get more personal and selfrevelatory by refusing to be big.".

	schema:reviewBody "Gus Van Sant's latest films have been some of the most idiosyncratic not just of his career but of independent film in America since 2000. He's jumped ship momentarily from the Hollywood machine To Die For Good Will Hunting Finding Forrester and made films like Gerry Elephant and Last Days as sort of poetic essays on film yes very pretentious but they are poetic at least. His latest Paranoid Park at least could be called as something more of a storydriven narrative than any of the others but it's still with a lyrical beat driven by a mixandmatch of 8mm skateboarding footage and the malaise of a teen caught in that very recognizable almost atypical state of mind at that age. Only here it's probably more of a quiet detached malaise that has within it a soul that is being sort of killed away piece by piece by the secret he holds.The teen is Alex first timer Gabe Nevins who was mostly responsible for the very grisly death of a security guard while he and a notquite acquaintance from Paranoid Park's skating scene were riding carelessly along a slowmoving train. He shut it out of his mind or tried to until a police officer examining the case brought in photos of the deceased in a Q  A with all of the skaters at high school. This pretty much is the bedrock of the story but aside from this it's the 'something' that is the story. The rest of the film shows this kid in a state of peril but not of the sort that makes us think this is an immediate existential crisis. He feigns interest in a girlfriend ditzy Jennifer played by Taylor Momsen hangs out with his skater friends like Jared also firsttimer Jake Miller and writes in a journal with a narration that's a mix of detached Travis Bickle and well awkward teen.What interested me was a mood I found Van Sant intentionally or otherwise was working with. I kept thinking back to a work like Camus's the Stranger which had its 'hero' Mersault as a figure who wasn't exactly passionate and just a few heart beats above dead fish. There's something in this kids eyes in his lack of reaction and in those long moments right after the train track scene as he is under the shower faucet in slowmotion. Actually there's a lot of slowmotion sometimes of walking or ruminating and as it builds with the narration and the mix of stark and experimental cinematography from the great Christopher Doyle great at you know these kinds of arthouse films as part of Van Sant's method of character study.Alex's inability to connect with friends parents authority figures even his own impulse to release his inner thoughts however brief and to the point I'm not much of a creative writer Alex admits is what is meant to absorb the viewer into Paranoid Park. For Van Sant no matter what the excesses of the light touches of music mostly from Nino Rota and Elliot Smith or the slowmotion skateboarding which I could go either way on as a casual admirer of the sport or the bits that seem to have not much to do with anything aside from following a character in the midst of some thought i.e. Alex on an escalator it works as a feat of art for expressing its character in the relatively short running time like no other filmmaker would. It's somewhat challenging but one that's worth taking for glimpses into a state of mind akin to the sobering existential and more startling the lackofcomingofage to the character. 8.510".

It's a tough film to classify not quite a character study not much of a thriller more of a mood piece. I was a little perplexed at what Van Sant was aiming for and particularly confused by the repeated snippets of score from JULIET OF THE SPIRITS but it resonates and does a pretty good job of sucking you into its rhythms and offbeat structure. There are a few character moments that don't quite ring true but this may be more a function of the nonprofessional cast than any fault of the screenplay. Shot beautifully by Chris Doyle on location here in Van Sant's hometown of Portland it's always a kick to see familiar places and faces... Ken Boddie!. It's not a DRUGSTORE COWBOY or a GERRY but I liked it more than a lot of other Van Sants I've tried.".

Something not really bad suddenly snowballs. You use a swear word and your dad starts shouting and he crashes the car and there's a big pile up and it's all your fault. Or a kind word gets taken the wrong way and suddenly everyone in the bar is throwing punches. Basically good guys don't always go to heaven that's my worry.Paranoid Park isn't a real park. Or rather it's a real skateboard park but the name is just made up by the kids there. It's the place where all the top skaters go. Alex is a good kid from the nice side of town. He skates a lot but doesn't know if he's really ready for Paranoid Park. That place is pretty intense. Alex borrows his mother's car but parks it on the opposite side of the river if he goes there. So it won't get damaged.A policeman at the school is asking questions. A security guard has been found dead near the rail tracks. Maybe murder. The tracks run close to Paranoid Park. Did anyone see anything? There are so many remarkable things about this unusual movie. Let's starts with the acting and characterisation. Here Director Gus Van Sant gives us characters that actors of many years' experience would be proud of. The kids in the movie don't have that  in fact most of them were recruited through MySpace. What we get though is a sense of their interior lives.All the kids  Alex his girlfriend Jennifer most of their friends come from a world where being a teenager is the reality. That means your hobbies and interests are the daytoday world goals for the future figure somewhere and adults are pretty peripheral. Adults exist and perform certain functions but are not that interesting. The adults in the film like those in Rebel Without a Cause are fairly onedimensional. But unlike most teenpics the children here do not seem angry overly rebellious or addicted to sex and drugs and rock and roll. Nor are they stupid. They are convincingly normal teenagers very real. They could be your children.The 'world' of skateboarding or rather Alex's mental narrative  is skilfully woven from the start. Not by boring the pants off us with long displays of skate board skill but rather by associational editing soundscapes and inventive use of cameras and formats. We see and feel how this hobby through the skaters' eyes produces a high akin to drugs or music. By making Alex's perspective so real for us his sparse lines throw us back on what he is thinking. We are closer to him than the adults in his world. More like a sibling. More like someone who knows and believes you when you are so honest and frank and also stands next to you when you have your fingers crossed behind your back . . .Our soundscapes are made up of gentle electronic ambient sounds. A dreamy woman's voice whispers something in French. Cinematography is by Christopher Doyle In the Mood for Love. The sun through blades of grass near the shore and we skip between Super 8 and 35mm handheld cameras and stable frames. The ethereal and unreal becomes the bedrock of our world. Just as the basis of puberty is change. Adults can be sidelined in a way that just stops short of being contrived. When Alex is talking to his mother or father they stay out of focus or out of frame for quite a long time into the conversation.When the mystery is revealed it happens with operatic intensity yet our emotion is held back until Alex can deal with it in his own way. The way the film evokes a moist eye from probably everyone in the theatre and suddenly stops will upset those wanting a more conventional structure. But it will still manage to satisfy far more people than might otherwise venture into such an artbased film.As one of the characters says to Alex Noone's ever really ready for Paranoid Park.".

	schema:headline " Another fine film from Gus Van Sant";
	schema:reviewBody "This is another fine film by Gus Van Sant which sadly seems to have overlooked by most cinemas and cinemagoers where I live. I attended one of three screenings at an almostdeserted local arthouse cinema in Southampton. For me however this short lowkey film left a deepimpression.The nonnarrative structure of the film means that the action on screen cuts back and forth in time around a central incident in which Alex played by Gabe Nevins causes the death of a security guard on a train track in Portland Oregon where the film is set. This shocking event is unveiled appropriately enough in the middle of the film. From very early it is more or less obvious what trouble Alex is in so there is little sense of mystery about the film's events. However the nonnarrative sequencing does allow for questions to float to the surface before explanations and elaborations begin to crop up later in the film allowing the viewer to make connections and draw some conclusions for themselves. I quite enjoy this approach to storytelling although it does seem to be increasingly common see Before the Devil Knows You're Dead Memento et al.The cast apparently consisting of local teenagers with little background in acting turn in some fine performances especially Gabe Nevins in the central role of Alex. Scenes in the film are interspersed with camcorder footage of teenagers skateboarding around Oregon which is a novel touch and in keeping with the feel of Van Sant's films which are realistic but more dreamlike than gritty.A special mention should go to the soundtrack in Paranoid Park which is one of the strongest features of this film. The music ranges from rock the Revolts through folk Elliott Smith to classical Beethoven and musique concrete Robert Normandeau. My favourite use of music in the film is in the opening shots of skateboarders in the skate park from which the film's title is taken. Warm electronic tones and burblings envelope a continuous slowmotion camera shot of skateboarders as they rove around the the curves and angles of the park and the effect is really quite magical. Having said that I think there are one too many slowmotion shots later in this film which seem somewhat suspicious when the running time is less than 90 minutes...".

	schema:reviewBody "I've been a fan of Van Sant's films for a while now. I guess I could boil this interest down to the college influence. Art in any form but especially cinema seems to resonate with my generation 1980's on. This film is the third in what I see as a three part series the first two being Elephant and Last Days. All three surprisingly depict the attitude of the contemporary youth in a way that no other films have been able to do. I say surprisingly because it strikes me as odd that Van Sant would be able to so accurately capture the thoughts feelings and attitudes of such a misunderstood generation. So often parents of these children say such things as we did that when we were your age or I can relate to what you are going through but what these parents often fail to recognize is that although the things we encounter may be similar the times as Bob Dylan would say are a changin'. To capture the particular mindset of the youth of today is a feat in itself but to do so and provide entertainment as well deserves at least a brief look.The film Paranoid Park itself seems to capture this way of thinking better than the previous two films. What starts as a simple rant about the modern youth becomes so much more. At first you might find yourself thinking that the movie is somberor perhaps unrealistic as the circumstances of the action are strange but as you continue watching it the message that is trying to be conveyed becomes clear. This could have been you. This could have been me. It could have been you child or the kid down the street. The common themes of teen flicks of drugs sex and rock and roll are pushed aside to highlight the internal strife of the protagonist. The emo music and distinctive fashion of this generational subculture seem all too real and in the end you are left feeling as the main character does silent and alone. Is this a movie about hope? I'm not sure. What I am sure about is that it deserves a chance. Paranoid Park could best be described as a much needed break from mainstream cinema but more important a film that might just make you think.".

	schema:headline " Paranoid Park Cast and Crew Screening 71707";
	schema:reviewBody "I was fortunate enough to attend a cast and crew screening of Gus Van Sant's latest film Paranoid Park. Having missed Last Days Gerry and seeing only bits and pieces of Elephant I didn't really know what to expect as he sheepishly greeted the crowd said his thank you's and let the film roll. With all the criticism both for and against these recent films I prepared myself for meaningless long shots of people walking eating and various other moments that would quickly find their way to most editor's cutting room floors. Would I be held hostage by a director too much in love with his own shots or witness the work of a director who could at this point in his career easily coast  yet continues to redefine himself? Thankfully it was the latter.Paranoid Park is easily one of my favorite films of the year second only to First Snow. Both share the same kind of slow dreamy reverie I think mainstream audiences are put off by. Both are threaded by haunting scores that are inseparable from the film as a whole. The film feels like music on its own.Park's story is about the death of a security guard in Portland's industrial district very close to an infamous skate park named Paranoid Park. The film was shot entirely in Portland Oregon. Much like Van Sant's Drug Store Cowboy the director treats the various locales in Portland as a second character showcasing the unique flavor of the city without coming across as a film commissioned by the Oregon tourist board.The young lead in the film Gabe Nevins in what is perhaps his debut film role has the uneasy task of carrying the film. He plays Alex a shy skater type who has little interest in his parents school or his pretty girlfriend. His performance is commendable. In a role that could have come across as the typical Skater Boy we've all seen 100 times before he comes off naturally as a nervous boy who's uncomfortable in his own skin A boy gripped by an internal struggle too personal to share with anyone. The film is ultimately about this struggle. His narration might strike many viewers as stoic and forced. I would have to disagree. I saw it as the voice of a boy nervously scribbling away at his journal  mistakes and all. The entire film has that raw type of quality.While pleased with Nevins' performance I can't say the same for two of the young female actresses in the film. Taylor Momsen who plays Alex's girlfriend is awful. In contrast to Nevins' natural performance Momsen comes off like a pretty teenager who's nervous about being watched. I've seen better acting at middle school dance recitals. In a long scene shared by the two we hear nothing but music this seemed less like an artistic decision and more like a creative way to tune out her distracting acting. Lauren McKinney as Alex's friend shows us an equally wooden performance.The most impressive quality of Paranoid Park is the gorgeous cinematography by Christopher Doyle and Kathy Li.

Whether the many dreamlike shots are the result of a director who edits his own film unwilling to cut away from his favorite shots or of an orchestrated effort to thread the film like a song and let the narrative drift in and out I am in love with his effort and look forward to dreaming with him more.Yours in Service Robert Plastorm".

	onyx:emotionText "I was fortunate enough to attend a cast and crew screening of Gus Van Sant's latest film Paranoid Park. Having missed Last Days Gerry and seeing only bits and pieces of Elephant I didn't really know what to expect as he sheepishly greeted the crowd said his thank you's and let the film roll. With all the criticism both for and against these recent films I prepared myself for meaningless long shots of people walking eating and various other moments that would quickly find their way to most editor's cutting room floors. Would I be held hostage by a director too much in love with his own shots or witness the work of a director who could at this point in his career easily coast  yet continues to redefine himself? Thankfully it was the latter.Paranoid Park is easily one of my favorite films of the year second only to First Snow. Both share the same kind of slow dreamy reverie I think mainstream audiences are put off by. Both are threaded by haunting scores that are inseparable from the film as a whole. The film feels like music on its own.Park's story is about the death of a security guard in Portland's industrial district very close to an infamous skate park named Paranoid Park. The film was shot entirely in Portland Oregon. Much like Van Sant's Drug Store Cowboy the director treats the various locales in Portland as a second character showcasing the unique flavor of the city without coming across as a film commissioned by the Oregon tourist board.The young lead in the film Gabe Nevins in what is perhaps his debut film role has the uneasy task of carrying the film. He plays Alex a shy skater type who has little interest in his parents school or his pretty girlfriend. His performance is commendable. In a role that could have come across as the typical Skater Boy we've all seen 100 times before he comes off naturally as a nervous boy who's uncomfortable in his own skin A boy gripped by an internal struggle too personal to share with anyone. The film is ultimately about this struggle. His narration might strike many viewers as stoic and forced. I would have to disagree. I saw it as the voice of a boy nervously scribbling away at his journal  mistakes and all. The entire film has that raw type of quality.While pleased with Nevins' performance I can't say the same for two of the young female actresses in the film. Taylor Momsen who plays Alex's girlfriend is awful. In contrast to Nevins' natural performance Momsen comes off like a pretty teenager who's nervous about being watched. I've seen better acting at middle school dance recitals. In a long scene shared by the two we hear nothing but music this seemed less like an artistic decision and more like a creative way to tune out her distracting acting. Lauren McKinney as Alex's friend shows us an equally wooden performance.The most impressive quality of Paranoid Park is the gorgeous cinematography by Christopher Doyle and Kathy Li. There is a rich warm  almost vintage quality to the film. Mixing what looked like various stocks of Super 8 digital video and 35 MM film each location is bathed in its own outward charm.

Of course the background is different as we're having the moral struggle put in youth and skate environment. As the plot twists the director focuses on the realism of the main character's's struggle. This is why the movie definitely scores as 9 out of 10. Not because of the 'moral message' which was the main 'goal' of Dostoevsky's book but he uses all of available artistic and directing methods to picture something that is not distant for the viewer. It is more like picturing the struggles that recently became part of human nature.Main character although he's a teenager is already wasted and is having enough of his life. Sick and tired doesn't give much attention about his girlfriend sexual initiation family and friends as the 'higher levels' of morality and humanity became his main issues after his accident.I think that the movie should be considered more as a inner mirror of struggles and hard issues that became a part of our everyday life.

	schema:reviewBody "Alex a teenage skateboarder accidentally kills a security guard in the vicinity of Paranoid Park a skate grounds on the outskirts of Portland. Rather than report the incident to the police Alex decides to say nothing.This thin plot is stretched for an hour and seventeen minutes as Gus Van Sant's camera following his amateur actors over the course of a couple of days. Many viewers will be left bored and find the story thin and undramatic but I enjoyed it.Gus Van Sant's intentions I think are to treat skateboarding as a form of escapism. Like drugs alcohol or even film skateboarding is Alex's way of escaping his dysfunctional family and depressing life. The boys at Paranoid Park are his kindred spirits. He feels comfortable around them. They all understand his pain. As such Van Sant tries to portray skateboarding as a dreamy slow sort of ethereal trance. He wants us to know that skateboarding is like being lost in drugs alcohol or even a good piece of literature. This is how Alex escapes the world.Van Sant's second point is that all the problems in the film are simply due to a lack of communication. The plot itself is merely a metaphor for this theme. Alex feels troubled and trapped simply because he doesn't talk about the crime he committed. Likewise he's forced into having sex with his girlfriend because he lets her do all the talking and he has problems with his parents because he never opens up to them. His parents themselves have marital problems because they fail to meaningfully communicate. Throughout the film character's constantly misunderstand one another or simply lie to avoid having to talk about something uncomfortable. Not only do they fail to communicate but they fail to properly articulate their feelings and pain.Alex then meets Macy that compassionate female character who seems to pop up in all of Van Sant's death films. Right away she senses that there is something wrong with him. She sees the pain in Alex and recommends that he write his troubles down to get his problems off his chest. Alex does this communicates to the audience and the film ends.The film has several flaws. Firstly the way Gus Van Sant portrays skateboarding a drug like daze doesn't work. It just feels cheap. Secondly his idea of Alex's confessional letter being the film fabric itself feels half thought out. Alex writes his letter bit by bit and the film takes this fractured approach. Elephant was structured in a similar way but felt more confident. Thirdly the story is too thin. The film is only an hour and seventeen minutes long and yet at least ten minutes of the film feels like pointless padding.Still there's a lot of strong stuff here. Like Gerry Last Days and Elephant Van Sant uses amateur actors which lends the film an interesting edge. Also his cinematography by long time Wong Kar Wai cinematographer Chris Doyle is always interesting.Despite it's failures Paranoid Park is a great little morality tale. Gus Van Sant seems to have tapped into the whole teenageangst thing. His characters are all lost trapped in an uncaring unforgiving modern world their parents distant and literally out of focus. They have nobody to turn to. Nobody to talk to. Nobody to console them.And like Paul Newman says at the end of Cool Hand Luke all these problems are simply due to man's failure to meaningfully communicate. Our failure to properly empathise and our inability to ever know what's going on in another person's head. We're all trapped in our own little boxes with our own little problems and rather than reach out and share our pain we bottle it up thinking we're all alone. Gus Van Sant wants us to know that by sharing out problems and by helping one another we'd have a lot less to worry and a lot less to be guilty of.7.910  A heavily flawed but well meaning film made by an honest artist.".

	schema:reviewBody "Any mention of a Gus Van Sant film is nearly always accompanied by comments of being about disaffected or alienated male youth. While this is invariably both true and unavoidable such superficial descriptions don't really do Paranoid Park justice. Van Sant's latest film is a profoundly intimate moving and insightful meditation on the inner world of a youth in crisis.Alex is sixteen and aside from navigating the usual hurdles of adolescence school girls and life in general his parents have recently undergone a messy separation. His escape is to hang out with his buddy Jared and together they discover Portland's tough Eastside Skate Park. Known to the locals as Paranoid Park it was built by the skaters themselves and is a magnet for all kinds of dropouts.Alex is a fairly normal kid but everything changes one evening when he goes to Paranoid Park alone and is involved in the death of a security guard. He keeps this toxic secret to himself but gradually reveals all in his diary.Of Van Sant's films Paranoid Park is aesthetically most similar to Elephant. It defies a linear narrative circling around the central facts which reflect Alex's state of shock and inability to come to terms with what has happened.Other stylistic devices convey Alex's fractured state of mind such as the use of a varied range of eclectic music. Similarly effective is the use of slow motion creating a dreamy ambiance that complements the music at times or contrasts at others the music. The film opens to the sounds of an ambient French track that matches the imagery of skaters floating through space defying gravity. In fact Paranoid Park is a French production and while the story and participants are clearly American the film really has qualities reminiscent of French cinema. Van Sant seems to be revered in France more so that in his own country. His work has stark similarities to my favourite type of French cinema.The depiction of grownups from a teenage perspective is fascinating. When in frame they either have their backs to us or cinematographer Chris Doyle's use of long lenses to strictly control focus means we mostly see them as a blur. They are not absent but don't figure prominently in Alex's world. This is also subtly accentuated in conversations. It's not like she cares moans Alex about his mother when questioned about his movements. We do however clearly see Detective Richard Liu. His strong presence shakes Alex out of his dreamy inner world and gives us a more grounded reference point within the story. His quiet intensity as he faces off with Alex at a crucial moment is as emotionally powerful as anything I have ever experienced on screen. This is when the true impact of Alex's ordeal as well as Van Sant's genuine empathy for his characters is fully revealed.In Paranoid Park youth are disconnected from adults but also parents are unable to engage with their children. Alex is in his own world that seems impenetrable to his parents and they seem to struggle with words he can relate to. When Alex's father talks about inevitable divorce his words have little interest to Alex. Cast with mostly nonprofessionals much has been made of Van Sant's casting call via MySpace though apparently none of the main actors were found in this way. Van Sant has used improvisation with the actors resulting in dialogue full of authenticity lightyears from the slick depictions of youth in contemporary cinema. His characters both adults and youths sometimes struggle with their words. The performances were terrific.In fact I find it hard to fault the film in any way. The cinematography is stunningly natural the music is entrancing and the story is compelling. Technically the most impressive aspect is careful construction of the story through editing by Van Sant himself.Starting with Gerry this film caps off four consecutive films Van Sant has made in a minimalist style he is making his own. All four of them are concerned with youth and death. Life death and what occurs between these are all compacted within the framework of a Van Sant film. The films are not about death but death is an event that provokes other dramatic elements. For me Paranoid Park is the most touching of all his films at least as good as Elephant and as good as anything I've seen in the last year.".

	schema:headline " Moptop stuff from Gus Van Sant";
	schema:reviewBody "After turning his back on the mainstream 6 years ago with his striking yet spurned twoman tale Gerry acclaimed writerdirector Gus Van Sant delivers once more in refined style with his own eccentric yet poignant spin on the teen' movie genre.Adapted from Blake Nelson's best selling novel and shot masterfully in Van Sant's hometown of Portland Paranoid Park hinges on an act of acute violence. Alex Gabe Nevins is a confused schoolboy skater whose life hits the bricks following his role in the death of a local security guard. The film itself then is largely told from Alex's perspective as he goes back and forth in his mind and notebook in an attempt to vindicate his tainted conscious and make sense of why and how things happened the way they did.With the chronology of the omniscient narrative skewed and certain scenes misleading Paranoid Park establishes a near perfect balance between form and content. The naivety and confusion stirring behind Nevins' infantile eyes are both complimented and mirrored by the structure of the plot. In his feature debut Nevins gives a modest performance of troubled teen' in whom thoughts of family divorce sex skating school and murder suffer a succession of highspeed collisions. At the age of just 15 Nevins' not only performs with a quality beyond his tender years and experience but provides a leading performance that is as convincing as it is impressive.As for Van Sant his tight filmmaking skills are exhibited throughout in what has to be considered as an experimental picture wherein an uncanny blend of handheld slowmo' scenic intercuts outofsync shots and mellow offscreen alternative music carve a moody yet nonchalant atmosphere that at times suggests that this is an independent crimemystery drama at others a tale of boy becomes man. Whatever it is it brings to mind the likes of Memento and Brick. Hence it is simply brilliant. Mystifying moving and quite majestic. Paranoid Park is one of this year's most haunting and interesting features that ranks amidst Van Sant's finest work to date. Good Will Hunting? Not quite. But for such a question to prompt a pause for thought says a lot. See this.".

	onyx:emotionText "After turning his back on the mainstream 6 years ago with his striking yet spurned twoman tale Gerry acclaimed writerdirector Gus Van Sant delivers once more in refined style with his own eccentric yet poignant spin on the teen' movie genre.Adapted from Blake Nelson's best selling novel and shot masterfully in Van Sant's hometown of Portland Paranoid Park hinges on an act of acute violence. Alex Gabe Nevins is a confused schoolboy skater whose life hits the bricks following his role in the death of a local security guard. The film itself then is largely told from Alex's perspective as he goes back and forth in his mind and notebook in an attempt to vindicate his tainted conscious and make sense of why and how things happened the way they did.With the chronology of the omniscient narrative skewed and certain scenes misleading Paranoid Park establishes a near perfect balance between form and content.

	schema:reviewBody "I went to see this film with high expectations to the Muestra International De Cine in part because of Elephant 2003 that is my personal favourite of Gus Van Sant.The film is similar to Elephant in the part that show to us the real life of an adolescent.Paranoid Park follows the life of Alex a young boy who loves skateboarding when his life change because of a murderer.But this film is not only about a murder and those kind of stuff is about real life show to us a world where adults don't know nothing about their own child's and for me that is very real.In the case of the main character Alex his parents are going to divorce and he spend his life with his friend Jared and his girl Jennifer. It looks that Alex have a good communication with his mom but when he need that communication there's a phrase that resume all is like write the letter to a person who you can trust not to your parents of your teachers write it to me. A phrase like that is said to Alex by another friend and for me that resume the problem of communication of the film.Another is when Alex is in the murder scene and he nows that his life is going to change and the unique person who is thinking about is his young brother.So the film is full of critic to the society and is very beautiful filmed and also the storytelling is great. The act is just natural and very real just like in Elephant and another detail that i love is that we almost can't see the adults in the film i mean the parents of Alex are like out of focus in the unique scene where they appear.As a conclusion This film is different and unique so is highly recommendable and comparing to the other work of Gus Van Sant for me this is in my 3 favourites with Elephant and Drugstore Cowboy.PS another detail that i love is when Alex' brother tell to Alex a scene from Napoleon Dynamite is like the magic of a child's innocence.".

	schema:headline " Another in Van Sant's admirable new series";
	schema:reviewBody "The film publicity lays it out about Paranoid Park with a synopsis that goes like this Alex a teenage skateboarder accidentally kills a security guard in the vicinity of Paranoid Park Portland's tough skate park.He decides to say nothing.That is indeed what happens and in action terms all that happens so you could call this a police nonprocedural. The story is not told in the simple order suggested by the synopsis. It's only gradually that the audience learns what Alex Gabe Nevins has gotten involved in and as the synopsis says he never tells anybody though viewers get to see it. He alludes vaguely to something bad that's happened when talking to Macy Lauren McKinney a smart ironic girl who seems to move in on Alex as Jennifer Taylor Momsen who wants to be his girlfriend moves out he breaks up with Jennifer after they've had sex. Macy suggests that to get it off his chest Alex can write a letter or diary about whatever happenedthen if he likes just burn it. Through following Alex's various writing sessions Van Sant weaves in the story of that event he can't talk about doesn't know what to do about and can't stop thinking about.His best friend Jared Jake Miller thinks Alex is crazy to give up free sex by breaking up with Jennifer but he does. Maybe what has happened to Alex puts having sex into perspective for him But even before that going to Paranoid Park with Jared was more interesting to Alex at this stage than Jennifer. Paranoid Park is an awesome place to skateboard. It's also scary scary because it's a bad part of town and there are tough older guys who hang out there and also challenging for Alex because he doesn't think he's good enough to skate in public. But it calls to him even when Jared can't go there with him. He goes alone one night and that's when he talks to some of the older guys and afterwards the bad stuff happens.The story about the death of the security guard by the railroad tracks comes up on the TV news. It looked accidental but then a possibility of homicide appeared. Because the train tracks where the death occurred are near Paranoid Park Detective Richard Lu Dan Liu shows up at Alex's high school and all the skateboarders are summoned to talk to him. He interviews Alex separately later but that's seen before. Detective Lu is very good at talking to the boys. He's completely nonthreatening but he does his job. However it seems likely that as one kid says he's just being a cop but doesn't really know anything. Anyway this story isn't about the crime investigation it's just about Alex.Alex's and his little brother's father has moved out and their parents are getting divorced not an easy thing to deal with. What's most important in Alex's life right now? His involvement in accidental homicide? His parents' divorce? A girl who want to have sex with him before he's ready? Paranoid Parka test of skateboarding manhood? The movie shows all these things competing for attention in Alex's world.Teenage boys tend to be somewhat opaque. The movie is true to that. Certainly Alex never shows others any sign of anxiety. He's cool as a cucumber but without being hard. His face is gentle almost pretty. He's simply a teenage boy. Van Sant working from Blake Nelson's novel set in Portland like the film gets that right. Some of the dialogue is hilariously authentic teenage talk. And after Jennifer and Alex have had sex she is immediately offscreen on her cell phone to her best girlfriend saying We did it we totally did it. It was awesome! You could laugh so hard you'd cry. But the movie creeps up on you it's so understated. There is a lot of use of music. When Alex drives his mother's car to the skate park alone that evening he looks like a child behind the wheel different music plays from rap to Beethoven's Ninth and Alex's expressions change with each change of sound as if to express a boy's sudden shifts of mood.Paranoid Park has a gruesome moment but as should be clear by now it's generally notable for its subtlety and restraint as was even Elephant considering.Van Sant follows the format of his last three films Gerry Elephant and Last Days and draws his actors mostly from Portland high schools as he did for Elephant. This time the cinematography is by Christopher Doyle. Doyle is associated with the blurry kinetic effects in Wong Kar Wai films but he's worked with static shots and with other directors. His skill pays off in beautiful visuals throughout the gift for flowing movement shown in the recurrent skateboarding sequenceswhich don't go so much for showy runs as for cool idiosyncratic moments.Despite shifts in subject matter and DP Van Sant's last four films are notable for consistency and quality and a return to his indie roots. This is more interior as a psychological study cryptic though it may be than the other filmsand less attentiongetting too. Gerry but has anyone seen it? is notable for its amazing realtime effects as it explores the horror of getting lost in the desert. Elephant leads up to a Colombinestyle school massacre and is the opposite of Paranoid Park because it's a multiviewpoint event film. Last Days is a dreamy mood piece about a doomed rock star fading into isolation and madness a la Kurt Cobain. Paranoid Park has a terrible event at its center too but approaches it crabwise. The film could be a TV movieoftheweek perhaps with a breathless moralistic finale. It's all in the style. Van Sant's distinctive touch is both in the elegantly offhand taletelling and in the quiet finish. In a sense it's a movie about forgiveness.Seen at the NYFF October 2007.".

	schema:reviewBody "Gus Van Sant continues his trend of making dreamy artsy moodpieces with Paranoid Park a film about a skateboarding teen who accidentally causes the death of a security guard. In some ways it almost feels like a continuation of Elephant where kids are shot walking through school hallways in slow motion here photographed by the legendary Christopher Doyle and their actions and reactions are observed quietly. No no literal shooting in those hallways this time thank God just the thick sense of guilt weighing down on young Alex Gabe Nevins. From what I had read about this film I had gathered that it was about a disaffected teenager who doesn't really care about the death he caused and reading some words written over Paranoid Park it seems that that is a common interpretation which I think is entirely incorrect. Van Sant thankfully isn't going the don't teenagers suck? route that many filmmakers would probably go. Alex is depicted as a boy wounded and who understands what he has wrought. Van Sant perfectly captures that high school feeling of being lost in your own life visualized in gorgeous footage of skateboarders dreamily gliding up ramps and walls. The chronology is disassembled but not quite in the same Bla Tarrinspired way as it was in the director's previous two films. Disassembled chronology is becoming quite a clich nowadays but a director like Van Sant knows how to use it how it adds to the mood and meaning of the picture.".

	schema:reviewBody "I really wanted to like this film especially after all the buzz I'd heard revolving around it. But sadly it just didn't work for me. Paranoid Park suffers from the same delusion Lost In Translation didIf you use very little dialogue be heavy on the slow motion close ups and concentrate on pieces of fabric in the setting then your story will magically come across as deep and thoughtful. Much of the plot line if you can find a plot of this film is contrived. I wasn't impressed with the 'write it all down' confessional being the way the protagonist deals with the accidentSo what are we supposed to believe? He grew up happily ever after and wrote a book about his experiences thus was vindicated for that horrific incident?What is I suspect supposed to be a film that evokes empathy for a young man who is directionless and faced with an impossible moral quandary instead creates a portrait of a future sociopathic personality. He has no connection to anyone around him and by the end of the film has no real sense of what is right or wrong. He has no direction at home and feels nothing for his friends. What we have is a portrait of a nonperson a spirit that merely coasts through life as he weaves his way along on his skateboard. I don't feel for him at all and honestly I wish he'd been caught. The entire film centres not necessarily on his feelings of guilt but on how he is going to avoid punishment andor accountability for a bad decision. He not only gets away with it he finds a way to subtly rationalise it. Quite a frightening negative message the suggestion being that so many of our youth are so disconnected from right and twrong that they simply make up the rules as they go along serving themselves for good or ill. I find it an insulting treatsie on today's youth and the pretentious arrogance of the filmmaker drips thick with every plodding overthought step and shifting eye.He did murder the guard but if you blink your eyes you miss it. Whether it was an act of mercy or not is hard to sayit could be he was so mortified he lashed out with his skateboard. When he runs to the security guard's car one of the wheels of his skateboard is stained with blood. ".

Quite a frightening negative message the suggestion being that so many of our youth are so disconnected from right and twrong that they simply make up the rules as they go along serving themselves for good or ill. I find it an insulting treatsie on today's youth and the pretentious arrogance of the filmmaker drips thick with every plodding overthought step and shifting eye.He did murder the guard but if you blink your eyes you miss it. Whether it was an act of mercy or not is hard to sayit could be he was so mortified he lashed out with his skateboard. When he runs to the security guard's car one of the wheels of his skateboard is stained with blood. ";

I've never been a fan of Gus Van Sant and as part of what previous posters have described as the new youth generation i was very disappointed and slightly angry at the stereotypical depiction of the characters in the film especially as they were used to string along the film's ridiculous storyline which is pretty much enforcing to the viewing masses that skateboarders are social rejects and should be blamed for crimes. As a skater myself i watch a lot of skate films and the filming during the skate scenes which is obviously a major part of the plot as the lead protagonist is a skateboarder was awful and Bourne identity esquire shaky camera technique was used with slow motion to give a horrible effect. This film is just full of ridiculous stereotypes as shown by the 'emo' soundtrack which just adds to the media myth that all skateboarders are white rockers. Simply just a really bad film.".

More psychological portrait than straight forward narrative the film is told after the fact as our hero writes of the events in a journal.This is a good but I don't think a great film. The film had appeared on some Top Ten lists for last year and I'm left scratching my head as to whats that all about. Its not that good over all. To be certain if I had been a teen of similar age or into skateboarding I might have liked it more but it never really clicked for me. There are lots of segments of the film as we watch the kids skate around Seattle. If you ask me what I remember about the film its the skating which seems to go on and on and on. They aren't bad and the images of the skating are nicely presented with some off beat music choices there are just too many of them for my tastes. I do understand that this is what this kids life is but it was too much for this viewer. Many reviews talk about the horrible accident that the plot revolves around. It is a nasty bit of business and not for the faint of heart.5 out of 10. better in pieces rather than a whole.My reaction at the end was thats it? Ultimately not my cup of tea".

	schema:reviewBody "Gus Van Sant's ongoing exploration of the lot of disaffected teens continues with this slow dreamlike study of a typical teenager newcomer Gabe Nevins whose life is thrown into emotional turmoil when he accidentally kills a security guard.This film has a number of strengths and weaknesses. Perhaps its biggest strength is the commendable ordinariness of its teens they could be your kids your brother or sister your friends you their every thought and action isn't predetermined by an overpowering desire to get laid they're not prone to playing pranks on one another or their teachers and they're not getting drunk or taking drugs at every opportunity. They have pointless conversations that go nowhere the aspects of the world they consider unimportant are instinctively exiled to the edges of their consciousness and they are not yet infected with the overbearing urge to get on in life. Alex the film's focal point wanders aimlessly through his life the impact of his accidental killing of a security guard barely monitoring on his blank features.The film also wanders also apparently aimlessly for much of its brief running time. Van Sant employs a nonlinear chronology to tell his tale a device that has very quickly become overused and that in most cases adds little or nothing to the impact of the fractured story it describes. Here scenes that don't make a lot of sense the first time we see them are replayed later on once the chronological gaps have been filled. It's like pieces of a jigsaw falling into place  but it also smells suspiciously of a director with not much material on his hands using every trick he can think of to elongate material that doesn't really add up to more than 45 minutes screen time. In addition to the same scenes playing twice Van Sant also treats us to long and frequent slow motion sequences of nothing in particular schoolkids walking through their school's corridors Alex's friend driving his car kids at the eponymous skateboard park showing their stuff in grainy 8mm. It all adds a dreamy detached feel to things that pulls you in with its mesmerising repetition in the same way that the fluent alert sections of the mind might yield to some particularly strong grass only without dulling the senses.The isolation of all youth  from whatever generation  is succinctly captured in Alex's plight the extremity of his situation perversely succeeding in pinpointing teen angst rather than generalising it. I can't really decide whether Nevins is terrific or just terrifically bad. His face is an impenetrable mask almost permanently blank and his lines are delivered in a monotone that captures the inflections or lack of of youth. All this might have been what he was told to do or might just be the best he can muster in terms of acting ability. Either way his character provokes responses that range from sympathy to exasperation in the viewer which ultimately leave you wishing you could step inside the story to bang a few heads together and get things moving.Fans of Van Sant will probably love this film but very few neutral viewers will be converted to his style of moviemaking.".

	schema:reviewBody "Gus Van Sant's latest film is to some extent his most accomplished to date but in other ways it will leave the viewer alienated and flat maybe on purpose. It tells the story of skater Alex whose life unravels when he is involved in an accident with a security guard. Fans of Van Sant will spot all his trademark stylings from the empty almost haunting school corridors of 'Elephant' through to his use of slow motion and an Elliot Smith heavy soundtrack. But its in the things you don't see that gives this film its 'paranoia' conversations shown only from one angle overlaying speech in the wrong places or playing music to mask over important conversations there are times when it genuinely feels quite unnerving as the story which isn't told straight unweaves to its conclusion. Van Sant has used no real actors for the film and instead enlisted real skaters mostly found from Myspace so don't expect the acting to be brilliant but it does give a sense of 'real' to the proceedings and of course they can skate which makes the dreamlike sequences around the parks all the better. Sant treads familiar ground in the themes explored but the film itself seems to flow and feel more matured than his earlier works and it has the ability to hold the viewer in a tight grip of suspense even when the pay off is finally revealed about half way through. This won't be to everyone's taste but don't let the skating put you off there's not that much in it and you would miss an understated little thriller if you decided to not give it a go. Put into context with Van Sant's body of work this is another teen trip down Alienation Avenue stopping at disenfranchised close and finally ending up at Paranoid Park. Haunting and scarily believable this is a very watchable film that will for what ever reason leave you cold.".

	schema:headline " Life of George";
	schema:reviewBody "Of course you'd have to be a fan to really appreciate Martin Scorcese's extensive re telling of the life and times of George Harrison but I am and so I presume was everyone at the sold out screening of the movie tonight at the Glasgow Film Theatre. More assembled than directed of course Scorcese takes us through the highs and occasional lows of the man's life without signposting anything too obviously so that the near fourhour viewing time rarely drags it was broken by a halfhour intermission at the showing I attended and I found myself rapt with attention. The film starts with a typically humorous modest and elusive appearance by George seen between the flowers in his massive garden at Friar's Park which mansion features so extensively in the footage shown that it should almost get a credit too. From there Scorcese takes us on a linear journey dwelling on the major events in his life without markedly signposting the passage of time at any point which I think helped the flow of the film. There was much archive photography and video footage which even a diehard like me hadn't seen before and the interviewees are well chosen and well edited although I was surprised that say Jeff Lynne or Michael Palin didn't get a lookin although maybe Marty thought re. the latter that the presence of two other Pythons Eric Idle and Terry Gilliam was enough. The best of the interviewees are probably Gillam Ringo and George's widow while the resemblance to his son Dhani is quite uncanny. The shock appearance of a now incarcerated Phil Spector looking ridiculous in his wig of the day is controversial and prompted gales of laughter amongst the Glasgow crowd but he's actually surprisingly lucid. Yes perhaps Scorcese dwells too much on the Beatles time and omits his output from 1973 to 1988 almost totally  it was a mistake surely to not mark the sequence on Lennon's murder without playing even a snatch of All Those Years Ago and likewise to make no reference at all to his comeback hit single Got My Mind Set On You and parent album Cloud Nine. Even so while some may argue as to whether Harrison's own legacy deserves this Scorcese tribute in the wake of the great director's other recent homages to Dylan and the Stones the fact that the audience I was among thought enough of what they had watched to spontaneously applaud at the end tells its own story I think. As we near the tenth anniversary of his untimely death I certainly enjoyed the movie and left convinced that George was a decent not perfect man who while he may he have been the third most talented of the four Beatles was more than worthy of this sincere and entertaining tribute.".

	onyx:emotionText "Of course you'd have to be a fan to really appreciate Martin Scorcese's extensive re telling of the life and times of George Harrison but I am and so I presume was everyone at the sold out screening of the movie tonight at the Glasgow Film Theatre. More assembled than directed of course Scorcese takes us through the highs and occasional lows of the man's life without signposting anything too obviously so that the near fourhour viewing time rarely drags it was broken by a halfhour intermission at the showing I attended and I found myself rapt with attention. The film starts with a typically humorous modest and elusive appearance by George seen between the flowers in his massive garden at Friar's Park which mansion features so extensively in the footage shown that it should almost get a credit too. From there Scorcese takes us on a linear journey dwelling on the major events in his life without markedly signposting the passage of time at any point which I think helped the flow of the film. There was much archive photography and video footage which even a diehard like me hadn't seen before and the interviewees are well chosen and well edited although I was surprised that say Jeff Lynne or Michael Palin didn't get a lookin although maybe Marty thought re. the latter that the presence of two other Pythons Eric Idle and Terry Gilliam was enough. The best of the interviewees are probably Gillam Ringo and George's widow while the resemblance to his son Dhani is quite uncanny. The shock appearance of a now incarcerated Phil Spector looking ridiculous in his wig of the day is controversial and prompted gales of laughter amongst the Glasgow crowd but he's actually surprisingly lucid. Yes perhaps Scorcese dwells too much on the Beatles time and omits his output from 1973 to 1988 almost totally  it was a mistake surely to not mark the sequence on Lennon's murder without playing even a snatch of All Those Years Ago and likewise to make no reference at all to his comeback hit single Got My Mind Set On You and parent album Cloud Nine. Even so while some may argue as to whether Harrison's own legacy deserves this Scorcese tribute in the wake of the great director's other recent homages to Dylan and the Stones the fact that the audience I was among thought enough of what they had watched to spontaneously applaud at the end tells its own story I think. As we near the tenth anniversary of his untimely death I certainly enjoyed the movie and left convinced that George was a decent not perfect man who while he may he have been the third most talented of the four Beatles was more than worthy of this sincere and entertaining tribute.";

	schema:reviewBody "I have never made a secret of the fact that I am a fan of the Beatles always have been and always will be. So when I heard that Martin Scorsese was making a documentary about the life of George Harrison you can guess I was a tad more than interested. Knowing it was very unlikely to air at my local cinema I was resigned to either waiting for the DVD release or for it to air on TV in about a years' time. Imagine my surprise when those nice people at the BBC aired it over the weekend of November 12th13th 2011! Here's a bit about it before I give you my thoughts.Using archive footage much of which I had never seen before and interviews with his friends and family we are taken through the ups and downs of the life and times of this quiet guitar player from Liverpool. From the early days of the Beatles through to their demise in the late 60's and then on through his solo career. We hear about how he came to finance a Monty Python film his love of Indian mysticism his love of motorsport and the many many friends he made along the way. How he formed a little group called The Traveling Wilburys and how they brought him a little success later in his career. It goes right up to his death from cancer in 2001.It's a very touching and heartfelt tribute to a man who had an impact on so many lives whether it be through his music or in some other way. I must say I enjoyed it very much although at just short of three and a half hours it is pretty long! It's beautifully put together with just about the right mix of archive footage intercut with interviews. Some of the people who appear are several Pythons John Lennon archive footage Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr Georges' wife Olivia and his son Dhani who really looks like him Eric Clapton Ravi Shankar Tom Petty and Phil Spector. At some stage I will definitely invest in the DVD of this documentary it's really worth a look for any Beatles fan or any fan of music for that matter Just be warned that despite a 'U' certificate there is a little swearing. Over all Highly Recommended but VERY long.My score 9.210 IMDb Score 8.310 based on 722 votes at the time of going to press.".

	schema:headline " a fascinating engrossing insightful exhaustively researched and revealing documentary";
	schema:reviewBody "From Oscar winning director Martin Scorsese comes this epic superbly crafted documentary exploring the personal and professional life times and musical legacy of former Beatle George Harrison who died in 2001. The youngest of the Beatles Harrison's own talents as a guitarist and songwriter were often overshadowed by Lennon and McCartney. It was only after the band split up that his abilities were recognised. Even Frank Sinatra called Harrison's Something one of the greatest love songs written. As with No Direction Home his epic 208minute 2005 documentary about Bob Dylan Scorsese's Living In The Material World is a revealing comprehensive portrait of Harrison and is essential viewing for fans. The film is also suffused with an obvious love for Harrison and his music and there are plenty of familiar tunes sprinkled throughout the documentary. Indeed it is easy to forget how many wonderful songs Harrison actually wrote. The film has been painstaking researched. Scorsese draws upon a wealth of photographs rarely seen archival footage home videos diary entries and interviews to round out this picture of a gentle humble artistic man eternally searching for inner peace. There is no voice over narration. Rather the intimate biographical details are teased out through a series of extensive intimate interviews with Harrison himself his wife of thirty years Olivia and his son Dhani. There are also wonderful anecdotes from the likes of Paul McCartney Ringo Starr Eric Clapton Terry Gilliam and famed record producer Phil Spector recorded before his arrest and well publicised murder trial. What emerges is a picture of a selfeffacing man a consummate professional who approached everything he did with passion. There is plenty of information during the first part about the Beatles and their early years in the red light district of Berlin at the start of the 60's the overwhelming success of the band and the creative tensions that eventually led to the split. The second part of the film looks in detail at Harrison's fascination with Indian mysticism and spirituality and the religious and spiritual transformation which would consume him in later years and shape much of his direction. There is plenty of detail about his postBeatles solo career his reclusive nature his collaborations with Ravi Shankar and the Concert for Bangladesh which was the first celebrity organised star studded benefit concert. The film even looks at his involvement in the film industry through Handmade Films the production company he set up to make films that he wanted to see. Through this company Harrison produced some of the classics of British cinema including Life Of Brian cult classic Withnail And I and The Long Good Friday. The film is so comprehensive that it even covers the time when Harrison was stabbed while fighting off a home invader just a couple of years before his death. However Scorsese brushes over his drug use and his womanising although the romantic triangle between himself his first wife Patti and Eric Clapton is explored. It is a little surprising that there is not even a brief mention of the protracted legal proceedings over his song My Sweet Lord. Like all good documentaries Living In The Material World transcends its subject matter and has broad appeal even to those who are not fans of Harrison or his music. Don't be daunted by the 208minute running time either. Living In The Material World is such a fascinating engrossing insightful exhaustively researched and revealing documentary that you are not conscious of the length or the passing of time.".

As with No Direction Home his epic 208minute 2005 documentary about Bob Dylan Scorsese's Living In The Material World is a revealing comprehensive portrait of Harrison and is essential viewing for fans. The film is also suffused with an obvious love for Harrison and his music and there are plenty of familiar tunes sprinkled throughout the documentary. Indeed it is easy to forget how many wonderful songs Harrison actually wrote. The film has been painstaking researched. Scorsese draws upon a wealth of photographs rarely seen archival footage home videos diary entries and interviews to round out this picture of a gentle humble artistic man eternally searching for inner peace. There is no voice over narration. Rather the intimate biographical details are teased out through a series of extensive intimate interviews with Harrison himself his wife of thirty years Olivia and his son Dhani. There are also wonderful anecdotes from the likes of Paul McCartney Ringo Starr Eric Clapton Terry Gilliam and famed record producer Phil Spector recorded before his arrest and well publicised murder trial. What emerges is a picture of a selfeffacing man a consummate professional who approached everything he did with passion. There is plenty of information during the first part about the Beatles and their early years in the red light district of Berlin at the start of the 60's the overwhelming success of the band and the creative tensions that eventually led to the split. The second part of the film looks in detail at Harrison's fascination with Indian mysticism and spirituality and the religious and spiritual transformation which would consume him in later years and shape much of his direction. There is plenty of detail about his postBeatles solo career his reclusive nature his collaborations with Ravi Shankar and the Concert for Bangladesh which was the first celebrity organised star studded benefit concert. The film even looks at his involvement in the film industry through Handmade Films the production company he set up to make films that he wanted to see. Through this company Harrison produced some of the classics of British cinema including Life Of Brian cult classic Withnail And I and The Long Good Friday. The film is so comprehensive that it even covers the time when Harrison was stabbed while fighting off a home invader just a couple of years before his death. However Scorsese brushes over his drug use and his womanising although the romantic triangle between himself his first wife Patti and Eric Clapton is explored. It is a little surprising that there is not even a brief mention of the protracted legal proceedings over his song My Sweet Lord. Like all good documentaries Living In The Material World transcends its subject matter and has broad appeal even to those who are not fans of Harrison or his music. Don't be daunted by the 208minute running time either. Living In The Material World is such a fascinating engrossing insightful exhaustively researched and revealing documentary that you are not conscious of the length or the passing of time.";

I totally understand the issues people express about this film long without being either balanced or comprehensive curiously silent on some key events perhaps Olivia Harrison's wishes are a factor here? missing some key points of view though getting Dylan for example to talk about anything in a useful way is notoriously difficult. But I feel I must address a couple of points raised. 1. Re Concert for Bangladesh. The amount raised by the concert itself was about a quarter of a million dollars. Sales of the iterations of the album and the movie raised about 12 million to be administered by UNICEF. The money DID go to refugee relief BUT was delayed by 11 years because of the failure of organizers to apply for taxexempt status. So... bad planning but not a scam or a failure. 2. Re Harrison's relative contribution to the Beatles. On the one hand the evidence is quite clear that Ringo was far more crucial to the Beatles sound in the studio than Harrison  the band simply did not function well with any other drummer rumors of McCartney sitting in are based on photos not the meticulous records kept by Abbey Road when Ringo quit for 6 weeks in 1968 numerous replacements including Ginger Baker were tried and no one was able to provide the subtle and generous and dare I say feminine approach that the Beatles suddenly discovered was a key ingredient in their process causing them to beg for his return. Harrison was great at coming up with carefully planned often doubletracked parts which added beauty and flavor at a higher level than McCartney or Lennon could offer the 15 seconds or so of Harrison on Getting Better e.g. truly makes the recording. But he was an indifferent electric rhythm guitar player in my opinion. His songs were only occasionally as good as LM's however there is no denying the fact attested to by Martin Parsons and others that Harrison got short shrift in studio time to realize his ideas. It is essential to keep in mind that LM were given INCREDIBLE amounts of time for the era virtually unlimited takes after 1965 to get the basic tracks right and then to try dozens of approaches to the sweetening and vocals. Harrison was never given this opportunity until the last two real albums produced White Album and Abbey Road and suddenly his work shows a massive uptick in quality both of writing and execution Savoy Truffle Piggies Something Long Long Long Here Comes the Sun While My Guitar Gently Weeps  all of these outclass his earlier work by miles. It can't be a coincidence that once the Beatles essentially stopped being a team and became each others' session players Harrison flourished. Also worth noting that he produced the first truly satisfying album as a solo artist All Things Must Pass  overly long but a big hit and a good listen using in part songs he had been carrying around for a few years. With regard to the contradictions between his lifestyle and his purported spiritual values  in what way is this unusual or even notable? Seems like standard operating procedure for entertainment celebrities to either need a frame of selfjustification or to have trouble avoiding the temptations of riches or both. I obviously appreciate Harrison's work but I'm not an uncritical fan  his middle period of solo work is pretty awful just a few songs are keepers and even Cloud Nine is really a few good songs surrounded by oddly paced indifferently written material. His last album Brainwashed is weird but really interesting and at a higher level lyrically than anything he had done since All Things Must Pass. He was who he was not a genius on the level of LM but an ingredient in their recorded output that would be sorely missed were we somehow able to remove it. And there is an argument that his presence and his influence enriched the Beatles philosophically lyrically and musically. They were very competitive if George was spiritual well by jove they were going to be spiritual too. A thin veneer of spirituality perhaps on lives that were primarily about fame and money and art but again an ingredient that if not present would have made the Beatles a very different band.".

	schema:reviewBody "George Harrison Living in a Material World 2011 12 out of 4Considering some of the movies that director Martin Scorsese has made you'd think that he'd be the wrong person to tell the life story of George Harrison but after viewing this mammoth documentary it's easy to see why the two went together. This documentary runs 203mintues so it's extremely wrong but it covers just about everything you'd want to know about Harrison. We start off with his brothers talking about what type of kid he was and then we move to his audition for what would become The Beatles. From here we see the bands rise and fall as well as how Harrison decided to go solo with All Things Must Pass. He experiments with drugs are well documentary as is the influence Indian music had on him. The Bangladesh concert his Traveling Wilburys days and his comeback are also discussed before we get to the 1999 home invasion attack as well as his fight with cancer. Among those interviewed are Harrison's widow Olivia Terry Gilliam Paul McCartney Ringo Starr Tom Petty Eric Idle George Martin Eric Clapton Yoko Ono Ravi Shankar and Phil Spector among many others. With such a long running time I went into the film a little worried that there was just going to be too much but I was pleasantly surprised to see how quickly the film went by as it certainly doesn't feel over three hours. What works so well is that there's a clear direction in all the material and it appears that Scorsese wanted to get across that Harrison was constantly searching for something that he could probably only find in death. It's clear from those interviewed that Harrison wanted to experience as much as he can and there's a lot of talk about him preparing himself for death and he wanting to be prepared for when he eventually left his body. I found all of this to be quite fascinating and the real master work from Scorsese comes towards the very end. We get a pretty disturbing story of Harrison being attacked in his home which his widow tells in such a way that you can't help but feel creeped out. Everyone knows that Harrison did eventually die from cancer but I won't ruin how this film ends but lets just say that it's quite powerful. I think the weakest part of the film is some of the stuff dealing with The Beatles simply because we've seen it so many times before. The first part of the film runs 94minutes and goes up to just before the Beatles broke up. Part two clocks in just under twohours and goes from the breakup to Harrison's death and I think this portion of the documentary is the best. Either way fans are certainly going to enjoy all the concert footage rare photos the interviews and of course Harrison gets to speak his own words with some old interviews.".

While this is another documentary about a rockstar icon following along from Scorsese's own The Last Waltz No Direction Home Bob Dylan and Shine a Light it's closest in style and tone to the Dylan doc as a profile of a man of his time and how he lived through it. Unlike Dylan who is a mystery even to the most curious of fans or just one of the more obnoxious depends how you look at it George Harrison seems to be from accounts and interviews to be a man of spiritual and artistic integrity who had various concerns and ideas and he expressed them throughout his life  or if not in the recording studio or as a producer of films then with his garden. One may not be able to find the link between the sarcastic if 'quiet' kid from A Hard Day's Night with an old man in a garden or for that matter the old man having to defend his life against a burglar as he did in 1999 but it's all here.I may not have found Harrison quite as enlightening as Bob Dylan but should he be? Maybe in his own simple way though Scorsese finds a more direct path or personal link to him through the spiritual side. Harrison was someone who found through the Maharishi Indian music transcendental meditation some kind of path through the noise of Western civilization. The clash is what's interesting here and Scorsese knows it too. While the director is fascinated with BIG emotions in his films see anything with De Niro for more on that he's also fascinated how someone operates with a calm demeanor on the surface burning with emotion underneath. Harrison was the guitarist for the Beatles and then when the breakup happened he had to breakoff and find another way. He was still a pop star and his first solo album the great 'All Things Must Pass' went into the top ten of the charts. But how did he reconcile a working class BritishLiverpool upbringing with the teachings of Haria Krishna?Of course the first hour of this massive three 12 hour films are dedicated to him and the Beatles and it's wonderful to see the footage hear the songs find out some details about the songs Harrison wrote for the group i.e. the first song he ever wrote 'If I Needed Someone'. Then the second part is about the spiritual search or what's close to it mixed with the start of the solo career and of course some of the famous tales of romantic highs and lows via Patti and Eric Clapton are included. There's a section for the filmpart of his career where as a man of faith though not exactly it's complicated you see he helped pay the most ever anyone's paid for a movie ticket for Monty Python's Life of Brian. And then about his gardening his second wife Olivia and  kind of a shock to me  the candor which Olivia who was a producer on the film and wrote the book spinoff of the film talks about Harrison's infidelities in their marriage something I really admired and other things like friendships the burglary in 1999 and his untimely passing from cancer.It wouldn't be a Scorsese movie without music and hey it's George Harrison so there's lots of good stuff here sadly for me no 'I Got My Mind Set on You' and there's the director via editor David Tedeschi's marvelous way of navigating the story with music. Watch the opening and how 'All Things Must Pass' goes over the WW2 footage then mixed in with some of the more traditional music of the 1940's period to see some of the brilliance with which Scorsese does this. And the interviews are mostly illuminating and nice once or twice piling on the adulation perhaps as one might expect while still giving some moments for the quirks Harrison had  such as a story Tom Petty tells about ukuleles  and some of his flaws as a man and artist. I'm not sure if for fans the film will shine a whole lot of new light though for newcomers it should provide the bulk of knowhow. What's great about the film ultimately is the thread of the story and how the filmmaker is not afraid to jump around or jump ahead and expect the audience to keep up. It's not as straightthru as say The Beatles Anthology. We're seeing a life in various dimensions timespans and it's as if not more postmodern than the Dylan doc. It's joyous meditative somber happy funny a little daft and a little less than perfect. I can't wait to revisit the life and work.".

First of all it's a really well put together piece  it basically covers every facet of Harrison's life in great detail  there's hardly any aspect of his career that's not mentioned.The film starts off brilliantly with pictures of 1940s wartime with the soundtrack of All Things Must Pass. It's a great start and sets the scene of what's to come. There's also some really cool previously unseen footage of Harrison and McCartney signing the legal papers looks like circa '71 judging by McCartney's hair and there's also a film of the early Beatles gigging at some sort of church hall circa '59.The Beatles years are dealt with brilliantly  great insights from Kircherr and Voorman about the Hamburg days and the film skips nicely along through '63  '67 intercut with great interviews and music. The '67  '70 years are also dealt with really well dealing with Pepper White Album and the eventual breakup. Some of McCartney and Starr's interviews are really insightful.The post Beatles years are dealt with in detail  from All Things Must Pass the Concert for Bangladesh Dark Horse tour Life of Brian Wilbury's and so on. The last twenty minutes or so is perhaps the best  it manages to eclipse Harrison's final years really well with some emotional words from those closest to him. There's some nice touches  Scorsese has the habit of playing a Harrison tune and then cutting it short when you least expect it. The other contributions are also fantastic  Clapton Idle Martin Petty and Jackie Stewart to name a few.Annoyingly something that isn't even mentioned is the 'He's So FineMy Sweet Lord' plagiarism lawsuit. Seen as this was a big deal in Harrison's life it seems really bizarre it wasn't included. Also there weren't any Lennon interviews of him talking about Harrison  this would have been a nice addition. Another omission was any mention of his Cloud Nine album. If you're making a documentary that's three and a half hours long you'd think these sorts of things would have been included.All in all it's a great documentary. It felt very long in the cinema even with a break but I don't see this as a negative at all  the film benefits from it. It'll probably suit watching on DVD more  in summary a great documentary a truly fitting tribute to George Harrison. And all I want to do now is play his records...".

	schema:reviewBody "Let me state this from the off I've got a lot of respect for Martin Scorsese. And I'm a big George Harrison fan.But I was so bored of this documentary that I had to leave it an hour and a half through.The biggest problem? There was no narrative. No flow. You're given no overarching journey or picture at all and no purpose or drive to what unfolds. It was assumed you knew the story anyway and so it was simply ignored I can't imagine how confusing someone unfamiliar with the Beatles would've found the section about Astrid Kirchherr and their Hamburg days. Even to fans like myself it was told in a way that was insubstantial and unclear That you're told Stuart Sutcliffe's death was difficult before you've even been introduced to him or told his relation to anyone else is one example of this.The story was told in isolated blocks  ten minutes of George and the Beatles coping with screaming fans and hotel rooms. Followed by ten minutes of them entering the studio.  and it didn't work. Not only did it disconnect things that were actually intimately entwined but it removed any sense of development. Things were presented in a roughly chronological way but not such that any of it felt meaningful. This and then This rather than This and therefore This.It was as though someone had made two checklists one of Events and the other of Footage and they just indiscriminately filed all of the latter into the arbitrary structure of the former.Some of the cuts also stood out never a good sign for a cut anyway as really poorly done  music stopping abruptly as we cut to a talking head or a scene with an older George inexplicably squashed in amongst something utterly different Did it cast those shots in a different light? Reframe the meaning recast the subject? No.Another real disappointment was the failure of the documentary to convey any atmosphere sense of place or sense of character. Who was George Harrison? What were his relationships like? Nothing came across. Or how about the places and the mood of their existence be it in hotels or the studio or during his childhood or in India or...again the documentary was empty vacant frustrating. This was partly due to the talking heads who didn't offer any insights or anecdotes beyond their own selfimportance Eric Clapton calling himself a lone wolf was inadvertently hilarious though but also due to the disconnected inexpressive editing.My overriding thought throughout was Man this is really poorly done. I didn't expect that I was entering this film full of excitement. But after an hour and a half of time and again catching myself saying it I decided enough was enough. A real disappointment one of the messiest dullest directionless documentaries I've seen in a long time. The subject matter deserves a much better more sensitive meaningful treatment.".

	schema:reviewBody "may seems like a sad song to you a song about a man that laments everything. But into looking through George Harrison's soulful deep dark stare I realize the man was lamenting what he had become and the man he could potentially be while everyone around him told him he should be one way or another. He was a very different Beatle. He was not as big as John Lennon or Paul Mc Cartney but he was a little hidden talent who worked behind the scenes more than anything he was the man behind the curtains who liked to look from aside or look at the Beatles as an outsider very self conscious of where his life was headed but having a strong sense of self a strong sense of what he wanted his music to carry this sweet spiritual side of him that could not be contained inside this phenomenon that was the Beatles.In the opening scenes of Living in the Material World the new HBO documentary directed by Martin Scorsese we take an unusual look at the most enigmatic Beatle the one that was not always in front of the newscasts the reporters he was no newspaper headlines material as John and Paul were which helped him create his own sound and his own songs that graced some of the Beatles albums such as Revolver's Taxman White Album's While My Guitar Gently Weeps or Abbey Road's Something and Here Comes The Sun which became some of The Beatles' most recognizable and beloved songs of their careers. We also meet a man who became more spiritual and embraced Indian culture and Hinduism with his friend and sitar player Ravi Shankar who appears in the documentary numerous times and was such an influence in both his music and his own life gave a complete twist. He saw something deeper than any of the Beatles had something that he was searching for something so unique and exquisite that he spent many hours listening to Ravi play his sitar and teaching him the techniques to perfect the art. George Harrison was like a sponge absorbing every little essence he could from Ravi and the Indian culture that he even introduced some of this music into The Beatles with songs like The Inner Light Revolver's Love You To and Tomorrow Never Knows and the incredibly ahead of its time Sgt. Pepper's Within You Without You which in my opinion brought The Beatles to a status that had never achieved before. At least first time I heard Within You Without You I thought to myself what does it mean? How does it come into play into my life? It didn't need translation it transcended everything and the answer was always there look inside yourself and there you will find peace you didn't need no temple no clergy no middle man just you and God.George Harrison was idolized by the hippie movement of the 60's which in this documentary he admittedly despised one weekend he spent with them was all he needed to realize it was not what he was looking for this world of drugs peace and love was not what he was searching for and he knew he had to meditate more as to where he wanted to go spiritually and artistically.It's funny that he said that in this documentary himself since I thought for the longest time that he was a hippie himself a man who took to drugs and experimented with a sitar and period that was it. In Living In The Material World I have rediscovered why I've always loved The Beatles so much they're not just four lads from Liverpool that created the best singles of the 60's and were musically talented but now also I see a side of them I hadn't really come to think about before. There was something very interesting that was said during this doc he basically says for a man that has everything they handed him anything he wished for anything he ever wanted anything within his reach he could have but if you have emptiness in your heart and soul then you're still not a rich person and you cannot take it with you. In life everything we own that is material is worth nothing when we leave our bodies and what George Harrison did constantly was to prepare himself mentally and spiritually for that moment in which he had to leave his body for his next adventure. I'm sure that wherever he is he's playing his sitar contemplating how much he'd accomplished how much he's left behind his legacy his family his garden. Boy was he ever so proud of that garden.".

	schema:headline " Almost excessively long but worth a watch";
	schema:reviewBody "So yeah this thing's really really long. Definitely longer than it needs to be but at the same time it makes the film stand out at least. Differentiates itself from the pack for me I guess given I've never personally watched a music documentary this long. George Harrison was always the most mysterious spiritual of all The Beatles so if a nearly 3 and a half hour documentary had to be made about one of them that's a fairly good reason to I suppose. About half of the film here will be very familiar to most Beatles fans as the first half largely focuses on one of the biggest music phenomenons of all time. Thankfully the extra focus on George Harrison during the film's first half means this familiar story does not feel entirely stale or redundant. The second half is less straight forward and more interesting too I think focusing on George Harrison's solo career and postBeatles endeavors. However it's also somewhat inconsistent. I found certain sections moving and engrossing whilst feeling that some other sections dragged on longer than needed. One final minor complaint would be what I thought was some dodgy editing in parts. Often when they played a Beatles or George Harrison song the music would cut off abruptly when it transitioned to an interview or someone talking about said song. I found it jarring every time this happened and kept wondering whether it was some strange stylistic choice that I just wasn't getting. Anyway if I'm sounding overly negative I'm sorry. I shouldn't be because this was still pretty good and I've certainly experienced many other movies of a similar length that did feel longer than this. I guess it might be a little disappointing considering this is one of the best directors of all time Scorsese making a documentary on a member of one of the greatest bands of all time. Still it's good all things considered. Certainly recommended just maybe lower your expectations a tad and definitely don't feel like you have to watch the whole thing in one go either.".

	schema:reviewBody "I will always go out of my way to see the work of certain actors and directors  a select few who in my opinion can do no wrong. I will always watch an Al Pacino or a De Niro film  even if it is a bad one as by their very presence they will somehow drag it out of the mundane and make it a pleasurable experience.One of my favourite directors is Martin Scorsese and to me he can do no wrong ever since I saw Taxi Driver all those years ago. Since then he has followed up with masterpieces such as Goodfellas Casino and Gangs of New York. Recently his production and directorial contributions to the TV series Boardwalk Empire has elevated it to the echelons of all time TV greats such as The Sopranos. Scorsese also has also directed a number of notable documentaries through the years almost always connected in some way to his love of music and music performers. His latest about the life of the Beatle George Harrison is a feast for the eyes.To Beatles fans lovers of popular music or just someone interested in the life and times of this fascinating and talented man this documentary is a 'must see'. I sat down to watch it at around 10 p.m and sat transfixed hardly realising that the clock was almost at the hour of 2 a.m by the time the final credits rolled down the screen  along with a few tears rolling down my cheeks There is no narrator  no quoting of dates or facts  just a cinematic account of the life of George from his earliest days in the Beatles right up to the day of his death from cancer in 2001. The story is 'told' through mainly previously unseen footage and magical interviews with so many friends and family who knew him and lived through the same life and times as he did. I have a new respect for Paul and Ringo who clearly gave very honest heartfelt and sometimes surprisingly vulnerable accounts of themselves and their relationships with George and their times with him  both good and bad. There many others Eric Clapton John Lennon both of George's wives Eric Idle Terry Gilliam Tom Petty Phil Spector Yoko Ono Jackie Stewart and so many more. Some of these people were interviewed especially for the film and other interviews were taken from archive footage much of it never seen before. At the top of the list of interviewees is George himself speaking from his very early Beatle days almost up to the time of his death. George was a fascinating man who lived a very full life from his music to his film production to his love of cars to garden design and to his almost fanatical involvement in Indian mysticism and transmeditation. Through the years this quiet but highly charismatic person acquired an incredible array of devoted friends from all walks of life. I particularly loved the videos of the impromptu sessions shot at Bob Dylan's home recording studio in New York when members of the 'Travelling Wilburys' George Tom petty Bob Dylan Jeff Lynne and Roy Orbison collaborated on a new song. It is pure magic. But there again there are so many magical moments. This wonderful documentary is a film not to be missed.".

I'd say Part 2 was better than Part 1.I like George Harrison but I didn't know enough about him to really keep track on who a few of the people were in the film. I would have been nice for them to have been introduced somehow. It just seemed like the doco was bits of stuff just stuck together and wasn't overly coherent. Lennon's death and Harrison's reaction to it was barely touched on. It was quite all quite clinical and unmoving.If you want to see a documentary done very well see SENNA. Living in a Material World pales in comparison. After watching Senna I was speechless for about an hour and it has effected me ever since. Living in Material World? Well it didn't even really effect me while watching it. While leaving this movie I wished that Senna had gone for the same length as this movie and that Living in a Material World had gone for less than 2.Living in the Material World is not a fitting tribute to a great man.".

Absolutely uninteresting crumbles of thoughts.Who hired those talented 'cinematographers' who managed to photograph all those persons in the most boring surroundings with the fugliest lighting imaginable?Why would not one try to shed some light unto the discrepancy between George's 'my sweet lord' holiness and his constant drug abuse? Anything just anything that would make one get closer to his soul and his character?And on and on  it's a terribly missed opportunity but I'm sure Mr. Scorsese was well paid for this hack job.Resume some interesting historical footage  but all in all 'uninspired' to say it in a kind way.";

He mounts his search by stapling notices to every telephone pole in town from his bike which is how he meets Mili. As the year progresses he sees Boris' romance follow the same pattern as his own twentyfive years ago.";

Would you clone a dead loved one if you could?  These are issues that we ourselves will have to be facing and making decisions on in the not so distant future.Virginia Madsen is nice as the love interest.  Vincent Spano wonderfully plays Igor to Peter O'Toole's Frankenstein while maintaining a mind of his own.  Mariel Hemingway is delightfully nutty and light as Meli the coed nymphomaniac.  Interesting surprise from her during a touch football game too.  And those of you who are MASH fans will love David Ogden Stiers as the foil for Peter O'Toole's mad scientist hijinx.This movie is refreshing and dramatic and subtle.  I love it I will always love it!  And it still moves me after almost 2 decades!BTWThose of you who appreciate soundtracks will love this one!  The String Trio Rock by Mark Cargill is interspersed throughout.  It will stay with you even after the movie is over!".

	schema:reviewBody "Have you ever seen a movie that made a quiet yet profound impact on your view of life? Have you ever seen a powerful performance from one of the world's best actors go so completely unnoticed in the process? Have you ever looked back on a film nearly 20 years later and think I hope I can find this on DVD? Creator is one such movie. Peter O'Toole's performance is one of his better efforts Come to think of it even a BAD effort by O'Toole would be head and shoulders above some of today's stars. As Harry you quickly learn and more importantly FEEL his pain and loss of his beloved wife Lucy years after her loss. But he has what he feels is a perfect plan to clone her and recreate the love of his life. Mariel Hemingway's character Meli is the LAST person you would expect a scholar such as Harry would choose to be the host to carry the new Lucy to term. Hemingway's performance was a hoot. The story takes some twists and turns that include a side story that nearly supersedes the principal one. But the beauty ultimately is how the two complement each other. Getting through this movie is an emotional rollercoaster the kind where when the ride is over you go WHEW! But then again you don't want it to end. The gift of this film is that when the lights came up at the end it sent me back to reality with a different perspective that truly IS a gift.Did the movie change my life? Perhaps not but it gave me a message that enabled me to change it myself. I think one of the reasons the movie came off so well in addition of course to a brilliant performance by the cast was that the script was written by the creator of the novel... so it stayed as true to the story as any adaptation can.Kudos to O'Toole and the entire cast. But Kudos too to writer Jeremy Leven Creator's creator and director Ivan Passer who brought the story to the screen so lovingly... and entertainingly. Yes this is one I want on my DVD shelf! If you've not seen it do yourself a favor Rent it and watch it with someone special. To paraphrase Leven Movies Can Be Wonderful... and Creator shows you how.".

	schema:reviewBody "Actually three love stories in one. There's Harry Wolper and his long departed wife putting the lie to till death do us part. Then there's the developing relationship between Meli and Wolper. And finally the impulsive young love of Boris and Barbara. All interwoven like so much spaghetti. There's so much love in the air that this would be a great date movie so long as both parties are comfortable with the occasional detours into science and philosophy. The dialogue is usually sharply written and often witty almost intellectual. The editing though was a bit choppy.In today's world where human cloning is coming ever closer to reality and paranoia about it is common Jeremy Leven's screenplay should be a good reminder that genes don't make us who we are. As Boris said even a cloning breakthrough wouldn't be able to bring back the woman he loved for he could never recreate the experiences that originally shaped her mind and soul.Peter O'Toole again plays his patented charming eccentric. It's a role virtually tailormade for him and he carries it well. Whether he's spouting technical or medical jargon wistfully remembering his lost wife or rhapsodizing on the nature of God and the Big Picture O'Toole truly loses himself in this character and comes through as totally convincing. Vincent Spano and Virginia Madsen showed great chemistry as the young college couple. Mariel Hemingway was the weak link. Her character was supposed to be streetsmart and selfassured but unfortunately often came across as simply shrill.The melancholy score meshes well with the movie successfully evoking the loneliness surrounding the characters. Surprising as it was composed by Sylvester Levay best known for his pounding synthesizerrich theme for TV's Airwolf.It's worth renting this movie on tape or DVD because the version edited for television cuts several scenes that are very important to the plot. Without those scenes some lines just don't make sense. Regrettably there is no widescreen version even on DVD although the standard 1.331 Academy Frame does help keep the story intimate. Occasionally though some characters will have their faces cut off the side of the screen. But even the DVD is a very imperfect version. The sound level wavers wildly the only DVD I've ever had that does this. Sometimes it's barely audible while seconds later it's back at full volume. And the beginning of the movie is truncated with the opening titles cutting in a few notes into the score. The print is also grainy painfully so in a few of the darker scenes. All in all a very careless transfer.Note for Star Trek fans this film contains a veritable cavalcade of Trek guest stars. At least four of the cast have appeared on various incarnations of Trek including Madsen and Stiers on The Next Generation and Ian Wolfe and Jeff Corey on the original show.".

Virginia Madsen is absolutely gorgeous it has been years since I last saw this film but I still remember that shower scene. Even Hemmingway who I don't usually like puts in a good performance. This is a very touching romance story that also deals a lot with letting go but not giving up. It also doesn't get too preachy about the morals of genetic engineering.

The price was ridiculously low and Peter O'Toole staring in it I thought it would be worth the little loose change they charged for it incidentally the postage stamp I bought to write the folks back home were more expensive then the movie.And almost a year later I've finally watched it! AMAZING.At first I figured it would be a slightly wacky comedy about a student looking for love and his professor helping him to get close to the girl he wants. I was way off! I must say this movie is THE GREATEST love story I've seen. Forget Zhivago it's way too pompous forget Gone with the Wind it's to sickening sweet forget Don Juan de Marco it's too shallow... I admit this movie had me crying for three times! It's really so touching. And trust me if a 30 year old guy happily married and hanging around bars on weekends admits he's been crying  the movie has got to be emotional.So what's it about? Imagine a cross over of Good Will Hunting Dead Poet's Society Finding Forester Dragonfly Groundhog Day and Monkey Business. Hard to do right? But that's about it.Harry O'Toole is an old professor lost in the memory of his long departed wife. Yet he is a brilliant researcher the guy that gets the research money donated needles to say O'Toole is about as brilliant as it gets. Sid Stiers is the sort of an antagonist of the story. He's the cynical down to earth materialistic selfrighteous yet brilliant scholar basically a role he got famous for in the series MASH while he played Dr. Winchester. And then there's Boris Spano the young student who ends up as an assistant to Harry which naturally changes his life not as funny as in Oscar while staring next to Stalone but then again this is not such a frantic movie. The main story naturally revolves around them although there are two significant women as well Meli Hemingway and Barbara Madsen. Unfortunately their characters are flatter then O'Toole's or Spano's. They're just there to support the story and to give them opportunity to grow. Still both roles are played superbly especially Hemingway contributes a lot to an all out comedic effect with her character.Apart from the story which you will have to simply experience for yourself I'm not giving any spoilers away I was also fascinated by other aspects of this movie. Every character that had lines really contributed. Not a single person interrupted the big picture and the relationship between all the people no matter how insignificant their roles seemed really helped to establish the personalities of the main characters. And the music score was also just brilliant.Really there isn't a single thing I could fault with this movie. Not because I liked it so much but because it really was very well made. I mean you'd think that after a dozen or so times of watching it within a month some flaws would pop up but no. Everything that's there just somehow fits the BIG PICTURE! So unless you're really prejudges about movies that stir up your emotions you'll just love this movie and I bet you are going to cry while watching it too.".

I think there are many lessons to be learned from it. Look I love horrorthrillers more than anything and that is what makes up most of my top 10 films. But Creator does slip in there Hemingway is just made for the part. I think the script is clever fresh  funny and delivered so perfectly by all involved.

He wants to clone his long dead wife for one. He hires Vincent Spano as his research assistant but Spano doesn't do much besides fall for fellow student Virginia Madsen who was quite cute at 24. O'Toole meets up with selfdescribed nymphomaniac Mariel Hemmingway who agrees to donate an egg so O'Toole can regrow his wife in a test tube. Hemmingway sets her sights on becoming O'Toole's wife I guess Woody Allen was too young for her?. The comedy is lame. The drama elicits more laughs. Near the end Madsen randomly falls into a coma and Spano overacts by her side. Hemmingway is really annoying in her 1980s protomanic pixie dreamgirl role. David Ogden Stiers makes for an uninteresting villain. Just a huge mess.".

The plot of the story is seemingly absurd but is completely genuine and thus engaging. A college professor harvesting ova in order to have the materials he needs to regrow a dead wife is certainly a bizarre movie concept. How this movie ever got made is a wonder. For some reason with this cast the movie just works. The characters in this movie are wonderfully developed. In particular Creator is made extraordinary by Peter O'Toole's gorgeously rendered character Dr. Wolper. The film is further enhanced by the simple but haunting soundtrack.".

The two brothers have not been on speaking terms for many years and now the clock is literally ticking on one last chance for them to see one another and hopefully make amends for past mistakes. Sissy Spacek gives one of her finest performances as Farnsworth's slightly mentally retarded daughter and the supporting players are all real and heartfelt caricatures of America's heartland. Outstanding filmmaker David Lynch to me the finest living American director along with Martin Scorsese goes totally outofcharacter with a 180degree turn from whacked triumphs like The Elephant Man Blue Velvet Twin Peaks Fire Walk With Me and Mulholland Dr.. He quietly and methodically creates a Grated family film that has deep messages for people of all ages and backgrounds. He paints a picture of America where the old ways of life are still the most important. Farnsworth who is a total revelation was in excruciating pain throughout filming due to terminal cancer and terrible arthritis. Notice he stands very little in the movie and he is almost always filmed from the waist up. Sadly this would be his final performance as he committed suicide shortly after his Oscar nod. He did become the oldest nominee ever in the Best Actor category but really that will become trivial as time passes and his role will be the thing that shines brightly forever. Truly a legacy production for all involved. 5 stars out of 5.".

	schema:reviewBody "A truly nice story with a moral about brotherly love describes this odd David Lynch film. This was especially odd because it wasn't the kind of film Lynch had been putting out in the last 15 20 years. Those were dark and shocking films Blue Velvet Wild At Heart Mulholland Drive and this is the opposite. I know it disappointed a lot of his fans. Others were delighted by it. Count me as one of the latter and I own all three of those dark films too.This was another supposedtrue life story here detailing an elderly man's trip in a seated lawnmower from western Iowa all the way to Wisconsin to see his ailing brother who he hasn't talked to in years but wants to see before the latter dies. Well I guess that premise  an old man driving a lawn mower 400 miles  still makes this an odd film of sorts so Lynch stays in character with that! Richard Farnsworth plays the title role. He is the type of guy facewise voicewise lowkey personalitywise that just about everyone likes. The wrinkles on his face tell many a story. It was so sad to hear what happened to him in real life a year after this film was released.The first 25 minutes of this film isn't much and not always pleasant as it shows the main character's adult and mentallychallenged child Sissy Spacek and her tragic past but once Alvin Straight Farnsworth begins his trip the story picks up. I played this for several friends and they thought the film NEVER picked up but I am more generous with it. I think it's a hidden gem. To them it was a sleeping pill.I found his trip pretty fascinating but you have to realize in advance this is NOT going to be a suspenseful Lynch crime story. It IS slow and if that's okay with you you might like this. Charm enters the picture in some of people Alvin meets along the way such as a wayward young girl running away and some nice town folks who help the old man out when he gets in trouble. Henry Cada as Daniel Riordan is a standout in that regard. Harry Dean Stanton gets third billing but that's a joke he's only in the final few minutes of the movie!The Iowa scenery is pleasant. I lived there for several years and can attest to the rolling hills and the rich soil. It's a nice state with nice people....like this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Who would have thought that a movie about a man who drives a couple hundreds of miles on his lawn mower to see his brother could possibly be good cinema? I certainly didn't. I thought I knew what to expect one of the most boring experiences of my life. Well I was as wrong as I haven't been wrong too often yet because this is one of the best most realistic and honest Hollywood films I've ever seen...Giving a short resume of The Straight Story isn't very difficult. It's about an old and stubborn man who steps on his lawn mower and drives off to another state to pay his brother a visit when he hears that the man has had a severe stroke. That's already special on itself but what makes it even more special is the fact that he hasn't seen his brother in ten years because of some stupid argument. In the meantime he has his share of bad luck and problems but he also meets a lot of people whose lives he influences in one way or another with his philosophical approach to life. Despite all the difficulties he drives on for weeks not knowing if he will reach his goal seeing his brother again before it's too late...I can easily understand why there are people who don't like this movie and that's also the reason why I will not say that these people don't have a heart or things like that... This movie hasn't got any flashy action scenes it is as slow as the lawn mower the man is driving on and no you don't have to watch it for the nice soundtrack either because there isn't any. But why should you watch it then? Well the simple answer is the story. I haven't seen such a touching movie with such a powerful story very often and the fact that this actually comes from Hollywood and  to make things even better  from the Disney Studio's that's right the same studios that overwhelm us with sugar sweet nonsense makes it even more special. I'm not ashamed to admit that I had the tears in my eyes a couple of times while watching it probably because the whole situation of not seeing someone for many years because of some stupid argument is all too realistic for me.Some people will argue that the story is very shallow but I really don't agree with that. Perhaps it is because they only see that old man driving on his lawn mower and don't want to think any further. If you look close enough than you'll understand that this man is doing all this because he knows he has once been wrong that only his pride stood in the way of seeing his brother again and that he wants everybody else to see that too so they won't make the same mistake. If that isn't deep enough how much deeper does a story have to go for you then? I would also like to add that this movie really had it all. Some beautiful landscapes finally an American movie that shows something else than the skyline of New York Chicago or some other big city some very fine acting by Richard Farnsworth Sissy Spacek... and a very understandable way of telling despite the fact that this is a David Lynch movie. I know now that I was completely wrong by assuming that this movie wouldn't be to my taste. It's one of the very best movies I've seen in a long time. This movie aimed for my heart and hit the bull's eye. I give it the full 1010.".

	schema:headline " Genuine rather than saccharine";
	schema:reviewBody "Whenever I hear a movie being touted because it has no sex violence bad language special effects and so on my b.s. detector goes off.  Usually a movie like that is sentimental hogwash which panders to people who don't want anything to surprise them but to affirm how superior they are to us craven folk.  So when David Lynch's THE STRAIGHT STORY began getting those kinds of reviews I was apprehensive especially since I was not a fan of his other uplifting story THE ELEPHANT MAN.  For all the stunning images and the good acting in that film it seemed more interested in preaching to us than inspiring us.I needn't have worried.  THE STRAIGHT STORY is an honest movie rather than a saccharine one.  Most of that is due to the fact that Lynch and writers John Roach and Mary Sweeney tell it straight and simple for the most part.  There are a couple of homilies by Straight I could have done without and the shots of grain being harvested are repeated a little too much but those are only quibbles.  There's no heavyhanded message no sentimental strings to jerk our emotions and no condescension towards us and its characters. Instead they depend on the story to build its own power and it does so by the final scene we are genuinely moved.Of course casting Richard Farnsworth adds realism to the part.  He really is someone who looks like he's lived through a lot but still perseveres and except for those homilies the desire he has to get back together with his brother doesn't seem overly sentimental because you can sense here is someone who's lived too long and seen too much to be driven by anger for long.  And he knows his time is running out so he wants to make some peace not only with his brother but with his life.  Sissy Spacek also does fine unmannered work as Straight's daughter.  And although I am a city and suburban boy the Iowa and Wisconsin landscape are beautifully shot making me want at least to visit some day.".

	onyx:emotionText "Whenever I hear a movie being touted because it has no sex violence bad language special effects and so on my b.s. detector goes off.  Usually a movie like that is sentimental hogwash which panders to people who don't want anything to surprise them but to affirm how superior they are to us craven folk.  So when David Lynch's THE STRAIGHT STORY began getting those kinds of reviews I was apprehensive especially since I was not a fan of his other uplifting story THE ELEPHANT MAN.  For all the stunning images and the good acting in that film it seemed more interested in preaching to us than inspiring us.I needn't have worried.  THE STRAIGHT STORY is an honest movie rather than a saccharine one.  Most of that is due to the fact that Lynch and writers John Roach and Mary Sweeney tell it straight and simple for the most part.  There are a couple of homilies by Straight I could have done without and the shots of grain being harvested are repeated a little too much but those are only quibbles.  There's no heavyhanded message no sentimental strings to jerk our emotions and no condescension towards us and its characters.

We begin with a simple family living a quiet life but end up with an array of absurdly interesting characters with depth in their lives that cannot be apparent from their introduction.

The plainness segment includes no technical features no audio or video aspects no set decoration or cinematography work no makeup and no costume. In fact with the use of this plainness David Lynch brings the restful country life to your view.Taking a road trip from Iowa to Wisconsin a World WarII veteran plunges unhesitatingly into the river of his passion driving his way with a 1966 John Deere lawnmower and with his defect of eyesight. I didn't know the lawnmowers are made for traffic since I watch this film. Well nothing is strange enough in David Lynch' s point of view. Despite this strangeness Lynch offers a complete sagacity through Alvin StraightRichard Farnsworth's successful acting and Sissy Spacek as his daughter accompanying him. Thus you get the straightness segment through those dialogues full of sagacity.Lynch has filmed his story along the roads that the real life Alvin Straight traveled in 1994. Wisely Lynch dished out his work very economically except he has used a helicopter to let us see how slowly Alvin driving his lawnmower on the road from bird's eyeview. Still Lynch could have cut some of the scenes which overshadow the smooth style of the film. His Straight Story taught us the importance of finishing whatever we started.".

Alvin Straight Richard Farnsworth is an elderly man living with his daughter Rose Straight Sissy Spacek in Iowa. When he hears that his brother Lyle Straight Harry Dean Stanton had a stroke he heads over to his home in Wisconsin to check on him. But Alvin has no driver's license so he drives on a John Deere 110 lawn mower. It is based on the true story of Alvin Straight who drove his lawn mower to check on his suffering brother. What I like about this film is the story the cinematography and especially the acting. Alvin drives and meets many people on his way including a runaway girl a bunch of cyclists and a friendly family who fixes his tractor when it breaks.

	schema:reviewBody "Upon The Straight Story release in 1999 it was praised for being David Lynch's first film that ignored his regular themes of the macabre and the surreal. Based on a true story of one man and his journey to visit his estranged brother on a John Deere '66 mower at first glance its an odd story for Lynch to direct. Yet as the story develops you can see some of Lynch's trademark motifs coming through.Lynch's focus on small town America and its inhabitants is still as prevalent as in his previous efforts such as Blue Velvet or Twin Peaks but the most notable difference is that the weirdness is curbed down. The restrictions imposed means that the film has the notable accolade of being one of the few live action films that I can think of that features a G rating. Incredibly significant this films stands as evidence that beautiful and significant family films can be produced.The Straight Story was the first feature which Lynch directed where he had no hand at writing. For many Lynch devotees this was a huge negative point. Almost universally acclaimed the only overly negative review by James Brundage of filmcritic.com focused on this very criticism that it wasn't a typical Lynch film. Lynch is struggling within the mold of a GRated story that isn't his own. Brundage claims with his protagonist Alvin Straight quoting lines directly from Confucious. He argues that the story is weak and the dialogue even worse. Yet this is about the only criticism that many will read for the film. Whilst it is true that it is not Lynch in the sense of Eraserhead Lost Highway or Mulholland Drive  all films which I also adore The Straight Story features a different side of Lynch that is by no means terrible. If you are a Lynch fan it is most important to separate that side of Lynch with this feature.The narrative is slow and thoughtful which gives you a real sense of the protagonist's thoughts as he travels to his destination. Alvin constantly is reminded about his past and his relationships with his wife children and his brother. Yet particularly significant is that there are no flashbacks which only adds to the effect which reminded me of my conversations with my grandparents. The conclusion arrives like watching a boat being carried down a slow meandering river and it is beautiful to watch. The natural landscapes of the US are accentuated and together with the beautiful soundtrack by Angelo Badalamenti makes me yearn to go to America. The performances are also excellent with every actor believable in their roles and Richard Farnsworth is particularly excellent. His Oscar nomination was greatly deserved and it was a shame that he didn't win. Regardless however it is probably the finest swansong for any actor. So whilst The Straight Story features none of Lynch's complex narratives or trademark dialogue the film is a fascinating character study about getting old and comes highly recommended!".

Perhaps art will always mean the most to its creator.The Straight Story is not a typical David Lynch film. Not that there's anything typical about them anyway. It's an odyssey through rural America. A real life journey Alvin Straight took on a lawn mower to get to his brothers house. He rode 300 miles from Laurens Iowa to Mt. Zion Wisconsin to make amends to his sick brother for past offenses.At the heart of this film is sweet voiced Richard Farnsworth. He brings Alvin Straight right to us in a simple and honest way. The fact that the film is slow paced matches Alvin's slow journey toward realization.Along the way Alvin meets a confused and frightened young girl. She is pregnant and has decided to run away from her situation. After listening to Alvin speak about family she reconsiders.Later Alvin witnesses a distraught woman kill a deer with her car. She complains that she has killed several and leaves. Alvin feels bad but is smart enough to cook up some dear meat that night.Later Alvin's lawn mower loses its brakes and nearly kills him. A nice man and his wife let him stay in their yard while he gets it fixed. They even let him call his sweet but slow daughter nicely played by Sissy Spacek whose haunted by a terrible tragedy in her own past. Alvin insists on paying for the call. The man even offers to drive Alvin to his brothers with pleasure. Alvin declines with thanks.While Alvin waits he also goes off to a bar with a kindly old man as they discuss the harshness of war and the price it took on their souls. Alvin even confesses a fatal mistake he made as a sniper that has forever haunted him.Alvin also encounters two bickering brothers who've repaired his lawn mower. He talks them down in price wisely calling them on their high labor and repair costs. He even helps them to appreciate one another learning from his own mistakes with his brother.The night before Alvin leaves the man's yard he takes his hat off to him. The man tells him it was an honor having him stay and asks Alvin to write to him. This scene is perfect in it's simplicity. It's heartfelt because it's so straight so real.The journey continues and we can't help to get more and more involved with it. We want Alvin to get to his brothers. We want him to make amends. We want to know this world is full of forgiveness.This was Richard Farnsworth at his best. It was his last film and his performance was amazing. You can't help but to understand his pride to listen to his wisdom and to ultimately feel his pain. One becomes as taken with him as the man who offers him his back yard to stay in.If there's justice in the afterlife then Alvin Straight his brother and Richard Farnsworth are together sitting at a bar. I can picture them discussing their lives regrets hopes and joys. As Alvin says in the film My brother and I used to look up at the stars. Well I know they all are with the best view in the house.".

	schema:reviewBody "David Lynch's 1999 film of John Roach  Mary Sweeney's story is set in Iowa and Wisconsin some time well before the film's eventual release.We come into the life of Alvin Straight Richard Farnsworth late on in life. His medical condition is poor his life is mostly behind him and he knows it.This makes what he decides to do even more remarkable and endearing. He decides and at every point in the film his own name reverberates through his actions to put a few things straight.Alvin is by this time in his life a man of great experience but modest means. His daughter Rose Sissy Spacek struggles with a speech impediment that makes communication a great effort on the audience's behalf. But it's worth it because Rose's story cannot help but come out as the film progresses.This film is the story of a journey. But like all journeys it is a journey in the geographical sense and in the human sense. Early on in the film we begin to understand that this is an ambitious journey which no elderly gentleman of Alvin's age should reasonably undertake.But along the way we slowly learn how Alvin has so many qualifications which equip him to achieve his unlikely objective. His objective is very simple and straightforward. His brother is ill and likely to die and he wants to visit him. He has had a falling out with him many years ago and they have not spoken in a very long time.Along the way Alvin meets many people. The way he behaves towards them and the benefit they get from having known him is the essence of this film. We come to know who Alvin Straight is from what Alvin Straight does. And at the end of the film we know who we are .. better.".

He decides and at every point in the film his own name reverberates through his actions to put a few things straight.Alvin is by this time in his life a man of great experience but modest means. His daughter Rose Sissy Spacek struggles with a speech impediment that makes communication a great effort on the audience's behalf. But it's worth it because Rose's story cannot help but come out as the film progresses.This film is the story of a journey. But like all journeys it is a journey in the geographical sense and in the human sense. Early on in the film we begin to understand that this is an ambitious journey which no elderly gentleman of Alvin's age should reasonably undertake.But along the way we slowly learn how Alvin has so many qualifications which equip him to achieve his unlikely objective. His objective is very simple and straightforward. His brother is ill and likely to die and he wants to visit him. He has had a falling out with him many years ago and they have not spoken in a very long time.Along the way Alvin meets many people. The way he behaves towards them and the benefit they get from having known him is the essence of this film. We come to know who Alvin Straight is from what Alvin Straight does. And at the end of the film we know who we are .. better.";

However here he's made a film that is very different in tone from his other famous workand I wouldn't have suspected he could make such a 'normal' film. Perhaps this is because unlike most of his work he didn't write The Straight Storyjust directed it. Regardless it's an exceptional filmone that is really unlike anything else I've seenand I have seen and reviewed A LOT of films.The film is based on a true story that occurred a few years before the film was made. Alvin Straight was a 73 yearold man whose brother suffered a stroke. Alvin did not have a driver's license as he had poor vision and was in pretty poor health. So in order to make it to his brother's home hundreds of miles away Alvin rigged up a trailer onto his riding mower and set out on a journey that would take him well over a month!While the subject matter is pretty mundane and the story rather slowgoing mostly because Alvin Straight's journey was a very slow one the film managed to be quite entertaining. The script was excellent Lynch's direction lovely and Richard Farnsworth was terrific in the film as Alvin Straight. Overall despite being such a simple story it is a very special sort of filmone that folks who don't demand action and excitement will enjoy.".

But it is a very straight story as the title might hint. Don't except to be caught in the usual Lynchian void of incomprehensibility that usually occurs after viewing i.e. Lost Highway. It is a simple film but it is indeed a great film. That is both from a innovative and an entertaining aspect. It's innovative because it so not Lynch. But maybe that IS Lynch. He likes to twist our minds and therefore puts together a film that might seem very mainstream and far from Lynch himself. Being a very avantgarde director he might just make a film like this just to tease his regular audience because he knows what they expect but he doesn't give it to them. That would be crafty.The pace of the film is slow. I would almost say lawn mower speed... Don't expect an action orgy but the film is truly entertaining for the ones who go with the flow of the film.  Look carefully for those small details that Lynch plot throughout the movie for our entertainment. Look for the great cinematography that makes this film come to life. And listen to Badalamenti's score and the main theme that really animates the Iowa and Wisconsin landscapes shown frequently. Farnsworth puts in one of his best performances in this film making him one of the most likeable ol' men ever depicted on film. He doesn't have to say anything to express his feelings and thoughts. His cheerfulness just shines right through him and his acting earned him an Oscar nomination. Need I say that his weak health in this film wasn't acted? He was diagnosed with cancer and shot himself right after this film was complete. That knowledge just puts more emphasis on the film because it becomes more of a homage to Farnsworth. All of the above form a very nice motion picture that is suitable for all kinds of people that like a film the way they are supposed to be done. One could ask for homilies that aren't that obvious and a bit naive but it doesn't ruin the overall picture being that it is a memorable motion picture. 910.".

Straight is struggling to come to terms with his own mortality when he learns that his estranged brother is also having health issues that may ultimately leave them with unresolved issues.All of his associates seem to agree that Alvin remains of sound mind and for the time being that seems to be enough to counter balance his rapidly advancing physical deficiencies. That is until he reveals the unconventional and extremely dangerous method of travel that he plans to use to make the approximate three hundred and fifty mile trip to visit his brother Lyle.I can't imagine that there's anyone in Hollywood who could have played the leading role of Alvin Straight better than Richard Farnsworth whose performance earned him an Oscar Nomination for Best Actor. Sissy Spacek's portrayal of his mentally challenged daughter Rose is phenomenal as well. They never pinpoint her affliction but I'm guessing that it's some form of autism. She stutters badly and is somewhat slowwitted but highly independent and has an uncanny knack for remembering facts historical and otherwise. The brevity of her on screen appearance may well have been the only thing that kept her from receiving yet another Academy Award Nomination for her work here.Prior to seeing the opening credits I had no knowledge whatsoever of the actual making of the film. When I saw the G Rating I was surprised. When I saw that it was a Walt Disney Production I was intrigued but you could have knocked me over with a feather when I realized that David Lynch was its director.This only helped to confirm what I'd felt all along. David Lynch's talents in terms of style and imagery are bound by nothing including his lack of involvement in the writing of this piece. Despite the limitations of the MPAA rating and the guidelines of Walt Disney which I imagine are at least somewhat restrictive this was Lynch in his classic style and at his finest. What he's done in effect is produce a work for all ages and cinematic taste without compromising his own technique. By the way those of you who aren't familiar with his other work have no idea what I'm talking about. I hope that those of you who are can relate.Although I only recently saw this film over the years I had heard many wonderful things about its subject matter from individuals whose taste in movies I fully trust. With that in mind there was little doubt that I would consider this to be anything less than tube time well spent. However nothing anyone ever told me could have prepared me for the degree to which it would touch me on a personal level. Alvin Straight reminded me very much of my grandfather who had a third grade education and is still the smartest man I've ever known. This film eloquently illustrates the patience wisdom courage and yes stubbornness of a generation that is all but extinct. While the elder generations are and will always be in essence living history individuals like Straight are all but gone. Soon the option to listen and learn about past events first hand from the accounts of our contemporaries who remain uncorrupted by the influence of the modern age will be gone as well.".
