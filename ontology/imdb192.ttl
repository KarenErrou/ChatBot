If you believe the film all of Flynt's opposition came from rightwing blowhards like Charles Keating and Jerry Falwell.  Certainly they did have the most publicized tussles with him.  But to ignore the problems he had with feminists makes it rather limited.  I don't agree with Gloria Steinhem's contention that the film ignores his depraved side but I think the film would have been more interesting if it had addressed the opposition he had from both the left and the right.

After watching it I know exactly who he is and what he stands for. He stands for freedom of speech. Some might call him a pervert. Others call him a patriot. I believe he is the latter. While I don't know the exact story of Larry Flynt from any other sources than this movie I don't know if it's completely accurate. The plot is great for a biographic piece the acting is superb by most actors especially the three main characters. Most of the cinematography fits the movie perfectly. The only thing that bothered me a little was there was relatively little information about why Larry Flynt did what he did believed what he believed so strongly. I sympathized with his character in several scenes but I never fully understood him. The director should have had at least a few more emotional scenes with Larry to explain his actions better. Overall a very good drama. Recommendable to most fans of the genre as long as they can stand what the movie shows them. If you have an open mind you're not too easily offended and you're into autobiographical dramas this is a good film to watch. 810".

It shows how a right that is supposedly near and dear to us all is often skewed in favor of mollycoddling lots of hypocrites who has the ridiculous audacity to think they have the right and the obligation to tell the rest of the world what to think of as moral or immoral. I loved the scene where Woody Harrelson who does an absolutely bangup job gives a speech about how explicit depictions of death murder and war are considered appropriate while sex is considered filthy. Sex or war indeed. The more of Harrelson I see the more my respect for his work grows. I must also mention Courtney Love who is terrific as Althea. Great movie I thought. Most of the people who don't like it are probably also the very ones it portrays as being the bad guysthe religious right of course. Larry Flynt may not be admirable in the type of lifestyle he and Althea lived and his magazine is to my mind entirely repugnant. But if Larry and Althea truly had the sort of relationship portrayed they loved each other beyond all reason and what he did makes him a great patriot. How many people would do what he did in defense of such an idealistic belief? Not all people who do great things for great reasons are great people.".

	schema:headline " Shocking Expose";
	schema:reviewBody "Anyone familiar with Milos Forman's work will know how much he likes to discuss and examine controversial reallife characters and make them the focal point of his films. Amadeus for one was a powerful expose of the legendary composer Forman was able to extraordinarily add so much spice to the script that the end result was a harrowing documentation that genuinely moved us. We didn't need to know anything about the composer or even like his work or personality Forman craves on these sorts of challenges. He likes to make films about characters that the audience may not identify with because it heightens the overall achivement if the film  is a hit. With Larry Flynt he's done it again.Flynt is the story of Porn magazine chairman larry Flynt who amidst an era of overwhelming decadance launched Hustler magazine a porn magazine that broke all taboos and crossed all boundaries. The magazine was a huge hit that transformed Flynt into a powerful figure in the American Community. Needless to say though Flynt superbly played by Harrelson faces insurmountable odds from everyone to keep the business running. Politicians reverends mass public opposition et.al.. Flynt is accompanied along the way by his junkie wife played with real panache by Courtney Love and a reluctant lawyer dependable performance from Edward Norton Jr.. At the midway point of the film Flynt is shot and paralyzed and consequently the fight to stay on top is made even more challenging.This story is intriguing because is dares to break universal taboo's. It shows Flynt disassociating himself from the norms and traditions of society and really willing to take genuine risks that could blow up in his face. Before Hustler was formed Playboy was the porno pioneer. Playboy was subtle in it's nudity preferring to call itself a REAL magazine rather than something trashy. We notice that Playboy was afraid to overstep the barrier. Playboy was a magazine that was restricted in it's disclosure of barenaked ladies because of the shape of society at the time and the values the society had come to embrace. To call yourself a porno magazine was unthinkable with unthinkable consequences! Hustler dared to step over those lines and bear all the consequences. Flynt was not necessarily a likeable man but he cannot not be admired. He was a risk taker an enterpeneur a man with a vision and a man who believed that oe should act on one's desires and ambitions.The mass hysteria the swamps the society as a consequence mainfests how powerful yet dangerous a little acting on ambition can bring. Flynt's idea is impossible to resist the public cannot stay away from the controversial impact of the magazine. As the fan base grows so does Flynt's empire and so do the forces determined to suppress him. Flynt's meteoric rise is unprecedented and made all the more shocking by the fact that the evnets are real. His opposition ranges from hypocritical politicians to dubious religious figures all of whom are hellbent on the abolition of Flynt and his tremendous reach.The film earns huge plaudits on the entertainment level. This is undisputed!! The acting demonstartes tremendous range from all involved and Flynt is an offensive yet endearing and very funny figure. We grow to really love and root for him as the film develops. The points that necessitate discussion however are the legal and moral issues that are debated by Flynt his lawyer and the opposition. The freedom of press of speech and the freedom to exercise your FREEDOM are all fiercely debated. Flynt vehemently defends his position because he feels that the world is afraid to agree with him that the world is afraid to speak out. The world is polluted by hypocrits he's the only pure seed. This presents tremendous irony because Flynt is a lowclass pervert up against scholars and politicians and bureaucrats and yet he's claiming that he's the real deal and they are all phonies. He has a point what's the point in looking presentable and being welleducated if you are  banal hollow and insipid and cannot open your mind to new ideas?? The film asks that question we see how closed off the men in power are to Flynt's ideas and we grow to hate them. Then we are torn because we are reluctant to accept the values of a porn fiend. The fact that we cannot resist Flynt's pulling power is the sign of the film's success. We start off opposing Flynt unable to identify. Then we try and take a neutral stand as we discover the ugliness of Flynt's opponents. Finally after Flynt is paralyzed and yet continues to defend his honour we can no longer resist the seduction.The film has Flynt giving amazing speeches about why he is doing justice to himself and the people. He's giving them what they wantthey are taking itand yet they are determined to censor him. He debates this point to manifest the outstanding hypocrisy that lies at the heart of society. Flynt is such an important character because he speaks for all of us. On countless occasions we all seek to expose the twofaced ugliness of those around us. We just can't because not enough people are listening. Flynt however gets eveyone's attention and defends his honour preserves his integrity and succeeds in winning over the justice system. The final speech given by Issacman his lawyer is very insightful and very powerful for it argues this very point 'We don't need to like what Larry Flynt does but we should like and appreciate the fact that we have the right to make that decision on our own and that's what makes our society great. We have the right to accept or reject the offer on hand. We may well reject it but we and we alone need to have the choice made available to us. If that right is taken away then we wither away as a people and our individuality is nullified' The speech is amazing because it demonstrates how the right to accept a porn fiend and his work preserves the democracy of the Western World. Truly Shocking but brilliant!!!I haven't discussed the other characters all that much and I'm not going to except say this All the characters are multidimensional because what we see on the outside is never what we get on the inside. Flynt for all his crude perverted behaviour is an admirable likeable highly identifiable personality. His wife for all her vulgarity and drug addiction is an endearing loyalintelligent personality. Issacman the lawyer for all his traditional stiff boring work ethic is an idealistic shrewd and deeply committed man....The list goes on and onI loved this movie because our hero is not perfect he's anything but!!! Movies that depict the hero as a flawed individual stand a better chance of being embraced by critics and audiences alike. Flynt thrives on this! And exposing hypocrits for their true selves is every cynics and I happen to be a huge one dream. Flynt's journey is whopping emotional tour de force!!!! You don't have to like Larry Flynt as a film but I love the fact that I had the right to make up my own mind!! Society you ignore that at your peril!!!".

	onyx:emotionText "Anyone familiar with Milos Forman's work will know how much he likes to discuss and examine controversial reallife characters and make them the focal point of his films. Amadeus for one was a powerful expose of the legendary composer Forman was able to extraordinarily add so much spice to the script that the end result was a harrowing documentation that genuinely moved us. We didn't need to know anything about the composer or even like his work or personality Forman craves on these sorts of challenges. He likes to make films about characters that the audience may not identify with because it heightens the overall achivement if the film  is a hit. With Larry Flynt he's done it again.Flynt is the story of Porn magazine chairman larry Flynt who amidst an era of overwhelming decadance launched Hustler magazine a porn magazine that broke all taboos and crossed all boundaries. The magazine was a huge hit that transformed Flynt into a powerful figure in the American Community. Needless to say though Flynt superbly played by Harrelson faces insurmountable odds from everyone to keep the business running. Politicians reverends mass public opposition et.al.. Flynt is accompanied along the way by his junkie wife played with real panache by Courtney Love and a reluctant lawyer dependable performance from Edward Norton Jr.. At the midway point of the film Flynt is shot and paralyzed and consequently the fight to stay on top is made even more challenging.This story is intriguing because is dares to break universal taboo's. It shows Flynt disassociating himself from the norms and traditions of society and really willing to take genuine risks that could blow up in his face. Before Hustler was formed Playboy was the porno pioneer. Playboy was subtle in it's nudity preferring to call itself a REAL magazine rather than something trashy. We notice that Playboy was afraid to overstep the barrier. Playboy was a magazine that was restricted in it's disclosure of barenaked ladies because of the shape of society at the time and the values the society had come to embrace. To call yourself a porno magazine was unthinkable with unthinkable consequences! Hustler dared to step over those lines and bear all the consequences. Flynt was not necessarily a likeable man but he cannot not be admired. He was a risk taker an enterpeneur a man with a vision and a man who believed that oe should act on one's desires and ambitions.The mass hysteria the swamps the society as a consequence mainfests how powerful yet dangerous a little acting on ambition can bring. Flynt's idea is impossible to resist the public cannot stay away from the controversial impact of the magazine. As the fan base grows so does Flynt's empire and so do the forces determined to suppress him. Flynt's meteoric rise is unprecedented and made all the more shocking by the fact that the evnets are real. His opposition ranges from hypocritical politicians to dubious religious figures all of whom are hellbent on the abolition of Flynt and his tremendous reach.The film earns huge plaudits on the entertainment level. This is undisputed!! The acting demonstartes tremendous range from all involved and Flynt is an offensive yet endearing and very funny figure. We grow to really love and root for him as the film develops. The points that necessitate discussion however are the legal and moral issues that are debated by Flynt his lawyer and the opposition. The freedom of press of speech and the freedom to exercise your FREEDOM are all fiercely debated. Flynt vehemently defends his position because he feels that the world is afraid to agree with him that the world is afraid to speak out. The world is polluted by hypocrits he's the only pure seed. This presents tremendous irony because Flynt is a lowclass pervert up against scholars and politicians and bureaucrats and yet he's claiming that he's the real deal and they are all phonies. He has a point what's the point in looking presentable and being welleducated if you are  banal hollow and insipid and cannot open your mind to new ideas??

This isn't a movie about Larry Flynt the porn king. It's more a movie about the right to say what you want to say without having to think of every person's opinion first. You may not like the man or what he stands for but at least he has the guts to stand up for what he believes in. He defends his right to speak freely and doesn't mind kicking against the shins of the ultra conservative Christians. In a way today's America needs more people like him instead of acting like a bunch of sheep being brought to the slaughterhouse by their government...The acting in the movie is very good but especially Woody Harrelson as Larry Flynt and Edward Norton as his lawyer were excellent. Courtney Love isn't really an actress but still did a good job not that hard to do when you play a role that you are quite familiar with in your own life.All in all this is a very enjoyable movie that will be loved by some and hated by many. Personally I liked it and I give it a 7.510".

A highlyentertaining highlyintriguing  a highlygripping film. This film shows us the rise  rise of Larry Fylnt the man who believed in doing what your heart says. An incredible film! 'The People VS Larry Fylnt' is a film that leaves behind a lot of questions? Example Fylnt says that WAR is more homely a talk than SEX... Now that's something!SEX is something that everyone wants but when it's shown on TV or in a Movie or in a Magazine everyone seems to be getting uncomfortable? Fylnt knew what he was doing... and he proved right after all the CourtCases and despite being a paralyzed man. 'The People VS Larry Fylnt' is a must watch film.... because it shows a man who did what he had to despite everything that happened to him.Woody Harrelson's performance as Larry Fylnt is exemplary. Any compliment won't do justice his portrayal. Courtney Love is fabulous as Fylnt's lady love. Edward Norton is fantastic as Flynt's lawyer. Larry Fylnt who makes a brief appearance as a judge is perfect.'The People VS Larry Fylnt' cannot be missed by anyone... watch the amazing life of a man amazing man right now! Two Big Thumbs Up!".

	schema:headline " A fascinating period piece with a standout performance from Woody Harrelson";
	schema:reviewBody "Milos Forman's The People vs. Larry Flynt tells the true story of how Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flynt unwittingly became a crusader for freedom of speech. Beginning in the early 1970's the movie follows Flynt as he builds a porn empire with his racy alternative to Playboy. Of course pushing the boundaries of good taste has a tendency to ruffle some people's feathers so he quickly and frequently finds himself involved in various legal wranglings. Defending his business interests he stands his ground on the premise of freedom of speech.Thankfully the Golden Globewinning screenplay doesn't paint Flynt as a selfless crusader for human rights. He straddles the grey area between hero  antihero and the script doesn't go out of its way to sway you one way or the other. The premise is fascinating on its own but further colour is added by way of delving into other areas of Flynt's life.Portraying Flynt is Woody Harrelson in his first Oscarnominated performance. He carries the movie creating a portrayal that makes Flynt likable as a character regardless of what you think of his profession. Courntney Love also got a fair amount of attention as Flynt's wife but I'm not completely sold on her presence here. More memorable in my mind is Edward Norton in an early role as Flynt's longsuffering lawyer. The supporting cast is generally reliable as well including Harrelson's brother Brett as Larry's younger brother Jimmy.Milos Forman's direction is top notch as expected. He received an Oscar nomination and took home a Golden Globe for his efforts. The movie has an attractive look that is vividly brought to life with attention to detail in the periodspecific costumes  sets. Some periodspecific soundtrack selections further enhanced the movie's feel.All in all The People vs. Larry Flynt is a fascinating portrait of a man of dubious morals who ended up fighting for the free speech of all Americans. With fine direction and acting thrown into the mix the movie is a unique entertaining tale of a true rebel though one that is unlikely to appeal to all tastes due to the risqu subject matter.".

That's not to say Americans are bad quite the contrary but we definitely have a problem admitting when we're wrong. This movie makes no apologies and goes straight for the jugular. And thanks to Milos Foreman and Larry Flynt himself this movie asks us to consider just how fundamental the right of free speech and the freedom of expression is to society. And yes it relates to hardcore porn.Without delving too much into the technical aspects of the movie let me just say that if you watch the Edward Norton courtroom scenes the first where Larry Flynt himself is the judge and the last one when he's arguing to the Supreme Court and the epic speech our protagonist gives on sex versus death you are going to start developing opinions. It is going to make you think and it might challenge your comfort zone. And for all those reasons this movie is worth every moment of your time... including those painful scenes involving Courtney Love.I still think about this movie sometimes whenever I hear people arguing about their First Amendment rights. Larry Flynt might not be a knight in shining armor so to speak but what he stands for is more than just porn  it's freedom of expression and Americans have to accept that that doesn't necessarily mean something tame or conservative. It's an important lesson and a movie that should not be missed.".

	schema:headline " Why I love movie biographies";
	schema:reviewBody "The genre of the movie biography is often marked or marred by hero worship historical inaccuracy and more clichs than one can tolerate. Usually a director has a specific reason for selecting a project about a particular person. Biopics are usually about heroes or at least about misunderstood good people. When such a picture is attempted about a villain or ne'erdowell a very fine tightrope must be walked between whitewashing and playing it safe with a politically correct hatchet job.With THE PEOPLE VS. LARRY FLYNT director Milos Forman treads that tightrope with confidence. His protagonist is a man whom millions have condemned as a vile pornographer and character assassin. Telling any kind of story from the perspective of Larry Flynt or anyone like him is dangerous. But Forman is careful to be thoroughly analytical in his examination of Flynt's life. He does not try to lick the publisher's boots but simply presents him as he was albeit in a heightened fashion. Forman's Flynt is a man whose ambition bad temper and appetite for anarchy get him into a lot of trouble at the same time he is not devoid of relatable human feeling.Almost as if to parody Abraham Lincoln's beginnings Forman first shows Flynt as a Kentucky youth living in a log cabin. Eager to get ahead in life he haphazardly concocts his own moonshine and peddles it to local drunks. A few decades later his fortunes have improved somewhat he now operates a lowrent semisuccessful burlesque house in downtown Cincinnati. But far from being content with making enough money to live comfortably Flynt is on the cusp of unleashing on the world his own redneck manifesto. Condemning Playboy as an elitist publication he vows to create a men's magazine that values the beerdrinker over the martinidrinker. The result is Hustler  which far from being just another girlie magazine vents Flynt's class anger by lashing out in vicious mockery of a world that he and his clients never made.As his recreational tastes begin to run to the abstract Flynt becomes increasingly outspoken about his supposed relevance as a spokesman for First Amendment rights. When his magazine is banned in some cities this confirmed hedonist transforms into something of a pagan pulpitpounder. His barnstorming eventually brings him into contact with a more traditional kind of pulpitpounder Moral Majority leader Jerry Falwell. Under pretense of jesting Flynt lowblows Reverend Falwell with an obscene and slanderous ad parody. The stage is now set for a somewhat farcical battle of wills that manages to mount high enough to reach the Supreme Court.Whether you admire Flynt or not it is easy to take away from Forman's movie the basic message that his rights as a publisher were just as precious as anyone else's. Problem is Larry seeks not just vindication but domination he is hellbent on testing the very limits of constitutional license and public tolerance repeatedly daring an uptight world to silence him. His megalomania causes him to be far more concerned about all the free publicity his magazine receives from the controversy than with anything as elevated as constitutional freedoms. Woody Harrelson must be commended for capturing with aplomb the audacity of a man whose circuslike antics masked a ruthless determination to hype and exploit himself no less sordidly than any of the naked women in his magazine. That this man has become an icon for the rights of American democracy and capitalism is a bitter irony for many to stomach but it is no less true because of that.The reallife figures portrayed in this movie are rendered without compromise and with an eye toward objectivity Forman resists the urge to place anyone on a pedestal or drag anyone through the mud. Harrelson convincingly brings to life a colorful and imaginative man who gradually becomes emboldened then intoxicated and finally consumed by his petty sense of selfimportance. And Jerry Falwell far from being demonized is portrayed with great tact and understanding that he sometimes comes across as a gladhander may not always be bearable but it is believable.THE PEOPLE VS. LARRY FLYNT reminds me of why I so enjoy modern Hollywood biographical films. They are always about figures who live their lives to the fullest often with complete disregard for the consequences. Larry Flynt inhabits a world that is totally his own and he will not rest until every inch of that internal experience has been projected onto the outside world in all its tawdry glory. I turned the whole world into a tabloid! he exults at one point. Watching it all on a screen safely quarantined by the passage of time and by ironic distance it is hard not to share in that exhilaration.".

	schema:reviewBody "We sometimes have trouble in our patrimatriarchal political and social structures thinking outside of dualisms.  For example if a person is shamed and repressed by the archy it often seems like the only way to freedom is through rebellion.  Thus in movies like The People Versus Larry Flynt and Quills we get sexual acting out sexual excess and sexual abuse presented as sexual freedom.  The archy loves this  It needs an enemy to continue thriving.  The archy creates the conditions for rebellion to thrive.  The archy also secretly likes to glorify this rebellion.  So in movies like The People and Quills we also get stories glorifying pornography in such a way that strips it of its true ugliness and tragedy.  These movies make pornography seem cool.  The People operates on the premise even if it is supposed to be done with humor that Larry Flynt our flawed hero is standing up to sexually repressive American Christian Fundamentalists such as Jerry Fallwell.  Flynt does this by exploiting and victimzing young women who are victims of the very system he is supposedly trying to liberate everyone from.  I am all for more openness and less shame in the handling of sexual matters on a mass cultural level but I do not see pornography and the exploitation of women's bodies as the best means of doing this.  On the contrary pornography is merely the flip side of sexual repression  It is sex seen as dirty tainted with the stink of patrimatriarchal shame.  Hopefully in time we can all move beyond such dualistic ways of thinking and realize that true freedom lies in respecting everyone's needs and values from the time they are brought into this world and not getting lost in this eternal game of repressrebel that has been responsible for so many of our world's ills over the last two thousand years.  Long live empathy and compassion!".

	schema:headline " a mixed biography for one of the kings of pornography";
	schema:reviewBody "A Czech director who emigrated in the USA in the seventies Milos Forman these last years specialized in biographies Larry Flynt 1996 and he was to shot Man on the Moon three years later about the life of the comedian Andy Kaufman. After a seven year absence his last movie was Valmont in 1989 Larry Flynt was released in 1996 and we all have in our minds the poster because it caused a scandal. Larry Flynt one of the kings of pornography depicted as a crucified Christ on the string of a woman! After I watched this movie which relates the chaotic career of this man against the establishment it left me a bitter taste in a major part caused by the script.It is not a matter of chance if Forman hired Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski as the scriptwriters. Both concocted the screenplay of the delicious Ed Wood 1994 one of Tim Burton's peaks in his work. So to write the script of Larry Flynt they used the same methods as Ed Wood's to relate his life as precisely as possible. If it had wonderfully worked in Burton's movie here the mayonnaise isn't thickening for Forman's movie. I think that it is due to a difference of personality with the two quoted characters. Indeed Ed Wood was an eternal loser but the scriptwriters had made him endearing. Moreover Johnny Depp had rendered his personality in a convincing way. As for Larry Flynt he was a winner although he has had trouble with the law and he built a real empire based on a vulgar exploitation of the woman body. At once we deal with an ambitious but hateful character. Woody Harrelson's efforts to make him nice are ineffective either in dramatic moments Flynt's wife who commits suicide either in funny sequences Flynt's excess in court. Besides these last sequences aren't even funny in the way Harrelson goes over the top.As a result the movie loses a lot of its appeal and you just glance through it. By way of consolation we can save Courtney Love who for her real first role in screen offers a decent and sometimes harrowing performance. There's also a decent performance from Edward Norton but he will find the role of his life three years later in Fight Club.A mixed biography which shows that the presence of two excellent scriptwriters in a film doesn't always contribute to its success.".

	onyx:emotionText "A Czech director who emigrated in the USA in the seventies Milos Forman these last years specialized in biographies Larry Flynt 1996 and he was to shot Man on the Moon three years later about the life of the comedian Andy Kaufman. After a seven year absence his last movie was Valmont in 1989 Larry Flynt was released in 1996 and we all have in our minds the poster because it caused a scandal. Larry Flynt one of the kings of pornography depicted as a crucified Christ on the string of a woman! After I watched this movie which relates the chaotic career of this man against the establishment it left me a bitter taste in a major part caused by the script.It is not a matter of chance if Forman hired Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski as the scriptwriters. Both concocted the screenplay of the delicious Ed Wood 1994 one of Tim Burton's peaks in his work. So to write the script of Larry Flynt they used the same methods as Ed Wood's to relate his life as precisely as possible. If it had wonderfully worked in Burton's movie here the mayonnaise isn't thickening for Forman's movie. I think that it is due to a difference of personality with the two quoted characters. Indeed Ed Wood was an eternal loser but the scriptwriters had made him endearing. Moreover Johnny Depp had rendered his personality in a convincing way. As for Larry Flynt he was a winner although he has had trouble with the law and he built a real empire based on a vulgar exploitation of the woman body. At once we deal with an ambitious but hateful character. Woody Harrelson's efforts to make him nice are ineffective either in dramatic moments Flynt's wife who commits suicide either in funny sequences Flynt's excess in court. Besides these last sequences aren't even funny in the way Harrelson goes over the top.As a result the movie loses a lot of its appeal and you just glance through it.

Obviously Mr. Flynt is not someone most people would admire and the film doesn't attempt to portray him as an angel by any means. What the film does portray is that the First Amendment of the United States Constitution was put in place to preserve our natural rights of freedom of speech. Any speech  as Ron Paul has stated The First Amendment was not put in place to protect our rights to talk about the weather. Mr. Flynt was jailed for publishing a magazine the government found to be indecent. Fortunately for the preservation of Americans' rights Mr. Flynt fought for his rights. When speech such as Larry Flynt's is protected all of our speech is protected.Milos Forman does an outstanding job of direction and Woody Harreson's performance was definitely worthy of it's Oscar nomination. Courtney Love is excellent as well although you have to wonder how much of her performance was acting and how much was just Courtney Love being Courtney Love. Ed Norton as per usual puts in a stellar performance playing Larry Flynt's abused lawyer. This film has consistently been in my top 10 favorites list not only for it's message but it's entertainment value as well. It receives my highest possible recommendation.".

The People vs. Larry Flynt is a biographical drama film directed by Milo Forman about the rise of pornographic magazine publisher and editor Larry Flynt and his subsequent clash with the law. The film stars Woody Harrelson Courtney Love and Edward Norton.The film was written by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski. It spans about 25 years of Flynt's life from his impoverished upbringing in Kentucky to his court battle with Reverend Jerry Falwell and is based in part on the U.S. Supreme Court case Hustler Magazine v. Falwell. Forman's film follows Flynt from his childhood in Kentucky where he made extra money for his dirtpoor family by selling the moonshine his father brewed into adulthood as he manages a strip club in Cincinnati. While the club does middling business the experience changes Flynt's life in two ways he meets Althea an exotic dancer who becomes the love of his life and he gets the bright idea of starting a magazine to promote the club. Marketed as a crasser less pretentious alternative to Playboy or Penthouse Hustler becomes a huge success after Flynt runs a photo series of Jacqueline Onassis sunbathing nude. However while plenty of people are buying Hustler there are also plenty of people who don't care for it including Charles Keating leader of a watchdog group called Citizens For Decent Literature. Keating spearheads the first of many legal attacks on the magazine one of which reaches the Supreme Court as Alan Isaacman Flynt's lawyer debates the finer legal points of bad taste with the justices of the highest court in the land. Meanwhile Flynt makes a fortune loses the use of his legs after an attack by a sniper embraces and than abandons Christianity and eventually loses Althea who succumbs to AIDS after a long addiction to drugs.A brave spectacularly entertaining  and unexpectedly stirring  account of Flynt's life that asks us to regard the publisher of Hustler magazine as an invaluable champion of our First Amendment freedoms.It's a modernday Capra film about an unorthodox businessman who's persecuted for his originality but eventually is recognized for the lovable rugged American individualist he truly is.Woody Harrelson plays Flynt with energy and Courtney Love does at least as well as his wife.And special mention also goes to Edward Norton.The screenplay by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski is rich in detail and dialogue.But stillthe movie is not compelling enough to generate interest and great entertainment to the viewer.But stillit is a good movie to watch.".

Later of course I saw the actual Larry Flynt on TV. That was after the Clinton scandal when he offered 1 million dollars to everyone who could uncover that someone of the party' that had hunted Clinton for his adultery had committed adultery as well. In the weeks after that numerous hypocrite politicians resigned. Well done Larry Flynt you have not only shown how much hypocrites and liars are in politics but you have shown your teeth again and you have shown that you can bite too.Now on to the film this is really a good film about a kind of sad yet very meaningful life. It is a man who fought for his ideas and ideals. He was a man who risked everything for his and other people's freedom of expression. OK he was a bit of an exotic bird you may say but do to him what was done to him no way. He didn't do nothing wrong. It is sad what the juridical system did to him only for spreading a badly tasted pornographic magazine.Apart from that the actors are really great and that means everyone but there are two whom I must name. First of all Woody Harrelson Larry Flynt who delivers a really great Flynt in all of life's perspectives. He is funny mad loveable an a..hole and not to mention an irritating little controversial pimp. He is great and he would have deserved at least the Golden Globe. I love all of his ways all of his phrases all of his actions he said whatever he thought to whoever it concerned even judges and that takes balls. You know this is a controversial film but this film has taught me something It is a great good that I have the freedom to choose whether to see this film or not. That is what Flyn fought for. He indirectly fought for me to see this movie.Courtney Love Althea Flynt however was much better I loved the hair especially the one where the pony was white and the rest black with pink and blue extensions. She deserved an Oscar for the role of Flynt's drug addicted wife something she played very well maybe she was addicted once herself but nonetheless great work. Well I guess the film was just too controversial with all the fuss about the film's poster we see a lady's slip which is the American flag and Woody Harrelson lies on the woman's crotch in a Jesusonthecross like manner and all of the contents of the film.8 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "No one in today's Hollywood is going to truly outshine past pairings such as Clark Gable and Joan Crawford Cary Grant and Grace Kelly or even Rock Hudson and Doris Day.  They simply had too much mystique and showbiz magic behind them for the tabloidridden stars of today to compete with.  However based on what's out there today Clooney and Jones make a delicious gorgeous pair.  In this frothy sometimes manic production Clooney stars as an ace divorce attorney.  So successful is he that he can turn around even the most airtight cases.  Yet he has it all and is bored.  After he pulls the rug out from under one of his clients' wives Jones she sets out to exact revenge upon him.  The two play a cat and mouse game of Igotyou and yougotme with their actual feelings occasionally rising to the surface. Clooney is charm epitomized.  His jawdropping good looks are actually beginning to show minor signs of wear check out his cheek pores in that opening teeth cleaning sequence and note the onset of wrinkles and rasp in the voice  though he still looks like a god in kind lighting but thankfully he's become such a decent actor that he should have no problem continuing a strong career.  In this he is comparable to Cary Grant who remained attractive right up until his death.  Unfortunately he doesn't have QUITE the skill that Grant had but he'll do.  Some of the lingo and jargon that Clooney has to emit looks and sounds like it's over his head. Jones is astonishing.  She has without question that old time glamour and the finely honed talent to carry her roles.  Her face clothes hair...everything is stunning.  Together the two are blisteringly attractive and charismatic.  The supporting cast is great here with Rush in a surprisingly tiny role hamming it up well and Thornton presenting another one of his oddball characterizations.  Also of note are Cedric the Entertainer who is less annoying than expected and especially Adelstein as Clooney's adoring sentimental cohort.  And it's fun to see Duffy get a big screen role which beautifully utilizes her brittle noseintheair persona.  One of the funniest and most shocking moments in the film comes courtesy of Keyes who plays an asthmatic hit man.  The whole film is peppered with odd little characterizations some funny some intriguing some just bizarre.  The diner waitress is hysterical.  The hunky pool man is perfect.  Clooney's boss is unintelligible and just plain weird.  The film seems to take place in it's own little world which can sometimes be quite different from the one the rest of the audience lives in.  The quirkiness and farcical nature of the film occasionally threaten to cross it over into Zucker brothers territory but ultimately it keeps it's feet on the ground.  A couple of familiar or dull moments can't dampen the spirit of the whole.  The stars are deliriously attractive the story has a few surprises along the way and the film is very easy on the eyes and often entertaining to the ear.  There's also a delightful title sequence inspired by vintage Valentine cards.".

	schema:reviewBody "Miles Massey is an amazing divorce lawyer who has a wellearned reputation. When he takes on the case of Rex Rexroth who was caught on video cheating with another woman he successfully wins the case and leaves the wronged wife Marylin with nothing. However he also falls for her but she is planning his downfall in return for her losing everything she had.With a big name pair of leads it does look very much like the Coen's were looking for a big screen hit that would support their work to a greater extent than the loyal fan base does. As that sort of film it seems to be doing OK but I wondered at what cost to the product? The film starts well enough with an interesting case which we actually see little of however the character of Miles is enough to hold the film together. The film contains the usual mix of larger than life characters and quirky humour but the central romancing doesn't always hold true and there are stretches where the humour dips away to find that there is very little left without it.Having said that this doesn't occur often enough to be a problem and the film is still pretty good fun. The characters are it's making and there are enough of those to make it work. Clooney excels in the lead with a strange sort of humour  the same sort of character he played in O Brother if you ask me but he does seem to have a touch for the comic stuff. Jones is less assured and her character has less of the humour I expect from the Coens and is more of a straight role. The support cast is all good as they provide small snippets of humour whether it be Wheezy Joe or the rude waitress.Overall it is not the cleverest film the Coen's have done nor the funniest or most satisfying but as a multiplex pleasing romance with quirky humour it does work and should be enjoyed as that.".

	schema:reviewBody "I doubt that there are two more strikingly attractive actors in movies today than George Clooney and Catherine ZetaJones.  ZetaJones in particular has the kind of classic beauty that puts her right up there with the great screen legends of all time women like Ingrid Bergman Natalie Wood and Audrey Hepburn who with their ravishing good looks and photogenic quality came to define the ideal of female pulchritude in their time.Credit the Coen Brothers who made Intolerable Cruelty' with having the good sense to know what they had in these two stars and for exploiting it to the full.  They have allowed the actors to play off their good looks most especially Ms. ZetaJones portraying an icy golddigger who specializes in marrying rich men with the express purpose of taking them for everything they've got once the marriage is ended.  Clooney is the firstrate divorce lawyer who finally meets his match when he falls under the spell of this strangely bewitching woman. The major joy in Intolerable Cruelty' comes from watching these two tremendously attractive stars go at one another  be it in lust passion or anger.  Miles and Marylin are both seasoned gameplayers and worldclass manipulators who know how to get the better of the hapless victims who stumble headlong into their paths.  Unfortunately the film itself never lives up to its promise of becoming a slashing satire on the mores of our divorcehappy society.  The main reason for this is that the script often shoots too low in its tone opting for an overly broad slapstick approach when a slyer subtler style is what's really called for.  It's not that Intolerable Cruelty' doesn't provide its fair share of laughs it's just that we feel there should be a whole lot more of them given the pedigree of the film's makers and the highpowered acting of its amazingly gifted cast.In addition to Clooney and ZetaJones  who hit all the right notes in their playing off one another  the lineup also includes Geoffrey Rush Billy Bob Thornton Edward Herrmann Richard Jenkins and Cedric the Entertainer who steals the few scenes he's in with his manic interpretation of a private investigator who specializes in capturing wayward spouses in compromising positions.Perhaps Intolerable Cruelty' for all its moments of mirth and fun simply doesn't go far enough into the realm of outrageousness to make the concept really work.  The Coen Brothers who have proven themselves masters of the absurd in the past for some reason seem to be holding back in this film going for the easy laugh and the easy sentiment when what we really want is for them to cut loose and go for the jugular as Danny De Vito did with similar material in The War of the Roses' so many years ago.  Maybe Miles and Marylin need to be a little more nasty a trifle more cutthroat in their demeanor to bring it all to life.Intolerable Cruelty' offers some hearty chuckles and some definite eyecandy in the person of Ms. ZetaJones but when all is said and done the film is mainly just promises and not enough delivery.".

It's lean mean to the point no wasted scenes.  And it's very witty featuring dialogue and references that have clearly sailed over the average idiot's head as well as the fairweather Coen Brothers fan's head.  Joel and Ethan remind us here that a mainstream IDEA for a movie is not equivalent to a STUPID idea for a movie.  The movie mixes wild slapstick with delicious bon mots.  There's always something going on.  And the picture looks fantastic another triumph for DP Roger Deakins showing us a shimmering sunlit paradise of an almost mythical Los Angeles.  The leads George Clooney and Catherine ZetaJones are also shot to advantage  neither have looked better and Zeta Jones in particular practically sucks your breath away every time she appears in a different Rodeo Drive confection. Yowza!The film failed as almost all Coen Brothers' movies fail at the box office because while delightful and funny it's also ICECOLD.  The filmmakers as they always do distance us from the characters inviting us to contemplate them rather than to get emotionally involved with them.  This is a formula for boxoffice disaster especially for romantic comedy.  The womendemographic who came expecting a chickflick were turned off cold and the guys stayed away anyway.  Coen Brothers  fans  once again proved to be a fickle bunch lambasting the film as too  mainstream  while utterly failing to get the subtext.  These are the same  fans by the way who avoided  Lebowski  and  Hudsucker  and  Barton Fink  because it was too  excessive  andor  weird.  Make up your minds fairweathers.  In any case I'll be one of the  IToldYouSos  when a decade hence Intolerable Cruelty  will be regarded as one of the few intelligent romantic comedies made in recent times.Let me put it this way  if you think a movie in which the two romantic leads put a contract on each other is too  mainstream you've revealed yourself as a poseur who should leave the amateur reviewing to the grownups.

	schema:reviewBody "Miles Massey George Clooney is a divorce attorney whose clientele consists primarily of the rich and powerful in the Los Angeles area. He's well known for an ironclad prenuptial agreement named after him and also known for taking his clients' spouses to the cleaners. But when he works his magic against Marilyn Rexroth Catherine ZetaJones he may have picked on the wrong person.I didn't find Intolerable Cruelty very funny. I might have chuckled a couple times. The dialogue was mostly affected and pretentious to my ears. The story wasn't very interesting to me. I really couldn't get myself to care what happened to Miles or Marilyn. I've liked most of writersdirectors Joel and Ethan Coen's previous films but Intolerable Cruelty seemed to me to have little of the inventiveness and cleverness of their past efforts. I have also liked most of the past films that George Clooney Billy Bob Thornton and Geoffrey Rush have been in but here they seemed to be turning in just okay performances for bad material. Heck I even loved Clooney's turn at Batman 1997's Batman  Robin Thornton's portrayal of a rocket scientist in Armageddon 1998 and Geoffrey Rush's eccentric millionaire in House on Haunted Hill 1999 but Intolerable Cruelty just didn't work for me.Still I can't say the film was a complete failure. I'm giving it a 6 out of 10 which is equivalent to a D in my way of looking at ratings. The performances might have been just okay but they were okay not awful. The Coens managed some interesting shots such as Rush through the windshield of his car where we mostly see a reflection of trees. That was unusual and effectively conveyed the heat and brightness of a summer day the way a more traditional shot wouldn't have. The opening scene had promise to me. The Wheezy Joe subplot was fun. The slight suggestions of surrealism in Miles' boss were very enjoyable although on the other hand I found myself lamenting that surrealism wasn't the focus of the whole film.Glancing at other reviews obviously the film worked for some people. Maybe if you're more in the market for a realist drama cum light farce about divorce lawyers you'd appreciate it more than I did. But for me it has me rethinking my desire to collect all of the Coen brothers' films on DVD.".

As brothers they should have told each other that the production stank as must have been evident from the readthrough. The casting is is bad as the script which is very bad. Overthetop acting decorates the whole mess Clooney may have got away with it in 'O Brother' but miscasting like that seldom works more than once for anyone and besides he was then acting lines inside real Coensworld.Bad timing overlong scenes no sympathetic main character. You want George and ZJ to end up together but only inasmuch as then the movie might fade to credits. Incidentally there are times you fear it never will. I'd have switched off at several points but I couldn't believe they could complete this project without at least one saving grace well they couldn't Billy Bob Thornton comes along to save them just one point as far as I'm concerned. Carter Burwell's beautiful music is desperately out of place. The script is littered with pretentious quotations as if to remind us that Joel and Ethan did rather well at college. Did they? It pains me to write this as I have championed these two since 'Blood Simple' but it really is a very bad exercise in wastage of studio funds.I paused for a moment to catch my breath badly required so that I might deflate my expectations a little more scene by scene and momentarily I imagined Melanie Griffith and Kevin Spacey doing this movie. It would perhaps have been better but oh those lines would not have improved their prospects for another job!Even when not playing a bitch ZetaJones exudes heartless shallowness evidence 'The Terminal' and it seems plain that apart from the initial promise shown in 'The Darling Buds of May' that's all she had. As actor after actor attempts to portray emotional attachment it feels more and more cringworthy. Even the dependable actors are unable to build with such insipid mortar. Nothing hangs together then here comes Burwell again calling passionate musical themes reminiscent of Miller's Crossing into scenes devoid of any pulse. I feel in this association he has devalued his own work is it possible he can turn his beautiful music out at the drop of a bad line without the prime mover of a good connecting human story? Did he even see the film before writing the original score?Some Sample dialogue and believe me the Coens take credit for this You must leave the house because I left the gas main on that leaks honestly it's there in the movie then Whatever they're paying you I'll pay you double. It goes on and on and on and on forever and eventually dissolves into slapstick like DeNiro doing a bad Jim Carry part. How can you have so many good ingredients and still spoil the dinner? Did Joel and Ethan really see 'Out of Sight' and 'War of the Roses' in the same week and gamble they could just join the two together with a bad gluejob? It takes more than that at least a hint of screen chemistry. Unbearably bad intolerable cruelty. O brothers. Shame on you.".

The real Intolerable Cruelty is subjecting people to this crap AND making them pay for it.George Clooney plays Miles Massey an expert divorce attorney who is getting bored with being in bad movies. Catherine ZetaJones plays a Marylin Rexroth a golddigger who is in this film because she must have lost a bet. There are other people in the movie but I won't embarrass them with credits. This whole film is like a drunk and ditzy girl at the party  she might be nice to look at but don't get too close or you'll be bored to sleep with her silly conversation or vomited upon.I like George Clooney but no actoractress carries out a good performance in this train wreck. The jokes are not only not funny nothing is quite as hilarious as divorce except maybe domestic violence but are so wornout and tired they actually sucked the humor out of other movies. It's just another formulaic romantic comedy and an especially boring one at that.I blame it on 'reel ass' syndrome. There gets to be a point in any popular director's life where if that director so much as directs his ass toward a reel of film a substantial number of people will see the movie.

I watched this film in DVD format since the original release didn't last too long and when I tried to see it it had departed from the local screens. It was a shame because any Coen picture is worth seeing. Spoilers herein.This comedy was highly enjoyable because of George Clooney. His take on Miles Massey the reptilian lawyer he plays is one of the best things he has done in a while. Mr. Clooney should engage more in lighter roles such as this because it appears he is a natural for playing these eccentric types where he excels.Miles is a tough divorce lawyer who will stop at nothing to get his male clients to get rid of nasty situations and demanding former wives until he meets a beautiful creature named Marilyn. She proves to be his downfall. Catherine ZetaJones is perfect as this gold digger in search of riches.Marilyn is left with nothing when she divorces Rex but that defeat she will turn into a triumph at a later date. Marilyn is calculating and nasty she wants to get all she can from all these rich husbands and live a life of luxury in L.A. L.A. Land.This movie has a lot of funny moments. A lot of good performers appear briefly in the movie. Geoffrey Rush is enjoyable as Donovan who suffers his own nasty divorce. Edward Herrmann is equally effective as Rex Marilyn's naughty husband. Also Cedric the Entertainer has a couple of good scenes where he is hilarious. The only one that doesn't get to do a whole lot is Billy Bob Thurnton who is totally wasted as the fake husband Howard.Ultimately the film belongs to George Clooney. It was a pleasure watching him being the object of Marilyn's own revenge only to find out at the end that she couldn't resist him at all.".

	schema:headline " Interesting Canadian film that offers food for thought";
	schema:reviewBody "It is fascinating how the horrors of World War II continue to spark off good intelligent cinema around the world even after a gap of over half a century. Emotional Arithmetic based on a novel by Matt Cohen a Jew? begins with an astounding remark If you ask me if I believe in God I am forced to answer does God believe in us? The film is not about atheism. It reflects on the terrible scars left by war on orphans on individuals who stand up and protest when wrong is done on relationships forged in times of stress pain and loss.The charm of Paolo Barzman's film rests considerably in the hands of the capable actorsSusan Sarandon Max von Sydow Chistopher Plummer and Gabriel Bryneall who have a maturity to carry off their parts in the film with grace. Ms Sarandon has matured into a formidable actress in recent films and this one showcases her talent.Screened at the 12th International Film Festival of Kerala India the film forced this viewer to compare the contents of Emotional Arithmetic with those of a Swiss documentary A Song for Argyris also shown at the festival. Both films underlined the difficulties in forgetting tragic events in our lives and moving on. Both films indirectly discuss the bonding of survivors of tragic events. As I watched the film I could not help but note the growing interest filmmakers in family bondsin Emotional Arithmetic it is merely a subplot balancing a virtual family that suffered during the Nazi rule with that of a real family comprising three generations living in idyllic conditions in Canada.This film would offer considerable material to reflect on for the viewer beyond the actual events shown on the screen.Though there is no mention of a divine presence the use of the vertical crane shots of the dining table and the car at interesting junctures in the film seem to suggest this debatable interpretation. This Canadian film provides eyecandy locations that grab your attention from the opening shot. Mesmerizing crane shots are part of the film that provide an unusual charm to the high technical quality of the film which becomes all the more apparent on the large cinemascope screen. So is the competent editing of the sequences that make the viewing process delectable. Like another Canadian film Away from her shown at the 11th edition of the festival Canadian cinema has proved capable of dealing with serious subjects with the help of international actors without resorting to the commercial gimmicks of mainstream American cinema and employing high standards of craftsmanship in the true tradition of the famous Canadian filmmaker Claude Jutra!".

Emotional Arithmetic based on a novel by Matt Cohen a Jew? begins with an astounding remark If you ask me if I believe in God I am forced to answer does God believe in us? The film is not about atheism. It reflects on the terrible scars left by war on orphans on individuals who stand up and protest when wrong is done on relationships forged in times of stress pain and loss.The charm of Paolo Barzman's film rests considerably in the hands of the capable actorsSusan Sarandon Max von Sydow Chistopher Plummer and Gabriel Bryneall who have a maturity to carry off their parts in the film with grace. Ms Sarandon has matured into a formidable actress in recent films and this one showcases her talent.Screened at the 12th International Film Festival of Kerala India the film forced this viewer to compare the contents of Emotional Arithmetic with those of a Swiss documentary A Song for Argyris also shown at the festival. Both films underlined the difficulties in forgetting tragic events in our lives and moving on. Both films indirectly discuss the bonding of survivors of tragic events. As I watched the film I could not help but note the growing interest filmmakers in family bondsin Emotional Arithmetic it is merely a subplot balancing a virtual family that suffered during the Nazi rule with that of a real family comprising three generations living in idyllic conditions in Canada.This film would offer considerable material to reflect on for the viewer beyond the actual events shown on the screen.Though there is no mention of a divine presence the use of the vertical crane shots of the dining table and the car at interesting junctures in the film seem to suggest this debatable interpretation. This Canadian film provides eyecandy locations that grab your attention from the opening shot. Mesmerizing crane shots are part of the film that provide an unusual charm to the high technical quality of the film which becomes all the more apparent on the large cinemascope screen. So is the competent editing of the sequences that make the viewing process delectable. Like another Canadian film Away from her shown at the 11th edition of the festival Canadian cinema has proved capable of dealing with serious subjects with the help of international actors without resorting to the commercial gimmicks of mainstream American cinema and employing high standards of craftsmanship in the true tradition of the famous Canadian filmmaker Claude Jutra!";

	schema:reviewBody "AUTUMN HEARTS A NEW BEGINNING is another one of those independent films that lacks an audience until the DVD is released. Granted it is not based on subject matter that titillates the big movie house throngs but it is a warmly tender film about the emotional effects of historical traumas and how each of our histories molds our lives. It is a superb work on every level. Director Paolo Barzman brings to life the novel 'Emotional Arithmetic' by Matt Cohen as adapted for the screen by Jefferson Lewis with a sterling cast of consummate actors. The impact is lasting. Melanie Winters Susan Sarandon lives on a picturesque farm in Canada with her retired university professor husband David Christopher Plummer and their grown son Benjamin Roy Dupuis an unexplained single father of his own son Timmy Dakota Goyo and caregiver for his physically ailing father and mentally fragile mother. Melanie lives in the past as a child in 1942 she was interned in Drancy an internment camp outside of Paris where she bonded with a young man Jakob Bronski and an Irish lad Christopher  taking on the responsibility of maintaining the written history of the camp at Jakob's request so that atrocities such as they were witnessing would never occur again 'Always remember'. At one point Jakob turned himself over to the Nazis to allow Melanie and Christopher to be released. Now years later Melanie is still cataloging all of the atrocities in the world as they appear in the newspaper and continues to attempt to find Jakob. Jakob writes to her and soon is arriving in Canada as an elderly man Max von Sydow traveling with his surprise guest the adult Christopher Gabriel Byrne. It is this visit that reunites Melanie Jakob and Christopher that allows closure to their turbulent history and a healing not only for the three survivors but for Melanie's family also. It is as though it took a quiet time in the beauty of nature and the lifesustaining atmosphere of a farm to cleanse these 'autumn hearts' from the anguish of the past. Not all of the elements of the story are resolved we never learn much about Benjamin and his state of solo fatherhood David's private life that so incenses Melanie etc. But these are minor exclusions in this beautifully sculpted story and film. The cinematography by Luc Montpellier and the musical score by Normand Corbeil capture not only the beauty of the Canadian landscape and lush colors of the farm in autumn but also heighten the authenticity of the Drancy camp experience in the black and white flashbacks. This is an exceptional film that deserves a wide audience. Grady Harp".

It is a powerful story that has roots in the very fabric of human history and the struggle for meaning in life.The existential struggles and scarred souls of three Nazi concentration camp survivors meet after 35 years. Lessons are learned by all involved. The perhaps greatest lesson is the need for the young to understand the life and circumstances their parents faced. And ironically the inability of time to seem anything except indifferent to human suffering and existence itself. The past and its sufferings need give way to time's indiffernce. Live and love in the present. That is the crux of this fine drama.I donot suggest this film for insensitive slobbery and obviously some here saw nothing in it. It is as if a great film was cast before them and all they saw was a boring pace and words and emotions they could never feel or associate themselves with.I have given this film a NINE. That for me is almost an impossible thing to do if you review my reviews.Congratulations on a moving intellectual and poignant cinema.".

The location where this film was shot is beautiful the film uses a recurring color scheme through out that really makes the audience not just see it but feel it as well. The same can be said for the style and camera work in the flashback scenes scenes that are not over used and that could easily be the emotion of the film but wisely in my opinion the director doesn't go that route and leaves the emotion in the here and now. Summed up this film was easily my biggest surprise film of this year which is my favorite kind of film one that I expect nothing and am rewarded with some thing truly great.

I'm not even sure it was ever shown commercially in the United States. It is the type of film that causes fans of good acting and production to be grateful for DVD's.The story and the characters may be a bit exaggerated but that can be forgiven because the viewer is offered insight into some extremely interesting personalities.In 1942 Melanie Lansing was the pubescent daughter of American Jews living in France. It is not fully explained in the film but Melanie has been separated from her parents and sent to Drancy. Drancy Link was a transit camp not far from Paris where those unwelcome in the Nazi world were prepared from shipment to concentration camps. At Drancy Melanie meets Christopher Lewis who is an Irish lad about her same age. Christopher introduces Melanie to Jakob Bronski who is a young Jewish scholar in his twenties. Jakob is able to bribe the officials so that Melanie and Christopher are not sent to concentration camps in Germany. Just as Jakob is being packed off to a concentration camp he gives Melanie a book with the obligation to record all who pass through Drancy. These events exist as Melanie's memories in the film that takes place in 1985.Melanie Lansing Winters lives on a small farm in an idyllic setting in Eastern Canada with her husband David who is a semiretired college professor. Also at the farm for a momentous event in Melanie's life are her son and grandson. It seems that Melanie has spent her life in support of oppressed groups of people and she has tracked down Jakob who was first sent to a German concentration camp and then to a Russian camp. In both he suffered unspeakable tortures both physical and psychological. Melanie has invited Jakob to her home offering him a place to stay for the rest of his life. It is clear from the beginning that her husband is not as enthusiastic about this plan as Melanie for reasons that will be exposed as the story continues.Jakob arrives at the airport with a somewhat unsettling surprise for Melanie. He has brought Christopher with whom Melanie had lost contact. Christopher has nurtured his love for Melanie for over forty years and hopes that she returns his feelings.The action in this tale takes place during one weekend and at a welcoming dinner for Jakob that Melanie has arranged. During that time we gain insight into Melanie her husband David their son Benjamin Christopher and Jakob. The story revolving around this fortythree year old encounter is a bit weak but the characters are solid as concrete as their emotions can be applied to anyone anywhere at any time.A powerhouse of actors bring these characters to life.Christopher Plummer is husband David who appears first as an unfeeling lunk but emerges as a complex man whose life has been shaped by his love for an obsessive woman.Roy Dupuis is solid as a son who has had to endure a life dominated by two opposite poles of overwhelming parents.Dakota Goyo is beautiful as the grandson who is able to touch the innocence still contained in all of the wounded adults around him.Gabriel Byrne is perfect as Christopher a successful man still gripped by a love that began almost a half century ago.Max von Sydow gives a hypnotic performance of a man who has suffered unimaginable tortures and has survived to live the last of his life in a peace created by his own mind.The unstable and fanatical Melanie is played by Susan Sarandon. Has she ever given a bad performance? In this film she gives us a woman who is basically unlikable but her considerable acting talent forces us to care and emphasize with the emotionally damaged Melanie.From the description you may think that this is a tragic tale about a group of lost souls but the DVD title is a spoiler to the conclusion of the film. This is a beautiful story of lost souls found and it is solid solid entertainment.".

	schema:reviewBody "My first reaction to this film It sucks beans.But I gave it a lot of thought afterwards and now the morning after I think it is a very compelling picture worthy of a 2nd watch.First I'll tell you why I initially hated it maybe sparing you the misery. Everything about this film is extremely deceptive setting up emotional expectations that are never fulfilled. The USA title Autumn Hearts A New Beginning is way off the mark and the DVD packaging is awful describing it as a tender love story of redemption healing and reconciliation. HUH?? Did the marketing department even bother to watch the movie? If you watch this movie expecting a sentimental tearjerker or a tender love story you'll find yourself hurling popcorn at the screen in disgust. It is none of those things despite the sweeping lush cinematography and Hallmarkgreetingcard setting complete with melodramatic musical score that does its best to yank our emotions to the surface. Whether deliberate or not the film is very misleading in that respect.If not a cryfest what do you get instead? You get a marvellous philosophical question that goes to the root of what we are as human beings. What is our job on this planet and what are our limits of duty vs. survival? The movie investigates four major characters struggling with the same question each taking a markedly different approach. Four peoples' lives have been twisted out of shape by the injustice of humanity. How do they react? One Gabriel Byrne suppresses the trauma under a veneer of British civility  reticence. Another Max von Sydow has had the memories forcibly erased by chemicals and exectroshock experiments though he still retains an inexplicable connection. A third character Susan Sarandon obsessively collects her memories appointing herself as a sort of librarian of human injustice and in so doing starts to lose her mind. And a fourth character Christopher Plummer is a secondary victim suffering by association and trying his best to move ahead while realizing the impossibility of that notion.The dynamic is incredibly well played. There is no clearcut answer and each character plays against the others hoping to find the route to peace. I didn't find this to be an emotional film but instead a very intellectual puzzle. The original title Emotional Arithmetic while not as poetic or appealing as Autumn Hearts is definitely more appropriate if you choose to view the film as I described it. It is an almost scientific approach to the manipulation of emotions bringing us back to the main question is our job to hold on to the past like living history books toruted  martyred for the sake of teaching future generations? Or is our job to bury the ugly face of past injustice and focus on moving forward ourselves? However way you choose the answer is represented by one or more of the four characters.This film is a slowpaced philosophical soul teaser wrapped up in a brightcoloured emotional package. There's definitely a lot going on much like a Wim Wenders film Lisbon Story Paris Texas or a Hirokazu Koreeda film Maborosi After Life though not nearly that slow. Another film I might compare it to is The Shipping News by Lasse Hallstrm but that comparison is mainly due to the director's way of using landscape  nature to create a mood. One thing about this film that no one will deny is that the setting Quebec in the early Autumn is about as beautiful  dreamy as any place on Earth.Yes I know Gabriel Byrne is Irish not British!".

	onyx:emotionText "My first reaction to this film It sucks beans.But I gave it a lot of thought afterwards and now the morning after I think it is a very compelling picture worthy of a 2nd watch.First I'll tell you why I initially hated it maybe sparing you the misery. Everything about this film is extremely deceptive setting up emotional expectations that are never fulfilled. The USA title Autumn Hearts A New Beginning is way off the mark and the DVD packaging is awful describing it as a tender love story of redemption healing and reconciliation. HUH?? Did the marketing department even bother to watch the movie? If you watch this movie expecting a sentimental tearjerker or a tender love story you'll find yourself hurling popcorn at the screen in disgust. It is none of those things despite the sweeping lush cinematography and Hallmarkgreetingcard setting complete with melodramatic musical score that does its best to yank our emotions to the surface. Whether deliberate or not the film is very misleading in that respect.If not a cryfest what do you get instead? You get a marvellous philosophical question that goes to the root of what we are as human beings. What is our job on this planet and what are our limits of duty vs. survival? The movie investigates four major characters struggling with the same question each taking a markedly different approach. Four peoples' lives have been twisted out of shape by the injustice of humanity. How do they react? One Gabriel Byrne suppresses the trauma under a veneer of British civility  reticence. Another Max von Sydow has had the memories forcibly erased by chemicals and exectroshock experiments though he still retains an inexplicable connection. A third character Susan Sarandon obsessively collects her memories appointing herself as a sort of librarian of human injustice and in so doing starts to lose her mind. And a fourth character Christopher Plummer is a secondary victim suffering by association and trying his best to move ahead while realizing the impossibility of that notion.The dynamic is incredibly well played. There is no clearcut answer and each character plays against the others hoping to find the route to peace. I didn't find this to be an emotional film but instead a very intellectual puzzle.

I agree that more of the past should have been developed and tied to the characters in the present. For me it was a bit confusing that it seemed like such a modern time and I just didn't believe that they had survived the Holocaust. I felt they should have shown more hauntings from the past and perhaps a bit more clinging to each other after having survived in the emotional shipwreck of Drancy. I think perhaps more of their message could have been brought out if they had just spent more time in the scenes from the past. After seeing this movie I did some research on Drancy and was shocked to learn it was the French with the approval of the Nazi's who did this. There should have been more history lessons I feel so we could see the larger picture. Anyway I loved Max von Sydow's portrayal of Jakob and I liked Susan Sarandon's suffering but I just felt it seemed to be disconnected from what happened in the past. I was expecting a multi hankie movie and only shed an occasional tear. All the actors are really good and this is well worth the money to rent or own and to open discussions about the atrocities of WWII and the Nazi regime.".

I think it was just as good as The Dead Next Doora B grade zombie flick that gets a lot of attention as being an unknown classic. This is a fun film to watch if you don't expect too much from it. Don't expect great actingtop quality production and whatever else most people think it takes to make a good film. But if your a fan of B grade horror movies or on a quest to see and own every zombie movie ever madesuch as myself give this one a chance. I was surprised to see one of the zombies in this movie was Bill Hinzman the cemetery zombie who chases after Barbara in the original Night Of The Living Dead. I guess you could say he is reprising his role so to speak. I think he also directed and produced this film. I must admit this film does seem to borrow a little from the original Night Of The Living Dead but I don't care. This movie was fun and entertaining to watch and that's all I ask for. I was surprised at the amount of gore as well. The version I got was an uncut one entitled Revenge Of The Living Zombies. Once again a pleasant surprise.

The film by no means gets close to the entertainment level of the movie it draws inspiration from Night of the Living Dead but is still entertaining to a degree despite being highly predictable. As stated before a farmer uncovers a wooden box with a bizarre warning on it that had obviously been buried for decades and upon opening it releases the zombie Hinzman who starts his rampage of undead terror. The acting is not the greatest and the story drags at times but some scenes are pretty spooky such as when Hinzman and some other zombies wander into town and attack a family in a suburban house. The ending which I won't reveal here is highly predictable and you can see it coming a long time off. All in all Flesheater may not be the greatest horror film ever made or even a great zombie movie but it's not totally awful either.".

Of course Bill Hinzman RIP my good man you will be missed the cemetery zombie from NOTLD directs and stars but did you know that when George Romero and company set out to make NOTLD the working title was Night of the Flesh Eaters yet another film 1964's The Flesh Eaters discouraged George from using Flesh Eater in the title but Bill seemed to use Flesh Eater to further the NOTLD mythos. also spoiler alert the little fella who pops the remaining two teenage survivors in the head believing them to be zombies when they scurry out of their hiding spot in the barn well that fella was the same guy who shout Ben in the head when he peered out of the arm house in NOTLD. Seems Bill was trying to make a subtle point. I loved the Pennsylvania scenery in this film and all the time watching I was really dying for an Iron City Beer what with all the product placement. I love this movie for the bad acting the camp the nonplot and all the bravado Bill put into this. Bill is the Ed Wood of the zombie film. any serious NOTLD fan should watch this for the shear nostalgia.".

	onyx:emotionText "A couple of things that are really a treat for any NOTLD fan. Of course Bill Hinzman RIP my good man you will be missed the cemetery zombie from NOTLD directs and stars but did you know that when George Romero and company set out to make NOTLD the working title was Night of the Flesh Eaters yet another film 1964's The Flesh Eaters discouraged George from using Flesh Eater in the title but Bill seemed to use Flesh Eater to further the NOTLD mythos. also spoiler alert the little fella who pops the remaining two teenage survivors in the head believing them to be zombies when they scurry out of their hiding spot in the barn well that fella was the same guy who shout Ben in the head when he peered out of the arm house in NOTLD. Seems Bill was trying to make a subtle point. I loved the Pennsylvania scenery in this film and all the time watching I was really dying for an Iron City Beer what with all the product placement. I love this movie for the bad acting the camp the nonplot and all the bravado Bill put into this. Bill is the Ed Wood of the zombie film. any serious NOTLD fan should watch this for the shear nostalgia.";

Anyway I'm a huge fan of horror movies and I checked out the horror section and I caught a glimpse of a cover box of this film. the VHS of this is called REVENGE OF THE LIVING ZOMBIES I picked it up and after viewing it was I disappointed hell no! This was a good zombie film that is underatted so much because some people think this is a copy of the infamous NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. Okay people listen to me yes the ending rips off night but thats about it! The only other similarity was the fact of zombies walking around farmfields. People need to watch this and see it for what it truly is A GOOD MOVIE WITH SOME NICE ACTING AND MEMORABLE SCENES. Now that I'm done with that heres the plot A bunch off teens take a tractor ride into some woods to have sex and party. Nearby a farmer accidentally unleashes a zombified sacrifice. Farmer gets killed he returns to life both start killing teens two becomes 4 4 becomes 6. you know. The music is great and it adds greatly to the atmosphere of the film. creepy piano music and the area its in just has a great creepy atmosphere to it. This gore is awesome savini like gore. Heads are blown off throats are ripped out a cop is mutilated in his car a heart is pulled out some impalings the bedroom scene if you see it you'll know what I mean. A good and underatted creepy zombie film don't listen to what others say see it and you might be surprised.".

Typical 80's acting. The plot was no different than any other zombie movie but that's what I love about it. Stupid teens getting attacked by the undead or the living dead rather. The action started right off the bat which is a great thing. The music was spooky and quite creepy at times. I was also impressed with the makeup effects. Fairly realistic for the time it was made. High body count with nice gore. Overall I really enjoyed this. A classic gore fest with gratuitous nudity for anyone who loves gore high body count boobs zombies and horror. A very good underground zombie film. A must see for horror hounds.".

Little did they know that this deceased man is in fact very much alive in the form of a zombie. One by one the actual living are falling victim and becoming zombies. Eventually there are zombies everywhere and someone needs to stop them but who? Actors The problem with this film is the amazingly poor choice of actors. To say it plain and simple they just can't act at all. The most realistic acting in this film is the zombies. The reactions from the actors are the worst I have ever seen. The characters that are living just don't have anything special about them and are hardly memorable. The only character which I can remember the name of the lead zombie but only because his name is the title of the film. There is just no emotion felt with the characters. The end scene where the guy and girl gets shot I wonder where they got that idea from is meant to be emotional but you just can't feel anything. You just don't simply care that they've decided.Music If you've ever seen a classic episode of Doctor Who then you will know exactly what type of music in this film is. The soundtrack used is more of a techno scifi feeling and only fits with a select few scenes. It doesn't let you forget it anytime soon as it's basically repeated throughout the film. Basically it's just a badly composed soundtrack.Special Effects The special effects are one of the things in which are not faulty in this film. They are actually very decent and are well made. Although some scenes have effects which are so obvious they are not that bad. If they put as much effort into their soundtrack and actors then the film has the chance to have been a lot better.Conclusion 'FleshEater' suffers from a lot of problems. I would go as far as saying the special effects are fantastic with the rest being bad. The film is that bad it can often be funny but don't go into this film if you're expecting a serious zombie flick. It's often repetitive with a lot of chances to guess what happens next. Also if you're a redblooded male u would be pleased as there is a lot of nudity. You can tell when there is too much nudity when you start getting the feeling that the filmmakers are just throwing in random naked women. I'll leave it up to you to choose but if you want to enjoy 88 minutes of laughable acting then watch this otherwise avoid.WOW... You're supposed to say trick or treat.

There are some wonderful eat scenes great head explosions and nice tits!  I think it great that Hinzman the first zombie seen in The Night Of The Living Dead who walks in the cemetary to chase Barbara should reprise his role and eat flesh once again!  If you can just get past the extremely noticable Western Pennsylvanian accent and granted the ended is a pretty much the same as Night Of The Living Dead  which by the way the man at the end of this movie who shoots the only 2 surviving teens is the same man who shoots the only survivor in Night Of The Living Dead at the end of that movie as well then a person may see an artistic work of art and zombie gore that fans want and expect!

If you can just get past the extremely noticable Western Pennsylvanian accent and granted the ended is a pretty much the same as Night Of The Living Dead  which by the way the man at the end of this movie who shoots the only 2 surviving teens is the same man who shoots the only survivor in Night Of The Living Dead at the end of that movie as well then a person may see an artistic work of art and zombie gore that fans want and expect!  I reccomend this movie to all horror fans!By the way Rik Juanita really enjoyed it also!";

	schema:reviewBody "A note for all you budding horror film directorsThe basic requirement of any zombie film is you should be really scared of the zombies and the background music score should be really creepy. Also it helps for the film to have a solid plot. The zombie effects and acting should be top notch. Casting should be really good and the character's introduction and development in the film should be good.This film rises above its shortcomings in the sense of poor acting and character development average special effects and zombie makeup effects and poor sound effects and background music score. From its poor opening start and very poor zombie acting the film plods on and on while gaining a good pace in the gore department. The victims are killed in various ways the common one being a bite attack on the throat.The plot is standard for a zombie film teenagers enjoying themselves on someones farm are attacked by a zombie who has been released from his coffin. All hell breaks loose as a fight for survival ensues and the zombies keep gaining strength in numbers. Hinzman shows he is an ambitious amateur at direction. He could have gotten help and pointers from Andrea Bianchi Lucio Fulci and George Romero.The best zombie films I have seen are 1. Burial Ground 1981 directed by Andrea Bianchi. 2. Zombie 1979 directed by Lucio Fulci. 3. The Living Dead at Manchester Morgue 1974 directed by Jorge Grau. 4. Return of the Living Dead III 1993 by Brian Yuzna. 5. The Reanimator Trilogy of films. 6. Romero's Dawn Of The Dead Day Of The Dead and Land Of The Dead. 7. Savini's remake of Romero's Night Of The Living Dead. 8. The Evil Dead Trilogy by Sam Raimi.With this collection of films you never will need to see another zombie film ever again.Cheers to all you horror addicts out there.".

Rutan Kim Lisa Smith Carrie Denise Morrone and Bill Mark Strycula decide to camp out in the woods for a night of fun and relaxation. As they start to enjoy themselves they are stumbled upon by a ravenous Flesheater S. William Hinzman who attacks them and starts to attack them along with a series of past victims and force them to flee into the forest. Finding an abandoned farm on the edge of the forest they seek shelter inside and barricade themselves inside to prepare for the attack only for the creatures to break inside and slaughter most of them. After managing to get away they realize that the zombies have invaded a local town and must fight them out to get away from the evergrowing legion of zombies.The Good News This one here was actually pretty good. One of the best areas to this is the great violence and gore on display. While not up to the gloriousness of some of the other entries out there in the genre there's enough here to make it seem really bloody and gory with a high enough body count to make it seem like there's a literal walltowall bloodshed. Here we get tons of bites to the arms legs neck and shoulders a pitchfork to the chest intestines ripped out through the stomach a hand punched through the back and comes out bloody on the front and the usual feature of the flesh being seen to be devoured. There's a whole lot more in here which is really nice and gets a lot of mileage out of it's bloody shenanigans. The film also has a lot of action which really helps it out tremendously. The last half of the film nearly thirty minutes plus is direct headtohead confrontations with the zombies and that leaves a lot of fun times to be had from this. Since it starts with the posse on the outskirts trying to get into the town there's some pretty fun gunfights to be had out in the desert surroundings tons of bloodied corpses getting shot down and other fun stuff. There's also the fact that they do get into the town and start battling the zombies in town including some rather nice and fun encounters between them in the town. These are the film's best moments as the gunhappy posse acts in great fashion of shooting everything that moves and that makes for some really good times. Also quite nice if not up to par is the first battle at night which is mostly featured for it's spectacular and creepy car encounter that is one of the best suspense scenes in the film and features some extra blood and gore to make it even more worthwhile. There's small scenes here and there which also work well including the useless scene with the family that is saved mostly by the full nudity displayed and the fact that the kids are actually killed a surprisingly rare move. The releasing of the zombie out in the woods is really good and the whole woodland setting is pretty creepy at times. The twist at the end is a really nice shock playing into conventions nicely and comes off well. These here are what work for the film.The Bad News There wasn't much to this one that really didn't work. The lowbudget factor for the gore and overall feel don't exactly feel really big and out there being quite obvious in that they're low and not quite up to most standards by being so obvious in they're lowered ability. There's also the rather long middle segment where there's nothing at all that happens in here from the happenings with the townspeople on the verge of being attacked and from there it stops the normal plot and just has the other section of the film that features these and it's quite distracting at times. The last thing to this is the really terriblelooking zombie makeup. They don't look like traditional zombies as it's just white makeup on the face and overdubbed growling and compared to other entries in the zombie genre these here aren't that impressive. Otherwise this one here wasn't that bad.The Final Verdict A thoroughly enjoyable zombie film that has a lot to like about it and a few really noticeable flaws to keep it down. If you're into the lowbudget zombie genre have a tolerance for the cheesy 80s films or the fans of the original while those who aren't big on the first two categories should heed caution.Rated R Graphic Violence Language Full Nudity and a sex scene".

	schema:reviewBody "Flesh Eater aka Revenge of the Living Zombies aka Zombie Nosh is directed by and stars Bill Hinzman the first zombie you see in Night of the Living Dead the one that chases Barbara through the cemetery. The movie tells the story of a group of college teens who disappear into the woods one Halloween night for a little party. The farm they are residing on however was once the area of a group of people who practiced satanic rituals and when a farmer uncovers the grave of one of the corpses it rises attacks that farmers and kids and VOILA! Zombie mayhem! There really isn't much to say about this movie as the plot line is almost identical to Night of the Living Dead. Don't be surprised if some of the sequences or ahem ENDINGS! ahem resemble Night of the Living Dead or other zombie films of the 70's and 80's. The acting here often receives a lot of criticism but if you put the skill level with movies like The Dead Next Door then you should be able to bear this this seems like it even had a bigger budget. The movie contains some excellent gore scenes which was surprising as the movie only bears an R rating. Things to look forward to in this one included a nose being bitten off a couple of hearts being ripped out a pitchfork the to chest of a teenager and a disturbing scene where a zombie attacks a little girl just about to begin her trickortreating run.For some reason this movie is one of the more disturbing zombie movies I own. I associate it with believability reasons. This film takes place in the woods and a small farm town around Pennsylvania. The area resembles many of the areas around my University here in New England and I think that it just stuck me as more frightening. I've always seen zombies in the tropical islands or the big cities so for some reason it was a bit scary to see them in my own home turf. The version that I am reviewing is Flesh Eater from the Zombie Pack 2 released by Shriek Show entertainment. As I always recommend GO GET THE ZOMBIE PACK 2 IF YOU LIKE THESE FILMS! I had always viewed this movie as the least desired of the three in the pack however I now all hold them with equal weight after viewing them all. This movie is a great lowbudget zombie flick with tons of gore nudity and zombies! Do yourself a favor a grab a copy of this under the radar zombie flick and give it a view.".

This atmospheric film takes place in a French chteau where the master of the castle Sir Remy struggles to forget the memories of his former wife. He decides to marry a virgin Mathilde and along with some prurient friends sets out to corrupt the naive Mathilde.The plot isn't too complex and of course there is a lot of sex but we do see the story unfold through the eyes of Mathilde. Everyone from Sir Remy to the housekeeping staff is as energetic as rabbits. The denouement takes place in a large castle chamber where Mathilde is prepared by Sir Remy's...deflowering assistant. The assistant is quickly shoved aside and dismissed when he hurts her and Sir Remy then consummates the marriage with Mathilde. Although I don't appreciate rape scenes or passively acquiescent female characters in any film the scene was brief and Mathilde after being socialized to life in the chteau later on seems to enjoy her new role as mistress of the castle.This film has a few key traits that makes it stand out for me it is a low budget French porn with an actual plot filmed in a chteau in the French countryside in the early 1990s. This fact alone should garner it a cult following. And the addition of the attractive Draghixa and Lydia Chanel should elevate it to the pantheon of great porn films if such a thing exists of all time.".

I have it on my hard disk and still click on it occasionally sometimes only to watch the erotic solo dance number that serves as the background for the opening credits. Excellent fastpaced direction with exceptional acting especially for a porn flick. Definitely a movie that a woman will appreciate for all kinds of reasons.

	schema:reviewBody "Yes this movie is not quite what one would expect from Richard Pryor...light on the cussing a touch of being almost a family comedy but not quite that tame. In this movie we have a man who is laid off and is offered a very nice job in Boise. Of course his daughter is rather upset about the prospect of going there however his wife and twin sons are a bit more supportive. Also happy to see the family go is the crazy neighbor played rather good by Randy Quaid. A neighbor who for some reason must cut his rather small lawn with an industrial mower. Well he has a couple of moving agencies give their appraisal of what it would take to move and he goes with the more expensive as the cheap ones look like recently escaped convicts or something. They find a nice house in Boise where they meet the delightful owners who tell great jokes about how they are going to take everything from the doors to the pool with them. Then he finds just the perfect guy to drive one of his vehicles to the new house. Well everything begins to unravel rather quickly as the movers turn out to be familiar faces he does not want to see the jokes on them with the new house and the driver of the car has a bit of a mental problem. So all in all a funny movie a few of the jokes miss the marks such as the giving the wrong finger thing however most are pretty good like how the twin sons run track. So for a rather light Richard Pryor comedy that still has some good laughs give this movie a try.".

Also happy to see the family go is the crazy neighbor played rather good by Randy Quaid. A neighbor who for some reason must cut his rather small lawn with an industrial mower. Well he has a couple of moving agencies give their appraisal of what it would take to move and he goes with the more expensive as the cheap ones look like recently escaped convicts or something. They find a nice house in Boise where they meet the delightful owners who tell great jokes about how they are going to take everything from the doors to the pool with them. Then he finds just the perfect guy to drive one of his vehicles to the new house. Well everything begins to unravel rather quickly as the movers turn out to be familiar faces he does not want to see the jokes on them with the new house and the driver of the car has a bit of a mental problem. So all in all a funny movie a few of the jokes miss the marks such as the giving the wrong finger thing however most are pretty good like how the twin sons run track. So for a rather light Richard Pryor comedy that still has some good laughs give this movie a try.";

At first they don't like the idea but what has to be done is clear so they head up to go West but run into one problem after another.In my opinion Pryor was the greatest stand up comic in history. There really wasn't anyone better at that Rrated type of humor and he could take perfectly normal situations and turn them into comic gold. His stand up films are some of the greatest out there but sadly his talents really didn't translate to the big screen. His movies were mostly misses which is too bad considering his talent. I know MOVING isn't technically a good film but I must admit that I have a nostalgic thing for it and for the most part it makes me laugh.Again if you're expecting a classic comedy or even a wellmade one then it's best to not watch this film because it's kind of bland in ways and the direction is certainly lacking. What I do enjoy about the film is that it allows Pryor to play the nice guy that he has been doing throughout his career but they also let him enjoy a Rrating which is something kind of rare for the actor. He really does a great job here playing the nice and calm guy who keeps having bad things happen to him until he snaps.Pryor is great here and really works well with the role and there's also some nice support for him. You've got Randy Quaid playing a couple roles and he's a lot of fun as is Dana Carvey in his scenes. Both Beverly Todd and Stacey Dash are good in their roles and there's even a funny cameo by a legendary comedian that I won't ruin. There are some funny moments scattered throughout the film but I think the best moments are when Pryor simply snaps and goes on some foulmouthed rants.MOVING isn't a classic film and I'm not sure most people will enjoy it. I do find it to be rather charming in its own way though.".

Randy Quaid also shines as his neighbor and deranged exVietnam vet Frank Crawford who childishly abuses Arlo. There are some cool small roles from the likes of Rodney Dangerfield and pro wrestler King Kong Bundy as well.Not the best Richard Pryor comedy out there but a good one and a lot better than the critics at the time opined.

	schema:reviewBody "Yeah I thought this being a straight to video B grade this would be a miss of a movie. My Sister recommended it to me and I passed it off. Coming across half of it on t.v. one night this corrected my qualms about this movie quick as I eventually did hire it on video in 94. The movie is a cheap laugh riot steered by the great comic timing and priceless expressions from Pryor who after a couple of weeks of being jobless he's just been thrown a work offer he can't refuse that involves moving.... again. His whole family especially his daughter driven to desperate and funny measures are dead set against it. Finally forced to make the big trip his hell has only begun. He has the removalists from hell that includes King Kong Bundy so you don't want to hypothesize on breakages and damages to valuables etc. His driveaway guy has personality disorders and the last tenants of their new home in Boise were whack jobs while also his new neighbor is the arsehole brother of an equally irritating guy who shared former neighborhood residence with Pryor. What are the chances? Moving is cheap side splitting and quite inventive laughter while also taking quips at all the downfalls and hassles of moving where behind the quips are realistic clouds of what's involved in making the big move and the stuff ups that can happen where they've just all been peppered with comedy or inanity. The catalyst is very real when you approach it from Pryor's point of view. The rebellious daughter who stymies their chances to sell their old home was real where as I said before she's much opposed to moving and kind of brought shades of my rebellious in the home. The frequently funny film also brings Rambo into the picture. This is a great vehicle for Pryor and though not everyone will see this film my way and I'm talking Pryor here's one not to overlook but just see. We also see that being black twin brothers does have it's advantages on the running field and in the classroom. The movie does have some sharp humor too where as I said laughs are continual where identity changing Carvey is a hoot.".

The film's writers and producers obviously couldn't make their minds up about what direction they were going to take this in. Family comedy Pryor vehicle or kick ass suburban nightmare sendoff? In they end they tried to attach all three and not surprisingly the result is a poorly paced and confused affair lacking coherence and overall good direction.'The Burbs' was intelligent because it kind of put you in a safe and familiar environment then turned it on it's head. It also had some really well developed characters. But there is little at best of that here. Randy Quaid's character is supposed to be the neighbour from hell. At least that is what we're told and what is instigated through Pryor's reaction to him. But we don't actually see much evidence of this. Which kind of made me not really understand why Pryor hated him so much. Shame as well because this is the kind of role that big Randy usually kicks ass in ie.  'National Lampoons Vacations III and IV' and 'Next Door'. The removals guys were just really predictable with the King Kong Bundy joke not really working nowadays and though he usually makes me laugh the Dana Carvey section just wasn't well.......funny.The side stories about Pryor's daughter staying behind in Jersey because of her new boyfriend also just falls apart. He doesn't answer a call from her the night after her folks leave so from that we are meant to infer I think that he is cheating or something so she just ups sticks and moves out after her folks. Okay. But what the hell does this contribute to the story? Similarly Pryor's two twin sons decide to pass themselves off as one person throughout the movie. Ah the old identical twin joke. So their parents never went to a parent's night obviously as they claim that nobody outside the family home has ever clocked onto it in their 12 years of existence. And this plot device is used for? Well nothing. Just another inconsequential little side story with no resolution. The whole bit involving Pryor becoming a PostApocalyptic like KungFu using warrior out of frustration is more embarrassing than entertaining sadly. This films just left me feeling disappointed as there were certainly the tools and potential for something more. As it is it's more of a kind of mild and forgetful rainy Saturday afternoon type of experience. Check out 'Neighbours'and 'Funny Farm' if your looking for something in the same territory which hits the mark more often. See 'National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation' or 'The Burbs' if your looking something along the same lines but which is completely superior.".

CAn the family make a smooth transition from one neighborhood to another? Will they have problems with the new neighbors or the strange movers? Find out when you watch MOVING!!As with all of these type of films youll have the kid who doesn't want to leave and the worried family members about the new community they're moving into. Randy Quaid costars in two roles. King Kong Bundy plays a mover Stacey Dash makes an early costarring role as Pryors teenage daughter Dana Carvey guest stars as a weird dude who's hired to drive Mr. Pryor's beloved Saab and Rodney Dangerfield makes an uncredited appearance as well.I liked this movie for some reason. The humor was a little more towards old Richard Pryor. But it's not one of his best efforts. Mr. Pryor would make one more funny movie Hear No Evil See No Evil before illness would force him into early retirement.Recommended.".

Ranging from awful SUPERMAN III to merely mediocre CRITICAL CONDITION his ReaganBush output didn't produce anything decent until he reteamed with Gene Wilder for 1989's SEE NO EVIL HEAR NO EVIL which granted was no classic. MOVING wasn't his worst movie but it certainly didn't help his career. Playing a meek suburbanite Pryor's raw comedic persona was castrated with a silly name Arlo Pear??? and a bland inoffensive script. Watch him in this movie and note how defeated he appears. In a decade Pryor went from STIR CRAZY and BLUE COLLAR to a featurelength sitcom that could have starred anybody.That's not to say MOVING is without merits. It provided Dana Carvey with his funniest role that didn't costar Mike Myers and Randy Quaid a good actor who can do comedy as opposed to a good comedian earns a lot of laughs here in a dual role. But the efforts of the supporting cast are wasted by a script that should have gone through more rewrites. A comedy about moving your family across the country could find a lot of humor in the small but countless frustrations that can happen when undertaking such a challenge. Instead of wringing laughs from human foibles here we've got stupid professional movers who do things to be funny therefore making what they do unfunny. That old guy wrapping every toy separately? The other guys breaking furniture and taking a side trip to New Orleans? It's dumb and not believable and not funny. However Carvey acts like he's in a whole 'notherand bettercomedy. I gotta admit his shtick in drag was hilarious.The movie has structural problems too. It spends half the movie packing their things and dealing with the slob neighbor and  bam!  it jumps to the family's new home. What happened during the 3000mile drive to get there? Did the kids get on the parent's nerves while cooped up in the back seat the whole time? Surely there are possible crosscountry mishaps that weren't already explored in NAT'L LAMPOON'S VACATION right? One minor thing. What road did they take out of Jersey? They're on some blacktop with a sign stating they're leaving the Garden State. Um don't they have to cross the Delaware River to enter Pennsylvania?And I wonder if a black family from Jersey would assimilate so easily in suburban Idaho. Since anybody could have been cast in the role was this movie written with Pryor in mind? Doesn't seem so since this family is white in every way except skin color. Their closest friends are an elderly white couple and their daughter played by Stacey Dash appears to have blue eyes leading me to believe she should have been cast instead as a Wannabe in Spike Lee's SCHOOL DAZE. Forgive me for raising racial issues in a lightweight '80s comedy but wouldn't this affluent black family from the East Coast have any reservations about relocating to Aryan Nation? A 1990 census shows that Idaho was over 94 Caucasian while Blacks made up less than one percent around the time the movie was made. American Indians at 1.3 were more represented. Wouldn't this have been a factor in their decision to move there? Finally for a movie that's barely ninety minutes long MOVING coughs and wheezes to the closing credits. It somehow feels both overlong and too short if that makes sense. And there's a chase scene to wrap things up. A chase scene to end a bad comedy? What else is new?".

It looks great  probably better than it did in the theatres. Not exactly a zombie flick but that is the closest genre you could categorize it.  It follows the trials of Elizabeth a young woman traveling by rail across the French countryside en route to meet with her fianc who runs a winery. Before she reaches her destination however she encounters a homicidal man who has just murdered her traveling companion and whose face disintegrates before her horrified eyes as he chases her off the train. Lost in the rural expanse the woman encounters various peasants who seem to have become trapped between life and death driven mad by the pain of decaying alive and more than eager to throttle her and visit various abuses upon her body implied by the fact that any uninfected individual she comes across in her adventure inevitably takes the proverbial bullet for her  by pitchfork hatchet or whatever lethal tool the living dead' have at hand at the moment. Finally it is revealed that her fianc has been pumping out wine tainted by pesticides which has been consumed en masse earlier at a festival by the unfortunate villagers talk about becoming dead drunk.. This is easily one of Rollin's most accessible films but may not be to the tastes of anyone weaned on EmptyVee styled horror flicks.  But for the discriminating palate this is definitely recommended  leisurely paced atmospheric and with liberal dollops of gore and mayhem to boot this is late 70's horror at its best.".

	schema:headline " Surprisingly good French zombie flick!";
	schema:reviewBody "French director Jean Rollin is best known for his messy erotic vampire films but Zombie Lake aside he's actually a lot better at zombie films. Along with The Living Dead Girl The Grapes of Death represents one of the few successes for the cult director. This zombie film stands out for its morbid and surreal atmosphere and for the fact that as zombie films go this one is quite original. The title doesn't suggest a good film but it refers to the movie's main plot point namely the fact that it's the French tradition of distilling wine that is to blame for the zombie outbreak. It's points like this that make the film profoundly French and despite the fact that France doesn't seem like the ideal country for a zombie outbreak the plot and location blend together rather nicely. Naturally the main character is female and we follow her as she makes her way to her home town of Roubles a wine producing estate. The journey turns awry when a man infected with the zombie virus boards the train and our heroine finds her travel companion dead...and that's just the start of it! The plot takes the familiar Night of the Living Dead style idea of the living trying to stay clear of the dead but Rollin makes the film his own with a fine variety of weird and wonderful characters and it usually turns out that these are more dangerous than the zombie hoards. The rural setting provides a nice base for a zombie movie as it's quite different from the usual urban setting and this also blends well with Rollin's morbid atmosphere. The film is also very surreal and the director continually gives the viewer the impression that there's something nasty lurking just around the corner. Many of Rollin's films feel cheap and nasty but this one doesn't the cinematography is beautiful and the acting isn't too bad either both of which give the film a higher quality feel than the plot by rights should have. The only time there's a lapse in quality is the awful commentary on French politics towards the endbut it's not enough to spoil it entirely. The film is quite erotic and even though it's quite different to his usual stuff you can still tell that it's Rollin in the director's chair. The ending is really good and comes as quite a surprise and I've got to say that I loved the final message I agree beer is superior to wine. Recommended!".

	schema:reviewBody "I must admit that unlike many of my fellow Eurohorror fanatics I am not the biggest fan of Jean Rollin but then I am still far from being an expert on the man's work. Most of the Rollin films that I've seen so far reach from stylish but flawed e.g. Fascination to stylish but boring e. g. La Rose De Fer to plain ridiculous Le Lac Des Morts Vivants. Therefore I was very positively surprised when I recently saw Les Raisins De La Mort aka. The Grapes of Death 1977 a highly original creepy intelligent and overall very impressive ZombieGore film which is by far my favorite of all the Rollin flicks I've seen. Les Raisins De La Mort is a Zombie film with a somewhat environmentalist premise In a mountainous winedrinking area of France pesticides that are meant as insect repellents for grapes turn the population sick and murderously insane... Unlike your usual fully braindead zombies the infected here are still somewhat capable of thinking talking and having feelings they just have the insatiable urge to murder... Les Raisins De La Mort has the reputation of being one of the first French gore films and it is also a highly effective one. The cinematography and settings beautiful French landscapes and villages are extremely elegant which is a quality that most Rollin films have. This one's intriguing premise and suspense is a quality that I would only attribute to this one out of the bunch of Rollin films I've seen. MarieGeorges Pascal who sadly committed suicide at age 39 in 1985 makes a likable protagonist as lisabeth a girl who gets lost in the land of the infested when trying to visit her fianc and Mirella Rancelot is memorable as a blind girl a likable character whose stare into nonentity is both sympathyevoking and slightly eerie. The film delivers what gore fans expect the zombiemakeup the infested begin to get moldy and rot away is extremely disgusting and the gore effects are bloody as hell and very well done. For a Rollin film this one is very low on the sleaze and nudity only the ravishing actresspornstar Brigitte Lahaie Rollin's favorite actress gets naked in a supporting role. The score is pretty good and underlines the eerie atmosphere.Overall this film delivers everything one might hope for in a Zombie film a nice setting suspense and creepiness and loads of both disturbing and disgusting gore. Atmospheric effective and definitely Rollin's best in my opinion. Highly recommended!".

This film takes it's time in the usual French way.Hey this one's got good gore effects!!  I like the realistic sores with puss oozing out of them.  The cool scene of the puss oozing out of the guy's face on the train was really well done.I also like the pitchfork scene where the farmer forks his daughter in an apparent fit of pesticideinduced madness.  Not bad at all.Another good scene is when the blind girl Lucy is crucified on the back door of a farmhouse and her provider comes out and chops her head off with an ax blood spraying out everywhere...Then the gorgeous Bridgette Lahaie appears looking normal but really isn't. We get a nice fullfrontal scene of her nude too.It has one of those typical 1970sstyle ambiguous endings where no one really wins good or bad so you'll have to see it for yourself.Excellent Synapse DVD with extras such as an interview with Rollin and Lahaie who still looks gorgeous after 25 years.  She hasn't really aged at all.Plus there's an excellent slideshow of all the gore scenes up close.Too bad the first reviewer below didn't wait a couple of years for this DVD to come out7 out of 10 for keeping me amused.".

However most rules have an exception and Grapes is an excellent example of such.Rather than following his usual blueprint of dreamy atmosphere barely existent plots sleepwalkerlike acting and an abundance of useless lesbian activity Rollin goes directly for the throat this trip. The plot is straight forward the acting excellent and action starts quickly and only lets up in time for a downbeat conclusion. The wineinduced zombies are quite effective with nasty oozing sores and an unrelenting nature for the worst cases and a quirky onset of mania for those in the less severe stages. The one thing Rollin does thankfully carry over is his eye for polarity the french landscape is beautiful but filled with impending hazy dread. And No worthless sex scenes! This wonderful film is a true oddball in Rollin's canon. It's easily his most accessible and gory film to date. If you're looking for an entry point to his films this really isn't a place to start since it's SO different from the rest. But If you've seen the man's other work and didn't care for it give this one a chance. I think you will be very pleasantly surprised.Note Synapse's DVD release is nothing short of stunning. The print is flawfree and bursting with sharpness and color. This may very well be the best transfer of any obscure '70's film I've viewed yet. And I've seen a lot of 'em!".

You do have to take into account that this is a 1978 movie and it does show it's age but it has genuine fright moments and a real seedy scary under currant and a lot of modern horror directors could learn a thing or two about pacing a horror movie from here. A real unexpected treat. I would definitely watch this again and for fans of the genre give an extra mark.".

If you are ever asked about the importance of editing and continuity to the watchability of a film just point to this film as an example of how NOT to do it. Due to the poor editing and lack of continuity people jump all over the screen and sets showing up in one place after starting in another. One of the actresses literally walks around a corner of a building and changes clothes completely at the same time. No I don't believe that this was intentional. A couple huge dogs just show up at one point which also makes no sense wounds change locations and some events were obviously intended to precede other events that now appear earlier in the film.Don't get me wrong this film is worth your time if you're a fan but it is definitely not a slick finished product.".

The script by Rollin  Christian Meunier seems to have been heavily influenced by Goerge A. Romeros The Crazies 1973 in fact they have much in common. It is also very slow dull  frankly boring. It has a decent central premise that had potential but the film is just lethargic  the infected villagers themselves totally disappear for the final twenty odd minutes  they are just really slow. The story character's or situations just didn't grip or engage me  I found myself becoming more  more disinterested in what was or in the case of Les Raisins de la Mort what wasn't happening.Director Rollin as usual spends more time on the visual look of the film rather than the story. There is hardly any dialogue which is expected  he likes to let his images to do the talking. Les Raisins de la Mort has a nice visual look the bleak stark French countryside with it stone house village's makes for a nice isolated location although it does become monotonous eventually. Contray to what you may have heard the gore is quite tame  the special makeup effects are generally poor as the infected villager's look like they have bits of pizza stuck on their faces. There is one gory moment when someone has their head cut off with an axe other than that there is a poor looking slit throat someone is stabbed with a pitchfork  a few splashes of blood that's it. For a Rollin film the nudity is surprisingly low with just two instances.Technically the film is OK it looks nice enough but the effects are a bit dodgy looking. I can't comment on the acting as the dialogue is spoken in French so don't watch it if you don't like reading subtitles as I don't think an English dub version exists.Les Raisins de la Mort was disappointing as far as I'm concerned I'd have preferred a zombie film with intestine eating  blood drinking rather than the infected villager's type thing we ended up with. I found it boring dull  went nowhere. Even Rollins usual visual dream like surreal style seems to be absent. Average at best not worth making any real effort to watch.".

Tragic consequences ensue.Have you ever seen a sophisticated zombie gore film? Rollin's take on the zombie genre isn't the same blunt instrument of grue that we often are used to seeing although the French director does turn up the dial on delivering some nasty facial sores which release yucky colors and goo. The pitchfork scene is certainly a highlight..and Rollin's camera remains on the victim's stabbed body as she dies with the pitchfork sticking out. The French countryside is utilized by Rollin well..would you expect anything otherwise?showing us a gorgeous unpopulated picturesque space uninhabited by the zombie hordes. Certainly an alternative to the awful low budget bloodbaths that have glutted movie shelves since Romero's movies broke the cinematic mold for gory violence. Not to say Rollin doesn't display a few gruesome highlights despite the pitchfork scene. One wacky moment shows an infected citizen beheading his female lover stuck to a door with nails through her hands and blouse ripped displaying her breasts! Oh and Rollin adds to the hysteria of the scene by showing him planting a slobbery kiss to the lips of the disembodied head as he dies! Lahaie sure captures your attention as well..she disrobes in a completely gratuitous scene showing the two uninfected males that she has no sores. Pascal as the tragic heroine tries to show a woman losing her sanity as she bares witness to the nonstop parade of insanity occurring around her. I found her a bit over the top but I guess we must look at what was happening and put her character's plight into proper perspective. Here's Lahaie having arranged for the zombies to have their way with her coming towards Liz with a lighted stick as flames threaten to burn her face. If that wasn't enough she watches as an innocent falls prey to her infected lover not being able to stop what will eventually happen. And to cap it off Liz must face the fact that her fianc not only caused the plague but is also a victim of his creation. So I guess I can see some heightened overacting..pulling into her hair screeching with eyes bulgingbeing feasible under the circumstances. At the very end Pascal displays her character as a silent shell of her former self no longer the young woman full of life at the very beginning..Elizabeth has been put through the ringer. Although The Iron Rose is still my personal favorite Rollin film this may very well be his best one. I think Grapes of Death certainly shows a filmmaker who has taken complete command of his craft.".

They just enjoy killing you in twisted ways. It's like they get an unstoppable rage that can't be stopped. At least Jean Rollin tried to be different in that aspect as so many zombie films were coming out around the time this movie was released. It does have a decent amount of gore. I wouldn't call it a gore fest but it does deliver. We get a very bloody decapitation icky zombie makeup impaling with a pitchfork gunshot wounds and off screen stuff as well. Not great but not bad either. The ending was very very odd. We get no real explanation as to why the main female lead is acting suspicious. It subtly hints that she's turning crazy but it never gives it to you fully. Or it could be I was becoming more and more disengaged that I missed an important plot development but nonetheless I was confused. The acting isn't worth mentioningFinal Thoughts It's well made but it's quite a drag to sit through. It has good moments but not enough of them.

The only Jean Rollin film I've really had interest in seeing turned out to be one of the slowestmoving zombie romps I've ever suffered through and creating a bad zombie movie is a feat. How can you go wrong with the living dead? For starters the print I saw was from Video Search of Miami an enterprise infamous for the bad quality of their videos and while granted it was probably the best available copy the sound alternated between being super low and cutting out all together and while it was subtitled it was still annoying as hell. Technical grievances aside the plot involves a young girl who's name we never get travelling on a train through the French countryside to meet her fiance the manager of a small winery. Unfortunately an experimental pesticide infects the locals with a condition where they rot rapidly and become walking dead and she's forced to flee the zombies and wander aimlessly through medievallooking towns trying to find regular live humans. The viewer is subjected to scene after scene of her running through fields screaming with the occasionally zombie jumping out from behind a rock or building. The highlights are few and far between to say the least but among them are one pretty neat decapitation of a blind girl a pitchfork stabbing and a rotting guy smearing his festering pusy forehead on the window of a car. Other than that this one really sucked. No wonder it's perpetually out of print!".

	schema:headline " Surrealist zombie movie";
	schema:reviewBody "How do you horrify an audience that's overused to violence? This is a tricky one. Recently I watched Franju's Nuits Rouges 1974 wherein a character is stabbed in the back with a syringe he's stood there in agony trying to remove it but it's in the small of his back he struggles to reach it and hysterically pleads with his buddies to take it out but they are too busy with chasing the culprit. It's this kind of material that you need to show to get the audience there show them hysteria because hysteria is infectious. There's a good example in Rollin's zombie movie Les Raisins de la Mort. There is a panicked blind woman Lucie being led through a village draped in cadavers. You can see corpses in all sorts of movies we're corpsefatigued now. So how to communicate? Lucie senses that something is wrong and pleads with the stranger who is leading her lisabeth to tell her what it is when she doesn't the panic and hysteria start to mount as kindness is misunderstood for untrustworthiness and you start to understand what you're seeing. Jean Rollin said when asked why he always has scenes with two pretty women in his films that he was the wrong person to ask the right person apparently is a psychiatrist. Whatever the doubtless perverse and sadolesbian reason those scenes always manage a frisson for me.The story concerns a remote French region where some new pesticides are being sprayed on the grapes somehow this is causing a plague of zombies. The character lisabeth leads the viewer through the bizarre countryside where there are jagged stones that jut out of the stunted ground and brittle leafless October trees. The houses are crumbling made of old lichened stone they're all perched on hillsides the walls dissolve into scree and have plants growing out of them there are arches and towers and strange labyrinthine streets really the whole landscape of the movie is quite phantasmagoric. Few directors I have seen understand the importance of location as much as Rollin.The film plays on urbanite fears of the countryside that you get in giallo House With Laughing Windows as well as in American cinema Deliverance. The people of the very strange countryside in this movie were bad before the plague came. We can tell by the way the Polish worker is mistreated at the start of the movie by the patron of the vineyard and also as Lucie mentions being mocked by the disablist villagers before the plague the abuse of disabled people is an alarming and undermentioned phenomenon.I like to harp on about is the importance of interior design in a movie. Please movie makers unless you're going for verite have the rooms you shoot your movies in properly designed for maximum psychological effect! There's a very creepy house in the film where there are stuffed animals at every corner and above the bed leopardskin cover on the quilt of course there's an ugly animal skin that really looks like it's been flayed off the animal's back.The whole uncanny sense of the movie is heightened by the strange soundtrack that you can't really place it could be harmonium or electronica doesn't sound like anything I've heard before. It helps make the movie hermetic. You need to know in a horror film that there is no connection to familiar reality no help coming no unsevered umbilicus.It wouldn't be a great Jean Rollin film if we didn't get to see Brigitte Lahaie naked and Rollin delivers on that again as with the other two great movies of his I've seen Fascination and La Nuit des Traquees. We also get to see Lahaie walking two enormous hounds at night in her nightie her gorgeous blonde hair shimmering in the light of a flambeau. It's all pure insanity.I won't spoil the topmost scene of awesome depravity in this movie. I do however feel the need to mention the gore in general although a lot of the depravity is either referred to or implied what had Lahaie been using those dogs for on other nights?. Generally the gore effects were fairly cheap some of the scab prosthetics looked like they were going to peel off and occasionally it looked like one of the poor actor had had their face dipped in custard and jam. However master that he is Rollin can still use this. There's a scene where a man with a grievous wound to his forehead headbutts some glass repeatedly from the other side of the glass you can see the pus smear. That is disturbing and that's what most modern horror directors lack the artistry to make the gore connect with the audience.I like the zombies in this movie too they are slow moving like in all movies but you can see that the zombie plague is more facilitating the unleashing of something depraved and already present inside the rural folk. You can see for example that their personalities are still there like when a zombie character calls for Lucie by name. Murder is not just by mindless chomping like in most zombie movies these zombies are straight out of de Sade's mind.I salute Jean Rollin poet of the subconscious and the macabre.".

	onyx:emotionText "How do you horrify an audience that's overused to violence? This is a tricky one. Recently I watched Franju's Nuits Rouges 1974 wherein a character is stabbed in the back with a syringe he's stood there in agony trying to remove it but it's in the small of his back he struggles to reach it and hysterically pleads with his buddies to take it out but they are too busy with chasing the culprit. It's this kind of material that you need to show to get the audience there show them hysteria because hysteria is infectious. There's a good example in Rollin's zombie movie Les Raisins de la Mort. There is a panicked blind woman Lucie being led through a village draped in cadavers. You can see corpses in all sorts of movies we're corpsefatigued now. So how to communicate? Lucie senses that something is wrong and pleads with the stranger who is leading her lisabeth to tell her what it is when she doesn't the panic and hysteria start to mount as kindness is misunderstood for untrustworthiness and you start to understand what you're seeing. Jean Rollin said when asked why he always has scenes with two pretty women in his films that he was the wrong person to ask the right person apparently is a psychiatrist. Whatever the doubtless perverse and sadolesbian reason those scenes always manage a frisson for me.The story concerns a remote French region where some new pesticides are being sprayed on the grapes somehow this is causing a plague of zombies.

Brigitte gets butchered by a strange man on the train. Elizabeth gets away and runs afoul of a savage horde of lethal decomposing killers who have been infected by a toxic new pesticide used in the local grape fields. Director Jean Rollin working from a terse and straightforward script he cowrote Christian Meunier wisely eschews pretense and gets right down to chilling brass tacks from the terrifying beginning to the supremely jolting and nihilistic downbeat conclusion. Rollin relates the grimly compelling story at a deliberate pace and does an expert job of creating and sustaining a quietly eerie and ominous atmosphere. Moreover Rollin delivers several moments of pure gutwrenching terror a father murders his own daughter by running her through with a pitchfork a village littered with freshly slain corpses and a helpless blind girl being killed by her guardian who then strings up her body on a door and cuts off her head. Better still Rollin gives the premise a substantial degree of credibility by firmly grounding the plot in a thoroughly believable pedestrian reality. The remote rustic countryside setting evokes a powerfully unsettling sense of dread isolation and vulnerability. The fact that the hideous rotfaced ghouls are struggling to retain their humanity while succumbing to the disease makes them that much more scary and disturbing. Kudos are in order for the sound acting by the sturdy cast Pascal excels as the frightened yet resilient heroine Felix Marten contributes a solid turn as rugged nononsense peasant and war veteran Paul and the gorgeous Brigitte Lahaie makes the most out of her memorably odd role as a shrewd infected woman who shows no external signs of the disease. Claude Becognee's bright agile cinematography boasts a few striking sinuous tracking shots and offers a wealth of stunning visuals. Philippe Sissmann's spare wonky synthesizer score also does the shivery trick. But it's the starkness of the narrative which gives this picture an extra unnerving edge. Well worth seeing.".

I would recommend this to anyone new to Rollin's work.My favourite scene involves a decaying man who chases Elisabeth back into her parked car which naturally fails to start.

	schema:reviewBody "Somewhere in the midst of the zombie craze that exploded in the late 60s to the mid80s this Frenchmade one is probably the least known. While not technically a zombie film it's the closest genre to compare it to. Jean Rollin the director was often known for making low budget schlock but with this big budget disaster flick he shows he's quite a masterful storyteller. His keen eye for even the slightest of gestures to the gory special effects blend perfectly with the wellwritten characters and dialogue. Now the story Elizabeth played by MarieGeorges Pascal is riding a train with her friend. She's going to visit her fianc who works in a vineyard. At the vineyard they've recently started using a new type of chemical pesticide. However some of the workers are starting to feel weird. In a grisly opening scene Elizabeth watches a man's face disintegrate right before her eyes. While fleeing the man she stumbles upon the body of her friend. She manages to escape off the train. The man has followed her off the train but then sits down on the tracks a look of utter despair on his face. From that point on she comes across stranger and stranger people all suffering in various stages from some kind of decay. The worse it gets the crazier and more zombielike the people become. This movie borrows ideas from Romero's DEAD movies as well as THE CRAZIES but then takes those concepts in new directions. MarieGeorges Pascal plays the part of Elizabeth wonderfully. She's got such a beautiful expressive face. Whether she's crying screaming or just has a look of hopelessness you feel for her. Sadly as I stated earlier this is a little known gem that deserves to be rediscovered. So please if you can find it hunt down this notquiteazombie film. It's worth discovering!".

I have seen enough of both to know they aren't for me. Jean Rollin's The Grapes of Death is no exception. I rented this based on the fact it was the only movie to receive a high level of praise from Jamie Russell's Book of the Dead that I hadn't seen. Maybe I missed something because this seemed worthy of no more than a blurb in the back of the book. The film is set in the French countryside where wine is turning the people into crazed zombies and one girl has to fight her way through to reach her lover. It's no more than a retread of ground Romero already covered in The Crazies and covered much better I might add. Like The Crazies the villagers in Grapes are not really zombies. They're just crazy people with purple lesions. I found the movie to be very droll and completely without action. But judging from the high level of acclaim those other horror fans I was talking about earlier...you know the ones who like Rollin...apparently love this film. So decide which type of fan you are before seeing The Grapes of Death or any other Rollin movie for that matter.".

I have seen enough of both to know they aren't for me. Jean Rollin's The Grapes of Death is no exception. I rented this based on the fact it was the only movie to receive a high level of praise from Jamie Russell's Book of the Dead that I hadn't seen. Maybe I missed something because this seemed worthy of no more than a blurb in the back of the book. The film is set in the French countryside where wine is turning the people into crazed zombies and one girl has to fight her way through to reach her lover. It's no more than a retread of ground Romero already covered in The Crazies and covered much better I might add. Like The Crazies the villagers in Grapes are not really zombies. They're just crazy people with purple lesions. I found the movie to be very droll and completely without action. But judging from the high level of acclaim those other horror fans I was talking about earlier...you know the ones who like Rollin...apparently love this film. So decide which type of fan you are before seeing The Grapes of Death or any other Rollin movie for that matter.";

	schema:reviewBody "I just saw this Synapse DVD last night and enjoyed it quite a bit but I have to add a different perspective on the decapitation scene that everyone seems to enjoy. The most shocking and significant part of the scene is the crucifixion but the headchopping itself . . . well it's about as believable as Herschell Gordon Lewis. It's one of those things where a limp soft human actress instantly turns into a stiff wooden or plastic mannequin coated with paint. You can even hear the wooden chunk of the hatchet going through! You can only laugh. And the editing of that scene looks like a hatchet was used there too. It's like the director or producer thought he needed a money shot. That's the most unconvincing moment in the movie the low point of an otherwise pretty decent paranoid nicely photographed nightmare with character touches and subversive elements.By the way my favorite element is the fact that the baddies aren't real living dead zombies and they don't want to eat the living. They're just people with a disease that drives them mad but they can be killed in any ordinary way and they don't get up again. That makes it a bit more like The Crazies or Rabid or Blue Sunshine than a traditional zombie movie.".

	schema:headline " There is a certain irony that grapes and wine made this movie possible and yet it aged so abysmally.";
	schema:reviewBody "The zombie flick starts off promisingly with an incredibly dumb brunette abandoning a train after her friend had been murdered by a confused slowly decomposing semizombie. Mind you when I say that GOD starts promisingly I don't mean that in a Blade Runner promising kind of way but more in a decentzombieBflick promising manner. However GOD starts sinking rapidly with the appearance of Brigitte Lahaie. Don't get me wrong it's not her fault she gives us a splendid view of her perfect body and boobs just minutes before being blown into bits. It's the fault of the damn script which quickly disintegrates into bull's dung from this point onwards. Lahaie plays an uninfected villager who  somehow and for whatever bizarreidiotic reason  acts as Svengali to the zombies around her. She helps them snatch and kill the uninfected rather than abandon the village. There is absolutely no explanation for this it's merely a dumb plotdevice to prolong the movie or to make it forcibly unpredictable. Nor is it explained why the zombies don't want to kill her and obey her. The brunette is incredibly stupid possibly the most dimwitted and confused movie heroine I've ever seen. One of her many foolish decisions was to refuse to tell the blind girl about the danger  as if making the girl think she is not surrounded by the living grapedead actually makes her safe. Predictably and logically the blind girl is appalled and confused by the lies and runs away and is murdered. Beheaded no less there's the French for ya saving the most sadistic demise for a helpless invalid dyevochka. Her end is a direct result of the dumb brunette's idiotic decisionmaking process which dominates GOD. It's just part of a string of dumb decisions and actions she makes. A little later the dumb brunette meets Lahaie who requests to hold the brunette's revolver only minutes after they'd met typically for our birdbrained brunette heroine she suspects nothing even turning her back to Lahaie so that the chesty blond can attack her with more ease.Just minutes after she'd been betrayed by Lahaie the awfully dumb brunette approaches her carrying a torch. To get her revenge? To prevent another attack? Not really. Instead of attacking her the brunette just stares at Lahaie  as if she were a dumb zombie herself Lahaie predictably takes advantage of the situation and pounces on her. Duh. Lahaie's character is so absurd she even has an unintentionally funny moment when she tells the two armed villagers that she didn't hear anything right after the dumb brunette lets out a very loud scream nearby. The two dolts predictably don't suspect anything never questioning why she'd lie about it.GOD then even manages to contradict itself when the brunette describes the peasant's daughter as crazy in spite of having only a small sore. That's the same peasant's daughter who tried to SAVE the dumb brunette from her own father and got killed in the process she wasn't crazy at all. That's the thanks you get for trying to save a Frenchwoman! But isn't it such a typical trait of the French to confuse sanity with insanity? The dumb brunette shows yet more gratefulness or grapefulness? a little later when she murders two unarmed uninfected men  the same men who had come to her rescue so selflessly just a day earlier! And she is supposed to be GOD's heroine! We're supposed to root for this illogical female moron. But it's things like these that make a French movie so French they have such a skewered sense of morality bless 'em it's almost comical at times. The dumb brunette actually suggests to the armed men that they go to her fianc's winebrewery right after they'd concluded that grapes are the culprit! That's like traveling to the Arctic just as scientists announce that a new Ice Age had started. On their way there the trio engages in a moronic political discussion in which the military and nuclear powerplants are named as the enemy of man and society  i.e. the writer's petpeeves. No scene is too silly for those leftwingers to advance their cretinous propaganda with no opportunity or situation no matter how unsuitable or daft is missed out to harass viewers with their fanatical logicfree ideology. Strangely enough it turns out that it wasn't nuclear waste that turned the normally happytoplease grapes into sour grapes of death but her fianc's experimental pesticide. When The Simpsons plays around with these kinds of dumb leftwing fantasies at least we can laugh WITH it because it's a comedic cartoon. But GOD we laugh AT because the filmmakers try to lend sociopoliticalenvironmental relevance to a goofy little zombie movie. God knows George Romero had tried this and failed time and time again the Marxist putz. You can't preach while standing on your head. You can't preach while taking a dump. And you certainly can't preach in a zombie movie. There is a time and place for emptyheaded preaching and these three situations just aren't it.Film buffs  nearly all incurable Marxists  like to describe GOD and other movies like it as subversive. They must mean idiotic. But then again they DO get awfully confused.The script is a mess in every sense of the word. So badly written is this zombie message movie that GOD manages to unintentionally turn its politicallycorrect heroes into villains and morons while turning the supposedly narrowminded triggerhappy hick into the voice of reason. How had they achieved this? By having the dumb brunette murder her rescuers the writer inadvertently turns the gunhappy old geezer into the hero and smart guy because it turns out he'd been right all along about killing everybody. This in turn renders his leftwingthinking young buddy wrongstupid because he proposed a softer approach to the zombies. Wow.".

This movie isn't about homosexuality but it IS about sexuality.Aihara an aloof girl will definitely make the viewers ponder who IS behind the aloof girl. Does she love Yoshida? Or does she love Ito? Or did she somehow turn into a lesbian because of the incident? I doubt it.And what about Yoshida? Does he realize that he loves Ito in the end? Well we all know he loves him as a friend. But you'll never know once you see this movie... haha  In the end Aihara along with Ito delivers an exceptional message to the audience which is that it does NOT matter if you love a boy or a girl. And I have to tell you I'm SO dense that I didn't get it at first.  It's because of the whole no talking scenes... You have to try to understand what the characters are thinking and saying through their actions and NOT by what they say especially the final part... whew boy that was confusing! It's a confusing story but it IS beautiful nonetheless.  This movie is certainly one of the best Japanese movies I have ever seen and trust me I've seen plenty.".

It gives an insight in to the youth culture struggling to define itself outside of the bounds of their parent's generation with it's strict conformity and facade. Typical to Japanese cinema often what isn't said is more important that what is so to those not versed in Japanese film and culture beware. It can seem dull and minimalistic pretty much like every film to come out of Japan bar Mangas if you don't know what to look for. I saw it for the first time when I was 15 and was what originally sparked my interest in Japan it's culture and language. Considering I'm now 22 and learning Japanese with the intention of living there for 2 years needless to say it's a powerful film. Enjoy!".

	schema:reviewBody "Writing about something so wonderful is completely hard. Actually it's almost impossible to describe the peculiarities of this movie. This is a marvelous story about sex and gender and it's almost unbelievable that we have not to deal with obscene scenes of sex. Feeling this film was made for people that like to feel and just to feel life in all its complexity in a gorgeous simple way. We look at it and something starts growing inside our minds even our hearts it a pure poem. I've watched some gay movies and I almost always got really unsatisfied with unnecessary scenes of sex not because I don't like scenes of sex but generally they are so pornographic that I'm forced to think that the director or the producers or the writer of the script thinks that homosexuality means perversion. Nagisa no Shindobaddo is totally different from that ones. Three are the main characters. We have Ito Yoshida and Aihara two boys and a girl in a peculiar love triangle. Ito likes his best friend Yoshida Yoshida likes Aihara and Aihara likes Ito. Imagine what this could turn in unprepared hands? But in the contrary Hashiguchi makes a magnificent story which goes profoundly in the philosophy of life adding a question in our mind that made me think astonished in the end of the movie Why? And that why expanded in multiple questions inside of my brain and inside of my heart. The scenes actually sometimes tending to be boring are moments of the most delightful poem which we are able to feel but totally unable to write down in words. And maybe because of that we are unable to understand the question in the end of the movie. I'm sure this movie was not made for us to discuss every piece of it Some people want to understand a film almost dissecting it. Others are so used to common American gay movies that can't appreciate the real value of this masterpiece. Watch it close your eyes in the credits and feel everything feel yourself feel the wonderful song. For all this and much much more I give a nine. And I just don't give ten because ten of ten is perfection. But I confess I almost did it.".

The script veers from joy to the overwrought one minute everything is simple in the next suicidal despair! The film deserves to be a classic not just pegged as a 'gay' coming of age film which is only one of the many strands in the film high school coolness and popularity bullying and jealousy are the others. Parents hardly feature at all. The specifics of family life an important strand in Hashiguchi's next film HUSH is completely left out. These are adolescents remember! they exist everywhere in their own bubble. And unlike HUSH parts of LIKE GRANIS OF SAND is not easy to watch. There's nothing 'feel good' in it. It is loaded with the pain and confusion of finding out whom you might be and what choices you will have to make. Choices that in a way determine the rest of your life. Hashiguchi is a director who paces his films beautifully. The long takes never feel forced. It is scandalous no one has bothered to pick this up for distribution with English subtitles.

	schema:reviewBody "It's remarkable and quite praiseworthy how writers and directors continue to make great movies out of one of the oldest and most overused story lines in cinema! Dog Bite Dog is basically not much more than just the simple story of an lone copper obsessively chasing a brilliant criminal only PouSoi Cheang distinguishes his film from the rest by being extremely violent  relentless. This is unquestionably one of the grittiest and most uncompromising movies I've ever seen with an atmosphere of constant nihilism and characters that seem to come walking straight out of hell! Not even the installments in ChanWook Park's trilogy of vengeance with the exception of Oldboy perhaps or any other infamous CatIII film ever released were as sadistic and brutal as some of the events depicted in Dog Bite Dog. Pang is a young and ruthless Cambodian assassin who lands in the crowded streets of Hong Kong to eliminate the wife of an eminent judge in a restaurant. When the police arrives at the place young officer Wai sees how Pang hastily flees from the scene of the crime and follow him. The first actual confrontation between the two rabid dogs results in a gigantic blood bath as Pang mercilessly kills several hostages and even Wai's long time friend and colleague. From then on begins a thrilling and actionpacked cat and mouse game between the frustrated cop and the professional killer. The latter also saves a young girl from the constant sexual abuse of her father and stays with her at her shed in the local garbage dump. What makes this routine actionthriller so fascinating apart from the explicit violence are the main characters' backgrounds! Pang the hitman is a Cambodian orphan and has been trained to fight  kill for money ever since he was a child. He knows no restrictions has no mercy and barely speaks a word. Wai the cop became particularly ruthless and unorthodox ever since his rolemodel father also a cop lies in a coma after a drugrelated incident. Lai doesn't question suspects and witnesses he yells at them and he's prepared to sacrifice everything in order to stop his brand new nemesis. People with a weak stomach or tangled nerves are advised to stay away from this film because the cruelty and shocks featuring in Dog Bite Dog can easily cause nausea. It's not the type of violence where bloodied heads and chopped off limbs fly through the air but more like the intense and utterly disturbing type where people attempt to crush their opponents mentally as well as physically. The filming locations are effectively dark and eerie and the extremely sober music makes the already harrowing tone of the movie even more petrifying. The performances are terrific! I wouldn't be surprised if Edison Chen and Sam Lee treated each other like enemies on the film set as well because their on screen hatred and disgust feels a little too legitimate. Dog Bite Dog is a powerful and unforgettable film highly recommended if you can stomach it. If you fear you can't just wait a few years for the inevitable American remake which will unquestionably soften the premise a little.".

Of course there has to be a catch manifested here in the form of several glaring inconsistencies yet all told DBD represents the mature spirit we'd love to see more of in the HK mainstream.It also marks the heralded return of Edison Chen long absent since the Initial D debacle of a year ago. Chen's reserved machismo does wonders for the movie yet would have had it rough without opposite Sam Lee whose knack for alternating between physical comedy Crazy 'N' the City No Problem 2 and lunatic menace has culminated in the strongest role we've seen from him since Made in Hong Kong.Together the duo makes Dog Bite Dog and hopefully Edison's going to get an easier break from now on as a consequence his touch transformed projects from Princess D to the Infernal Affairs saga and still he remains a rare occurrence.Mostly upon commencing DBD showcases some mesmerizing imagery playing gorgeous tricks with light shadow and perspective. The soundtrack boosts this atmospheric effect adding to the overall unreal mood the film purveys. Much of the resultant combination probably has to do with writer Matt Chow previously engaged in likewise gruesome Three Extremes. Dog Bite Dog retains numerous traits recalled from that horror project namely rundown urbanscapes and a pervasive air of something eerie lurking round the corner.Rest assured though this isn't a horror movie instead following a path trodden before by classic One Nite in Mongkok albeit from a miles more perverse angle. Replacing Daniel Wu's reluctant mainland assassin character we have Edison playing a nameless killing machine hailing from Cambodia's underworld. Sent Hong Kongway to execute a single target the nearly silent assassin takes care of business immediately upon arrival a process chillingly depicted courtesy of the film's brilliant visuals.Although weaned from childhood to become a professional killer Edison's eponymous wild dog still has human weaknesses and leaves a trail picked up on by a CID team sent to investigate. This assembly features a nice cameo by mobmovie stalwart Lam Suet and good support from TV star Wayne Lai. However Sam Lee's renegade officer Wai leads the charge revealing himself to be a highly disturbed individual but excellent cop nonetheless. We gradually learn Wai's innerconflict stems from his father's police corruption background evoking demons handy in the relentless pursuit that ensues.A minor body count transpires as Edison seems to consider taking prisoners a nono. There's quite the violence quotient in store even though gore per se feels toned down in places and adult language only makes a token appearance. Once more no nudity leading one to conclude Cat III's are being handed these days a bit hastily. Still DBD's a relatively mature theatrical release and we applaud its arrival.In between the fighting stabbing  hacking and shooting even a career murderer needs some romance and just like Daniel Wu had Cecilia Cheung in One Nite so does intrepid Mr. Chen get a sweetheart done beautifully by new comer Pei Pei. Her unnamed character lots of anonymity in this one meets Edison's at a strangely deserted landfill abused by her father to the point of repulsive madness and yearning for escape. When the killer ditches HK he agrees to take her with him and they go on the run together love blooming en route. While the movie doesn't linger on loveydovey stuff our hearts go out to Pei Pei's tragic character and her endless suffering. She renders the timid but valiant protagonist amazingly well establishing that there aren't any good or bad guys here evinced by the highly sobering finale.Director Cheang Soi's portfolio includes recent suspense thriller Home Sweet Home and Love Battlefield with Eason Chan two numbers likely surpassed in most accounts by Dog Bite Dog's sinister demeanor. Cheang manages to keep DBD flowing throughout and considering the many parts in play here stands up to critical standards erected by people like Johnny To in his watershed nocturnal epic The Mission. A couple of glitches do come about to wit Edison miraculously shrugging off a shot to the chest but these are highly forgivable.Marking triumphant returns for two young talented performers of the kind Hong Kong needs if we want the city's movie heyday to come back Dog Bite Dog doesn't stand out for story. Its forte lies in strong portrayals and style buoyed along on the strength of thespian muscle and a keen eye for visual and auditory finesse.HK has a long timehonored tradition of stories to do with the city's nighttime alterego something Dog Bite Dog upholds lovingly amounting to a solid run if not an outright masterpiece.Rating    ".

Dog Bites Dog while not necessarily getting as hyperviolent as the craziest Miike film nor is it as unapologetically brutal as some Koreas more ambitious efforts it is a perfect in between with its own brand of brutality all it's own. The greatest strength this film has though like the greatest of the Japanese or Korean efforts is that the brutality rather than detracting from the film actually develops the characters if not pushing the story forward. The two main characters are both incredibly vicious individuals with their own motivations and emotional underpinning for being as such. Sam Lee's character for instance is on the edge from the very start and slowly and surely amidst various encounters with Chang's character it is revealed why he is. Without spoiling this part of the story too much it involves the morally ambiguous nature of his father. Chang's character on the other hand has his most primal instincts honed to if not perfection brutal efficiency. Surprisingly Chang's story arch while not necessarily revealing a more human side actually reveals a side to our animal nature which many forget about which is the natural ability to recognize a fellow broken animal and no I am not talking about Sam Lee rather Pei Pei's garbage dump girl character. Ultimately however for the first 80 minutes or so it is a more or less straight forward cat and mouse or Dog chase Dog film in which every encounter ends in at least one death seriously once Sam Lee and Chang Square off some one will die and the fun part of movie is you never know who hands will commit the act. Which brings us to the film's one weakness. Unforunatley to delve into it would be yet another spoiler but to put it simply it is guilty of pushing one of the main points of the film since rather then letting the point be made as is 80 minutes into the film the film goes on for another 20 minutes or so to further emphasize it. Don't get me wrong if transitioned better from the 80 minute mark to the climax and if the final act wasn't filled with sweet music in fact if it like the majority of the film kept the music to the barest minimum and let the disturbing sound effects do their job it still could have worked and not detract from the film. As it is though despite the third act having the most vicious and bloody of the encounters the way it was handled made it feel tacked on and almost insults the viewers intelligence since it felt it had to go this far to get it across. Nevertheless it is still a breath of fresh air from Hong Kong cinema since even the most bloody of the martial arts films never reaches the level of viciousness and brutality while keeping the the character archs in tact.".

	schema:reviewBody "I gotta be straightup  I haven't seen a film as solid as DOG BITE DOG in quite a while. I'm a big fan of the oldschool late 80s to mid 90s era CATIII films and I had been hearing that that style of films is making a bit of a comeback with films such as this and Herman Yau's GONG TAU which as of this writing I have not yet seen... so I was very interested to give some of these newerwave CATIII films a shot. Did this film live up to my expectations? Absolutely  but not quite in the fashion that I imagined.The story follows a young animalistic resourceful and virtually unstoppable Thai hitman with a somewhat vague history who comes to Hong Kong to complete a mission. Due to some badluck he is quickly identified by a roguish copy who exudes many of the same qualities as our hitman and is quickly apprehended and captured. This state of affairs doesn't last long though as the unnamed assassin escapes from his captors and quickly shows the local police that he is not to be taken lightly. The hunt is on and a catandmouse game between the police and the mad dog as the police refer to him ensues. Along the way Mad Dog is inadvertently befriended by a slowwitted young woman and a bond forms between the two when she helps him out of a sticky situation. The ante keeps getting upped as Mad Dog's only objective is to get out of Hong Kong and back to Thailand by any means necessary and the cops keep trying to reel him in alive...I could probably write ten paragraphs about this complex and thoroughly layered film but I don't want to give too much away. I watched DOG BITE DOG knowing nothing about the premise and I think it's the type of film that is definitely better appreciated that way. As to comparisons to the olderstyle CATIII films...there are some similarities. DOG BITE DOG has some hyperviolent moments reminiscent of the good ol' days but is never quite as sleazy or grimy as oldschool classicks like THE UNTOLD STORY or RED TO KILL. Where many of the older CATIII films' main intention was to shock  DOG BITE DOG is a far more thoughtout and wellrounded production though that's not to take ANYTHING away from those CATIII films that I hold so dear.... This film is far more emotional than it is exploitative and as we learn more about the characters and their backgrounds the audience begins to bond and identify with both sides. There really are no clearcut good and bad guys as Mad Dog shows moments of extreme compassion and the cops stoop to extremely unorthodox methods to try to flesh out the killer. There's also no nuditysex in this film which is a typical characteristic of the older CATIII films. Personally I would compare DOG BITE DOG more to Park's SYMPATHY FOR MR. VENGEANCE or perhaps the Pang brother's BANGKOK DANGEROUS as both of those films mixed extremely emotional overtones with strong and unflinching action and violence. Again  there's pretty much nothing that I didn't like about this film. The acting is deadon the cinematography is sharp and well done and the whole film skillfully blends several different elements successfully in a way that isn't seen very often. Is this film and others like it... the rebirth of the CATIII film  not exactly  but it IS a very solid film that's absolutely worth checking out...910".

And that is where it loses some points at least 1 in my opinion. It's not only an overblown ending it's also overly dramatic. You might like it but it surely isn't for everyone!".

	schema:headline " Amazing crime thriller that never lets up..";
	schema:reviewBody "As I understand it after the Chinese took over Hong Kong the infamous Cat. 3 Hong Kong movies kind of disappeared. At least until now and what an amazing movie this one is. I knew it was a rough crime drama going in but being the first Cat. 3 I've purchased that's been made recently I wasn't sure what to expect.A Cambodian hitman goes to Hong Kong to knock off the wife of a judge who is also a lawyer. Turns out the Judge made the arrangements for the hitman because she was divorcing the judge and threatening to take all his money. This is all known within the first ten minutes so nothing is being given away. After the hit the cops locate the hitman pretty fast but in trying to arrest him several police officers and civilians are killed. He eludes the police and now the race is on to catch the guy before he escapes back to Cambodia. This is a movie that never stops and hardly gives the viewer a chance to catch their breath. Yes it is very violent and intense many cops are killed as the hitman proves very very hard to track and take down when they do locate him. Along the way the hitman in trying to hide in a dump finds a women being raped and mistreated by some man. He helps her and saves her from the guy and she persuades the hitman to take her along with him in his escape. I loved this movie it's like a rollercoaster that just keeps moving and moving at high speed as one incident leads to another and the police at times are just as bad or worse as the hitman. The acting is exceptionally good and the location filming and photography is at time breathtaking. There's no let up in this movie not even with the very very incredible ending. The ending is pretty much unbelievable and also a fitting end to all the action and violence. Yes the violence is brutal at times but this is a very no nonsense crime drama that will knock your socks off. Dog Eat Dog definitely needs a more widespread release including an R1 release for sure. Great movie highly recommended.".

	schema:headline " Deeply effecting and moving film that defied my expectations";
	schema:reviewBody "Despite being quite far removed from my expectations I was thoroughly impressed by Dog Bite Dog. I rented it not knowing much about it but I essentially expected it to be a martial artsaction film in the standard Hong Kong action tradition of which I am a devoted fan. I ended up getting something entirely different which is not at all a bad thing. While the film could be classified as such and there is definitely some good action and hand to hand combat scenes in the film it is definitely not the primary focus. Its characters are infinitely more important to the film than its fights a rather uncommon thing in many Hong Kong action movies.I was really quite surprised by the intricacy of the characters and character relationships in the film. The lead character played by Edison Chen who is really very good becomes infinitely more complex by the end of the film than I ever thought he would be after watching the first thirty minutes. The police characters also defied my expectations thoroughly. In fact the stark and honest portrayal of the seldom seen dark side of the police force was quite possible my favorite aspect of the film. I don't know that I would say Dog Bite Dog entirely subverts typical notions of bad criminal good cop but it certainly distorts them in ways not often seen in film unfortunately. So many films especially Hong Kong action films I find portray police in what is frankly a VERY ignorantly idealized light. This is one of my least favorite things about the genre. I was pleasantly surprised to see that Dog Bite Dog actually had some very unique and really quite courageous ideas to present about the police force. There are negotiation scenes in this film that I have never seen the likes of before and doubt I will ever see again and am sure I will remember for quite a while. Also the criminal characters are shown from an interesting perspective as well there is some documentary footage in the film of Cambodian boys no older than ten being made to fight each other to the death with their bare hands which I thought was one of the film's most powerful and moving moments. It says a lot about the reason these guys are the way they are rather than simply condemning them. Also the relationship between Chen's character and the girl he meets in the junk yard reveals a lot about his character. It wasn't until this element entered the film that I really started to see the film as an emotional experience rather than only a visceral one. There is something about most on screen relationships that doesn't quite get through to me but for some reason this one really did. The actress does an incredible job with this role which I imagine was not easy to play.Dog Bite Dog also features some really breathtaking cinematography all though it is unfortunately rather uneven. There were some moments that I found really striking particularly in the last segment of the film but there was also a good deal of camera work that was just OK. Another slight problem I had was with the pacing which I also felt was uneven. I found a lot of the looking for a boat scenes to be a little alienating all though it quickly picks up after that. The action scenes are short and not too plentiful but are truly powerful and effecting particularly towards the end. The fight choreography is honestly not all that impressive for the most part all though to its credit it is solid and fairly realistic but the true strength is the emotional content behind the fights. The final scene while not a marvel of martial artistry or fight choreography is one of the most powerful final fights I have ever seen and I've seen quite a few martial arts films.I suppose the biggest determining factor of whether or not one will get much out of Dog Bite Dog is whether or not you can connect with the characters. All of them are certainly some of the more flawed characters one is likely to see in a film of any kind but there was something very human about all of them that I couldn't help but be drawn to and really feel for them particularly Chen's girlfriend. I should say that I doubt most people will like the film as much as I did simply because I imagine that most people will not like or care about the characters in the same way but I still recommend it highly all the same. It is truly a deeply moving and effecting film if you give it a chance.".

This is what movies are about and this is the reason Neo keeps watching bad HK movies. Dog Bite Dog is not only the Love Battlefield's director best movie ever but undoubtedly the best movie of the last two years. This is what true HK cinema lovers are waiting for. This is the movie that stamps a huge mark on the viewers and perhaps a place in HK cinema history. To be perfectly honest Neo haven't been this excited after a movie for years and finally this one delivers. It is that good it is that impacting and it is that brilliant. As I said before when I love movie I overlook its flaws but this one have none and at the very least it captured and got hold of my heart. Seriously if you are reading this review right at this very moment and still haven't watch Dog Bite Dog go bite yourself and run or whatever straight to the local DVD shop and bite on it! It's a movie you cannot miss! Writing this review right now within just minutes after viewing this extraordinary experience I am shocked moved and absolutely uplifted. Nothing is better than finding a gem in a sea of recycle water and Dog Bite Dog is like that in 2006 HK cinema. I am not exaggerating it is exactly how I feel right now. For someone who have been criticising Edison for his singing acting and dancing for almost his whole career with the exception of Jiang Hu Neo is still shocked to the max that such a person like Edison is capable of such performance. Not unlike Jet Li's Danny the Dog director Soi Cheang uses similar themes but make the movie 30 times better. It is unforgettable and cruel experience to endure through the brutality of humanity and the meaningless yet meaningful aspect of life.Sam Lee the actor who deems his way through supporting roles and leading roles in Bmovies have done something that he will be proud of. Perhaps a performance that will change his life and the direction of his acting future it is a heck of a brilliant and absolutely award winning performance. His brutal eyes and expressions of angry are terrifying and his transformation is utterly and brutally memorable. Sam Lee has matured into an actor and perhaps after years and years of appearing in crappy movies he has decided to stamp a point about himself. Alright let's make a bold statement here SAM LEE WILL WIN BEST ACTOR AWARD FOR 2006 HK FILMS AWARD! Edison Chen Edison Chen Edison Chen what can I say? A transformational performance and a career defining moment Edison has put out a heck of a memorable performance. As a dog he is aimless with ultimate goal of killing for survival and the way he changes throughout his experiences of love and anger is both extraordinary and beautiful to watch. Two thumbs up from Neo and you are officially a better actor than Ekin Cheng.The innocent girl played a role that limits her abilities but for once it was not a pretty face that shines through but a performance that underlines the beauty of smile even when all hopes are lost. She is fighter a symbol of hope and a passion for love. It is tiny moments of her smile that made the movie all the more credible and also perfectly juxtaposing the brutality with peace within oneself. Love is a power tool not only to fix things but changes people and peace within oneself.With that been said director Soi Cheang is a genius at making emotional packed ending as seen in Love Battlefield and Home Sweet Home. Here Soi Cheang opts for a level beyond emotional too smart to be conventional and even shock to be unpredictable. Not to spoil the ending it is so well done that one can not find any flaws but then again maybe Neo overlooked them. What made the movie even better is the outstanding use of scenery and contrasting the rapid fire industry of Hong Kong with the poverty yet underlying romantically charged Cambodia.I am still catching my breath at the moment and to be honest this movie really made my night. Its been a while that after watching the movie I watch straight to my lap top and started typing but in all I just wanted to share my feelings across before I forget. It can simply be a movie about a dog a mad dog finding love but this isn't just another dog movie. It is a movie about life the realities that exist in a place not too far away. It is the realism and the brutality that shock us but ultimately it is the movie as a whole that truly delivers. Dog Bite Dog is the best movie since 2004 and before I end this review I will repeat myself one more time  Neo just simply love it! Neo 2006Neo rates it 1010www.thehkneo.com".

	schema:headline " A film with bite.";
	schema:reviewBody "Some comments here on IMDb have likened Dog Bite Dog to the classic Cat III films of the 90s but although it is undoubtedly brutal violent and very downbeat this film from PouSoi Cheang isn't really sleazy lurid or sensationalist enough to earn that comparison. However it still packs a punch that makes it worth a watch particularly if gritty hardedged action is your thing.Edison Chen plays Pang a Cambodian hitman who travels to Hong Kong to assassinate the wife of a judge Sam Lee is Wai the ruthless cop who is determined to track him down whatever the cost. With Wai closing in on his target Pang will stop at nothing to ensure his escapeuntil he meets Yue a pretty illegal immigrant who needs his help to escape her life of abuse.A relentlessly harsh drama with great cinematography amazing sound design a haunting score and solid performances from Chen and Lee as well as newcomer Pei Pei as Pang's love interest Dog Bite Dog is one for fans of hardhitting Asian hyperviolence think along the lines of Chanwook Park's Vengeance trilogy. Stabbings shootings merciless beatings all happen regularly in this film and are caught unflinchingly by director Cheang.Of course this is the kind of tale that is destined to have an unhappy ending for all involved and sure enough pretty much everyone in this film dies rather nasty deaths. Unfortunately there is a fine line between tragedy and unintentional comedy and in its final moments Dog Bite Dog crosses it in a laughably overdramatic final scene Pang and Wai are locked in battle as a pregnant Yue looks on. Eventually after all three have suffered severe stab wounds during the fracas a wounded Pang performs a DIY Ceasarean on a now dead Yue delivering their baby moments before he himself dies.Whilst this film might not be a 'classic' slice of Hong Kong excess with its deliriously OTT action and stylish visuals it's still worth seeking out.".

	onyx:emotionText "Some comments here on IMDb have likened Dog Bite Dog to the classic Cat III films of the 90s but although it is undoubtedly brutal violent and very downbeat this film from PouSoi Cheang isn't really sleazy lurid or sensationalist enough to earn that comparison. However it still packs a punch that makes it worth a watch particularly if gritty hardedged action is your thing.Edison Chen plays Pang a Cambodian hitman who travels to Hong Kong to assassinate the wife of a judge Sam Lee is Wai the ruthless cop who is determined to track him down whatever the cost. With Wai closing in on his target Pang will stop at nothing to ensure his escapeuntil he meets Yue a pretty illegal immigrant who needs his help to escape her life of abuse.A relentlessly harsh drama with great cinematography amazing sound design a haunting score and solid performances from Chen and Lee as well as newcomer Pei Pei as Pang's love interest Dog Bite Dog is one for fans of hardhitting Asian hyperviolence think along the lines of Chanwook Park's Vengeance trilogy. Stabbings shootings merciless beatings all happen regularly in this film and are caught unflinchingly by director Cheang.Of course this is the kind of tale that is destined to have an unhappy ending for all involved and sure enough pretty much everyone in this film dies rather nasty deaths. Unfortunately there is a fine line between tragedy and unintentional comedy and in its final moments Dog Bite Dog crosses it in a laughably overdramatic final scene Pang and Wai are locked in battle as a pregnant Yue looks on. Eventually after all three have suffered severe stab wounds during the fracas a wounded Pang performs a DIY Ceasarean on a now dead Yue delivering their baby moments before he himself dies.Whilst this film might not be a 'classic' slice of Hong Kong excess with its deliriously OTT action and stylish visuals it's still worth seeking out.";

	schema:reviewBody "After watching this film I was left with a two very annoyances about this film why did they make Chen's character this McGuyver hitman and Lee's character such an incompetent idiot? Chen's character's background is that he was raised in an underground Cambodian orphanage for blood thirsty fighter where they learn to brawl it out to the death like wild dogs. This detail is pushed early on during a scene where he gets into a cab and as it starts to drive he shows how he is unfamiliar with a seat belt. Soon after this scene he has a similar situation at a dim sum restaurant. Not only is he uneducated he is starving. This is not a reference to Chen's scrawny physique but to the two early scenes in the film where he is scarfing down food one of which being rice porridge off the floor of the lower deck on an old ship. Si in the first ten minutes of the film it is established that Chen is malnutritioned unmodernizedand has only thing going for him his dog brawling fighting style of some sort. Despite this situation Chen manages to outshoot every policeman even managing to ricochet a bullet off a metal pipe to hit a guy in a head whom was holding Chen's girlfriend hostage and has somehow attained a super human strength swings a 50 lb block of concrete plastered on the end of a metal pipe to the head of the police chief AS he is getting shot in the chest by said chief.Now Lee's character...okay I get it he's depressed he's got some baggage but wow can he do anything right? One moment they try to make him cool composed and ready to take care of business and the next moment he just got beat again. First scene he runs into Chen and he manages to misses him from approx 15 ft multiple times. Toward the end of that scene Lee watches Chen as his close friend and coworker gets slowly stabbed in the neck with a long knife for a good full 5 seconds while holding a gun to Chen face at a 10 ft distance. Even at the end of the movie Lee manages to get stabbed to death and fails once again.And my biggest problem with this movie is that it is presented in a manner that film makers are trying to get the audience to sympathize with Chen's character and that he is just killing to survive. That would be a lot easier if I didn't just watch Chen kill innocent people throughout the whole awful movie. Of the numerous people he killed only two people had the intention of trying to kill him the police chief and Lee. Others were just people who were eating boat owners taxi drivers and policemen trying to arrest him not kill. Overall Chen's character is a just a cold blooded killer who kills for what he wants even if its just a free ride. Did I mention he is carrying a wad of hundred dollar bills throughout most of the film? My 3 stars go to some of the interesting directorcamera work who got in some nice shots.Bottomline One made for the nuthugging Chen fans. For me Dog Bite This DVD".

	schema:reviewBody "I watched the DVD of this movie which also comes with an excellent commentary track in English. It seems in Cambodia the subtitles in English say the character is speaking Thai but the movie says Cambodiaa very violent evil man is raising boys to be killers using starvation and training them to fight and kill. He sends Pang to kill some people in China and during the killings a cop's partner is killed. The cop Wai is a loose cannon who is worried about his father who is also a cop who was shot and is in a coma. Wai's chief is his dad's friend and is worried about Wai's erratic behavior. He doesn't know Wai was the one who caught his dad in dealing with drug dealers and shot him and put him into the coma. Pang escapes and hides in a squalid landfill shack where he meets a woman who came here to find her mother and keeps repeating her father won't let her leave Pang doesn't speak Chinese and doesn't understand this but saves her from her father who appears to be having sex with her maybe this is the reason for Cat III. Wai becomes more and more obsessed with getting Pang but Pang is almost unstoppable. Even after Pang steals a boat and takes the woman to his home where they are married and she becomes pregnant Wai follows and joins the evil man who's training the boysmaking a deal to fight and train so he can get Pang. There is a big showdown between Wai and Pang with the terribly abused woman the major victim and leaving Wai dead and Pang cutting out his child from the dead mother only to die and leave him as the possible next boy to be raised as a killer. This film is beautifully photographed with an excellent soundtrack. There are many very brutal violent scenes. The woman having a long nail pulled out of her foot. Knives to the neck and torso. Guns fired directly to the head. And several very intense beatings. It maybe grim intense and downbeat but it is definitely worth seeing.".

Pros He's angry alright. Cons When it comes to the explanation scene he cannot convey the sadnessdisappointment he has in his father. The crying scene was too fake and it seems like he is literally squeezing out tears from the corner of his eyes.2 To connect the movie to the title there were barking or dog wimping sounds during the fight scenes and rape scene which is totally irrelevant and confusing to the viewer. I understand that it's supposed to be a metaphor or what not... but it's just sooo dumb! 3 WHY THE HECK DID THE COPS NOT SHOOT THE KILLER? What the heck is wrong with this movie. When the killer started stabbing an officer SHOOT him. He's already dead! What the heck? There were lots of opportunity that the killer could be killed but I do not know why he wasn't! 4 During the scene where the girl had her foot hurt. In the scene it was very clear that the LEFT foot of the girls was hurt so how the heck in the next scene that she's lending all her weight on her left foot? And this is the actress nominated as the best new performer? WTF? 5 The sounds in the movie are off sync.6 I am guessing that this movie is trying to bring awareness of the brutality and violence among children in South East Asia so why does the bad guy wins and then the cop was joining the fight? 7 This movie is just too violent without a purpose. Cops are beating CI to a pulp and then if they cooperate they give them marijuana and coke? This is overall the worst movie. I truly feel that the person who wrote this movie is a sadist and sick person. I have never seen a more disgusting movie in my whole entire life. WORST MOVIE EVER!".

And in the end you were left feeling that all that detailed background information and introspection of the main characters was somehow very unnecessary.On the plus side the transition in story from point a to point b was quite atypical compared to US movies  so those who aren't familiar with Asian films and are tired of Hollywood's predictability should check it out.The white balance seemed off throughout most of the film.

Full of slapping stabbing and shooting but don't worry  the lead's a terrible shot it can best be described as a violent romp through Hong Kong and Cambodia. Edison Cheng plays Pang a Cambodian assassin in town to kill a barrister. Despite being filthy from his journey he's almost immediately seated at a huge table in the middle of an obviously expensive restaurant. If this sounds wildly implausible to you you should probably avoid this film. It acted as my cue to suspend disbelief and I had a lot more fun for it.Chasing Pang down is Wai Sam Lee a young edgy cop who likes to smack people around almost as much as he likes to smoke. Wai walks a fine line that has Internal Affairs investigating him and his father a legendary Good Cop is in a coma following a drug deal that went south the implication is that Wai is letting his father take the rap for his own corrupt dealings.There are a car crashes lots of killings and a strange and awkward love story on offer here all played out in almost comicbook style. I suspect the humour was deliberate nobody uses gargantuan concrete bludgeons without an eye for the extravagantly absurd though the overthetop nature lost a number of my fellow audience members. There are at least three points where the film might have ended and at 109 mins it may have benefited from more ruthless editing or the deletion of one of the narrative threads the lighthearted stuff worked well so I would have left out the interactions with the three fathers.I'm inclined to give it a high pass however if only because of the ending  I've rarely heard so many people laugh so loudly at what should have been a poignant moment.

	schema:headline " Refreshing but frustrating";
	schema:reviewBody "Note This is more of a semireview so if you're still looking forward to seeing the movie you might not want to read this. However if you wish to avoid a frustrating experience then read on.Dog Bite Dog is a refreshing change in Hong Kong cinema. As the starting credits came on I noticed that the movie was produced by a Japanese producer and directed by Soi Cheaung whom I'm not familiar with. This was enough foreshadowing for me to be prepared for something different from your regular mainstream Hong Kong flick. But I was not prepared for over an hour and a half of disbelief.The movie starts out quite well with maturing star Edison Chen playing the role of an assassin with the instincts of a killer canine. Gone are the days of the street kid rapperwannabe Edison has really come a long way and he plays a role similar to that of Jet Li in Danny the Dog aka Unleashed. I like Edison but personal preference could not save the unrealistic scenes in Dog Bite Dog. The storyline is decent Sam Lee's character has a complex background that I won't spoil and he's a bad cop which most of us would probably enjoy. But for some reason Edison's character Pang is some kind of super human he is just invincible to the point where you start to laugh in amusement. In the first encounter with the cops Pang kills at least two innocent citizens before taking another hostage while the cops panic and put down their guns. Obviously Pang manages to escape but not without killing a cop in the process and the hostage as well. At this point you'd want to prepare yourself because this is going to happen very often. I think perhaps the director is trying to show the compassionate side of man as the cops are constantly trying to stop Sam from being too brutal and sympathize for the hostages. This kind of attitude always gets themselves killed however.I didn't take a body count but Pang must have killed over 50 people in the end. Basically when he needs a car he goes in kills the driver and takes the car. In one scene he enters a fishing boat at night and kills an elderly couple just for fun and leaves. Yes director I understand that he has no feelings. But what I don't understand is why the need to make a complete MOCKERY of the Hong Kong Police Force? In one shootout scene near the end one of the cops finally snap and take the girl as hostage Pang's girlfriend apparently in order to get Pang to release his hostage a cop. The superior officer tells the snapped cop to release the girl but then suddenly Pang shoots the cop holding the girl right on the head. He then obviously kills his own hostage and runs while the cops stand in disbelief and me staring in disbelief. Sorry guys but if this was in America Pang would probably have like 20 bullets in his body hostage or not and I refuse to believe Hong Kong police are stupid enough to stand and watch. When one citizen is killed it gets blown to ridiculous proportions by the media one death is a serious thing in HK. There is NO WAY they would deal with a mass murderer like this. There were so many times I was just laughing and shaking my head in sadness and I found myself fast forwarding the compassionate moments of Pang because I just could not relate with a mass killer no matter what excuse he has or how he was brought up to be the way he is. In our society killing people at will is simply unacceptable no matter if it's your fault or not. Another strange concept was that all the cops who are supposed to be I'm assuming either Homicide cops or CID why are they all armed with six shooters? Even regular street uniformed cops are now switching to Glocks I have no idea why the director andor producer needed to dumb down the cops in order to make their point. The final half hour of the movie was so laughably pathetic that I found myself telling the story ahead of the movie itself. The girl whom I never got to know her name because she seems to have a kind of speech impediment is newcomer Weiying Pei 18 years of age from Mainland China and she gives a fantastic performance as well as being naturally beautiful. But what I can't stand about her is the way her presence dumbs down the cops. I can understand them not paying too much attention to a weak and injured girl but this girl has bashed Sam on the head before it's obvious she's with the criminal. How she is so constantly ignored and underestimated is simply pathetic predictable and an insult to the viewers' intelligence.This movie would probably appeal to those who are a bored closet psycho who has dreamed of murdering people for fun after playing too many video games or if you're simply too tired of the clichd Hollywood movies. Or if you have a beef with the HKPF and would enjoy watching cops getting owned. It was refreshing but I can't say I enjoyed it.".

	schema:reviewBody "I like amateurish crowdpleasing weirdness so take that into consideration when contemplating the 7 stars I'm granting.Contrary to what other reviewers have stated none of the three Jigoku films in IMDb have anything to do with the others. None are remakes they just all happen to be called Jigoku or Hell. I'm also taken aback by someone else's description of this film as pornographic. Okay so the gate to hell looks like a vagina but it's hardly prurient otherwise a few bared breasts linger before the cameras at regular intervals. Not what I'd call porn though the lengthy view of a very young girl's underpants is in highly questionable taste especially since the girl is a child molester's target.Those familiar with Japanese comics cartoons and movies will know that underage pantie shots are a staple in Japanese exploitation some strange schizophrenia allows the Japanese to both exploit and condemn child sexuality. Here the molester is punished with an eternity of repeated dismemberment. But I guess there's nothing wrong with the camera lingering on an 8yearold's white cotton briefs. The old lady other reviewers refer to is Enma the Queen of Hell King Enma is in Buddhist tradition the judge who determines where the wheel of karma will take your soul. Enma's decision to grant young Rika a glimpse of hell is reminiscent of the Roman Catholic myth of the young girls who were granted a vision of hell by Our Lady of Fatima and certainly Dante's Inferno has had an influence here sinners sinking into their own excrement is a direct lift.Hell is quite the fun place Enma's bestial minions actors wearing bizarre masks fright wigs and boartusk dental appliances detest the sins of their charges and take great delight in executing divine justice.The movie shifts gears considerably when about a third of the way through it becomes a soapoperatic docudrama about life within the Aum Shinriku cult the religious conspiracy responsible for the Sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway system in 1995. It helps here to know that Jigoku is the combination of two films that were begun before financing collapsed combined through a bit of extra filming and a lot of creative editing. The tone here is much like the exploitation gem The Ebola Syndrome exaggerating a truelife evil to play upon the fears of the audience. This is nowhere near the grossout fest that Ebola is but is similarly preposterous in the extremes of demonization it uses to amuse.For the third act we return to hell and Enma helps young Rika realize that to pray to an eternal being with a pure mind will bring about her salvation. She and a bunch of other girls then have a naked prayer session.I think both of these movies would be quite enjoyable had they been finished. 80 year old director Teruo Ishii has been amusing international audiences for half a century his best known film in the states is probably Attack of the Flying Saucers in 1964. The old guy probably doesn't have a lot of films left in him but I do hope his next backers let him finish one.".

	onyx:emotionText "I like amateurish crowdpleasing weirdness so take that into consideration when contemplating the 7 stars I'm granting.Contrary to what other reviewers have stated none of the three Jigoku films in IMDb have anything to do with the others. None are remakes they just all happen to be called Jigoku or Hell. I'm also taken aback by someone else's description of this film as pornographic. Okay so the gate to hell looks like a vagina but it's hardly prurient otherwise a few bared breasts linger before the cameras at regular intervals. Not what I'd call porn though the lengthy view of a very young girl's underpants is in highly questionable taste especially since the girl is a child molester's target.Those familiar with Japanese comics cartoons and movies will know that underage pantie shots are a staple in Japanese exploitation some strange schizophrenia allows the Japanese to both exploit and condemn child sexuality. Here the molester is punished with an eternity of repeated dismemberment. But I guess there's nothing wrong with the camera lingering on an 8yearold's white cotton briefs.

The effects are just middling with any effect in the viewer borders on laughter since they often are more silly rather than horrifying. If you compare this film to the original you see the opposite.

What I did get was this freakish thing the 1999 remake which you will adore if a lightly pornographic oldtestament remix of Monkey Magic sounds in any way appealing. I don't think there is a plot spoiler in this as there isn't a great deal of plot to spoil but just in case i do I excuse myself here. It loosely follows what I understand to be the story of the first Jigoku  sinners go to hell and are tormented and tortured for their crimes on earth. In this version the sinners are based on reallife criminals from Japan's recent past most prominently the cult behind the Tokyo subway gas attack in 1995. Also the woman who poisoned her family with curry !However in this dayglo remix the hell they go to is frankly hilarious and looks like a hugely endearing place to be. Populated by naked interpretive dance girls !? puppets of dragons living Heman figures a likable matriarch representing Satan and a cute winking guide in a shimmering dress. The backdrop looks like something you might see at a local drama group version of the Lion the Witch and The Wardrobe which this also somehow reminds me of. Having spent all the minuscule budget on the costumes the gore in the punishments are highly amusing in a DIY Story Of Ricky kind of way rather than at all disturbing. This is no Itchi The Killer so if you're looking for something extreme this isn't your chap but it is great fun main criticism is that the Cult's story goes on way too long silly inventive sexy and completely bargain basement. The more I think about it them more I love it to bits !".

So the dramatised middle segment  using the controversial subject of an actual case involving the Aum Shinrikyo Cult as its basis is spent on this cult group and their gloriously loony leader with really bad dandruff going about their business and setting their diabolical plans in motion. The tonal shift is noticeable as the comic nature of the hell sequences is dropped for something much sober. Quite grim in presenting the manipulation of such cults and at times increasingly bizarre having scenes of rubber cockroaches and squeaky muse toys infesting the cult's squalor residence.

However I did the find the cult side of the story to be inconsistently muddled and a little plodding as I had more interest in the tripped out journeymythology of the Japanese underworld and watching sinners get agonisingly punished.

Rika is allowed passage into hell to witness firsthand the punishment of the wicked and pass that knowledge on. A child molester for instance is treated to a course of forever dismemberment and resurrection for the rest of eternity.She is then shown her own life where we enter into a satirical look at a cult she's involved with that has elements on par with scientology.

Even a device that puts his followers 'intune' with his own brainwaves much like the 'EMeter' devices Scientology uses to bring people to enlightenment. The cult soon shows its real colors when an attorney refuses to back down in a case against them and they make him vanish. It was like watching Scientology mixed with the Manson Family.After that we are shown what will happen to the lawyers who defended the cult in a later murder trial along with the eventual demise of the cult leaders in a different manner.

I don't know what happened to the distribution of this movie perhaps there is an explanation but I suspect that many moviegoers just don't want to be troubled by the reality of what happened in Bosnia in the years that the movie so effectively depicts  19921995. It's a crying shame because this is a powerful beautiful story that focuses on a British journalist who must learn how to act on his moral outrage. As a former reporter I empathized completely with his sense of disconnectedness from the terrible events he witnesses. But as the camera moves through the burnedout rubble of the city and its surroundings the tension builds toward his inevitable actions and makes plain the movie's moral that even when we feel we can do almost nothing we should do whatever tiny bit we can. The message isn't heavyhanded it is intelligently conveyed through topnotch performances from a solid cast Woody Harrelson is perfectly convincing as the cowboy American journalist and a script that does justice to the complexity of the Bosnian situation. Real news footage is mixed quite cleverly with the invented  so well in some cases that it's hard to tell them apart. This isn't an easy movie to watch but it's worthwhile for those many of us who become confused and overwhelmed by the Bosnian situation. It's a powerful reminder too that being informed isn't enough action is imperative. I greatly admired this movie.".

Is it about Michael Henderson and his moral issues is it about all journalists and their moral issues is it about Flynn and his understanding of war is it about worlds' understanding of that war is it about Sarajevo about Emira about orphans? This movie needs focusing on one goal because this way I'm left with 100 stories that don't actually fit together and I don't know what I was watching the past 15 hours. Pictures of war make their message very clear but then its messed up with the story that tries to cover too many things at the same time. So is it fiction? Well no. Is it a documentary? Well no not that either...Most places shown in the move are totally wrong. Characters keep jumping from one end of the city to another in matters of seconds some events that really happened are shown in wrong places many times characters enter streets that in real life were sniper alleys etc. meaning no way one could get near and stay alive military checkpoints are mostly in the wrong places and so on but one can forgive details like that.Welcome to Sarajevo is trying to show you how it was living in Sarajevo under siege but its constantly missing the point and showing the wrong things. If you want to know how it looked like watch a documentary.To date the only realistic movie about Bosnian war is No Man's Land and that would be my highest recommendation. Other than that Lepa sela lepo gore is worth watching.".

But it is no longer. It's almost too easy to clear your mind of the strife going on in other parts of the world. Sometimes we feel guilty for being so fortunate. Sometimes we feel horror at the news reports of inhuman atrocities. And most times we shut out the reality of it as it is rarely affecting us in a personal way. This gripping tale of wartorn Sarajevo is told through the eyes of British reporters. It will probably shock jar and depress you but it will most certainly increase your sense of global awareness and instill a better appreciation of the liberties that most of us have taken for granted. Images from concentration camps hauntingly mimic those from fifty years ago.This film is based on an amazing true story of one man's personal involvement and promise to rescue one refugee child and the great lengths to which he must go to deliver her from a war zone.I caught this film in its limited theatrical run following its inclusion in the 1997 Toronto Film Festival. I exited the theater with my wife in a staggering awestruck state. No one could fully communicate what it would be like to live in a war zone but this film gives you a potent taste without pulling any punches.What this means is that most people will likely find it difficult to recommend this film to friends. It's not an uplifting tale but it is an extremely important one and I feel privileged and fortunate for having seen it.".

	schema:reviewBody "In Sarajevo the British journalist Michael Henderson Stephen Dillane is correspondent of war who decides to cover the orphans' situation due to the Bosnian War. Through successive matters he tries to show and sensitize the public opinion about this ignored war. Meanwhile he gets emotionally involved with Emira Emira Nusevic a young Bosnian girl. He decides to take the chance and brings her to the breast of his family in London. Some time later the girl's mother is found alive and requests the care of her daughter. Michael returns to Sarajevo to convince her to let him adopt Emira. The first time I watched this impressing movie was in 1999 and indeed it was the first film about the Bosnian war that I have seen. The director Michael Winterbottom makes a magnificent work alternating reality and fiction through images. Based on a true event he uses real war footages intercalating with his film to show the atrocities of this war having the focus on the children. Stephen Diallane Woody Harrelson Marisa Tomei Emira Nusevic and the rest of the cast have brilliant performances. There is a very special and cynical scene that I like a lot when the American journalist Flynn apologizes to a local in the name of the American people for the nonintervention of USA in this dirty war. This is maybe the best line of the great actor Woody Harrelson in this excellent movie. This week I have watched five films about this war and all of them are really excellent and highly recommended. If the reader likes this theme and wants to see different approaches do not miss 'Harrison's Flowers' 'Vulkovar' 'Pretty Village Pretty Flame' and 'Shot Through the Heart'. I intend to see again the magnificent 'Savior' and 'No Man's Land' along this week also about this horrible war. My vote is eight.Title Brazil 'Bem Vindo a Sarajevo' 'Welcome to Sarajevo'".

	schema:reviewBody "I think it's first important to understand what this film is not and hence why so many of the critical comments here are wide of the mark. It's not the Hollywood melodrama the trailer almost inevitably suggests. It's certainly not an indepth analysis of the causes of the Bosnian war. Probably what it's most about is the role of journalists and the media generally in a war zone.As an Englishman making a film about a foreign conflict I think Winterbottom's decision to focus on the true story of a British TV journalist was sensible  in the end Winterbottom's view can only ever be that of Henderson and in this way the film's integrity is maintained.It's easy to say that only someone with local knowledge can make a worthwhile film about this or any conflict however I think mistaken. Obviously Serb apologists like the several posting here will prefer a film which makes their side look less bad other parties to the conflict would presumably disagree and it is notable that the Serbian residents of Sarajevo were not ethnically cleansed by the government there. Nicholson on whose book the film was based was in Sarajevo undergoing the siege with the inhabitants. At the end of the day if a sniper is shooting children in front of you you do not ask whether there may be some historical justification for their actions.Once these false expectations are dispensed with the film is surely excellent. As in his other work Winterbottom does not go in for Hollywood handholding or emotional manipulation rather he aims at an Altmanesque ensemble piece with strong elements of black comedy and an open improvisatory feel. Big stars are given only cameo roles and seem to be happy with that certainly all the performances in the film are understated and unshowy with the actors content to inhabit the characters and relate to each other instead of to the audience. As with Altman we are expected to pay attention to pick up clues and to think and feel for ourselves.Where the film may fall down is on the occasions when it does stray into outright comment. Winterbottom's politics at least judging by this film seem to be straightforwardly liberal  terrible things happened our governments should have done more. Unfortunately as we have seen elsewhere too often these genuine humanitarian impulses are cynically and selectively used by politicians to serve their own agendas. At the end of the day Bosnia was of little economic value to the West so intervention was resisted for as long as possible.Overall this film avoids a lot of easy traps and is a fine addition to Mr Winterbottom's growing body of challenging and inventive work.".

Probably what it's most about is the role of journalists and the media generally in a war zone.As an Englishman making a film about a foreign conflict I think Winterbottom's decision to focus on the true story of a British TV journalist was sensible  in the end Winterbottom's view can only ever be that of Henderson and in this way the film's integrity is maintained.It's easy to say that only someone with local knowledge can make a worthwhile film about this or any conflict however I think mistaken. Obviously Serb apologists like the several posting here will prefer a film which makes their side look less bad other parties to the conflict would presumably disagree and it is notable that the Serbian residents of Sarajevo were not ethnically cleansed by the government there. Nicholson on whose book the film was based was in Sarajevo undergoing the siege with the inhabitants. At the end of the day if a sniper is shooting children in front of you you do not ask whether there may be some historical justification for their actions.Once these false expectations are dispensed with the film is surely excellent. As in his other work Winterbottom does not go in for Hollywood handholding or emotional manipulation rather he aims at an Altmanesque ensemble piece with strong elements of black comedy and an open improvisatory feel. Big stars are given only cameo roles and seem to be happy with that certainly all the performances in the film are understated and unshowy with the actors content to inhabit the characters and relate to each other instead of to the audience. As with Altman we are expected to pay attention to pick up clues and to think and feel for ourselves.Where the film may fall down is on the occasions when it does stray into outright comment. Winterbottom's politics at least judging by this film seem to be straightforwardly liberal  terrible things happened our governments should have done more. Unfortunately as we have seen elsewhere too often these genuine humanitarian impulses are cynically and selectively used by politicians to serve their own agendas. At the end of the day Bosnia was of little economic value to the West so intervention was resisted for as long as possible.Overall this film avoids a lot of easy traps and is a fine addition to Mr Winterbottom's growing body of challenging and inventive work.";

	schema:reviewBody "On a political level Welcome to Sarajevo almost comes across as proMuslim propaganda thus following the official line that tags the Serbs as the bad guys and the Muslims as the victims and the Croats as a sinister footnote.  People unfamiliar with the conflict will walk away with this general assumptionespecially given the common knowlege that the Serbs participated very prominently in the three other Yugoslav wars.  But the war was far more complex than that and no single film has yet to show the startling array of dimensions that fueled the violence in Bosnia in the 90s none manages to place the violence in a historical context.  Underground came close and the last sequence of Ulysses' Gaze gave it a good try but it wasn't really there.  Crowd favorite Pretty Village Pretty Flame simply wasn't a good movie whatever its intentions might have been. Taken together though a picture of Bosnia begins to emergeone that is decidedly dire and bloody but one that at least suggests how complex the war was.  Round it out with Vukovar and Cabaret Balkan and you'll have a home video film festival guaranteed to make you kill yourself.  Until someone makes a film about prewar Sarajevo with its vibrant multiethnic communities cosmopolitan sophistication elegant boulevards and generous hospitality and am I the only one who remembers the Sarajevo Olympics? cinematic Bosnia will have to be this violent wasteland of human pride and depravity.On pure filmgeek terms Welcome to Sarajevo is a meandering story that doesn't really seem to know what it wants to be is it a story about gonzo journalists or about the rescue of a little girl or about war atrocities? The gonzo journalist angle lasts for about a half hour and then promptly goes away.  Then there's the plot line about the rescue of the girl which appears somewhat arbitrarily a little late in the game.  Once that angle's resolved the movie keeps chugging along with a thoroughly inconsequential return trip to Bosnia that serves little dramatic purpose except to kill off another character.  The war atrocities thread runs throughout the film but never gels into a story of its own.  Given Woody Harrelson's topbilling and his grand entrance you'd think he and his antics would be important...but they're not.  Too many of the scenes go nowhere did I have to see the bus pulling over so the kids could sleep?  I think I could have figured out on my own that children sleep at night scenes that seem important end up not being so and some scenes that should be important are utterly forgettable. But still the prolonged bus ride is dreadful to watch in the good waykids in danger can't beat that for drama and seeing the girl prancing about the English garden wearing a cute dress and a bow in her hair was enough to give me a sense of relief.Final note I can understand the outrage any Serb would feel watching this film.  But in a way maybe that's the point.  Everyone should be outraged. Not by the onesided depiction of the war but by the fact that the Serbs did commit unspeakable atrocities in Bosnia and Croatia...as did the Croats and the Muslims yes even the victims took a generous shot at being the monsters.  Emira could have been from any one of those groups and children and adults from all sides of this spectacularly multisided war suffered the same as she did.  The only other group that gets badmouthed in this film is the West.  Of the many participants and guilty parties in Bosnia it is important to realize that not all were Bosnian.  European and American officials gave a collective shrug and said Not my problem and all those history lessons were proven to be worthless as we let the Balkan powderkeg explode once again and turned our eyes away from another Holocaust.".

The images of the concentration camps are of course harrowing and the scenes of the market place that was mortared are gruesome. There is an effective blending of news footage and movie to the point where at some point not immediately you don't know what is real and what is fiction. Ok. However this does not make for a movie. Movies have to have characters you can root for  they don't have to be Western journalists. I would have rooted for the little girl. Or her mom. Or the translator.

Plenty of Serbian's themselves died in the siege of Sarajevo as we made up over 13 of the cities population. I'm not sure what the motive was behind switching the girl's ethnicity but I can only suspect that it was motivated by Hollywood's desire to uncomplicate a complicated mess as well as pander to public consensus that Serbs were the aggressors and the 'bad' guys while Bosniaks Muslims were the victims 'good' guys.As far as the artistic merits of the movie herself I liked how she interwove real footage with fiction blurring the distinction. I also found it refreshing that such a marginal topic was brought to the big studios even though no one really watched. In the end though the movie was okay maybe even good but not great. The acting was fairly flat and the character development was mostly two dimensional. When the movie finishes you forget about it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sent to Bosnia to report on the war in the early 1990s a British journalist finds it hard to stay neutral in the conflict in this war drama from Michael Winterbottom. The film is based on the true story of a journalist who adopted a girl orphaned in the war. We're not here to help we're here to report he is reminded early on but can he just stand by and watch so many children devastated by war? 'Welcome to Sarajevo' is a noble attempt to shed light on a sad chapter in history seldom portrayed on screen but it is also admittedly a bit of a mess. The story is very unfocused as it tries to cram so much war horror into the plot. The protagonist does not even meet and think about adopting the girl until nearly halfway in and even then there are few scenes of them bonding. His affection for her is never well conveyed and we barely get a sense of her desire to leave the country. Winterbottom's inexplicable choice to only subtitle certain portions of Bosnian dialogue is awkward too and the blaring music soundtrack never quite feels right. Stephen Dillane makes for a decent lead and the film provides an admirable snapshot of 1990s Bosnia but the overall film unfortunately leaves a bit to be desired.".

It does not focus much on combat but rather the communities at large affected by it. The imagery is not as powerful as in other war movies yet the message is equally powerful.  Stephen Dillane makes an excellently understated leading man he proved himself wonderfully again in The Hours and as you can see from the rest of the cast list there are no slouches here. Tomei is as good here as she would be later in In the Bedroom.  Fox is well used. Even Woody Harrelson whose style is normally not my cup of tea really bothered me on Cheers and in his early film roles he does some of his best and most subtle work here.This film has a big heart and a bit of an attitude about our perspective on war among other countries as opposed to our own and it has a whole lot of heart.

Assignment K however is probably the best of the smooth hair movies.  He's a international spy in this one and a lot of the action takes place in a ski resort so the scenery is beautiful and wintry. He and Camilla Sparv play well together and best of all for Stephen Boyd fans like me he is onscreen throughout the entire film no cameos here  a major plus for this movie. Leo McKern another wonderful character actor turns up once again as the bad guy.  Remember him as the irascible but lovable Captain Brandt in Lisa? Assignment K is fairly fastpaced and somewhat exciting especially if you enjoy a little romance with your espionage.  And the ending will surprise you!".

Not too overhanded with the espionage...always one of my favorites back to when I first saw it on a double billremember those with King Kong Escapes.The theme song was always memorable...jazzy and you almost expected Sparv and Boyd to hook up at the end but it was not to be.

And 'Q' would certainly look down his nose at the homemade bomb his counterpart played by Geoffrey Bayldon comes up with here.The usually reliable Val Guest has to take most of the blame both for the uneven direction and contribution to a script that has pretensions to being taken seriously at times but is nowhere strong enough to be. As he had just been worked into the ground shaping with some success the chaos that was CASINO ROYALE he was probably a little jaded with the genre. He also wastes excellent character actors Jeremy Kemp and Leo McKern though the latter does make an impression against the odds. The revelations at the finale lack any impact. In fact a much bleaker ending had been filmed with Camilla Sparv's Toni being thrown into the river and drowned her stuntdouble being none other than the future star of saucy seventies' comedies Sue Longhurst.I quite enjoyed the 1960's ambiance including the relationship between Boyd and the alluring Sparv set against the glamorous background of Kitzbuhel ski resort.

The two have a rough time getting into the country until they meet a mysterious gangster's moll Anita Mui. Awhile later the three form an unusual friendship. Mark Go learns a lot from Ms. Mui as she teaches him how to survive in a brutal environment.A great film from the ever reliable Tsui Hark. What I like about his films is that he always has strong female characters. Anita Mui is simply wonderful in this movie. She also shows her vulnerable side she's not always hard as steel. Mark grows up quick in war torn Saigon. Tony Leung KaFai is good as well serious for a change instead of playing his usual goofy gigolo persona. The action scenes are staged very well they don't dominate the film. And what's a film starring Anita Mui without those skinny jokes yes a movie with Anita is not complete without a couple of skinny jokes at her expense. The movie was knocked in many ways because it's so different than the first two. I saySo what! The film is an essential action film from the master Tsui Hark.Highly recommended.Anita Mui also performs the songs in the film. Especially the haunting theme song heard in the middle and during the end credits of the film. A fitting song in so many ways.".

I think the direction and acting wasn't bad at all. Like many prequelsequels it suffers from hype and expectations. If its made exactly like the previous movies then we have a rehash. If it goes in a different direction like in this case it runs the risk of alienating a lot of loyal fans.Not sure how many of you knew the storyline prior to watching the film. I was at least privy to the plot summary before watching it in the theaters way back when. So I at least knew it took place in the 70s in Vietnam. Right there and then I knew it would be very different from the first 2 films. Wartorn Vietnam of the 70s would hardly be the kind of place where you find our heroes riding around in Rolls Royce's making high stake deals in fancy hotels or mansions wearing Fracescetti suits etc. A lot of the cool element of the original is due to Chow of course but settings and atmosphere had something to do with it as well. And Vietnam is not the kind of setting we're previously used to.What the film does show is probably a more realistic side of smuggling and counterfeitting. You make your deals at night in dark alley ways your clothes are cars are are much less flashy to avoid attracting attention to yourself. And of course Mark hasn't acquired his cool persona yet so we're missing that important element throughout most of the film.In short much of what we see is not entirely unexpected if you took the time to read the synopsis on the video box. Because the movie takes place at the time and place it did I'd say the crew did an OK job. As a prequel to ABT I am a bit surprise at the choice of location if not the time. I remember a scene in the original ABT where Mark talks about the old days of making counterfeit deals with Ho in Indoesia!! That was suppose to be 12 years ago according to movie dialog which would place us in the early 70s as well. So the movie would've been more continuous if we had Mark working for the H.K. crime organization already and making drops in Indonesia with or without Ho depending on whether they can get Ti Lung back for the role. I also think it might have been more interesting this way. Anita can still play Mark's love interest and much of the current ABT3 storyline can be incorporated as long as Mark isn't so goofy and inexperienced.".

	schema:reviewBody "Tsui Hark directed this sequel 1989 to John Woo's classic heroic bloodshed films Better Tomorrow 1 and 2 made couple of years earlier and this third installment is more a prequel than sequel. It concentrates on what happened before the first two films and has more drama than action in it. Chow Yun Fat is again Mark Gor who is in Vietnam and meets there his cousin Mun Leslie Cheung who is just released from prison when Mark arrives in Vietnam. They meet mysterious female assassin Kit the beautiful sweetheart Anita Mui and both of the men are attracted by Kit. The film concentrates pretty much on the war infested Saigon and the hell that's free in there so there isn't any particular plot in the film but that doesn't mean it's not interesting.I think there's couple of strong scenes of social criticism mostly the horrific customs scene at the airport when Mark Mun Kit and Mun's father try to travel away from the country and are abused by the corrupted custom officers. Also the scene at the hospital is very harrowing and is there to underline righteously the state of the world of that time and unfortunately there are even today places with same kind of circumstances in our world. Fortunately Tsui's attitude isn't this time as underlining as in his Once Upon a Time in China 1991 and Tomorrow 3 is therefore perhaps more noteworthy film as commenting society.The visuals are also brilliant as can be expected from this director. There are great use of blue smoke again and the gun fights are incredibly beautifully shot and are more effective than any gun fight in some Western effort. The slow motion death scene of one important character in the film's finale is perhaps among the most beautiful heroic death scenes I've seen and it is finished very carefully and thus it has such a power. After that scene everyone should know what this name heroic bloodshed for this genre means and what makes it so unique. The end is very sad too but as we know how Mark ends up in his subsequent adventures it gives some positivism for the sad ending of this third film. The ending is little irritating due to it's prolonged gun battles and fire power and I think it should have stopped little earlier in order to be more effective finale for the otherwise pretty great film.Better Tomorrow 3 is not as great and interesting as Woo's films but still this is much more than average effort from Hollywood and due to Tomorrow 3's great look and visuals I give this gladly 810 rating and think this is among the greatest films Tsui Hark has directed himself. He has produced perhaps as many films as he has actually directed and many have said he is better producer than director but this film shows that he really knows how to direct noteworthy films too.".

As a fan of the John Woo films I hate to say it but the gunplay in this film interfered with the human interactions. Not just a mindless action sequences. As a Chow Yun Fat fan I was really impressed with the range he displays here. Instead of the brash cowboy he played in the first two films he shows depth vulnerability and the best portrayal of this character. And what can you say about Anita Mui beauty brains brawn and charisma. A true cinematic masterpiece on par with the best Melville Renoir or Shaffner could have offered there. But then again who would have thought that exactly this film will be still so cherished after many years. It seems that only the fools reward the films for not being ahead of their time.

	schema:reviewBody "Sure it's not a crowd pleaser and exactly as enjoyable on a superficial level like WooHark's previous good installments... this film has something Woo never had and that's a very good idealistic detailed but at the same time a complex screenplay that is also opening the door for many various interpretations of the viewer as far as characters beliefs and motivations go very long spontaneous but also intense dramatic moments led sometimes by the three characters at the very same time brilliantly structured moody cinematography and many distinct characters differing one from another with their own issues interconnected throughout the story and most of all the ability telling a story mainly only by the images and songs. Not to mention the fact that this film features much more flushy and opulent deeply profound storyline than anyone could have ever witnessed in any J.Woo film to this day! Although one thing one could find lacking here that many fans of the first two films were affected by which are the action sequences that this film has clearly no such interest in or simply not being as focused on as many Woo's films though such scenes appear here now and then if sporadically but when they show up they're coming with a sense of the unanticipation shock and philosophical meaningness. As one biographer wrote In The Killer Woo shows two men firing guns back to back a sort of enclosed circle Tsui Hark has the same shot in A Better Tomorrow III except that it's Ho and Kit! Likewise Tsui has no interest in copying Woo's bullet ballet style of directing action sequences instead Tsui emphasizes the characters and the situations. Woo directs action for the sake of the action Tsui directs it for the sake of the story! Why people usually prefer the first one to this much dramatically superior film was already many times explained before and one of the things very often mentioned is the element of the commercialism and the appeal welldisposed to the western tastes that was ironically and effectively sold out. This film is totally different by its Chinese aesthetics that works in a more operatic dreamy poetic and sometimes fully surrealistic and artistic way J.Woo could only dream of to achieve. This time the meaning of the film is not about the traditional honor loyalty or brotherhood we've already seen in a never ending line of similar maudlin homoerotic movies Here we are introduced to the very meditative themes about the complexities of love and equality and above all Tsui Hark makes a much more ambitious effort as he brings these themes to a world swallowed by chaos. In the process of portraying the relationship between the main characters he humbles the viewers with the realization of how insignificant each one of us can be in the face of change. Yet he does not drag us into the abyss of desperation as he offers hope and redemption for those who keep trying. Otherwise he brings plentiful other themes resonating with the modern time among the politics the fear of the 97 handover and the sprawling examination of gender roles the film's background centers on the celebration of the Chinese nationality by the usage of the mutual heritage in favor of all or the Chinese notion of fate circling around all the main characters basically involving Anita Mui's meditative Kit pondering over all her doomed life that's conversely gonna reflect the life of Fat's Mark Gor later in his gangster period previous sequels  mind you.Each 24 or 20 frames per second are filled with an incredible ingenious sense for the timing and meaningful idea that both come along making a totally explosive impact on the mind of the viewer either verbally or visually. The film employs a jaggy documentary style to capture the chaos of its time then later in more quiet moments of the film's timeframe it's creating a lovely montage of Mun Mark and Kit shopping using gradated filters for a dreamy romantic feel that's bringing a sort of allegorical meaning that life continues even under the worst situations and can also continue with joy.There's another thing that makes this timeless masterpiece different from other installments this is one of the very few films that can never be REMADE. Possibly the best and the most provocative T.Hark movie ever! Let me say that now it doesn't quite surprise me that most of the critics were praising this film as the very best one in this classical series... they could never be more right this time.".

The chemistry between Chow Yun Fat's Mark and Anita Mui's Kit is great  especially with Kit.  The viewer really feels for her. Great job.The not so good  Many people accuse John Woo's films of totally ignoring women.  But when it comes to A Better Tomorrow  many people criticize part three for placing a woman in the mix.  It's supposed to be a story of brotherhood and friendship.  In a way I agree.  There should be more women representation is some of John Woo's work  but with this series  many fans prefer a team of friends  guys  more specifically Ho  Mark  and Kit from the first in the series.  I would rather have had part three be a true sequel picking up where the second left off with Ho and Mark's brother Ken also played by Fat and tell about there struggles and how they are getting over the events of the last movie.  Then you can put Anita Mui in the storyline somewhere and have her help them out in some way.Overall  A Better Tomorrow 3 is pretty good.  Not much like the first two but an alternative that strays from the formula and may be accpted by some and not by others.".

Even if he wanted to push the envelope on the series by making a prequel he should've done a wayyyyy better job.The storyline takes Mark back to Vietnam where we learn his life as a younger much less gangly individual. However don't count out Mark when guns are ablazing wherever they may be. It also has a take on his romantic days with a mysterious mob boss' girlfriend Anita Mui and the love square they all shared with the Japanese boss and Tony Leung.Let's talk what's important 1st in these movies. The action. Whatever you can expect in a late 80's early 90's action Hong Kong film  it's all there. Tsui Hark definitely made it through with the gun fighting scenes. Yet  they weren't as stylish and you could even say they can become boring once you recognize the similar scenes from other movies. Everyone's wielding an M16 or AK47 shooting the crap out of each other while Mark flies through the air with his signature double fisting handguns.Where's the edge? Where's the coolness that Mark had from the 1st movie when he strolled through the restaurant nonchalantly dropping berettas everywhere as he plans to slowly walk in to kill the boss while he's eating hotpot? Where's the climax that we felt in the 2nd movie where all three Ken Lung and uncle Keen all dressed up and were ready to avenge Kit's death? Let's talk about the plot. Vietnam. WHAT?!? The 1st thing I thought of when I heard prequel was  How brother Lung and Mark started it all  from humble beginnings as street punks to an established powerful gang where they both reign as kingpins. Or even how uncle Keen brought Mark and Lung into the gang and how they became who they are today. However what I found was a seemingly ridiculous plot where Mark is thousands of miles away fighting stupid wars that he got himself into. THEN he's somehow involved with Anita Mui. I'm sorry but some scenes where Mark is caught up in love made me lose respect for the character of Mark that I know.What makes these ABT films is through the theme of brotherhood  in this movie there simply wasn't enough  or it just wasn't standing out. What your eyes see is romance romance romance. Not to say that a love story isn't nice once in awhile but come on. As a prequel?! No  that just won't do.If John Woo was involved in this movie he definitely would've said  Ummm no  we're not going to shoot this movie because it's gonna be terrible. Looks like he dodged a bullet. No pun intended For an ABT fan you might enjoy it because you get to learn more about Mark. But as a movie goer avoid this one. It's a major disappointment and you'll be happy that you didn't waste 2 hours of your life.".

The 1st thing I thought of when I heard prequel was  How brother Lung and Mark started it all  from humble beginnings as street punks to an established powerful gang where they both reign as kingpins. Or even how uncle Keen brought Mark and Lung into the gang and how they became who they are today. However what I found was a seemingly ridiculous plot where Mark is thousands of miles away fighting stupid wars that he got himself into. THEN he's somehow involved with Anita Mui. I'm sorry but some scenes where Mark is caught up in love made me lose respect for the character of Mark that I know.What makes these ABT films is through the theme of brotherhood  in this movie there simply wasn't enough  or it just wasn't standing out. What your eyes see is romance romance romance. Not to say that a love story isn't nice once in awhile but come on. As a prequel?! No  that just won't do.If John Woo was involved in this movie he definitely would've said  Ummm no  we're not going to shoot this movie because it's gonna be terrible. Looks like he dodged a bullet. No pun intended For an ABT fan you might enjoy it because you get to learn more about Mark. But as a movie goer avoid this one. It's a major disappointment and you'll be happy that you didn't waste 2 hours of your life.";

These action scenes cannot be compared to John Woo's sequences. Some reviewers call this the best one of the series.

	schema:reviewBody "Now this is a prequel to the first film so rather than ABT 3 I might have suggested they call it A Better Yesterday but I wasn't there at the time.This time Woo is out and Tsui Hark is in the director's chair leading to the worst film in the trilogy. Is it any wonder that Woo and Hark were once peers and that only one went on to direct internationally while the other stayed in Hong Kong making films? In Tsui Hark's defense Woo's only real strength is action sequences his films are otherwise no better or worse. But this IS an action film. At two hours long this drags mightily for quite a while and the action is over the top without the Woo benefit of being dumbly entertaining. It is like Tsui Hark said I can't promise you'll enjoy it so I'll make it bloodier and more far fetched.A young Mark Chow Yun Fat goes to Vietnam in 1974 at the tail end of the Vietnam war to meet his cousin Mun as he released from prison for being involved in the black market.Mun only turned to crime to assist his ailing father to leave Vietnam and return to Hong Kong but he got caught up in the wrong crowd and ended up in jail. So they decide to reenter the crime world to get quick cash so that they can have another crack at leaving the country taking UncleDad with them.Now I ask you what could go wrong?Mark was only able to get through Vietnamese Customs with the assistance of an unknown woman and she turns out to be their first contact in the Vietnamese crime underworld named Miss Chow.After their first job together goes wrong and a bloodbath ensues Miss Chow turns into a female Rambo and blows dozens of bad guys away and Mun and Mark acquit themselves well enough that the three of them get along like a house on fire and spend all their time together.Now that they have the cash to leave Vietnam they sell up and head off again nothing goes smoothly and it is only thanks to Miss Chow that they get through with Uncle nearly dying in the process.Back in Hong Kong a love triangle quickly forms Mark and Mun both have the hots for Miss Chow but she only has eyes for one of them and it wouldn't be fair to say which here. Shortly after though the threesome becomes a foursome with the return of Miss Chow's former boss and ex from an overseas stay.The boss immediately attempts to sever all of Miss Chow's distractions by initially trying to kill them and then ordering them to leave Hong Kong immediately.Of course this is never going to wash so we have a deranged finale with Mun Mark and Miss Chow joining forces in a bloodbath that leaves dozens killed and involves tanks machine guns standoffs and switching allegiances. Basically everything that John Woo would have included but in a manner so clumsy that for half the time I couldn't work out what was going on and for the rest I didn't care.Final Rating  5.5  10. A disappointing end to what was hardly an aweinspiring trilogy to begin with. They should have stopped at two.If you liked this review or even if you didn't check out oneguyrambling.com".

It is like Tsui Hark said I can't promise you'll enjoy it so I'll make it bloodier and more far fetched.A young Mark Chow Yun Fat goes to Vietnam in 1974 at the tail end of the Vietnam war to meet his cousin Mun as he released from prison for being involved in the black market.Mun only turned to crime to assist his ailing father to leave Vietnam and return to Hong Kong but he got caught up in the wrong crowd and ended up in jail. So they decide to reenter the crime world to get quick cash so that they can have another crack at leaving the country taking UncleDad with them.Now I ask you what could go wrong?Mark was only able to get through Vietnamese Customs with the assistance of an unknown woman and she turns out to be their first contact in the Vietnamese crime underworld named Miss Chow.After their first job together goes wrong and a bloodbath ensues Miss Chow turns into a female Rambo and blows dozens of bad guys away and Mun and Mark acquit themselves well enough that the three of them get along like a house on fire and spend all their time together.Now that they have the cash to leave Vietnam they sell up and head off again nothing goes smoothly and it is only thanks to Miss Chow that they get through with Uncle nearly dying in the process.Back in Hong Kong a love triangle quickly forms Mark and Mun both have the hots for Miss Chow but she only has eyes for one of them and it wouldn't be fair to say which here. Shortly after though the threesome becomes a foursome with the return of Miss Chow's former boss and ex from an overseas stay.The boss immediately attempts to sever all of Miss Chow's distractions by initially trying to kill them and then ordering them to leave Hong Kong immediately.Of course this is never going to wash so we have a deranged finale with Mun Mark and Miss Chow joining forces in a bloodbath that leaves dozens killed and involves tanks machine guns standoffs and switching allegiances. Basically everything that John Woo would have included but in a manner so clumsy that for half the time I couldn't work out what was going on and for the rest I didn't care.Final Rating  5.5  10. A disappointing end to what was hardly an aweinspiring trilogy to begin with. They should have stopped at two.If you liked this review or even if you didn't check out oneguyrambling.com";

A literary or cinematic work of a comic nature or that uses the themes or methods of comedy. 3. Popular entertainment composed of jokes satire or humorous performance. 4.

I read all of Morris and Goscinnys work when they were at their best. In addition there was always with a twinkle in their eyes creating this hero what he is today.IMHO Terence Hill makes a great job capturing that from the comic books and here for those that think Morris made a mistake. All the movies he was in had an angle with tongueincheek perspective. Why would they continue their collaboration if he Morris had not approved of Terence Hill and the screen writing. Terence Hill doesnt take himself to serious and that shows in his movies. No cussing or questionable nude scenes just pure good old fashion fun. As a movie buff I enjoy a good movie and I dont judge how and who and why this and that is awful or faithful to whatever the source of a movie. I watch a movie to be entertained without to have to dissect every move or scene I see. This one is great full of humour and with a tongueincheek kind of way.

	schema:headline " Nice to see Terence Hill again  but Lucky Luke this is not";
	schema:reviewBody "I really wanted to like this movie firstly I'm a lifelong fan of the Lucky Lukecomics second only to Asterix the Gaul secondly like most German kids of my generation I grew up with the Terence Hill films of the 70's and early 80's. Especially the SpaghettiWesterns with Bud Spencer where Hill would play the unwashed gluttonous yet always fair and drawing faster than his own shadow Trinity were cult. Later Hill would sort of reprise the role under the name Nobody or Nessuno in the original version playing a similarly fast and witty yet cleaner version of Trinity. In many ways Nobody was a more anarchistic lawless version of Lucky Luke.Indeed what could go wrong casting Terence Hill in a real Lucky Lukefilm? Well theoretically the glove fit Hill like Pierce Brosnan would make the ultimate James Bond  in theory.Technically both the shortlived series and the film edited together from the show are so flawed that they're virtually unwatchable as Lucky Lukefilms and make it hard to choose what to start with. For one Terence Hill is roughly 20 years beyond his prime. Had this film been produced in the 70's Hill could have gotten away with pure panache  in the 90's he simply looks worn out trying to reproduce the moves from Trinitytimes.Hill could have even gotten away had the Lucky Lukecharacter been named for what it really is Nobody AKA Nessuno. Even down to the outfit which has nothing in common with the iconic Lucky Luke outfit the character had every physical trademark of Nobody but none of Lucky Luke.The comicbook Luke is a sombre character who only talks when needed forever having a rolled cigarette between his lips virtually unimpressionable but always ready to help those in need of a fastdrawing gunman. But this here is Nobody somewhere between goofy supercool who will occasionally play the simpleton in order to mask his superior wit and imagination.Trying to find something good to say about Lucky Luke the film is good wholesome familyfriendly fun that can be enjoyed by both young and old  unless you're a hardcore Lucky Lukefan that is. And it's good to see Terence Hill again even though it's like seeing a relative whom one lost connection with over the decades one is happy to see them again reminded of the 'good old days' and still very fond off  but in the back of your head you're thinking that time hasn't been kind to them and that the youthful vigour is forever gone.I hate to recommend any film featuring Til Schweiger but if you need to feel a real life film about Lucky Luke rather go for the 2003 version  at least Lucky is wearing blue jeans a yellow shirt and a black coat though I still can't see Lucky Luke without the iconic cigarette.As a laterTerence Hill vehicle I'd give it six points as a Lucky Luke film it get's merely four so I'll settle for the middleground.".

Later Hill would sort of reprise the role under the name Nobody or Nessuno in the original version playing a similarly fast and witty yet cleaner version of Trinity. In many ways Nobody was a more anarchistic lawless version of Lucky Luke.Indeed what could go wrong casting Terence Hill in a real Lucky Lukefilm? Well theoretically the glove fit Hill like Pierce Brosnan would make the ultimate James Bond  in theory.Technically both the shortlived series and the film edited together from the show are so flawed that they're virtually unwatchable as Lucky Lukefilms and make it hard to choose what to start with. For one Terence Hill is roughly 20 years beyond his prime. Had this film been produced in the 70's Hill could have gotten away with pure panache  in the 90's he simply looks worn out trying to reproduce the moves from Trinitytimes.Hill could have even gotten away had the Lucky Lukecharacter been named for what it really is Nobody AKA Nessuno. Even down to the outfit which has nothing in common with the iconic Lucky Luke outfit the character had every physical trademark of Nobody but none of Lucky Luke.The comicbook Luke is a sombre character who only talks when needed forever having a rolled cigarette between his lips virtually unimpressionable but always ready to help those in need of a fastdrawing gunman. But this here is Nobody somewhere between goofy supercool who will occasionally play the simpleton in order to mask his superior wit and imagination.Trying to find something good to say about Lucky Luke the film is good wholesome familyfriendly fun that can be enjoyed by both young and old  unless you're a hardcore Lucky Lukefan that is. And it's good to see Terence Hill again even though it's like seeing a relative whom one lost connection with over the decades one is happy to see them again reminded of the 'good old days' and still very fond off  but in the back of your head you're thinking that time hasn't been kind to them and that the youthful vigour is forever gone.I hate to recommend any film featuring Til Schweiger but if you need to feel a real life film about Lucky Luke rather go for the 2003 version  at least Lucky is wearing blue jeans a yellow shirt and a black coat though I still can't see Lucky Luke without the iconic cigarette.As a laterTerence Hill vehicle I'd give it six points as a Lucky Luke film it get's merely four so I'll settle for the middleground.";

	schema:reviewBody "Created in 1946 Lucky Luke the cowboywhoshootsfasterthanhisshadow is the product of a generation raised by the most iconic ambassadors of American cinema westerns. Luke's father Morris knew his classics and every adventure was the opportunity for a fun exploration of one of the many popculture aspects of the genre desperadoes pioneers stagecoaches Indian wars etc. Like I said in my How the West Was Won review you could learn as much about the Old West with Lucky Luke as with John Ford. Yup! So here we are in 1991 when it's the Belgian cowboy who inspires an American movie. Now should we say finally? It's impossible not to get some fullcircle coming vibes and loop closing delight in the fact that Morris finally made his poor lonesome cowboy get back to his roots... but let's face it Lucky Luke is as American as hot chocolate. As one of the most successful alumni of the FrenchBelgian school of comicbooks like rivals Asterix or Tintin its satirical humor can only mock foreign archetypes in a way that would appeal to a European audience. Maybe Terence Hill was too European for Lucky Luke.Indeed Hill is a popular actor who's made a name for himself thanks to his streak of buddy movies during the 70s80s with Bud Spencer together they've made millions of people laugh over the world and it's precisely for the relative 'innocence' and 'childishness' of their actionpacked LaurelandHardy style that a parody of Lucky Luke could have worked for the European public. It could work with Americans on one condition wherever to go you've got to fully get into that area. If you go for plain parody you adopt the noholdsbarred Mel Brooks style if you want to have your Western Spaghetti with a comedic al dente you make a lighthearted 'Leone'. But if you go the SpencerHill way at least make sure your Hill is good. And Hill isn't quite good. He's like playing the straight man in a movie without any clowns until the second half starts and by the time the Daltons make their memorable entrance we've endured a gallery of bland supporting characters supposed to be foils for a Lucky Luke who didn't look any more fun. There's a serious problem when you're more entertained by the voiceover or the stereotypical Chinese laundryman than the film's own hero. Hill played Lucky Luke like a man caught in the middle of strangers afraid to ask where the bathroom is while holding a big one. And not only Hill didn't look happy but I'm not even sure he enjoyed doing the film. I wouldn't blame his acting rather than the fact that he was 52 not quite the epitome of his youthful good looks and he used to be quite goodlooking. The clothes didn't help either it's even the first thing that struck us in the theater yes I have a pretty vivid memory of this film as one of the first I saw on the big screen. As a kid I was thinking but this isn't Lucky Luke why is he blonde? Old? Where is the black vest yellow shirt? but even without these superficial elements that bothered my Dad too he also grew up reading the comics the film could have worked. But it didn't. Gene Siskel said with a great casting 80 of the movie is there with this film you have a good counterargument.Lucky Luke is more fun to watch during the entire opening credits song than the whole movie. I liked his training with the shadow and his faces with the gopher and when the shadow outruns him and I reckon the song is quite catchy if the film was as good as the credits it could have afforded to be a cultclassic  la Johnny Dangerously. But there's nothing funny intimidating or even badass about Luke he's just standing posing making shots so badly edited they wouldn't have made the cutting room of a 30s second feature not to mention his dubbing voice slightly above Kung Fu movies' level. When he doesn't act he rides he sleeps and rides again the narration of Jolly Jumper is less a fun device than a yawning antidote. There are a few good things about the film I liked Nancy Morgan as Lottie Legs the Dalton are rather fun with Ron Carey who plays a Pesci version of Tuco which gets close enough to Joe Dalton and Fretz Seberg was quite a satisfying Averell. When the Daltons pop up the film's energy is enhanced... for a little while. Joe Dalton finds the town boring and it sounds like a selfreferential comment the Daisy Town in the film doesn't leave much to be interested in... until the Natives' part. But even I with my mind as open as Fort Alamo as someone who enjoys the caricatures in Goofy cartoon's Californyer's Buster or Blazing Saddles I was cringing many times. It's less for the caricatures than the fact the actors weren't even good... as I said if you want to go for the caricature do it frankly and responsibly not shyly doesn't work with Americans... doesn't work with any audience actually.The 1990s wasn't exactly a great decade for Lucky Luke. In 1991 the new animated series came out and despite a relative faithfulness to the albums' spirit plotwise it lacked the zany energy of the 80s HannaBarbera version. Then after what I consider his last great album The Daltons' Amnesia the trait of Morris worsened by age was going more and more uncertain until he indulged to a practice which I believe is the antithesis of creation reproducing frames in the same page. I don't think I bought any album made after The Dalton at the Party in 1993. In that unfortunate lackluster context the movie didn't improve things and it's quite fitting that its funniest running gag is an interrogation mark over someone's head.".

Here's the exact same idea done more than 60 years earlier in Germany. Considering that this is a German drama it has a surprisingly lighthearted tone. The central object in this movie is a 10mark banknote.I shan't try to work out a currency conversion for what 10 German marks in 1926 would equal in our own era's money but evidently 10 marks were a respectable weekly wage for an unskilled labourer in 1926. Young peasant girl Anna Mary Nolan has just received her first week's wages in the form of a 10mark note. She gives it to her mother Agnes Mueller ... who brings it to the market intending to buy groceries. A pickpocket steals the money.And so forth. Along the way this banknote generates more trouble than it seems to be worth. Several people die or have their lives ruined for the sake of briefly possessing this meagre piece of currency. Of course in 1926 most German filmgoers would recall the horrible inflation of only a few years earlier when it cost a MILLION marks to buy a loaf of bread. The message here seems to be that money is inherently evil that the trouble it causes far surpasses the good it can do.SPOILERS NOW. At the end of the movie of course the 10mark note comes back into Anna's possession ... and she recognises it by the serial number as the same note. Meanwhile Anna and her young neighbour Andreas Werner Fuetterer have fallen in love. They embrace and the banknote flutters to the floor ... where Anna's dog tears it to shreds. Oh the irony! Oh the moral!Despite some heavyhanded visual metaphors this is still an interesting movie with an interesting depiction of life in Germany between the World Wars. Oskar Homolka is impressive as Anna's employer. I'll rate this movie 5 out of 10. Got change for a deutschmark?".

	schema:reviewBody "The French make some very fine films.  They also make some really pretentious stinkers.  This is of the former variety.A very well acted and directed film.  The seediness of the criminals prostitutes the lawyer and the cops is very well portrayed.  You do need a scorecard to tell the good guys from the bad guys in this flick.  Which would appear to be exactly the response that the director Maurice Pialat wishes to elicit.Sophie Marceau does a fine job portraying the beautiful but ethically and morally empty Noria.  It's very evident that she's using Depardieu's character to achieve her own ends.  However Depardieu knows it too but cannot help himself.It's Depardieu's movie and he plays his character perfectly.  A combination of arrogance brutality macho humor and vulnerability.  You come to realize that for all of his violence groping women and swagger that on some level he is a lost innocent.  In one scene where he and Noria are in a car making out he comments that they're acting like a couple of kids. Noria responds something to the effect that that's exactly why it's so good.The final scene is played out perfectly by the two main characters. Depardieu is perfect in portraying both anger and vulnerability.  The viewer is left with a view of the tough guy left broken hearted by the beautiful but empty hearted girl.  The movie is about the basic human tragedy and the grave error of living only for one's own appetites.Very good movie.  It gives the initial impression of only being a tough French cop film.  But it's really a morality play which is done in such an artful manner that you barely notice until the ending.  It's also very romanticif only in a failed sense.  It appears to me to make the point that love can only live where there is honesty and a willingness to be open and vulnerable.  Hence it's inevitable death in the sordid world of the Police.".

	schema:headline " Another underrated movie that's worth checking out....";
	schema:reviewBody "Maurice Pialat's POLICE begins with an extensive interrogation by a cop... played by Gerard Depardieu. The shots almost exclusively flick back and forth in medium shot. To begin with the criminal is defiant. But over the course of almost 10 minutes he's slowly broken down into a confession. It's a fascinating scene to watch... and although it's not recreated directly throughout the rest of the movie 10 minute scenes with two shots would get tiresome quickly... the mood of the opening scene permeates through the whole of POLICE. The movie is a slow breakdown of the facade people build around themselves.Much of the dialogue seems improvised. Characters stumble over words and get caught in seemingly unrelated conversations. The Masters of Cinema extras DVD catches Pialat berating actors on set... trying to pull something out of the improvisation. He was apparently a real pain to work for but the end result seems to work in POLICE.Depardieu is the centre of attention playing the slightly shonky cop Louis. He's hulking in size 6ft tall and a pretty wide load often towering over the bad guys and dwarfing the various girls he flirts with. At times Louis is almost comedic grabbing every ass around him. He thinks he's a whizz with the ladies and the greatest cop around... and because he throws his weight into it all people believe him.The depth of POLICE is we see Louis behind the charade progressively doubting himself. He's falling in love with one of his suspects Noria played by Sophie Marceau who ended up sinking into being a Bond girl in THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH and it's eating away at him. He's bending more rules than ever and getting unnecessarily interested in a girl whose own family don't trust her. Louis becomes frantic reaching out for prostitutes drink and  eventually  frantically humping Noria in the Police HQ.The strength of the movie  and whether you'll like it or not  revolves around Louis. He's very irritating at the start of the movie... a letch an idiot someone searching for reactions from people. He's sleazy and seemingly irremediable. Yet at the movie goes on and as his vulnerabilities creep through he becomes strangely likable. Can he trust Noria? Is she leading him on to save herself or is she as lost as he is? So many films have predictable relationships but this one is a good 'un. We neither trust Noria or Louis yet we feel sympathetic towards both of them. This all leads to a real doozy of an ending  and a thought provoking one too.POLICE isn't a quick watch. It lacks dynamic scenes and it's only for those who can take constant dialogue. It's also not a movie laden with style. But when closeups are used they're used to great effect. Louis's confused bignosed mug... Noria's seemingly flawless good looks... something's going on behind those surfaces. You may gripe at the movie needing to be shorter and tighter but it'll leave an impact because of these two fascinating characters. And for that reason it's well worth getting hold of a copy of POLICE.".

Anchoring Police is the formidable Gerard Depardieu playing Inspector Mangin a chunky pitbull of a man who mixes charm playfulness and violence together as he plays his way through the crimefighting game with equal amounts of efficiency and carelessness. Pialat's camera loose and restless seems fascinated by him and Depardieu's performance devours the film overshadowing the director's themes of loneliness and criminality in France.The first twothirds of Police are it's best as Mangin is caught up investigating a bunch of Tunisian drugdealing criminals and has his eye caught by the doeeyed and beautiful Noria Sophie Marceau the girlfriend of one of the chief suspects. It's in these early scenes that Mangin is off the leash slamming suspects heads into tables as a manner of interrogation and outside of work joking with his friend Lambert Richard Anconina the criminal lawyer for most of the scumbags that Mangin puts away. Lambert is good at what he does and most of his clients get off yet he and Mangin laugh and joke about the system. It's all just a game to Mangin something for him to do in order to satisfy his many appetites as the line between the police and criminals is blurred.Then Police settles down somewhat as Noria turns from frightened innocent to fullyfledged femme fatale. She gets herself involved in a stolen wad of cash and suddenly noone is safe. Mangin is slowly revealed to be a lonely widower and the film loses it's momentum. The fast dialogue and the murky world of pushers pimps and prostitutes fades in favour of long takes in empty rooms and Mangin suddenly isn't as interesting as he was.

	schema:headline " Kind of slow going but ultimately worth it";
	schema:reviewBody "This definitely isn't the most exciting movie about law enforcement it took me three tries to finish it because I kept falling asleep. Instead of car chases and shootouts it contains a lot of dialogue some obviously improvised and focuses mostly on the relationships between the various interesting characters. It is a kind of a police procedural but even there it focuses on the more mundane aspects of police work that the much more famous Hollywoodand slightly more famous Italian cop movies tend to skip over.The whole thing wouldn't work though if it weren't for the acting. Gerard Depardieu plays one of his sympathetic antiheroes the kind of guy you really shouldn't like but eventually really do. Even though she was only about 18 at the time Sophie Marceau manages to hold her own against the great Depardieu as a potential femme fatale who is mixed up with the Tunisian drug dealers he is trying to bust. It's well known that Marceau is a Bond girl but it's not often mentioned that with the possible exception of Eva Green she's also the most TALENTED of all the Bond girls. I was impressed with Sandrine Bonnaire for another reason. I knew she was a formidable actress from Claude Chabrol's L'Initiation but I had no idea how cute and sexy she was in her younger years. She has a much smaller role as a 19yearold prostitute Depardieu's character picks up but she handles the requisite Frenchmovie fullfrontal nude scenes both Depardieu and Marceau uncharacteristically forego.The crime story here is interesting too in that both the Tunisian criminals and the cops are obviously flawed but not unsympathetic characters. You kind of don't want anybody to win or lose.This is kind of a slowgoing flick but ultimately it is worth it.".

	onyx:emotionText "This definitely isn't the most exciting movie about law enforcement it took me three tries to finish it because I kept falling asleep. Instead of car chases and shootouts it contains a lot of dialogue some obviously improvised and focuses mostly on the relationships between the various interesting characters. It is a kind of a police procedural but even there it focuses on the more mundane aspects of police work that the much more famous Hollywoodand slightly more famous Italian cop movies tend to skip over.The whole thing wouldn't work though if it weren't for the acting.

The film stars Grard Depardieu as Mangin a rough nononsense police detective that during the process of trying to bust a Tunisian drug ring falls for a mysterious alluring woman Sophie Marceau whose linked heavily with the gang. Maurice Pialat directs this film with his usual stoic motifs and just like The Mouth Agape it works for this film. The tone is excellent thanks to the use of classic noir elements. The main issue I had with the film is that that it wasn't concise about what it wanted to achieve whether that's to be a straight police procedural or a character piecelove story in the end it becomes a melting pot of different ideas.Another problem I had with this film was it came across too passive there was no punch to the story everything just happens with low energy. The pacing left alot to be desired most of Pialat's work is finely paced but in a film like this which is more focused on plot it needed to be a bit quicker. There were large portions of the film where I found myself becoming disinterested in what was happening on screen.This is the weakest film I've seen from Pialat so far. What saves the film from being flatout boring is Grard Depardieu's excellent performance. He carries the film by being constantly interesting and engaging. He's also a fantastic conduit for other performers as his energetic screen presence bounces off all the actors in the film. Most notably is his terrific chemistry with Sophie Marceau together they really keep the film alive when it starts to become contrived and uninteresting.This is the weakest film I've seen from Mubi's retrospective look at Pialat's filmography which is disappointing because I've enjoyed the majority of his films. In summery Police is a missed opportunity it's an average crime drama that's boosted by two strong central performances. Police is the last film from Pialat's mostly stellar filmography that I would recommend.".

This was a life that wasn't a waste because Selena knew hot to live life.But the best thing about 'Selena' is Jennifer Lopez. Those were the days when Lopez acted her heart out on screen as has also been apparent in 'Out of Sight' and 'Blood and Wine'. Not only that but Lopez looks stunning. Many prefer the way she looks today but in 'Selena' there's an innocence and honesty about her beauty and this coupled with her natural and spirited performance is a delight to watch. The supporting cast that includes Edward James Olmos Jon Seda and Constance Marie are all very good too.I loved the way the soundtrack was used in the film and it brings a lot of energy to the story. The cinematography is quite good but I did not like the 3 split screen.Even though we know the tragic fate of Selena this film reminds us that it's more important to live a big life than a long life. Make full use of what you have and take your chance. That's what Selena did. She was loved by her friends and family and won the hearts of millions. Strongly recommended.".

The movie is a celebration of her life rather than fixating on her death as one would expect with her family so involved controlling with the film. This approach also just felt right. I'm sure that Hollywood if it had had its way would have sensationalized this aspect to the max. I don't know how much of the film is factual and how much is apocryphal. A local reviewer wrote that a true biography of Selena would have to wait a few years and be done without a Quintanilla looking over both shoulders.All I can do is rave about Jennifer Lopez. Her beauty her talent her sheer magnetism flows right out of the screen. She was amazing. Since her biography subject died so young she was able to avoid the problems inherent in the genre of trying to age the actress to match the aging of the subject. Constance Marie who I'm not familiar with was quite good as Selena's mother although she did have to deal with the question of appearing to age 15 years. Every cast member seemed right for their part and everyone did very well. The film seemed welldirected in that I never thought about the director at any time during the film.Overall the movie was very sweet with obvious tragic overtones. Highly recommended.".

Selena had even won a prestigious Grammy award for Best MexicanAmerican Singer and was the most popular Latin singer at that time. Until all that was taken away from her when at the age of 23 in 1995 Selena's 'friend' and fan club manager Yolanda Saldivar murdered her after Selena had confronted Yolanda about money she had stolen.I'm one of the many people out there who only heard about Selena in the last couple of years. I can't remember where I first heard of her. The internet maybe but the things I did hear were all good and she sounded like a very talented and popular young singer and of course I was really shocked to hear about how she died. I was really interested to watch the movie Selena and when I finally got to watch it I thought it was really great. It tells you the whole story of Selena's life from when she was just a young girl to her meeting guitarist Chis Perez and secretly getting married to him  we see her singing at soldout concerts all the wonderful fans she had and not only that but we find out that Selena was planning to have kids and she was just about to release her first English language album all until she was she was terribly murdered. I thought the end of the movie where there was real footage of the real Selena was beautifully done and it was great to see clips of the real Selena singing at her concerts meeting her fans and just having fun with her family friends and husband.I thought the whole cast in the movie were great Jennifer Lopez played Selena really well and deserved any award she received or got nominated for. The rest of the cast including Edward James Olmos who played Selena's father and Jon Seda who played Selena's husband Chris Perez did really well too.After watching the movie and hearing Selena Jennifer Lopez was lipsynching to Selena's voice.

The screenplay is a little sappy but fine overall. Director Gregory Nava is always focused and this keeps the film interesting throughout.  A fine film all the way.  4 stars out of 5.";

She hits all the right chords as a teenager a woman in love a dutiful daughter and sister and a singer adored by legions of fans. And she loved everyone of them right back. The actors playing her family are all great too especially her father. Ms. Lopez also has a sweet natural chemistry with Jon Seda as Chris. Their relationship is so real because they were friends first...friends who fell in love.Ms. Lopez also does a great job lipsynching Selena's songs and the ending will bring tears to your eyes.

	schema:reviewBody "IMDb's 1000 words max. limit seemed quite generous until I was faced with reviewing this one. For how could a mere thousand words adequately express the thoughts and feelings generated by sitting through two hours of watching a Lennon or McCartney a Dion or a Jackson gradually taking hold of her Godgiven talents and rising to superstardom only to have it cut short by what must be one of the most vile acts of murder the planet has ever witnessed. What if the first few hit singles or the first couple of albums of ABBA were all we ever got to hear because Agnetha or Frida was murdered at that point? It even goes so far as to make you wonder about the Beatles even Bach Mozart or Beethoven.I admit I was a bit nervous when I rented the movie because I was worried that a substandard job may have been done to capture the short life of this young woman. Her music was really just the outcome of her virtuous self and the incredible qualities of courage a genuine love for humanity and a deepseated patience that she obviously clung to. For as the film points out a MexicanAmerican singer is not easily accepted by Americans nor by the Mexicans. Selena also had to work at brining about unity among her family such as with her father's acceptance of her marriage. Needless to say the film did not disappoint me in the least for it portrayed this truth with class.Fortunately the film did not sugarcoat the characters as many biographical movies do  it confidently revealed the mistakes and some undesirable traits in the people it portrayed. In fact the characters were so real I forgot several times that I was watching a movie and thought I was sitting with these people laughing with them and sharing in their joy and in their pain. Jennifer Lopez was absolutely outstanding. There was so much depth richness and naturalness in her acting.I recognise also that it must have been very difficult for the actress who played Yolanda manager of Selena's fan club and her murderer. To play the villain in order to help raise awareness of the life of a fabulous soul would be very difficult indeed.The beautiful candlelight vigils shown at the end of the film made me regret very much having not lived in Texas and been part of them at the time. I especially appreciated the fact that the film did not make Selena's death its focal point. It was much more of a celebration of the contribution she made in brining joy to the hearts of an unhappy world. This was its focus even though Selena's death gave me a very sharp sting and made me cry. It is so sad but it cheers me that this film was made and that such a superb job was done on it. Thank you to all who worked on making this excellent film. 10 out of 10.".

I had hoped however to learn more. Since Selena's music and career interested me little before this film I could not judge her story as to its accuracy and assumed that the different scenes  Abraham Quintanilla's rallying and pushing his young children to rehearse the group's playing for both enthusiastic and disillusioned audiences  occurred in reality much as I observed them. I did not in other words have a basis on which to doubt the story's veracity.I also had little reason to degrade the performances. Edward Olmos Jr. did his usual dynamic work this time as Selena's protective and volatile father and Jennifer Lopez did a credible job making me feel as if I were watching Selena not JLo. For the most part in fact each cast member spoke hisher lines naturally.What the filmmakers presented how the characters behaved and how they spoke then concerned me less than what they had to say. Hearing another aspiring musician or singer talk about achieving her dreams assert her desire to marry because I love him and he loves me describe the details of the quaint country home she envisions for herself once she has had enough of concerts and tours enjoy a rare exclusive conversation with her father in which he tells her you have always been my little girl made me cringe. After so many other similar stories about entertainers such as La Bamba The Buddy Holly Story and Sweet Dreams Selena often seemed formulaic.

	schema:reviewBody "Back in 1993 or thereabouts I was watching Univision one weekend night for variety and to learn some Spanish and they were airing a special a live Selena concert. I remember thinking how beautiful and talented she was but also how BIG. Madonna had nothing on her level of popularity which seemed almost to exceed it. Barely twenty years old Selena's meteoric rise seemed inevitable. I had become a fan of hers after watching the Univision concert and knew of her name and her work but never thought that it would be the last time I would ever see her. Only James Dean's premature death in 1956 rivals this tragedy for the loss of talent at such a young age. It is scary to think of what Selena would have become had she simply not been killed.The movie focuses on Selena's rise to fame as a crossover Tejano music star more popular south of the border than in the United States but becoming famous in both lands nonetheless. Other than Selena Jennifer Lopez the movie centers around her family her husband Chris Perez a very competent Jon Seda and her strongbutloving father Abraham Edward James Olmos in what is easily the best performance of his career.Lopez checked her attitude at the door for this film and plays Selena with reverence. Her resemblance to Selena and singing ability made her perfect for this role and Olmos made an excellent secondfiddle. The scenes between father and daughter transcended fame and showed the normalcy of Quintanilla family life as the backdrop for the spiraling fame that threw them into chaos such as when Selena had planned to tell her father about her sudden marriage but the radio had beaten her to it.As we all know Selena was tragically murdered by her fan club president a woman I will not name so as not to give her any more fame I urge others to do this as well. How someone with such a precious access to a precious individual could snuff out a life so young so talented and destined to be one of our greatest superstars is beyond comprehension. This crime was senseless even among other senseless crimes.This is a loss that in some ways has still never been recovered from. Women like Selena come around once in a lifetime and she was it for us. Sadly.My heart goes out to her family for having to endure such a horrifying experience.".

	schema:reviewBody "SELENA 1997 12Starring Jennifer Lopez Edward James Olmos Jon Seda Constance Marie and Jacob Vargas Written and directed by Gregory Nava   127 minutes    Rated PG for mild language and sensuality By Blake FrenchI am not a fan of Selena Quintanilla and I still loved Gregory Nava's Selena. It was a respectable movie on its own level the film would have worked even if there never was a professional celebrity singer of the same name. It's filled with inspiring style and lovely glamour. This is one of the better biography movies to come down the road in some time.The film stars the talented Jennifer Lopez as the famous singer in the title roll. The development of her character is what makes the production so effective. In biographies we need as much information as possible about the person in focus as possible and Selena starts at her childhood. She is one of the many in the Quintanilla family the father Abraham the mother Marcela and the siblings Abie  Suzette and of course Selena. Abraham involves the kids with music very early in their lives. After hearing his daughter's voice talents how could he resist. Some days the kids did not want to practice their instruments and music abilities but discipline is what makes things work.The film begins an emotional journey into the life of the Quintanilla's. Abraham's long awaited dream of opening his independent Spanish restaurant has come true. His children are the entertainment. Although much to his wife's dismay he soon quits his current occupation to manage his new restaurant full time. Again a big success for the first few months anyway. Before long however the restaurant is bankrupt and his family is forced to close it downleaving them no where to go except to sell their happy little house and buy a motor home for the family to live in.Selena's father becomes the antagonistbeing forceful controlling and difficult. He is the one who objects to the family's ideas. Abraham is the man who will never allow his daughter to get married. He is the person who cares so much about his family that sometimes he thinks that they can't do anything right. The development of the Quintanilla family is perfect. Selena although the centerpiece of the plot is jumbled in the family atmosphere with little significance above the rest of the members in her household. This concept makes the biography believable and heartfelt. The only problem I had with these folks is the old reused idea of having the strict father as the villain for most of the movie. We have seen this concept so many times before and while it does as always add some tension in the story line the film never gets anywhere with the theme and throughout the picture Abraham has varied in character moodlacking consistency.Jennifer Lopez is so much better playing a character like Selena Quintanilla than some of the varied characters she has been in the past. In particular the dreadful UTurn and Anaconda characters did not fit her personality in the least. Selena is the character who she was born to star as and what a wonderful inspiring job she does. I cared about these characters and if not for the performances it may have been another story. The movie offers a touching romantic subplotthat also happens to be bullheaded and stubborn. The audience doesn't mind this flawed story however simply because it is propelled by the performances and enchanting romantic chemistry. There are lots of emotions flying around in the film but even that doesn't hold it back from becoming a clear accuratelooking piece of work.Selena is a  biography worth seeing and then some. Featured are adorable characters exquisite performances a believable and historical plot line and a lot of irresistible idyllic chemistry. However at the same time suffers from too many emotional distractions and conventional clichs. The film could have been better...but it didn't necessarily need at be.Brought to you by Warner Bros.".

I really like how the movie incorporated her childhood and how her music business started because it is an important key part of her life. In the movie they also incorporated the use of the real Selena's voice when they show her making her music and in her concertsI thought that was a brilliant idea. Since I have seen the movie Selena I now enjoy listening to Selena's Tejano music. Overall the movie is very well put together and shows the most significant parts of her life to show her success.

	schema:reviewBody "...and for those who have not yet discovered the talent of Selena the young Tejano singer whose life and career were cut drastically short.I was one of many people who remembered Selena in 1995 unfortunately I did not know of her until she was murdered. I remembered going to see the film in the theater which is an experience to remember. This was the film that made Jennifer Lopez a star. I am not a fan of JLo but this is the only film of hers that I felt she did a decent acting job in. This is a wellintentioned sentimental film that the Quintanilla family released to show the world what a charismatic and talented singer Selena was.The movie has funny scenes like when Selena and her band's bus Big Bertha gets stuck in the middle of the desert and two cholos in a Low Rider stop by to help pull them out of the ditch but unfortunately they take the bumper right off the bus! This bumper's goin' on the wall of my garage carnal!. The scene where Selena and her friend are snubbed by the snotty saleslady at the upscale boutique at the mall is remiscent of Pretty Woman  a great scene  one of the best in the whole movie. It also has sad scenes that will make you cry. Of course they took creative license with a few scenes in the movie but the whole essence of the film is captured very well. And of course the soundtrack is full of Selena's wonderful songs.Selena is in a long line of stars whose lives were devastated by tragedy Janis Joplin James Dean Jimi Hendrix Elvis Jim Morrison Karen Carpenter Marilyn etc. Selena was the last person I have seen with that kind of unique charisma and talent a real star someone who had paid her dues playing gigs on the road with her family when she was very young. If she had lived she would have been very famous. Another theme in this movie is about the American Dream if you work hard and don't quit you will make your dreams into reality.It's a movie mainly for Selena fans and not for cynics. I have read many reviews about cornball cheese awful acting and script and so forth and yes some people are going to hate it but go ahead and give it a try. It might surprise you.P.S. Before the movie came out a casting call was made all over the country for unknowns to try out for the role of Selena. When I was 15 I was one of those who had auditioned. Unfortunately it was a publicity campaign for the movie since they had already cast Jennifer Lopez shortly after.".

It also has sad scenes that will make you cry. Of course they took creative license with a few scenes in the movie but the whole essence of the film is captured very well. And of course the soundtrack is full of Selena's wonderful songs.Selena is in a long line of stars whose lives were devastated by tragedy Janis Joplin James Dean Jimi Hendrix Elvis Jim Morrison Karen Carpenter Marilyn etc. Selena was the last person I have seen with that kind of unique charisma and talent a real star someone who had paid her dues playing gigs on the road with her family when she was very young. If she had lived she would have been very famous. Another theme in this movie is about the American Dream if you work hard and don't quit you will make your dreams into reality.It's a movie mainly for Selena fans and not for cynics. I have read many reviews about cornball cheese awful acting and script and so forth and yes some people are going to hate it but go ahead and give it a try. It might surprise you.P.S. Before the movie came out a casting call was made all over the country for unknowns to try out for the role of Selena. When I was 15 I was one of those who had auditioned. Unfortunately it was a publicity campaign for the movie since they had already cast Jennifer Lopez shortly after.";

There is a feeling of great sadness to what might have become of Selena. This film is a great tribute to somebody who died too young. Her father played by Edward James Olmos is superb. Lupe who plays Yolanda is also excellent. Constance Marie who plays Selena's mother is actually wonderful. I thought it was Olmos' real life wife Lorraine Bracco. They look so similar. Jackie Guerra is wonderful too as her sister. I wished that Hollywood would look at the fact that this is a Texas' story. Selena was a Texas girl who also happened to be Spanish American. She loved and treated her fans with respect. My favorite scene is at the Los Angeles mall the snobby salesperson almost refuses to try a dress It's 800.00. Rather than make a fuss Selena acts very classy about it. Then one Mexican sees her and the word spreads like a California wildfire around the mall the store is mobbed with shoppers and store workers. The snobby saleswoman can't believe her eyes. Who's Selena? she asked. She's surprised to know that the Spanish customer is a huge star in Mexico but not in Los Angeles. She's overcome with embarrassment. After all Selena is only in Los Angeles for the Grammys.".

Tura Santana's need to use a silencer in a gun fight it's a revolver which can't be silenced anyway and the silencer is hardly real more like a mashed dixie cup painted silver. Poor Rafael Campos actually doing decent acting making the other players even more wooden. And who leaves a scimitar lying around in a lab? Handy yes if you need to lop off someone's head which as I recall from my own lab experience is rather rare. But why ask questions about the incongruous? AstroZombi cannot answer them.

Its title may suggest that this film contains an onslaught of Romeroesque zombies from space of course that would've been a whole lot cooler than the few AstroZombies we see in this film but they still delighted me. I found this film to have a preety cool premise zombie like quasimen who can be controlled and programmed even though it contained all the stereotypical characters a film like this needs. Of course that didn't bother me in the slightest. Neither did the pacing I didn't find this film to bore me at all. Teenage Zombies would be a film with incredibly bad pacing. That is a boring movie. You need to keep in mind that Astro Zombies is a cheesy zombie movie from 1969 its not Oscar material. So you all need to quit your whining and just accept that there is much worse out there.

There is some fun to be found elsewhere in the film as Carradine's berserk astrozombies wreak havoc throughout the city there's even some gore and partial nudity the very comely blonde chick who does a topless dance routine covered in wacky multicolored body paint.

Joan Patrick is the shining star in the detective story as a young nurse used as bait for a zombie seems the brain of a criminal she operated on is inside of it. After that fails she goes home and is attacked by one while her cop boyfriend is outside. The cop puts up a fight with the thing and luckily for him since he was getting beat pretty bad the zombie runs out of energy in its cell battery on its forehead so it grabs the nearest flashlight turns it on smacks it onto the battery and runs back to the lab! The scientist plot is saved by the presence of a scantilydressed young captive who is gawked at and pawed upon by Carradine's assistant Franchot. Carradine just rambles on and on about science and zombies and such to his mute assistant who couldn't care less! All Franchot wants to do is experiment on the captive! The spy story is Tura Satana's story and I could watch her forever! An extremely sexy woman just like in FASTER PUSSYCAT! KILL! KILL! she is pure evil. She holds men hostage and burns cigarette butts into their faces shoots cops gleefully even after they're dead and obviously wants to take over the world!Now that I think about I guess I can see why people might want to watch this. For the sheer silliness of it all. But there are many boring parts including a hypnotic nude dance in a club by a woman painted head to toe in psychedelic colors! Proceed with caution!".

This was one of my most painful film experiences that is seeing AstroZombies.  Now don't get me wrong.  I didn't have lofty expectations before viewing this film.  When John Carradine is the big marquee name one is better off not to expect too much.  I did expect a bad film in that itssobadits goodfuntowatch vein.  Brother!  Was this film a disappointment!  This film is just out and out boring and boringly bad.  The story is somewhat complicated and confusing but basically deals with a Doctor De Marco creating astrozombies for the benefit of mankind that have turned out to be killers because he can only get the minds of killers. Throw in some GMen hot on his trailnaturally always AFTER someone is killed and a trio of foreign spiesagents out to get this incredible secret for their own country and you have the basic plot structure of AstroZombies!  The film is poor on so many levels.  The explanation of the plot portends much of the disaster.  Director Ted V. Mikels has little directorial ability and money for this production.  Cheap is an understatement in describing the budget this film had.  Doctor De Marco's lab was filled with very nonscientific equipment including gasoline plastic containers with squares cut in them.  John Carradine gives perhaps one of his worst performancesand believe me it is no small feat to label this performance as such even making his Wizard in The Wizard of Mars1964 seem like he's playing Hamlet!  He has no charisma at all and utters one line of scientific mumbo jumbo after another lines like circuit fusion and semicyrogenic state.  Throw in his mute hunchbacked assistant Franchot with a fetish for bikiniclad girls tied to laboratory tables and you have an amazing pair to watch!  But wait!  You also get the Astrozombies themselves which are little more than men with what looks like tinfoil on their heads.  The rest of the acting must have gone to the Herschell Gordon Lewis School of Poor Performance as none of them have any ability.  The one lone bright performing spotlight falls on Tura Satana of Russ Meyer film fame.  She is not a good actress but make no mistake she can attract your attention with her beautiful body and bust.  Her biggest talents jut out from armpit to armpit.  A truly bad film in every fiber of its being.  I had trouble watching the film in installments!".

There are so many just senseless or stretched scenes and but the powerful soundtrack hahahaha keeps you awake. The outer appearance of the Astro Zombies is also remarkable since I nearly never was so frightened to die from a laughing riot. Definitely Astro Zombies belongs in the category sooo bad that it is a great fun to watch. Even I would consider Astro Zombies for one of my worst movies favorites. So now I really cannot await to get the sequel and dig deeper into the realm of trash. Thanx Mr. Mikels for such a great laughing moment. So if you like trash  GO FOR THIS ONE!!!".

Definitely Astro Zombies belongs in the category sooo bad that it is a great fun to watch. Even I would consider Astro Zombies for one of my worst movies favorites. So now I really cannot await to get the sequel and dig deeper into the realm of trash. Thanx Mr. Mikels for such a great laughing moment. So if you like trash  GO FOR THIS ONE!!!";

In THE DOLL SQUAD he had the good sense of making an action film starring allwomen leads years before Charlie's Angels. It all started with this film. An auspicious beginning for a directing career that started as a cameraman on A.C. Stephens films.So let me get to ASTROZOMBIES. Carradine plays your typical mad scientist complete with a bodystealing hunchback assistant and a secret laboratory. Carradine spits out silly monologues enclessly explaining why his race of zombies should increase to an army.Meanwhile Tura Santana is going around as a Dragon Lady burning cigarette holes in people and killing them all the time smiling wide. Tura had alot of fun here and she is the film's shining grace.Everything else sucks. Have you ever seen BRIDE OF THE MONSTER by the great director Ed Wood? Well it seems as if Mikels had seen it a few times. Either that or Mikels and Wood are just working within the same idiom reworking horor cliches for a quick buck.But I want to make this clear I think that some of Mikels' films are fascinating mainly because he almost never takes himself seriously. This is one of the unwritten rules to a good drivein film because it's one thing to laugh at a film but its another to know that the director knows how silly it all is as much as you do.Alas there is no such irony in ASTROZOMBIES. Whatever little invention the film had started with probably sank along with the obviously bargain basement production budget. Still if the said viewer is in the mood to point and laugh at a movie this is fun viewing. All others beware THIS FILM IS BAD.".

	schema:reviewBody "As I watched this film I couldn't help but think that leading man Wendell Corey looked intoxicated throughout the movieacting listless and somewhat slurred in speech. So I did a search on the net and read up on Corey's lifediscovering that the same year he made this film he also died from cirrhosis of the liver as a result of alcoholism. What a sad end to what had been a good career. Corey had been mostly a supporting actor in the late 40s and into the 50ssteady and effective in his films. Here though he was blundering through his lines in a gradez scifi yarn. Oddly despite getting top billing he's not in the film that muchperhaps he died before it was completed.John Carradine is also in the film but that isn't nearly as sad as Corey as Carradine made a career out of appearing in bad films so this seems to be right up his alley! It is truly an awful filmwith practically no budget ketchup for blood and acting that seems amateur at best. You know it's a bad film when Carradine is probably the BEST actor among them.Here is the plot American scientists have been working on creating astrozombies. In essence robots that follow mental commands over great distancesso that humans on Earth can control these droids in space. The problem is a mad scientist Carradine has gone missing and many mutilated bodies begin appearing. Could it be Carradine or the Commies or both?! One of the few strengths about the film is the head baddie. This woman should probably have gotten a fashion makeover but I still loved her styleno debatingjust shooting people. And when she shoots them she shoots them again and againpumping bullets into the lifeless bodies just to be 100 sure they are dead. For once we seem to have an intelligent villaintoo bad she's starring in such an unintelligent film!! And too bad that she conveniently forgets to do this at the very endwhen she SHOULD have unloaded a full clip into her victim! The biggest deficit and there are many is that the film is so dull. Cheap does not mean that it must be dull. Even bad films such as PLAN 9 or TEENAGERS FROM OUTER SPACE are fun to watch because of their ineptness and because they try so hard to be entertaining. This one sadly isn't bad enough to be good for a laugh. Not surprisingly the film is from Ted Mikelsone of the best bad film makers that ever lived. Clearly he was the rival of the likes of Larry Buchanan Ed Wood and Al Adamson. If you don't believe me understand that The AstroZombies is among his BEST films!!".

	schema:reviewBody "The plot of The AstroZombies is so convoluted that I'm not sure I can sum it up in just a few short sentences  but I'll give it a try. It seems that a series of gristly murders is being blamed on a Dr. DeMarco John Carradine. Until recently Dr. DeMarco worked for the government on a top secret project where he was attempting to develop a synthetic man. The synthetic or astroman was thought to be ideal for long range space flight. The CIA theorizes that Dr. DeMarco has succeeded in creating an astroman and that it may be responsible for the murders. In addition a group of spies headed by a woman named Satana Tura Satana is also looking for Dr. DeMarco. They represent a foreign party interested in Dr. DeMarco's discoveries.You know I could sit here and go through a litany of weaknesses found in The AstroZombies. But I'll be honest that's too easy and ultimately too time consuming. It's like shooting fish in a barrel. So I'll stick to the biggest problem I had with The AstroZombies and that's how deadly dull much of the movie is. There are great big chunks of the movie where nothing happens. I don't mean it's just slow  I mean there's absolutely nothing going on. For example there are a series of scenes with Dr. DeMarco preparing his lab for an experiment that seem to go on FOREVER! Vials are filled switches are thrown microscopes are peered through and on and on it goes. No dialogue  just mundane routine scenes of people trying to look busy. I swear that at one point it looked like Carradine was working on a thermostat. And who wouldn't want to see John Carradine do a little home repair project? But as bad as The AstroZombies is the movie's not a total loss. There's enough bizarreness here that someone with a little talent might have gotten something interesting out of it. I'll go so far to argue that a good editor might be able to shave a halfhour off the thing and come up with an interesting surreal movie. The ingredients are here  CIA operatives John Carradine mutant creatures a secret lab Tura Satana who's pretty surreal in her own right a hunchbacked lab assistant violent attack scenes an unknown woman in a bikini strapped to a table and enough scientific hokum for two movies. But until someone takes the time to put this movie together the best I can give The AstroZombies is a 310.".

But don't expect a party moovie  MST3K fans beware put this flaccid flick on  you'll clear the room guaranteed!  8P The MooCow warns against anyone but schlock film professionals from cowming anywhere near this Mikels muddle.  Just to prove to you that there is no god or that there's no accownting for taste AstroZombies reputedly made over 3 million dollars.  Go figure. 8P";

I screened it at the AOF Festival in Pasadena 2009 and not only did Jesse Johnson do a great job making a film about a terrifically flawed but outstanding character he did it in a way that kept the tension excitement and power of the film moving moving moving. Raymond Barry was fascinating to watch as was the rest of the stellar cast from Keith David to James Russo Tom Berenger and one of my favorites Steven Bauer. The cast alone is worth the price of admission and if you get the chance to see Maxine Bahns in Conjurer don't pass it up she is great. The story follows Charlie on the lamb and in a seemingly desperate attempt to bond with his son in the process a son who desperately wants to be like his father or so he thinks. No spoiler here but what happens is fun to watch and a pleasure to see. I know the director and stars usually get all the credit but in this case someone needs to give a little love to the producers who took a chance and gave me one of my best viewing experiences of 2009. Great job guys!".

This little known cinematographic gem harvested the festival Best picture Best action Picture Best Cinematography and the Best Musical Score. Quite a feat for the team led by the talented screen writer and director Jesse Johnson who managed in only 18 days of filming and with a budget that is considered petty cash in Hollywood to come up with an action drama movie that isn't only well acted captivating and entertaining for the action movie fans but also adds a very human dimension to the classic gangster movie of the old days. Think of the main character Charlie Valentine as an aged Scarface who's ruthlessness and killing instincts are fading away with age and with the realization that in life there are other more important things than money power and sex. The characters are well rounded and played wonderfully by the main characters Raymond J. Barry Training Day and Michael Weatherly Gun Shy. The cinematography is top notch  a special mention for the great camera work and image quality. And most importantly it certainly looks like Jesse Johnson the screen writer and director of Charlie Valentine who did an excellent job putting this story on screen is becoming the new flag bearer of the British Invasion in American cinema.

Of course everything goes wrong and Charlie tracks down his estranged son Michael Weatherly for safety.

Weatherly shows his talent and holds his own with Barry. James Russo and Steven Bauer make up the badguys here and turn in some great performances. Tom Berenger and Keith David aren't in this for more than five minutes each but it's nice for them to throw their names into some smaller work.Worth a look if you like the genre or the actors.

The dialog is so bad that if you made a drinking game out of each main characters name not a single participant would be living. The unlucky sob who got Charlie could be swilling nonalcoholic and still get alcohol poisoning. Nearly every line of interpersonal dialog begins with the other characters name.This would of been a bad movie in the 80's.

The only reason I felt it necessary to warn people is that the review that pops up on the movies main page was apparently written by the producers PR firm. Mentioning American Gangster as being comparable to this film was just flat out lying to the people who actually use these reviews to help them make a decision as to where to spend their hard earned money. Avoid this movie at all costs. This comes from someone who typically enjoys bad movies. It take a lot for me to recommend someone away from a movie. Often times I feel people should check something out if they're interested. This movie changed my beliefs as far as that methodology goes.

	schema:reviewBody "Normally gangster movies are not my genre of movie to sit down and watch. Not to say I don't like them I just haven't watched a lot of them because there are plenty of other movie genres I'd rather watch first. But Charlie Valentine is a stand out film that I really liked. You might be wondering why it only ranked an 8 but in all honesty I was waffling on giving it a 10 but I try to save those for my favorite films. That being said Charlie Valentine is a movie I could definitely sit through again. The trailer is what hooked me instantly making me belt out I have got to at least see this film. The story is a simple one with Charlie Valentine as an aging gangster who fouls up a heist in a big way getting his whole crew killed. He takes off to hide with his estranged son who doesn't know what's going on. His son is a bit of a gangster himself but not the caliber that Charlie is. From there the story develops into a kind of violent father and son flick when the son asks Charlie to teach him everything he knows. The sequence in the trailer that made me burst out laughing and want this movie had Charlie's son being attacked by a man so Charlie calmly shoots the man. The son starts to flip out and Charlie very flippantly responds What? Did you want to chit chat? It was an unexpected laugh for me in the trailer. I wish the movie had more laughs than that but it definitely had me and a friend intrigued where we couldn't stop watching it. We started to watch it at 3 a.m. figuring we'd get tired of it enough to pause for another day but the story was engaging enough to keep us going all the way through the end.The tagline for the movie also had me hooked and wanting to see where the story went. A simple tagline it read Charlie Valentine was a gangster a gunfighter a womanizer and a pretty fine chef He was also the most dangerous irresponsible scoundrel you ever met. What's interesting is how the movie plays out the way Charlie is a violent but loving man and has two different personalities for his roles in life after he reunites with his son. Charlie carries an old fashioned razor blade in a leg holster and uses it to kill in the film. But that violent weapon is turned on its ear in the movie with Charlie using it to gently shave his adult son in one scene showing a tender care that he is not used to and how he misses it. The movie also shows Charlie's past and how he misses a life he knew he could never be allowed to have. The cast is top notch with character actor Raymond J. Barry who has more than 80 credits to his name in movies and TV episodes according to the Internet Movie Database playing the title role of Charlie Valentine. Michael Weatherly who has appeared in more than 150 episodes of the popular TV series Navy NCIS Naval Criminal Investigative Service plays Charlie's son Danny Valentine. A violent but fun film the movie has some great moments of moral ambiguity and the challenges of Charlie Valentine being a father and a man on the run. This is one of those rare films that I don't want to tell readers anymore than I have because of ruining the fun of the film.Regardless I highly recommend it. Even if you don't like gangster movies.".

What's interesting is how the movie plays out the way Charlie is a violent but loving man and has two different personalities for his roles in life after he reunites with his son. Charlie carries an old fashioned razor blade in a leg holster and uses it to kill in the film. But that violent weapon is turned on its ear in the movie with Charlie using it to gently shave his adult son in one scene showing a tender care that he is not used to and how he misses it. The movie also shows Charlie's past and how he misses a life he knew he could never be allowed to have. The cast is top notch with character actor Raymond J. Barry who has more than 80 credits to his name in movies and TV episodes according to the Internet Movie Database playing the title role of Charlie Valentine. Michael Weatherly who has appeared in more than 150 episodes of the popular TV series Navy NCIS Naval Criminal Investigative Service plays Charlie's son Danny Valentine. A violent but fun film the movie has some great moments of moral ambiguity and the challenges of Charlie Valentine being a father and a man on the run. This is one of those rare films that I don't want to tell readers anymore than I have because of ruining the fun of the film.Regardless I highly recommend it. Even if you don't like gangster movies.";

	schema:reviewBody "Rosalind Russell seemed to play a bazillion roles over the years in which she played highpowered yet rather sexless ladies. So when you see her in What a Woman! playing exactly this sort of character once again you have a strong sense of dj vu. This means if you are an old movie fan like me this film seemed rather clichd because this topic has been done too often...and done better.The film begins with Rosalind playing an executive at a major publishing house. She has a very successful author working for her and there is talk of making a movie of the man's bookyet no one has seen him or knows anything about him. So Rosalind is determined to track down this guywho turns out oddly to be nothing like you'd expect. While the book is apparently some sort of romance he's a bookish and rather asexual professor Willard Parker. Inexplicably Rosalind has the crazy idea of bringing Parker back to New York and molding him into the character from his book so he can play him in an upcoming movie. Why? This is never explained.Parker turns out to be pretty awful but still Russell pushes him....again I asked 'why?'. But when she kisses him and coaches him he suddenly turns into a lovesick puppy. He very very ardently pursues her and she shows as much interest as a person looking forward to a root canaland it's obvious to everyone except Parker.At the same time a reporter Brian Aherne has been floating about throughout the movieas if he has no job or is on an extended vacation. It's obvious that he too is interested in Russell. This and the Parker romances make no sense as neither man has any reason to even like hershe is 100 asexual and about as alluring as boiled turnips. Yet you know by convention that by the end of the film she will become a 'real woman' and marry one of the two male leads.I'd say this film was in need of a massive rewrite. Although it starts off promisingly even though it has a lot of familiar elements midway through the film it totally loses direction. The characters begin acting inexplicably and you wonder if ANYONE could behave this way. In movies yes...in real life absolutely never! In addition the characters don't do a whole lot other than act kookymostly because the writer has given them nothing more to do. And the ending comes out of no where!! A timepasser and nothing more.".

	schema:reviewBody "Irving Cummings a contract director best known for his long tenure at Twentieth Century Fox where he directed Shirley Temple and many musicals did this fastpaced wellstaged romantic comedy for Harry Cohn at Columbia. It's quite an achievement. Not only do the actors move as they deliver the dialogue but the camera directed by Capra's favorite DP Joe Walker moves as well. The performances from the smallest to largest are perfect. One wonders for example why Williard Parker who plays the innocent professor never went on to stardom. He's both handsome and believable as is Ahern. This film is an ideal example of the Hollywood studio system at its best. Rosalind Russell in a star turn is surrounded by a superb supporting cast and looks wonderful lit by Walker. Was this picture ahead of its time? Did it lose money?".

	schema:reviewBody "When I first saw this as a kid I was sort of let down because Mr.T's name and image were all over the ads and what I got was an ensemble piece instead with Adam Baldwin as the lead. My reaction was huh?.Watching it again 20 years later and knowing not to get too worked up over Mr. T c'mon he had his own cereal for crying out loud I felt completely different about this film. First of all I had to put myself back in 1983. Many popular comedies of the day were mostly crude sexist racist homophobic and would make a PC advocate shriek and hide under the bed. I bring this up because Joel Schumacher an openly gay director should've known better but since he cowrote it with someone else I don't know which jokes were his so I'll give him the benefit of the doubt. Porky's Doctor Detroit and Car Wash are just some examples of this kind of humor. Back to the movie As a kid I had no idea who they were but today it's kind of cool seeing a young Paul Rodriguez Patricia Duff yes THAT Duff...Ron Perelman's very rich ex Gary Busey Marsha Warfield Irene Cara and Bill Maher when he wasn't gray. Because of the ensemle nature of the movie some shine more than others. I don't even know why Maher is in this movie as he has very little to do. You may laugh at Mr. T's sermonizing in a very funny but great zoomout scene involving the Lincoln Memorial no lessbut it's refreshing to him delivering the same make something of yourself message today. It fits with the theme of the movie. Still this isn't for little kids because of the naked women and the nature of the humor. A few words on the very underrated Adam Baldwin. He was only 21 in 1983 yet he's the glue that holds this motley crew together. I liked his roles early in his career but I haven't seen him much after Full Metal Jacket which is a shame because he holds his own in that too. Working with Kubrick couldn't have been easy. Sure there are problems with this movie for example a romance between Baldwin and a waitress that doesn't really go anywhere and a thin kidnapping plot but nevertheless DC Cab is an entertaining feelgood time capsule. A refreshing escape from the meanspirited recycled or self contgratulatory comedies Hollywood wants us to pay 10.50 for today. If you think Joel Schumacher's movies are garbage today as I do check your prejudices at the door. This is way better than Batman  Robin. With DC Cab you'll have yourself a new guilty pleasure.".

Having seen Alex Cox' 'RepoMan' I was accustomed to the raw gritty nature of those films that you saw in that era. The film never has a dull moment and it's full of energypay attention to the scene where they try to rescue Albert from the kidnappers and when Adam Baldwin proves he's not chicken dung by refusing to surrend cab fare to a hood. Loud and Confusing the lack of rationality and reason pays off in D.C. Cab. A lot of noteworthy and in your face performances by The Barbarian Brothers Charles Barnett Max Gail and Marsha Warfield to name a few. Diversity works and this film proves it as we see so many walks of life and personality. There are a lot of good oneliners in this movie and they still stand the test of time...most are produced by the mouth of Gary BuseyHe had to be on coke during this he was off the wall bananas!D.C. Cab is a definite mustkeep for the DVDAficionado and for those who want to laugh feel nostalgic or just want to get lost check this out. In my opinion D.C. Cab is severely underrated and deserves plenty of accolades. I still chastise myself for not knowing it existed until I caught a preview on VH1's I love the 80s 3D. Oddly enough I wasn't optimistic when I began watching it but afterward I was entertained beyond expectation and I watched it again! Joel Schumacher should be proud of this movie as for the last 10 years most of his films turned out forgettable. A must see!810".

Cab is severely underrated and deserves plenty of accolades. I still chastise myself for not knowing it existed until I caught a preview on VH1's I love the 80s 3D. Oddly enough I wasn't optimistic when I began watching it but afterward I was entertained beyond expectation and I watched it again! Joel Schumacher should be proud of this movie as for the last 10 years most of his films turned out forgettable. A must see!810";

The lesser of the Baldwin brothers Adam stars as an ambitious young southerner who journeys to the Capital in hopes of breaking into the cab business. He's greeted by a memorable cast of zanies including future notables such as Mr. T Gary Busey and Bill Maher. It's not exactly Oscar calibre stuff but the plot takes interesting twists and turns as the film plows along at a brisk pace. True some of the humor is crude yet the movie has an undeniable cheesy charm. Directed by Joel Schumaker D.C. CAB is lots of fun but not necessarily lots of funny.".

It has an AWESOME cast....the main star of the movie is Adam Baldwin despite what the poster may say about Mr. T. He has a big role too don't worry It costars Max Gail Charlie Barnett Gary Busey Paul Rodriguez and Jill Schoelen. The movie has no plot. It is just fun watching all of these hilarious comedians and actors have fun with their roles and get into all the crazy tactics that they do. Gary Busey is awesome as Dell who utters some of the best oneliners in movie history in this movie. Mr T is great in the movie he has a pretty large role. Of course they do squeeze in a motivational speech about pride and all of that given by Mr T however it's Mr T so you gotta love it! The soundtrack consists of various soul funk disco  pop songs of 1983 that fit along perfectly with the movies tone. Irene Cara makes a cameo as herself in one short scene as well as performing the theme song for the movie entitled The Dream. This movie is packed with nonstop fun and laughs no doubt if you like comedies or you laugh easily you're going to love this one! It has always been one of my top favorites.910".

He only plays one of several misfits driving taxis throughout Washington DC. Naturally the movie's main selling point is Mr. T. In the end it comes across as one of those '80s movies that was a big excuse to be goofy. More than anything it shows a grittier side of our nation's capital and I don't mean the government!. I enjoyed it. The rest of the cast includes Adam Baldwin Gary Busey Whitman Mayo Grady on Sanford and Son and DeWayne Jessie Otis Day in Animal House. It's too bad that Joel Schumacher went on to direct the worst Batman movies.That was how Weird Al Yankovic described UHF.".

This movie is ridiculousstupid and crazy but it's actually not bad.Basically this is about a young Albert Hockenberry who wants to be in the DC Cab company business which is owned by his deceased father's old friend.The company is on the verge of getting shut down because of their competition with the Emerald Cab company. Albert tries to be part of the business but things doesn't go the way he expects.He deals with a stubborn Tyrone along with other cab drivers who lack motivation and are only in it for the money. The cab drivers get into a lot of difficult situations and hilarious mishaps. The plot makes sense overall the only confusing part was the kidnapping of Albert and the two rich kids.I thought it was pretty random. I admit it brought down the movie but the actors saved it by taking a ridiculous twist and make it look so much better on screen. I give it an 8 out of 10 because it cracked me up and kept my attention. I know a lot of people might disagree because this film is not for everyone. If you're not too picky about movie plots and just want a laugh you might like this as much as I do.".

	schema:headline " The first cut was better!";
	schema:reviewBody "I was previleged to screen this movie with theater owners and critics a couple of months before it was actually released in 1983.  I loved it!  It had great characters for that era.  Mr. T played his role very believably and really hammed up those classic Mr. T phrases Fool etc..  The support cast was also very good.  Lots of action comedy and a very satisfying happy ending. On the film's opening night I couldn't wait to see it again.I was very disappointed to find that for reasons unknown the original ending with Irene Cara had been ommitted.WARNING POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD!Note This next paragraph should be noted under Alternate Versions for IMDB.In the films original ending we get to see our heroes at the White House in the evening.  Irene Cara who had taken a ride Tyrone's cab early in the movie mentions in that scene that she will be singing at the White House and arranges for Tyrone and his friends to observe the concert from outside. Irene Cara could be seen superimposed through the window of the White House.  I think she was wearing a red dress.  I just remember she looked fantastic!  It sounds a little corny but the cab gang was all there and you had that feeling of everyone living happily ever after.What we see in the released cut of the movie is after the rescue of the children the scene jumps to a large parade down Pennsylvania Avenue in downtown Washington DC.  The parade seems to be in honor of the cabbies. You hear the Irene Cara song as the credits roll.  The End.Not bad but that feeling of satisfaction just wasn't as good.  Some others that had viewed it at that screening agreed.  The movie as a whole just didn't have the same feeling without that original ending.Incidently the White House ending was mentioned in the Washington Post movie review on the movie's opening day.  I guess they didn't tell the film critic about the changes.All in all DC Cab is a very entertaining movie and I can recommend it for those who just want to have a fun somewhat mindless comedy movie evening. My only other complaint is that they should have edited some of the language  the only thing keeping this from a PG rating.  This movie is very entertaining for children and suffers from all the profanity.  I give this 7 out of 10 stars  but would give 9 for the original cut.Maybe we will see it on DVD some day with the much needed original ending!".

The Foreign Department also assigns him an assistant during his stay Miss Andersson. Craig soon notices that Dr. Stratman is acting strangely.

	schema:reviewBody "Imitation in the film world is not always a bad thing. We can all think of movies that are eminently watchable despite owing an obvious debt to an earlier film or to the work of a particular director. Alfred Hitchcock is one director who has always attracted his fair share of imitators. Films such as Henry Hathaway's 'Niagara' J. Lee Thompson's 'Cape Fear' or Brian de Palma's 'Dressed to Kill' all owe an obvious debt to the master's work even down to the trademark blonde heroine but are nevertheless good films in their own right.All the above films were influenced by the darker side of Hitchcock's work the strongest influence on 'Dressed to Kill' for example seems to have been 'Psycho'. He did however have a lighter side often seen in his spy films which frequently blend suspense with humour. Examples are 'The Lady Vanishes' with its two eccentric cricketloving English gentlemen 'The ThirtyNine Steps' and most importantly for our purposes 'North by NorthWest'.'The Prize' clearly shows the influence of the lighter Hitchcock. The setting is the Nobel Prize ceremony in Stockholm and the central character is the winner of the prize for literature Andrew Craig an alcoholic American novelist suffering from writer's block. As numerous figures in the American literary establishment around this time did indeed have a drink problem it is interesting to speculate who might have been the model for the character. Craig discovers a Sovietblock plot to kidnap Dr Stratmann the Germanborn American winner of the physics prize and to replace him with a double who will use ceremony to announce his defection to East Germany. Like the Hitchcock films mentioned above the film mixes tension with humorous moments. The tension arises from Craig's attempts to thwart the kidnap plot and to convince the sceptical Swedish authorities of its existence. The humour mostly arises from the scenes featuring the other prizewinners. The French husbandandwife team who have shared the chemistry prize have done so despite the fact that they cannot stand each other. The husband has insisted on his mistress accompanying him under the guise of his 'secretary' while the wife enjoys flirting with Craig. The American and Italian cowinners of the prize for medicine constantly bicker about which of them has plagiarised the other's work. The peace prize winner does not appear to feature in the film although a pacifist is sorely needed to keep the peace among the others.Even the scenes featuring Craig are not always to be taken seriously. Although there are genuine moments of suspense such as the scene with the car on the bridge there are humorous moments as well. As other reviewers have pointed out the scene at the nudist convention owes much to the auction scene in 'North by NorthWest' also written by Ernest Lehman. The humour here arises from the contrast between the seeming absurdity of Craig's actions and their underlying serious purpose he is trying to attract the attention of the police because he is in danger from the villains.There are a number of effective performances especially from Paul Newman as Craig and Edward G. Robinson as both Dr Stratmann and his double. The result is a superior piece of entertainment not quite as good as Hitchcock at his best but better than most of his sixties movies except 'Psycho' and possibly 'Marnie'. It is certainly closer to authentic Hitchcock than his last two spy films 'Torn Curtain' and 'Topaz'. 810.".

	schema:reviewBody "Director Mark Robson tilts his hat to Hitchcock with this adaptation of an Irving Wallace novel. A slick lighthearted thriller of international intrigue with a dash of sex and humour thrown in The Prize is actually BETTER than some of the stuff Hitchcock was making around that time eg Torn Curtain and Topaz. No doubt part of the reason for the Hitchcockian similarities is due to the fact that this film was scripted by Ernest Lehmann who just a few years previously had written North By Northwest. Anyone who remembers North By Northwest will probably recollect the famous auction house scene and here in The Prize Lehmann has writtenin an almost identical scene in which the hero narrowly evades capture by creating a stir at a nudists' conference!American writer Andrew Craig Paul Newman is in Stockholm for the Nobel Prize Ceremony for which he has won the Literature award. Known for his boozy antics as well as his distinct lack of respect for those in authority Craig is assigned a personal assistant Inger Lisa Andersson Elke Sommer to keep him in check during his stay. Less wellknown is the fact that Craig has been suffering from writer's block for several years and has been writing cheap crime novels under a pseudonym in order to make ends meet. With his nose for a mystery he soon sniffs out some very curious goingson at the ceremony. He becomes increasingly convinced that the Physics Prize Winner Dr Max Stratman Edward G. Robinson has been kidnapped and replaced by a double. Since noone will believe him it is left to Craig and his pretty Swedish assistant to uncover the truth.The Prize actually starts quite slowly with an amount of time set aside for character introductions and plot exposition that impatient viewers might find excessive. However the buildup pays off brilliantly once the action gets underway and all the jigsaw pieces of the plot drop into place. Modern filmmakers seem to be of the opinion that the best approach is to hurl the audience straight into the action but The Prize proves conclusively that audiences get far more excitement and enjoyment when the plot and characters have been constructed with care and detail. In particular the relationship between the various Nobel prizewinners is an utter joy especially the husbandandwife chemistry winners who actually hate each other and the cowinners of the medical award who accuse each other of stealing their best ideas. There are a great variety of suspenseful and humorous moments in The Prize. Add to that the game performances excellent location work Jerry Goldsmith's good music score and the general sense of solid oldfashioned entertainment.... and you're looking at a Hitchcock pastiche par excellence.".

The first night Stratman who is accompanied by his niece Emily is kidnapped by Communist agents and his twin brother Emily's father takes his place.

Craig who had met the real Stratman becomes suspicious of the impersonator and starts his own private investigation. As a result he finds himself in the center of an intrigue and several attempts are made upon his life. NOTES Location scenes filmed in Stockholm.COMMENT Mediocre entertainment at best. Its many faults include a dated potboiler script about Russian spies on a kidnapping spree with E. Phillips Oppenheim impersonations. Whether to take the goingson seriously or not is a big question. At times the plot is obviously played for thrills on other occasions for laughs.A number of technical imperfections also cause viewer unease. These include blatant doubles in 2nd unit sequences glaringly obvious process screen effects and action spots that are amateurishly undercranked. The direction is undistinguished though reasonably fastpaced. Daniels' color cinematography is disappointingly ordinary throughout.That the film is better than the sum of its parts is due almost entirely to the cast. Newman plays sullenly if with an occasional mordant wit. In fact he starts off well but is let down by the script when his character as the scared pulpwriter who is being unwillingly drawn into the parallel world of his own creation  this time for real  is abandoned halfway through. Instead the character reverts to a standard heroic mold with acrobatics that include jumping on to the side of a highspeed truck to avoid knifewielding assassins and a spectacular dive off a Stockholm bridge. Unfortunately there are still inconsistencies. Robinson fares better with an ingenious role which for some reason tiredness he plays at only half strength relying for effect more on his heavy makeup than his native histrionic abilities. McCarthy as usual performs most capably in a minor subplot whilst Miss Presle is unattractively photographed in another. Diane Baker has a thankless if oddly appealing part which she plays with little zest.On the solidly credit side are the silkily attractive Elke Sommer Rudolph Anders as Bergh John Wengraf as the villain and Sacha Pitoeff as Daranyi his shivery henchman.".

As soon as the character of PAUL NEWMAN as Andrew Craig literature winner is introduced we're treated to another version of the sort of character Cary Grant played in NORTH BY NORTHWESTa man who suddenly finds himself in a situation where he becomes the target of assassins who want him out of the way because he knows too much.The similarities don't end there. There's a nudist convention that Newman has to barge into in order to escape two killers and he tries in vain to get them apprehended by the authorities. Sound familiar? There are people who refuse to believe his story of an attempted kill where he was thrown off a balcony and into the sea by a man trying to knife him to death. Another familiar moment occurs when he revisits a murder scene with the policebut the scene has been cleaned up and a woman denies that there was ever a dead body on the floor or that they owned a TV set which is missing as Newman claims.Furthermore every situation Newman is thrown into has its humorous side mostly because of some stinging oneliners he gets to bandy around at the bad guys like the waiter who only hours before is the one who threw him off the balcony. How are the crepe suzettes? Is there a body in there? Lehman keeps the yarn spinning along in dangerous territory but always with a good deal of humor in the words and actions of DIANE BAKER as a mysterious woman EDWARD G. ROBINSON in a pivotal role as a Nobel scientist replaced by a double KEVIN McCARTHY LEO G. CARROLL and others.Handsomely photographed in Widescreen and color it's no NORTH BY NORTHWEST as far as the suspense is concerned but it is almost as diverting despite some mighty farfetched escapes that only a writer as talented as Ernest Lehman could manage to make credible. Never read the Irving Wallace book but I'm sure the crisp dialog can be attributed to Lehman not Wallace since it sounds so much like NORTH BY NORTHWEST at certain moments.Nice jobs by PAUL NEWMAN and ELKE SUMMER as the foreign assistant assigned to be his aid during his stay in Stockholm and with whom of course he becomes romantically involved. Newman's breezy performance is full of cocky ease and he's clearly at home in this sort of caper.".

Paul Newman absolutely gorgeous and funnily enough he'll make a spy film with Hitchcock set in Sweden during the Nobels. Elke Sommer is like an imitation Hitchkcock ice blonde made in Germany. Diane Baker was the brunette in Hitchcock's Marnie and she's a real delight. Edward G Robinson of course always a pleasure but then Mr Robson casts Micheline Presle Micheline Presle from Devil And The Flesh and ignores her. She is framed as if Robson didn't know who she was. Another unforgivable bit of business Sergio Fantoni's Italian mamma. What was he thinking. All that aside. It's entertaining and Paul Newman can take me anywhere anytime.".

	schema:headline " Brilliant!!! One of Paul Newman's best roles!";
	schema:reviewBody "Every once in a while a movie diamond comes out from the rough. I sought out Paul Newman's 'lesser known' movies. The couple I had seen whilst good were not anything spectacular but I then stumbled across The Prize. Whilst not expecting anything too entertaining I was to my delight proved wrong. It was magnificent. One of Newman's top performances.Despite the negativity of the cinema critics The Prize was box office gold for MGM studios and the moviegoing public made it one of the most popular tickets during Christmas of 1963.The opening scenes of the movie are quite clever. We are introduced to the winners of the Nobel prizes and the viewer is given an introduction to the main supporting cast. We meet the joint winners for Chemistry Dr Claude Marceau Gerard Oury and his wife Dr Denise Marceau Micheline Presline. Claude and Denise are married yet Claude shares his physical needs with his accompanying secretary Jacqueline Beer. The prize for Medicine is shared by Dr John Garrett Kevin McCarthy who is convinced fellow winner Dr Carlo Ferrelli Sergio Fantoni stole his research. The Prize for Physics has been won by American physicist Dr Max Stratman Edward G Robinson who has been joined by his niece Emily Stratman Diane Baker. One Nobel winner is missing American novelist Andrew Craig Paul Newman who has won the prize for Literature.Andrew's fondest for alcohol womanising and his general cynicism for the Nobel Prize prompt the Swedish Foreign Ministry to allocate him a chaperone for his stay  the beautiful Inger Lisa Anderson Elke Sommer in her first American film appearance. We meet the novelist flirting with a flight attendant arriving into Stockholm late because of a rendezvous with a young woman. Andrew is introduced to Dr Max Stratman whilst checking into the hotel. Both men agree to meet the next day for a drink with Dr Stratman determined to give the young author some advice in accepting the Noble Prize humbly. As Andrew spends the night indulging in alcohol and the flashing his charm at every young woman in Stockholm Dr Stratman is being abducted and an impostor put in his place to accept Stratman's Nobel Prize.At the Nobel Prize press conference the next morning Andrew lets the world in on a little secret  he has been suffering writer's block for the last five years and as a consequence has been earning money by writing detective stories. It is Andrew's 'nose' for detecting mysterious occurrences to make him realise that something is not quite right with 'Dr Stratman'  he doesn't seem to recall meeting Andrew from the night before..As Andrew becomes caught up in trying to unravel the sinister plot to smuggle the real Dr Stratman behind the Iron Curtain attempts are made to kill him. Naturally when he reports the situation no one believes him because Andrew's reputation for being an alcoholic trouble maker has indeed preceded him. He is therefore warned to stop creating problems. To make matters more complicated Andrew and Lisa fall under each other's spell and they start a romance and Lisa realises that Andrew is indeed telling the truth about Dr Stratman's abduction. Together they must save Dr Stratman and the Nobel ceremony as well as trying to prevent an international incident at the same time.It is now up to both Andrew and Lisa to save the real Max Stratman from being smuggled behind the Iron Curtain and preventing the impostor Stratman from receiving the Noble Prize and publicly denouncing his loyalties to America.As Andrew ends up in one comedic situation after another the other supporting actors come in to play. They are absolutely fantastic providing for a hilarious and witty journey for all involved.The screenplay was written by Ernest Lehman  the screenwriter for Hitchcock's North by Northwest. This is where the unfair and biased comparisons start to play upon the viewer's judgement of the film. Whilst North by Northwest is a traditional Hitchcock thrillermystery The Prize is a delightful comedy. A word of warning for fans of North By Northwest The Prize is not meant to be taken as a serious spy thriller. It simply invites the viewer to enjoy the frivolities and comic situations of a group of people who could not be more different.After playing such intense and character roles such as Eddie Felson and Brick Pollitt previously Newman was able to completely relax and enjoy playing a comedic role. He is absolutely delightful as the flirtatious and handsome young novelist. Elke Sommer is gorgeous as Andrew's chaperone and eventual romantic interest. It is wonderful to see how skilfully she helps her character develop from treating Andrew with icy distain to falling in love with him. Micheline Praline and Diane Baker are beautiful as Denise Marceau and Emily Stratman. Both are fine actresses.To those who admire Paul Newman's work I urge you all to see this movie. Despite the kudos he receives for his dramatic roles this is one of his top line movies. It is often disregarded and to my mind unfairly. It is absolutely wonderful and I loved it. To those who simply like a bit of a laugh and some wonderful actors hamming it up it is the perfect way to spend a quiet Saturday Night relaxing. If you enjoy it spread the word. They certainly don't make them like this anymore.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you have read the book what the film has to offer is unfortunately a replay of what Hitchcock created in 1959.Ernest Lehman was the script writer for Hitchcock's North by northwest. I was surprised that two scenes from the classic were modified by Lehman for The Prize. The famous scene of Cary Grant being almost killed by a plane in the open field is replayed here with Paul Newman being terrorized by a car on an empty bridge at night. A few minutes later into the film Lehman replaces the auction sequence in the Cary Grant film with Newman in a nudist conference. If you have seen the Hitchcock film you know what follows. Was it a homage to Hitchcock or was Lehman suffering a bout of creativity loss? Or was Director Mark Robson a die hard Hitchcock fan? The book pulp fiction at its best made good casual reading. The film is good to pass the time watching Paul Newman and Edward G. Robinson reenacting roles similar to what they have enjoyed playing so often. The wisecracks thanks to Irving Wallace make the otherwise dumb and predictable film worth your time.".

	onyx:emotionText "If you have read the book what the film has to offer is unfortunately a replay of what Hitchcock created in 1959.Ernest Lehman was the script writer for Hitchcock's North by northwest. I was surprised that two scenes from the classic were modified by Lehman for The Prize. The famous scene of Cary Grant being almost killed by a plane in the open field is replayed here with Paul Newman being terrorized by a car on an empty bridge at night. A few minutes later into the film Lehman replaces the auction sequence in the Cary Grant film with Newman in a nudist conference. If you have seen the Hitchcock film you know what follows. Was it a homage to Hitchcock or was Lehman suffering a bout of creativity loss? Or was Director Mark Robson a die hard Hitchcock fan? The book pulp fiction at its best made good casual reading. The film is good to pass the time watching Paul Newman and Edward G. Robinson reenacting roles similar to what they have enjoyed playing so often. The wisecracks thanks to Irving Wallace make the otherwise dumb and predictable film worth your time.";

	schema:reviewBody "Stockholm never looked lovelier than in this film. Seldom have I seen a city made to look as beautiful and colorful as they managed to do here. While introducing farcical elements to replace the heavy romance in the original director Mark Robson and screenwriter Ernest Lehman virtually remake Alfred Hitchcock's and Lehman's North By Northwest in a way that continually pokes fun at itself.Paul Newman stars as effete and boozing American writer Andrew Craig who somehow managed to win a Nobel Prize for Literature despite not having written anything but cheap detective novels for years. Arriving in Stockholm to attend the ceremony he is shepherded during his stay by government representative Inger Andersson the lovely Elke Sommer. He meets several other prize recipients each of whom has some dysfunctional relationship with either a fellow prize winner or someone else close. Then there is one particular prize winner Dr. Max Stratman Edward G. Robinson who is the subject of a sinister ColdWar plot....Newman lounges through most of the film affecting a nowit'sthere nowit'snot effete speaking voice that contrasts sharply with his pretensions to being a lady killer. Being a detectivestory writer he quickly senses from some subtle facts that something is amiss with Dr. Stratman and his perky niece Diane Baker. He spends the remainder of the film gallivanting around Stockholm solving the mystery while contending with assorted colorful locals.Anyway that's the setup. There are gaping plot holes at one point Craig receives a mysterious and crucial phone call from someone for no apparent reason and jokey scenes with no purpose Lehman sends up a similar scene in North By Northwest by having Craig interrupt a Nudist Convention in order to escape bumbling killers. More so than usual in these types of films the crooks seem to linger around practically inviting the hero to figure things out in time. The chief hired killer is a dead ringer for Martin Landau who must have been unavailable while Leo G. Carroll reprises his role as an authority figure to eliminate all confusion about what is going on. The real problem with the script is that it can't make up its mind to be a complete farce so one minute Newman is stumbling around rather pathetically the next he is outwitting professional killers on a cargo ship a la James Bond. As a mystery the film is rather silly and as a farce it pulls its punches so those are not the reasons to see it.But Stockholm is glorious! There is an irreverent liveandletlive attitude throughout that plays on the stereotype that anything goes in hip Sweden and Elke is the embodiment of that wistful notion. Newman gets off occasional oneliners of the type that Sean Connery did much better in the following year's Goldfinger but are amusing in their own right. Worth catching for a trip to a fabulous place that never really existed.".

	schema:reviewBody "For a Hitchcock knockoff The Prize is not bad at all. There's an amusing situation not Lincoln's nostril but the Nobel Prize ceremonies scenic tours not of the Riviera but of Stockholm a gaunt killer not an imported assassin who knows music but a waiter a long terrifying fall not Madeleine Elster but Paul Newman a supple blond ice queen not Grace Kelly or Eva Marie Saint but Elke Sommer and a dashing hero not Cary Grant but Newman. And in an odd sort of way it's Paul Newman who is as much a drawback to the movie as a plus. Newman plays Andrew Craig an American author who has run out of steam after two great books. He's been awarded the Nobel Prize for literature and has arrived in Stockholm full of martinis and selfloathing for the award ceremonies. Craig is on his way to becoming a lush. The Nobel committee has assigned him a keeper Inger Anderson Elke Sommer to keep him out of trouble away from the booze and to see that he minds his manners. She's not altogether successful. At the hotel Craig meets Dr. Max Stratman Edward G. Robinson an migr after WWII from Germany who is now an American citizen. Stratman is receiving the Nobel for physics. They chat and agree to meet for further discussion the next day. Craig also meets Stratman's niece Emily Stratman Diane Baker. Yet at the next morning's press briefing where all the Nobel winners have gathered to meet reporters Stratman acts as if he's never met Craig before. Only we know why Max Stratman has been propositioned to defect to East Germany...and when he refused he was abducted and replaced by his twin brother Walter Stratman from behind the Iron Curtain. It's not long before Craig catches on that something nasty is happening. Partly out of concern for Max Stratman partly out of boredom he sets out to answer the questions that keep popping up in his head. Along the way he finds a body is pushed off a tall building into an ocean channel and nearly killed by a tugboat is threatened and then almost run over by a car finds himself in an eery psychiatric hospital and then pursued by two killers in a meeting hall filled with nudists. What can he do but take off his clothes to blend in? At the climax he finds himself clamoring around the cargo holds of an East German freighter where only he seems to believe the villains have hidden Stratman. And all along he is either helped or hindered take your pick by Inger Anderson and Emily Stratman. It's easy to tell who the bad guys are but not so easy to figure out which of the two women is playing a double game. While all this is going on preparation for the Nobel ceremonies is taking place...the receptions the rehearsals the gettingtoknow the other winners some of whom turn out to play key roles especially the two who have won the Nobel for medicine. They dislike each other intensely yet find a grudging friendship when they must work together to save a key character. Best of all is Leo G. Carroll as Count Bertil Jacobson charged with making sure everything at the ceremony moves smoothly. Carroll a veteran of Hitchcock films is droll and understated. Why is Newman essential to the movie? Because he has star power and we recognize it as soon as he appears on the screen. Hitchcock was at his best with strong charismatic actors. Newman provides the same strength here. Why is he also a weakness? Because he's no Cary Grant. The Prize is the same kind of international adventure romantic and stylish as are To Catch a Thief and North by Northwest. Where Grant could effortlessly turn irony into amused charm however Newman turns irony more often into a kind of petulant sarcasm especially when he's acting half in the bag. And where Grant and Kelly melted the celluloid Newman and Sommer don't make many sparks. They're playful find themselves in compromising positions smile out a few hopeful double entendres but it's all just pleasant acting. On the other hand Edward G. Robinson brings a great deal of authority to his role. There's not much of him in the second half of the movie. In the first half however we get to see him as an avuncular kindly and smart old man someone we can believe would make a man like Craig become concerned about and then as a coldeyed deliberate and notsokind character. Allinall The Prize is a snappy reasonably fastpaced coldwar adventure a lot of fun to watch. I enjoy it whenever I see it. I just wish Hitchcock and Grant had made it.".

In classic Hitchcock fashion once the mystery kicks in your left scratching your head wondering if the protagonist just paranoid or is something fishy really going on.I consider The Prize one of Paul Newman's best films giving him the opportunity to show off his not often exposed comedic chops. Newman is one of few select actors in which I can ask the question honestly who doesn't like Paul Newman? does there exist a more likable screen presence? Likewise Edward G. Robinson's role is reminiscent of his part in The Whole Town's Talking playing a dual role of characters identical in appearance but with polar opposite personalities while the hotel setting rings a bell of MGM's own Grand Hotel some 31 years prior. plus when you set your movie in Sweden it seems inevitable that someone will mention Greta Garbo along the way. Hitchcock himself also never fully took advantage of the cold war. Torn Curtain although I do think is underrated is imperfect while Topaz is one of his dullest outings. It's satisfying to see a superb Hitchcockian thriller with a plot about West vs. East.North By Northwest has the auction scene in which Cary Grant makes a fool of himself to get caught by the police in order to get away from the bad guys The Prize has the same scene but ups the ante with having it taking place during a nudist meeting and of course naturally of all the countries in the world to a nudist meeting where else but Sweden. The Prize is not quite Hitchcock's greatest hits but it's the closet a film comes to being so. There are other allusions to other Hitchcock films including The Lady Vanishes Foreign Correspondent Saboteur and Torn Curtain. Hang on that one didn't come until three years after this movie. Huh was Hitchcock inspired by this Hitchcock cloneripoff homagewhatever you want to call it. As far as imitations of someone else's work goes it doesn't get pulled off any better than this.".

	schema:reviewBody "It took me years to finally see The Prize 1963 although the film had intrigued me since I saw a production still featuring the then radiant and very young Elke Sommer. But until I actually viewed The Prize I was unaware that this was one of the earliest Hollywood attempts to create a blockbuster. Not because of potential box office it would take Jaws and Star Wars to start that revolution but because the industry at the time felt the only way to successfully differentiate themselves from television was by bundling up a cast of thousands with a whole lot of exotic location shots and a running time far in excess of anything to be found on the tube the miniseries had not yet been invented.This cast of thousands includes prospective Nobel prize recipients in Stockholm for the awards presentation. Novelist Andrew Craig literaturePaul Newman refugee Max Stratman physicsEdgar G. John Garrett and Carlo Farelli medicineKeven McCarthy and Sergio Fantoni. Commies this is the cold war after all kidnap Stratman with the aid of his niece Emily Diane Baker who believes this is a way to free her father. Suspension of disbelief is necessary at this point as the premise is that her father is Stratman's identical twin who will take his place and denounce the United States during his acceptance speech yawn. Newman is the star and he teams up with a hot Swedish official Miss Sommer to foil the Commie plot. The NewmanSommer stuff is the best part of the film along with a fun performance by Jacqueline Beer which adds some degree of comic relief. Believe it or not they take 134 minutes to tell this story which barely has enough interesting story elements for a 50minute episode of I Spy.So for those thinking about watching The Prize be prepared for a fair amount of absolute boredom. There have been attempts to compare the film to some of Hitchcock's stuff particularly North By Northwest. That is quite a stretch although even Rear Window had it's occasional boring moment maybe if you take the most boring minute in any Hitchcock film and multiply it by 134.If you are looking for comparisons think Arthur Hailey as the Irving Wallace source material is very similar. Imagine an overlong combination of The Young Doctors and Hotel. Then again what do I know? I'm only a child.".

Suspension of disbelief is necessary at this point as the premise is that her father is Stratman's identical twin who will take his place and denounce the United States during his acceptance speech yawn. Newman is the star and he teams up with a hot Swedish official Miss Sommer to foil the Commie plot. The NewmanSommer stuff is the best part of the film along with a fun performance by Jacqueline Beer which adds some degree of comic relief. Believe it or not they take 134 minutes to tell this story which barely has enough interesting story elements for a 50minute episode of I Spy.So for those thinking about watching The Prize be prepared for a fair amount of absolute boredom. There have been attempts to compare the film to some of Hitchcock's stuff particularly North By Northwest. That is quite a stretch although even Rear Window had it's occasional boring moment maybe if you take the most boring minute in any Hitchcock film and multiply it by 134.If you are looking for comparisons think Arthur Hailey as the Irving Wallace source material is very similar. Imagine an overlong combination of The Young Doctors and Hotel. Then again what do I know? I'm only a child.";

	schema:headline " Worth watching for light entertainment and cinematic history";
	schema:reviewBody "The Prize falls somewhere between North by Northwest and the Pink Panther as a mix of mystery thriller and comedy. It should be viewed as light entertainment much like a Poirot or Agatha Christie mystery. I had not seen this before and looked it up for the early Jerry Goldsmith score which is colorful but more of a nondescript background piece than most of his work. What I found interesting is the place of The Prize in the many mystery thrillers of the period along with the Ernest Lehman script. Beginning with Hitchcock's North by Northwest with script by Lehman the thrillers mixed in some subtle humor to make the films seem cool and hip. The James Bond series which began in 1962 with Dr. No followed by Goldfinger is a classic example but you also see it in Mirage and later The Ipcress File and Gambit. But it is never slapstick humor in the main body of the genre. Then with The Pink Panther A Shot in the Dark and Casino Royale the humor becomes dominant using the thriller only as a foundation. In The Prize you see an attempt at about a 6040 mix of thriller and humor. Does it work? The viewer must be the judge. But if it had been a 9010 mix like Northwest it would have failed at least without mixing in more danger and believability and this would have been a different movie not so family oriented for the time. I don't think the plot is strong enough to be a straight thriller and neither apparently did the director. Ernest Lehman turned in a good script that puts the pieces of the complex jigsaw puzzle together efficiently but without the snappy memorable dialog of his other work. It is worth watching twice to look for the subtle cues and red herrings he throws in. But I think the director Mark Robson did not demand enough from most of the Alist actors to give the movie realism. I guess he was going for light comedy and it is funny enough. The bad guy with the pointed hat was a nice touch an allusion to Mad Magazine's Spy vs. Spy comic series which he looked like. The light style and format with its almost random romantic interaction seems to anticipate Love Boat. But I feel better directing could have raised the movie a notch. I wonder what Hitch would have done differently? I wonder if he was offered the movie but turned it down? Compared to some modern movies in this genre such as Flawless I think The Prize's plot and script are far more complex tight and interesting. But modern audiences might be disappointed by the relative lack of adrenalinedriving action.The movie opens saying it is set sometime in the future. The only indications of this are the nature of the prizes which presciently include Nobels for in vitro fertilization organ transplants by suppressing the immune response and solar energy. I don't know whether Irving Wallace or Lehman deserve the credit but someone did their homework and got the future right by about 20 years. As to Paul Newman's performance I think it is just fine. You see him change as the plot progresses from a cynical depressed writer to a revitalized man who has found his groove and his girl. Anyone who views this performance as evidence that Newman was an egotist is confusing the role with the person. Newman who never lived in Beverly Hills was one of those great actors who never let fame go to his head. I couldn't help wondering what Richard Feynman thought of this movie. He discusses his feelings about accepting the Nobel Prize in his memoirs. I wonder if he mentioned this movie?I also couldn't help but wonder to what extent the real life version of Leo G. Carroll's character does worry about scenarios such as impersonation? But I assume security matters are secret.As to the nudist scene which echoes Lehman's Northwest auction scene the curious part is that it precedes the nudist camp scene in Peter Seller's A Shot in the Dark. I have the feeling the publicity department might have had something to do with it as Sweden and nudist certainly would have gotten the public's attention back then. There was apparently a lot of cross fertilization of ideas within the genre of the period sometimes with improved effect. The classic Peter Sellers nudist scene is far funnier and about the only worthwhile part of the movie. But I would loved to have seen Hitchcock's face when he saw the nudist scene. And Lehman's face when he was writing it!In short I give The Prize an A for originality of concept a B for tightness of plot and a C for directing.".

What makes it fascinating is that the writing by the same Ernest Lehman who scripted North by Northwest the international casting the action melodrama pacing borrowed from The Adventures of Tintin the sexual innuendos the music by a young Jerry Goldsmith channelling Bernard Hermann's celebrated orchestral stingers over a John Barrylike jazz background and the expert direction and editing by Mark Robson an alumni like Robert Wise of the Val Lewton outfit at RKO all make it possibly better than the original. It is certainly entertaining and chockfull of wonderfully spirited performances by the likes of Micheline Presle and even that other Val Lewton alumni Anna Lee in a small role. It is interesting to note that Hitchcock was himself inspired by this Cold War scenario for his own subsequent Torn Curtain  starring Paul Newman but without the heavy sexual innuendos. I have only one reservation stunt dubbing Edward G. Robinson' voice in a crucial scene about the magic of acting was a serious mistake. He certainly could have done it on his own.Long overdue on DVD.

	schema:headline " In A Word Outrageous!";
	schema:reviewBody "Outrageous! This is another sickbutfascinating David Lynch film maybe his sickest although I've never seen Eraserhead. The most interesting feature of this strange movie I think was the weird characters one after the other. Make that ultraweird.....and the strangest of them all is Bobby Peru played by Willem Dafoe. In all my years of movie watching I think Bobby Peru still has to rank in the top five of the creepiest characters. He is so outrageously disgusting and perverted you just have to laugh out loud at him.In fact outrageous might be the best word to describe this film characters and all.This wild and entertaining film sometimes makes me shake my head in disgust that I own it and at other times makes me just laugh out loud at the absurdity of it. You really have to have a dark sense of humor to appreciate much of it. I do to some degree....enough to keep viewing this.Nicholas Cage is particularly fun to watch and provides most of the laughs. Laura Dern is also convincing as a trailertrashtype. If you want a clue on why Dern would play such a sleazy role check out her reallife mom in this film Diane Ladd who plays her mother in the movie. It looks like Mom passed on her wholesome values.As with some other Lynch films the music is outstanding just a great soundtrack. I bought the CD to this a year after first seeing the movie and I've always enjoyed it. And another Lynch trait that certainly is here is the excellent visual style which is enhanced by the widescreen DVD.So if you are looking for an outrageous two hours and you aren't easily shocked or offended this would be a film to consider.".

	onyx:emotionText "Outrageous! This is another sickbutfascinating David Lynch film maybe his sickest although I've never seen Eraserhead. The most interesting feature of this strange movie I think was the weird characters one after the other. Make that ultraweird.....and the strangest of them all is Bobby Peru played by Willem Dafoe. In all my years of movie watching I think Bobby Peru still has to rank in the top five of the creepiest characters. He is so outrageously disgusting and perverted you just have to laugh out loud at him.In fact outrageous might be the best word to describe this film characters and all.This wild and entertaining film sometimes makes me shake my head in disgust that I own it and at other times makes me just laugh out loud at the absurdity of it. You really have to have a dark sense of humor to appreciate much of it. I do to some degree....enough to keep viewing this.Nicholas Cage is particularly fun to watch and provides most of the laughs. Laura Dern is also convincing as a trailertrashtype. If you want a clue on why Dern would play such a sleazy role check out her reallife mom in this film Diane Ladd who plays her mother in the movie.

	schema:reviewBody "Wild at Heart is probably the most conventional David Lynch film I've seen. That being said it still remains very far from mainstream. Wild at Heart revolved around a young couple played to perfection by Nicolas Cage and Laura Dern. Fast paced mostly ridiculous and pretty unrealistic Wild at Heart is far from perfect but a very fun film to watch.The premise is strange but intriguing. A young couple is separated when the guy an Elvis fanatic named Sailor Nicolas Cage goes to prison for manslaughter after defending himself against a man who threatened him. When he gets out he is desperate to get Lula Laura Dern the girl he loves back again. Lula is more than willing to pick up the relationship but if her mother has anything to do with it she won't have a chance. Being young and in love the girl rebels. However her mother's desperation leads her to contact a hitman she is in knows and the young couple is forced to run away. The two lovebirds head to California and encounter all sorts of crazy situations along the way.Arguably the best thing about Wild at Heart is its great cast. Nicolas Cage is in his prime here and the role is somewhat reminiscent of the repeat offender he played in Raising Arizona. Nicolas Cage was great in his preactionhero movies. Laura Dern is equally excellent. I'd never understood the reason for her popularity in sexy roles. It's effective here though and she embodies sweet yet trashy Lula wonderfully. Supporting performances by Willem Defoe Harry Dean Stanton and Diane Ladd also provide liveliness that enhances the film.Although it deals with such serious subjects as murder incest and general family dysfunction Wild at Heart is anything but serious. The film is chocked full of amusing moments and over the top clichs. The best example of this is the presence of a rich older crime boss with a penchant for having young  preferably naked  young girls surrounding him at all times he's present. There are a few moments when the style gets repetitive and the characters do something worthy of much eyerolling. Despite that this movie is never boring and fairly unpredictable.Wild at Heart is a fun adventure to hitch a ride on. It is full of energy and snappy dialogue. Unlike most Lynch films it is very linear and straight forward. The acting is excellent and the characters are strangely likable. Wild at Heart feels a little long and drags in a few places toward the end but this barely hinders the film in its entirety. This is an amusing film one that would make a good introduction to Lynch for those unfamiliar. For the rest of us it's simply an enjoyable piece of filmmaking.810".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of my favorite David Lynch films. It is also one of the more transparent easy to understand Lynch films although that's not the reason why it's one of my favorites. But that fact also makes Wild at Heart a good candidate for introducing someone to Lynch.On the other hand although it's more transparent and linear on a surface level I'm still not sure I've figured out the multilayered bizarre subtexts and symbolism that lie deep beneath the surfaceeven though I've seen it a few times now. Assuming that there is indeed something to figure out. To an extent it seems like maybe the hint of something deeper is in this case more of a red herring. This is one of Lynch's funnier films albeit very macabre humor. It contains references to all of Lynch's most common content quirksincluding sequined ingnues singing jazz manipulative housewife types shots of asphalt speeding by minor characters with freaky speech impediments severed body parts and on and onbut it's almost as if he's making fun of himself. Combine that with excellent performances including a hilarious bit part for Crispin Glover one of my favorite actorspersonalities a sublimely incongruous score and a retro gripping violent road trip saga cum romance that presages both Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers 1994 and just about all of Quentin Tarantino's career and you've got quite a film.Wild at Heart based on a novel by Barry Gifford is the tale of Sailor Nicolas Cage and Lula Laura Dern a doeeyed classy white trash couple. As the film startsand what a start it issomeone tries to stab Sailor to death as he's exiting a theater. Sailor will have none of it and Lynch begins the film on an exhilarating brutally violent notethis is not a film for the faint of heart. To complicate matters and set up the primary conflict we learn even before the attempted stabbing that the hit man was sent by Lula's mother Marietta Fortune Diane Ladd who claimed that Sailor tried to seduce her in the bathroom this isn't quite true as we learn in detail later.There isn't a character in the film who isn't involved with some shady business either presently or in the past. Sailor and Marietta's tensions stem from many years ago when Lula was just a girl she's supposedly quite a bit younger than Sailor. The events of the film's opening result in Sailor being imprisoned. Lula dutifully waits for his release much to the consternation of her mom. The basic gist of the film is disarmingly simpleSailor and Lula are headed across the country with an eventual goal of California as Marietta tries to arrange for Sailor to be put away for good. There are many finely realized subplots and detailed tangents but that's the crux of the plot on the surface.In addition to his typical hyperrealsurreal weirdness Lynch concocts a very improbable stew of influences that work together beautifully. Lula has something of an obsession with The Wizard of Oz 1939. She's haunted by visions of the wicked witch including the evil cackle and she sees the road trip as a veritable journey to the Emerald City. Lynch works in a lot of subtle references to The Wizard of Oz with other characters too. Sailor is something like lounge version of Elvis reincarnated as a gangster flunky with even better karate moves to match. Yet the two are huge heavy metal fans especially of a band named Powermad whose music exquisitely punctuates many sequences including some sublime dance scenes. In the first half important scenes are set in New Orleans with the familiar unsettling undertone that that locale often has in filmsyou can just smell the voodoo sex drugs and death bubbling beneath the skin of the city. Later scenes are set in the desolate desert prairie country of Texas which turns out to be even more unsettling even though I really find such places refreshing and relaxing. There are other kinds of symbolic stylistic and literal references worked into the film such as the constant fire motif which Lynch shoots beautifully but the above is to just give you an idea of the stew.It all seems like it should add up to some subtextual grand narrative and maybe it does but I haven't quite figured out what it all means yet. But it doesn't matter. The stylistic flourishes are ingenious superficially too and maybe Lynch is just poking fun at being Lynch. Here perhaps more than in any other work he has found the perfect balance between the soapoperatic and the utterly bizarrethe filmic equivalent to author Harry Crews' best work.Tarantino doesn't tend to have pithy subtexts in his films either but they're no worse the wear for that and when Wild at Heart takes a turn into typical Tarantino territory Lynch is just as captivating gritty and groovy plus he's doing it before Tarantino himself. At the same time Lynch manages to maintain a parallel lush erotic romance between Sailor and LulaDern is incredibly sexysensuous here. This material works as well and supplies what just may be the message of the film after allthat love can eventually conquer all even the stuff that's wild at heart and weird on top.".

	schema:headline " A stark trip into the heart of the weird and not so wonderful.";
	schema:reviewBody "It's true to say that Wild At Heart is perhaps one of David Lynch's moreflawed cinematic endeavours with many of the scenes and indeed the film as a whole seeming incomplete or lacking any real purpose. One criticism of the film that tends to crop up most often is that the whole thing smacks of weirdness for weirdness sake with Lynch failing to tie his strange characters and their surreal situations to any kind of real narrative which I suppose is true. However despite these flaws the film is still a great deal of fun and although the whole thing is ultimately very silly it still has enough bizarre highpoints setpieces sightgags and cameos to make the whole thing ultimately worthwhile.I suppose the film is best described as a vicious blackcomedy though the emphasis there is on 'vicious'. Lynch also makes allusions to the 'lovers on the run' genre of crime filmmaking popular in the 60's and 70's taking it all further into the realms of the bizarre through his own cinematic obsessions like deformities arson smalltown Americana detective fiction good versus evil caraccidents etc as well as more arcane references to Elvis voodoo incest and the Wizard of Oz. It's a surreal trip best summed up by the film's repeated mantra wild at heart weird on top with Lynch seemingly revelling in this carnival of grotesques whores thugs and criminals all gathered together in smalltown New Mexico under a haze of blood and sex. American film critic Roger Ebert mockingly referred to the film as a lurid melodrama soap opera exploitation puton and selfsatire which to me sums up the film's most successful attributes. The plot takes off from films like Thieves Like Us Bonnie  Clyde and Badlands predating Oliver Stone's similarly overthetop darksatire Natural Born Killers with two starstruck lovers hitting the road in an attempt to escape from the pressures of the modernworld parole poverty and an overbearing mother. Lynch lays on the melodramatic clichs in broad stroke to the point where all narrative references are to be taken with a pinch of salt... for example it's not enough for our hero Sailor to be a murdering jailbird from the wrongside of the tracks but he has to have a loving sexkitten girlfriend from a welltodo neighbourhood with overprotective lovedones. Admittedly Lynch does subvert this almost saccharine depiction of moral family values by offering a flashback in which our heroine Lula is assaulted by a predatory uncle while her mother is later revealed to be a drunk manicdepressive with mafia ties which again is all part of the joke.There's also the spirit of the 50's with Fredrick Elmes' colourful widescreen cinematography bringing to mind the Technicolor melodrama of Hollywood's golden age and the films of people like Nicholas Ray Elia Kazan and Douglas Sirk. There's also the obligatory references to the feckless youth of Brando in The Wild One or the selfaware pastiche of Coppola's great film Rumble Fish with the characters here looking and sounding like they've walked out of the pages of a lurid slice of pure pulp fiction. Of course this is another problem that some viewers have had with the film with Lynch offering no real characters  as he had done with masterpieces like The Elephant Man and Blue Velvet  and instead relying on arcane ciphers and bizarre caricatured grotesques. Again this is all part of the fun and not really intended to be taken entirely seriously with Lynch and his actors keeping the film moving from one outburst of random surrealism to the next with a number of humours andor terrifying iconic performances from this esteemed though certainly eclectic cast of characters. The centre of the film and indeed the real focus of our attention is established and sustained well through the relationship between the characters Sailor and Lula which is developed surprisingly well through the strong and fearless performances of Nicolas Cage and Laura Dern. Dern has never looked more stunning in a film as the sensual and unhinged Lula whilst Cage reminds us of what a strong and intense character actor he used to be in the days before he switched to shallow Hollywood blockbusters. Both actors have a great chemistry with each other and create a believable relationship in spite of the overthetop abstractions and dramatic flourishes called for by Lynch's script. Amongst the supporting players Harry Dean Stanton is a joy as the hounddog privateinvestigator Johnny Farragut who is sent looking for Sailor and Lula by his lover Lula's mother Marietta Fortune who is brought vividly to life with a grandstanding overthetop relish by Dern's reallife mother Diane Ladd.Add some bizarre cameos from Lynch regulars like Sherilyn Fenn Jack Nance Freddie Jones Grace Zabriskie Isabella Rossalini Sheryl Lee here continuing the Oz references with her climactic appearance as the good witch J.E. Freeman Crispin Glover in one of the film's most bizarre scenes as Lula's troubled cousin Dell and an extended appearance by an unrecognisable Willem Dafoe who's character Bobby Peru meets one of the most outlandish and overly violent sequences ever witnessed on screen. Certainly this film doesn't quite floorme with it's madness as it used to when I was 14 or 15 and would watch this and Blue Velvet pretty much religiously with Lynch subsequently outdoing himself with the modern masterpiece Mulholland Drive. However this film is probably more fun and doesn't take as much concentration to really follow or get into it.Ultimately the film works depending on how much of Lynch's bizarre creations you can stand with the film falling somewhere between the darklycomic satire of Twin Peaks at it's most wittiest and the dark industrial nightmare of Lost Highway only with a more linear plot. I still think it's a great deal of fun and will undoubtedly appeal to diehard Lynch fans or those with an interest in cult American cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "The most creative and controversial director in cinema is back with a roadmovie! Wild at Heart is one rough roller coaster ride and a typical Lynchcocktail of violence sex and of coursebizarre characters. I challenge you to find one personality in this film that could be referred to as a normal human being'. As usually Lynch introduces a bunch of wicked individuals in his film who're all messed up in the head pretty bad. Yet I feel like Wild at Heart might be Lynch's most accessible film outside The Elephant Man and The Straight Story. The structure remains chronological and quite easy to follow. Unlike the previous Blue Velvet I feel like the plot and development of Wild at Heart is a bit inferior to the wonderful photography. The greatest aspects in the screenplay are in fact the delicious sidechapters that are told without absolute necessity. Like the story about Lula's cousin Dell Crispin Glover the torture of Harry Dean Stanton's character and the nasty and disturbing images of a car accident the protagonists come across. These are the little sequences that truly prove Lynch's talent as a storyteller. Overall and simply put this movie is COOL! It's a joy to watch and you really hate to love some of the offensive characters. Willem Dafoe takes the cake as Bobby Peru. His portrayal is a neat followup to Blue Velvet's Frank Booth. Peru is a filthy and despicable pervert with itchytriggerfingers! It's a damn shame he hasn't got any more screen time. Wild at Heart surely isn't the greatest masterpiece out there but you should love it for what it is an absurd and entertaining adventure with a couple of thoughtprovoking values and an extraordinary lovelesson.".

Unlike the previous Blue Velvet I feel like the plot and development of Wild at Heart is a bit inferior to the wonderful photography. The greatest aspects in the screenplay are in fact the delicious sidechapters that are told without absolute necessity. Like the story about Lula's cousin Dell Crispin Glover the torture of Harry Dean Stanton's character and the nasty and disturbing images of a car accident the protagonists come across. These are the little sequences that truly prove Lynch's talent as a storyteller. Overall and simply put this movie is COOL! It's a joy to watch and you really hate to love some of the offensive characters. Willem Dafoe takes the cake as Bobby Peru. His portrayal is a neat followup to Blue Velvet's Frank Booth. Peru is a filthy and despicable pervert with itchytriggerfingers! It's a damn shame he hasn't got any more screen time. Wild at Heart surely isn't the greatest masterpiece out there but you should love it for what it is an absurd and entertaining adventure with a couple of thoughtprovoking values and an extraordinary lovelesson.";

The two protagonists Sailor and Lula Nicholas Cage and Laura Dern are so in love with each other that they'd go to extreme lengths not to be separated. Their separation is exactly what Lula's crazed mother wants as she believes that Sailor is a coldblooded murderer who is putting her daughter in danger. Her anger is so fierce that the viewer becomes slightly scared by her her manic fits of rage where she plasters herself in red lipstick her bizarre paroxysms fueled by numerous cocktails. All of her slight idiosyncrasies and mannerisms well up to create a very intimidating mother. She sends out a hitman to dispose of Sailor and bring back her daughter but the lovely couple are on the run from her and the law.Sailor and Lula meet up with some very strange characters whilst travelling far away from Lula's mother. The eccentricities of 'Tuna Town' in Texas the insane car accident victim and Lula's nutcase cousin who believes that the man with the black glove is coming to get him. It's all rudimentary David Lynch fare. He has mastered the art of contemporary film making a clever blend of blackcomedy violence and fantasy.The viewer builds an empathy for the two main characters as it would be a terrible thing to see their undying love for each other shattered. The other characters in the movie all seem to want to destroy that love. Sailor's character although violent and hardbitten seems the most normal of the lot. It takes a sane man to make sense of all the insane folk in America's underbelly. He puts up with a lot from everyone but all he really wants to do is escape from it all with Lula.After all who can love in a world that's wild at heart?Nine out of ten.".

	schema:reviewBody "When Lynch wants to say something he takes his time no doubt about it. Sometimes he takes his time even when he doesn't have much to say. Example?Isabella Rosselini in torn stocking shabby wig and red shoes is swaying gently to some music when Willem DaFoe crashes in and gives her a vigorous smooch. That's the beginning and the end of the scene. Another example? Cage and Laura Dern are having an argument just after he's let out of the slams. She's nervous and upset because she hasn't seen him in six years. He looks at her intently and tells her it's a mistake for them to get back together again. There is about a twentysecond closeup of Dern's magnificent blue eyes. They don't drip with tears. They don't even blink. They stare directly into the camera. Why? Like you I'd have to guess. I'd guess that her unblinking unteary stare is meant to tell us that she sees things pretty clearly despite being shaken. That's pretty banal I know but my mind is open to other interpretations.I don't mean to sound as if I'm bashing the movie because that's not what I mean to do. Let's linger a little over a much later scene. It takes place in the middle of a city street El Paso I would guess but it's one of those industrialarea streets that are deserted on weekends. It's a wide sunbaked silent street cluttered with drunkenlooking telephone poles and lined with onestory factories and warehouses and there is a city skyline way in the distant cerulean with urban haze. And Cage is walking alone through this bleak and ominous landscape. But it's not only the visuals that makes this scene outstanding. A handful of viperous dudes wearing black fall in behind Cage's figure and another group of Thugees finally blocks his way in midstreet. The music comes to an abrupt halt. Nobody says anything. The atmosphere throbs with threat. Cage sets down his suitcase takes the time to deliberately light a cigarette looks around him and asks Okay  what do you faggots want? What they want is to beat the hell out of him and they get their wish. The unconscious Cage has a vision of The Nice Witch of the West don't ask and when he recovers he finds he's still surrounded by these sadistic brutes who ask him if he's had enough. He struggles to his feet gingerly feeling his broken rubber nose and says Yes I've had enough. Furthermore I'd like to apologize for referring to you dudes earlier as homosexuals. You've taught me a lesson. Then he runs away ecstatically. How many other movies can boast ten minutes worth of film like that?Now I can see where a lot of tenyearolds or tenyearold minds might be bored with this film. It's long. There isn't an abundance of violence although DaFoe does get his head blown off by twin blasts from a shotgun. I mean quite literally his head is blown completely off. It bounces off the wall like a football and lands with a loud splat on the pavement. So maybe there's a little hope for the horror afficionados after all but not much when you get right down to it.The movie is punctuated with violence and even more with oddities but mostly it moves languorously. Cage and Dern thrum through the Texas night in a shiny old convertible whose radio plays nothing but news like A man won his appeal today for dismissal of charges that he ate his own child. Well  not that but equally weird. One relative of Dern gets his kicks by putting a cockroach directly on his nether orifice. Willem DaFoe should definitely sue his dental surgeon. He thrusts his mouth close to Dern's at one point urging her to say something filthy to him and he'll let her go and his mouth is like a limpet's his lips a disgusting circle of membrane filled with hideous teeth.I wouldn't argue that Wild at Heart should be put into a time capsule but it's not a movie that's easy to forget. David Lynch may or may not be a hot commercial property but he's one of the most original directors working today.".

Lula Laura Dern and Sailor Nicholas Cageare in love but Lula's mother played by Laura Dern's real life mother Diane Ladd is evil. She doesn't want to see them together. Because of a murder Sailor is finally released from prison. Lula's mom hires people to kill sailor. So Lula and Sailor go on a crazy road trip with dark and fellini like characters. William Defoe is unforgettable as the creepy and perverted Bobby Peru. The film almost received an XNC17 rating. It's easy to see why it has lots of disturbing sex and violence. But than again that's a David Lynch trademark. This film is probably on my list of favorite road trip movies next to Godard's Weekend 1967 Thelma  Louise and Natural Born Killers. Both Nicholas Cage and Laura Dern give amazing performances. Dern's character Lula is the complete opposite of Sandy in Blue Velvet cause she's so wild and sexual. But Lula still has a naive child like charm. It seems that actor Nicholas Cage was born to play Sailor a charming Elvis like ex convict who wants to change his ways. Also check out Berry Gifford's sequel to Wild at Heart Perdita Durango aka. dance with the devil These films are both Wild at Heart and weird on Top!".

Wild at Heart is highly selfaware furiously cranking up the Lynchian stylistic quirks with little awareness of the delicate balance that made former Lynch films great. Blue Velvet did descend into surreal dark chaos but it contrasted the depraved weirdness with common decency and compassion. Wild at Heart on the other hand is just a heady stew of violence sex and bizarre happenings  very little here is recognizable as human behavior and just about nothing as human goodness. If Blue Velvet was guilty of being a little too turned on by its own darkness Wild at Heart is downright proud of presenting evil in a lurid gleeful manner.Nevertheless if all you want from Lynch movies is memorable surrealism wacky characters and delirious energy Wild at Heart still offers plenty to savor. Parts of Wild at Heart do possess a mad energy and offbeat humor that is infectious. The performances are also highly entertaining  Nicolas Cage has rarely been better and Dianne Ladd is hysterically funny in an utterly unhinged performance. But the madness of Wild at Heart all starts to seem too calculated too soulless and too ugly. The weirdness of Blue Velvet and Eraserhead almost always seemed organic like a natural outgrowth of the film  Wild at Heart seems awkwardly scrambled together. Wild at Heart contains flashes of true Lynchian brilliance and a game cast but they are lost in a nauseating patchy subpar work.".

The acting is generally poor and the ending of this movie is just plain stupid.The only other good thing about this movie is Powermad. It's too bad they didn't continue.

	schema:reviewBody "I hate to be the lone voice of protest here but. . .I saw this film the other day and aside from a few touches of visual flair and a terrific performance from Willem Dafoe nice little 'Sailor vs. Marine' motif it was an undercooked mess.  The overthetop qualities which would serve Oliver Stone so well four years later in Natural Born Killers come off as clumsy and forced.  Visual cuessuch as the plethora of Oz referencesare thrown in with about as much subtlety as a beer commercial but without the sophisticated wit.  I got the idea that Lynch was tired the cinematographer didn't feel like framing his compositions in a creative manner and the editor hit the bottle a few too many times before coming into work.And another thing  I was embarrassed for Diane Ladd and Laura Dern.  This film is a black spot on their respective careers though from what I've read they have a nearcultist reverence for Lynch and his 'artistic integrity'.  I found it most difficult to watch the scene where Ladd has to crouch up against a toilet after having vomited with lipstick coating her face and chunks of spew in her hair.  I didn't find it hard to watch because it was merely disgustingfolks there is such a thing as the degradation of women on film and it's here.At long last if you want to see these kinds of stories done right here are a few alternative film suggestions1.  Joseph L. Lewis's 1949 film of Guncrazy a Bmovie classic of starcrossed lovers on the lam.2.  Bonnie and Clyde of 1967 which skyrocketed its principal players to stardom and rightfully so.  A cornerstone of '60s American cinema.3.  From across the Atlantic another 1967 film JeanLuc Godard's Weekend.  Even if you don't like the picture you can't deny Godard's mastery of the medium.  Where Godard rebelled and bucked convention in countless ways Lynch is trapped in his own urge to include another injoke popculture reference or blood splatter and calling those his 'trademarks'.4.  Terrence Malick's first film 1973's Badlands with a remarkably youthful Martin Sheen and Sissy Spacek accompanied by Carl Orff's Musica Poetica fans of True Romance will recognize it instantly and elegaic heartland cinematography.5.  The imperfect but extremely likable True Romance from '93 with an excellent Tarantino screenplay the aforementioned Carl Orff score and the first 'straight' performance from Dennis Hopper since Godknowswhen.6.  Finally the one that puts any David Lynch effort to shame Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers.  Fans of Lynch and Wild At Heart will be angry with me calling WAH the main source of inspiration for NBK but I see it as a rehearsal instead.  Oliver Stone for all his faults at least takes filmmaking seriously.I was careful to have seen nearly all of Lynch's films before making a comment.  I have seen all but Twin PeaksFire Walk With Me and the Twin Peaks TV show.  I also have studied film seriously on my own for the past seven years so I like to believe I speak with a little authority.I realize Lynch must feel that his works are impervious to the audience's resentment of him but he's wrong.  Without an audience the celluloid itself is nothing because it exists in no one's mind except its makers and collaborators.  Think about that.I also acknowledge the small but steadfast group of Lynch devotees.  That's fine.  I'm happy for those guys.  And like them I have nothing but hope for Lynch's next film .".

It doesn't always add up and even though it isn't meant to the movie feels so selfindulgent you feel like the style is used to hide sloppy moviemaking.

Nick Cage is a bit too much to take too...you might find him funny or just overacting. There are some terrific performancesa hyped up silly sexy Laura Dern a hardened Isabella Rosselini a characteristic Harry Dean Stanton an unpredictable Willem Defoe and so on quite a quirky cast! A lot happens in two hours and it has that wide open American landscape behind it. It's no doubt sexist but I doubt any of its fans care a bit. And luckily this kind of highly stylized film has its fans. Surely the glossy saturated nightmare and all the sex and violence is has all the earmarks of counterculture hedonism. That's good if you're into that. But I constantly think how much more powerful it could have been. There are moments and scenes that are fabulous really brilliant. But in the long run it's a lazy movie depending on its weirdness far too often. For me that's not enough. Curious but not enough.".

When Sailor and Lula break parole and head for California she hires a hitman after them to kill Sailor.  Unaware of this Sailor and Lula continue west encountering all manner of weird and wonderful people on their way.I first tried to watch this when it first came on television but I was watching it with family and felt uncomfortable with the nudity and turned it off.  Years later I have seen many other Lynch films have loved Twin Peaks and looked forward to a chance to watch it.  I sat to watch it aware of the basic plot and that it was to be full of references to Wizard of Oz but I wasn't prepared for the biggest surprise  that it just wasn't that good a film.  I am not adverse to Lynch's universe of weird characters but I don't like it when I get the feeling that he is simply being weird for the sake of it.Certainly that seemed to be the case here the plot is so loose and meaningless to almost be pointless even as a frame for weirdness  which is what it really is.  The references to Wizard of Oz are all there but rather than being part of the film they are stuck in with clumsiness all the way  they seem like a gimmicky afterthought rather than a carefully scripted part of the film.  The plot is more a collected of the usual Lynchian weirdness and gore.  Sometimes this works really well when it is framed within an engaging film but here the characters images and action are all just left drifting in a relatively empty film.  It's a shame because I really like many of Lynch's films and was looking forward to this but even I am forced to admit that this film just isn't that good.The cast features many of Lynch regulars but many seem to be lost due to the fact that they haven't got the material to do their stuff within. Cage is really quite good despite his simple character.  Dern is given more to do but comes across rather hammy with it  her character should have had the emotional buy in to the film but she can't deliver it.  Turns from Dafoe Stanton Rossellini Fenn Glover and others are all good but they exist as free floating weird characters rather than part of the film in the way I would have liked.Overall this is a typical Lynchian film in it's imagery weird characters strange story and violentsexual content.  Usually these would be good things in this context but here they aren't put together very well creating a film that although worth seeing and weirdly fascinating is not actually that good a film.".

I saw it once when it came out and the only things I remembered was the car accident with Sherilyn Fenn and the angel at the end. That's it. I saw it again for the first time in 19 years and I understand why. It's not very memorable because it isn't a very good movie. Sure there are some cool crazy characters all right they're all crazy! and the photography of the bleak landscape is beautiful. David Lynch has also a cool way of using sounds and music which makes the film very eerie. Apart from that the film is dangerously close to being a Bmovie almost laughable. It doesn't hold up.".

How this dreadful waste of time was awarded best film at Cannes is beyond me and especially after the year that sex lies and videotape was awarded the same honor.  The latter was a great film this one is not. Even though I loved Blue Velvet I've never been a big fan of David Lynch and this movie is one of the reasons why.  His overuse of descriptive imagery in this work is senseless.  In particular the desert scene where the witch on a broom flies by indicating a reference to Lula's evil spiteful mother who has a detective and hitman trail them after they leave together for California.  The scene where she was showing her anger after Sailor and Lula's departure was something out of a movie from the 30's or 40's way too overacted.  It was just her grimacing and menacing music playing.  Nuts!! Listening to Nicholas Cage sing Love Me Tender and with a straight face just about capped it for me.  About 30 minutes into the film I was planning to hit the eject button but kept watching to see if it would improve.  It only got worse.".

	schema:reviewBody "John Frankenheimer didn't have a lot of credibility in his last few years. His final film was the rather crap Reindeer Games with Ben Affleck and in 1996 he gave us the utterly terrible Island Of Doctor Moreau. However he did do Ronin in 1998 which makes up for absolutely everything.It is a detachment from glossy MTVdirected Hollywood action movies. If you want trash like Bad Boys 2 then this isn't for you. Ronin returns to the gritty rustic and deadly serious actioners of the Seventies much like Frankenheimer's own French Connection 2.The title refers to Samurai warriors in ancient Japan who were left with no cause or purpose if their master was killed. They'd roam the countryside pretending to be thieves beggars even madmen and hiring their skills out to the highest bidder. Much like the lost wandering freelancers that make up our cast of characters.Robert De Niro is Sam an exCIA agent or is he? who bands together with a ragtag group of similar exspies for a no questions asked job with what appears to be the IRA. First we have Vincent the wonderful Jean Reno as a French agent who knows where to find just about anything you want. Spence Sean Bean is a gungho SAS dropout who is waaaaay out of his depth and ends up jeopardising the whole mission. Gregor Stellan Skarsgard an exKGB spy who knows his gadgets and another American called Larry who is rather disposable. All of these men are led by Deirdre Natascha McElhone a young Irish woman who answers to Seamus O'Rourke Jonathan Price an IRA boss who is in a lot of trouble with his superiors.Still with me? No? Well I'm gonna continue anyway. The group's mission is to steal a metallic briefcase from the Russian Mafia. The contents of this case are a mystery all we know is that a lot of people are willing to pay mucho plento to get their hands on it.As if the setup wasn't tenuous enough there is immediately too much suspicion within the group to bear. And the already complicated plot is thrown into endless chaos as doublecrosses doubledoublecrosses secrets and lies screw things up in a big big way.It sounds tough going but it's not really. I'll admit I didn't really like Ronin when I first saw it or the second or third for that matter but it's one of those movies that creeps back on you. Frankenheimer's direction is so flawless and masterful that every frame of every scene flows effortlessly The acting is so well rehearsed and the cast so well chosen that even in every gesture idiosyncrasy and subtle glance you can read into the characters's hidden motives. It takes a good number of viewings to decipher Ronin but when the story is this well done who cares? Since its release there have been few action films that have come close to its intensity. Some like Bourne IdentitySupremacy try to emulate its bleak tone but don't match up. Supremacy has a car chase that was desperate to beat Ronin's but is far too flashy.That's also the ace up it's sleeve. About 80 minutes into the film the second car chase is a juggernaut of filmmaking. Never before and probably never again for a long long time has there been a car chase so completely mental. No Michael Bay 1000 cuts a second no slowmotion no stunts silhouetted against the sunset just sheer relentless adrenaline as DeNiro and Reno tear up the streets of Paris. It's the centrepiece of the movie and a perfect example of what REAL action filmmaking is.Elia Cmiral's score is the other utterly perfect aspect of the movie. Simultaneously lonely seductive and mysterious it surely is one of the best themes ever and anyone with sense would go out and buy the soundtrack CD right away.Ronin is perfection from beginning to end from Frankenheimer's strong imposing direction to David Mamet's script riddled with cryptic dialogue and doublemeanings.No one can deny Ronin's importance as a real action picture. No one can watch crap like xXx or 6 Fast 6 Furious and claim Ronin to be a bad movie. It has enough maybe too much integrity and intelligence to shame anything that comes even halfway close. If you're sick of action flicks or films in general where the audience just sits there passively and is fed information then Ronin is the cure.It may sound like a bizarre comparison but it's on par with Lost Highway as one of those movies you have to figure out in your own damn time.".

No movie can compromise that and in recent years Hollywood has been doing just that to show off it's million dollar special effects and two cent story lines.

The mission goes awry with betrayal and we soon find out that everyone has their own motives and goals with the mysterious silver case. The cast is good and the direction is smooth and keeps the story flowing and it'll keep you guessing right up to the very end about just exactly what is going on and who everyone is. Then there are the car chases and they are awesome. Truly awesome and even legendary by now. Just like classics like 'Bullitt' and 'The French Connection' and goofy camp films of the seventies like the original 'Gone in 60 Seconds' this film uses no hypercrazy CGI in its action scenes and that proves all for the better since it is an action movie but it cannot lose all it's credibility for the sake of some cars crashing. A thrill needs to be at least partly believable otherwise it won't be thrilling. In fact the whole film has a more realistic feel to it with the relentlessness of the action being not over the top but still enjoyable for fans of the genre. Then there are the characters who much more real as they don't snap wise cracks while shooting bad guys square in the head one handed with a pistol at 30 yards. All in all this is a very good entry in the action genre and Hollywood should take note. 810Rated R for violence".

	schema:reviewBody "This thriller from veteren John Frankenheimer is pure excellence the script acting and action are top draw. De Niro and Reno are brilliant in this as of course you would expect from two such excellent actors. The action scenes are pulse pounding and particularly excellent are the car chases probably the best ever. Not only did the stunt guys risk their lives but the guys shooting the action captured some truly thrilling close up view from the cars as they speed along. The action also carries a certain degree of realism to it the shootouts are sensible and the car chases and crashes seem very genuine no massive corkscrewing threw the air like most car chases or cars jumping 100 feet in the air like in Gone in 60 seconds which is all very good but not for this sort of thriller. The pacing of the film was great and there was a constant chilling atmosphere. As I said before Robert De Niro and Jean Reno were exceptional particularly in their scenes together. The support cast are good too with a brief but excellent display from Sean Bean and Natasha Mchelhone and Jonathan Pryce are both good as Irish terrosists with comendable accents. All in all a very god way to spend a few hours.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ronin 1998 being one of the late John Frankinheimer's final films before his passing is a much improved formulaic film to the disastrous turnout of the Marlon Brando led Island of Dr Moreau. The story contains a McGuffin being a plot device that the characters want very much but the audience cares little or nothing about. The device of Ronin is a boxy Metal Case with contents unknown. At the same time the film's title draws its name to the similarities of the leads....The Ronin were ancient Japanese Samurii warriors without Masters to serve. Mercenaries. Our film contains a group of former spooks of multiple nationalities turned freelance mercenaries without a master aka a Country to serve. Sam Vincent Gregor and Deidre plus a handful of others whose names are unimportant. For this movie our hodgepodge of Ronin are hired by parties unknown accept that they have Irish andor Russian connections for reasons unknown to capture a case whose contents remain unknown in possession by French gangster whose reasons for possessing the case remain unknown. The Ronin do their homework and manage to snatch the case after hairraising car chases and violent gun battles. But then the double cross begins and a new chase both literally and figuratively ensues for the now split Ronin the recapture the case and send it on its way to its unknown Desiree.For all its splendor and suspense Ronin still lacks a clear direction to follow. Clearly Frankenheimer's direction was utilizing a Hitchcock McGuffin the case to explore the characters. However the script lacks a real clear direction for any of the characters perhaps thats why the title was named Ronin. Despite all their combined acting talents and prestige Robert De Niro and company all come across as dry characters. All are basically amoral and suspicious of their fellows. The audience really has no like or dislike of what constitutes the good guys from the bad ones. None really show passion towards the Case beyond its perceived monetary rewards which is what they are trying to obtain. Unfortunately the McGuffin fails in this film because the audience really cares more about the case than the characters. As if the Case itself had a personality and history. Clearly the Case's contents are of high value given all the trouble and time that the higherups are paying to get it. However what the movie lacks inward looking makes up for in high stakes stunts car chases and gunfights that makes the viewer more interested in the momentary safety of both the supposed good and bad guys. Well done on that part.In an otherwise typical Hollywood way of illustrating things for the audience to understand better occurs about 23 of the way in the movie after Sam performs surgery on himself at the old man's house in the Mountains. This man had a hobby of designing and building dioramalike miniature sets of legendary battle scenes complete with handcrafted characters in proper attire. On this particular day he was designing scenes of Japanese Feaudal Samuri and he began a little monologue about how certain warriors who lost their masters were known as Ronin. In a sense he compared these ancient feudal warriors to the freelance spooks of the movie. This is how the filmmaker's tied the film's title to the film which would otherwise be called something like Hire then Betray then DiePossible spoilers below. On a footnote at the movies conclusion during the little coffee shop scene between Sam and Vincent a reporter mentions in a sound only byte that some new twist had occurred concerning peace negotiations in Northern Ireland...suggesting that the case's contents contained some sort of instrument of negotiation that the parties involved need to help in the peace negotiations...what that could be I couldn't tell you.Provided you can look past the desire to learn about whats in that ubiquitous case Ronin is a film that any action fan will rave about but mystery fans might find a little lacking. My opinion...I enjoyed it but still left wanting to know more about the case and why all the destruction and death to get it when the characters themselves had no desire to keep it permanently.".

DeNiro and Reno had a great chemistry and some of the chase sequences especially the last car chase scene one of the best filmedcoordinated I've ever seen. The supporting actors were great there were plenty of devious doublecrosses and the like as well. The basic plot is as follows There is a group presumably IRA which is looking to steal something important. They hire a group of criminalsexoperatives to do a job in return for exorbitant pay. DeNiro's character Sam is mysteriousalthough he seems to be some sort of exoperative. Needless to say his true origins do not become clear until much later in the film. The remainder of the gang members also have shady backgrounds. They are tasked with finding a specific package which their employing shadow group covets. However once they have the package greed takes over and the group begins to break down as order and allegiances quickly dissolve. What results is some compelling action as Skaarsgard Gregor turns out to be DeNiro's antithesis another exoperative from the other side. As I mentioned before the camerawork in the chase scene is outstanding and as far as I know very original. I have never seen anything like it before or since.I thought it was a highly entertaining movie and well I'm a huge DeNiro fan. If you're in the mood for an entertaining crime film with a twist or three then go rent this. You won't be disappointed.".

	schema:reviewBody "Robert De Niro gets a chance to shoot off more than his mouth in director John Frankenheimer's Ronin a firstclass fastpaced offbeat international suspensethriller about a mysterious suitcase that has costars Jean Reno Jonathan Pryce Stellan Skarsgrd Natascha McElhone and Sean Bean squeezing triggers first and worrying about questions afterward in modern day France. If you are searching for comparisons Ronin huddles alongside rawedged Quentin Tarantino classics like Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction as well as the Michael Mann masterpiece Heat in a lineup of crime thrillers. Indisputably a cynical streetwise bluecollar crime caper Ronin qualifies as De Niro's most visceral actioneer since the mobrelated Martin Scorsese saga Goodfellas. Audiences who demand that their movies neatly laceup all leftover plot strings before fadeout may hate Frankenheimer's penchant for realism in storytelling.Clearly Ronin is a postCold War thriller. Neither patriotism nor propaganda motivates the exCentral Intelligence Agency operative known only as Sam and the former KGB agents with whom Sam swaps lead in this crisp hardheeled melodrama about lethal secrets and lost illusions. A shady lady with obvious IRA connections Deirdre Natascha McElhone of The Truman Show hires a diverse team of former spies and terrorists to seize a hot suitcase that the Russians the Irish and others want to buy. De Niro ramrods this covert cabal as Sam a reticent professional who evades questions about his past. You can tell that Sam knows his business in the first scene when he cases a bar before he enters it and stashes a pistol outside near the back door should he require a rapid exit. Joining him are Vincent Jean Reno of Le Femme Nikita the scourger who can lay his hands on anything Larry Skipp Sudduth of Eraser the getaway car driver Spence Sean Bean of GoldenEye a flaky English weapons whiz and Gregor Stellan Skarsgrd of Insomnia a wizard with electronics.Written by Witchblade's Z.D. Zeik and Richard Weisz playwright David Mamet's pseudonym Ronin deplores artifice. The scenarists reveal only what audiences need to know. This heist caper does things that audiences either will hate or are not accustomed to in Hollywood films. For example De Niro does not get the dame Deirdre at fadeout. The most that our chief protagonist gets out of her is a couple of hugs and kisses during a makeout scene. Essentially there are two kinds of thrillers. First those where the innocent bystanders never acquire so much as a scratch and second those were they die. In Ronin innocent bystanders are victims. They get shot at or smashed up. The heroes get shot up themselves despite their bulletproof vests too.Some things in Ronin are left up in the air. One apparent main character exits early in the action but not in a shower of blood like Janet Leigh's premature departure in the Alfred Hitchcock classic Psycho. Instead Spence gets booted off the job because he cannot measure up to their standards. Meanwhile like Pulp Fiction never divulge what is in the suitcase. Veteran director John Frankenheimer has a knack for staging urban shootouts and car chases through crowded Parisian streets. When the characters scramble for their cars and careen recklessly down narrow claustrophobic streets you want to grip the arms of your chair. Even if you walk out of Ronin unhappy with the ending you cannot say that this spirited thriller did not keep you glued to your chair by the seat of your pants during the superb action scenes.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is undoubtedly my all time favourite film. It has everything I like in it. Great plot characters action acting script cinematography direction and of course the locations. This film has combined all these aspects into a monster of a movie.The plot is great as it has narrative but only gives you what Sam De Niro knows about what he's doing. The audience is purposefully being kept at arms length so that they are constantly thinking about what is coming next? What does this mean? And of course the most important question what is in the case? The plot itself is not overly complex. An Irish separatist group want a case which is being sold to the Russian Mafia and they hire spies who no longer have jobs since the Cold War ended to get it for them. However the relationships between characters and the plot twists make for a movie that is filled with intrigue and themes. So the plot ranks at 810.The script is very solid. It is a no nonsense script which contains good lines from different cultures. It has American sayings British phrases Irish mannerisms French touches and even a little bit of a German directness for the appropriate characters. It has some good interactions in it. Vincent and Sam have some of the best exchanges as do Sam and Spence Bean. Script gets a rating of 910.The characters don't seem complex at first but they are very different and very threedimensional. Each character seems to have am untold back story that has made them who they are. The relationship between the characters counts for a lot especially the ones between Sam Deirdre McElhorne and Vincent Reno. So the characters rate at 810 as well.It has a unique cast the likes of which rivals 'Heat'. De Niro Reno Skarsgard Bean McElhorne Price and Lonsdale are some of the best in the business and they are all on the top of their game in this picture. To give you an idea of what to expect I regard the scenes where it is just Reno and De Niro to be ten times better than Paccino and De Niro in 'Heat' which is arguably the greatest Thrilleraction movie ever made. Lonsdale is the icing on the cake of this films cast Reno De Niro and Skarsgard provide most of the cake ingredients but Lonsdale is just class. So the Cast is 1010 Frankenheimer achieved perfect acting with his cast as well as brilliantly composed shots done with Robert Fraisse and a good challenging narrative. The car chases surpass the racing scenes from his 'Grand Prix' and there is some of the best acting we have seen from one of his casts in this film. 1010 for him as well.Each shot in this film is a work of art. The smooth steadycam shots the perfect composition of the close ups when introducing the characters and the various shots achieved during the car chase scenes all look fantastic. The cinematographer Robert Fraisse did a fantastic job working with the very visual John Frankenheimer who never received the plaudits he deserved. 1010 for the photography.The action is immense. The gunfights and car chases all look sublime. No CGI in the action sequences either it's either stunt men or the actors and its looks so fluid. The car chases make ever other car chase seem obsolete and the gunfights aren't half bad either. But the car chases are the high point of the action of the film and must be seen to be believed. The action gets a 1010 rating from me. The locations in Paris Nice and Arles add a subliminal beauty to the film. The helicopter shots give the audience a nice view of the brilliant architecture and charm of French cities. The layout of the cities also makes the car chases interesting as the streets are very narrow and filled with sharp turns. The look of the buildings does the most for the films look though. The stone buildings give a sense of age that goes along with the retired intelligence officers. This is the first Hollywood action movie to be shot in France and special rights were given to the crew so that the film industry in France would boom. The locations collect a solid 1010.Due to all these factors Ronin becomes a classic espionage film that will be difficult to surpass. The car chases are truly phenomenal. This is a must see film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Watching Ronin is like going 25 years back in time. The European locations the cold and cynical characters the deliberately ambiguous and serpentine plot the car chases the treachery.... all these are the standard ingredients of those twisty spy flicks that were tenapenny in the late '60s and early '70s. And who better to direct this retrothriller than John Frankenheimer the man behind such genre masterpieces as The Manchurian Candidate and Seven Days In May?A group of mercenaries gather in a Parisian warehouse. They don't know each other and they don't particularly know why they've been summoned.... other than the fact that they're about to be offered a job worth a considerable amount of money. Among the group is Sam Robert De Niro an American ronin the name once given to masterless Japanese samuraiwarriors who used to wander across the land offering themselves as hired swords. Others include Frenchman Vincent Jean Reno English weapons expert Spence Sean Bean East European electronics specialist Gregor Stellan Skarsgard and ace driver Larry Skip Sudduth. The team has been brought together by Irish revolutionary Deidre Natascha McElhone who eventually reveals to them that their task is to get hold of a mysterious silver briefcase. They are not told what is in the briefcase merely that if they want to get their hands on their money then they must steal the said briefcase from a team of ruthless agents currently guarding it.Throughout its running time Ronin keeps its plot very secretive even at the end we never learn WHAT was actually in the briefcase. In some ways this makes the story intriguing but it also causes a certain degree of dissatisfaction as many of the loose ends are still left untied as the final credits roll. De Niro gives a game performance as the morally complex hero and Reno backs him up splendidly in yet another of his charismatic slightly villainous roles. The big revelation is McElhone a relative newcomer who holds her own with all these powerhouse stars without looking at all daunted. The action is excitingly shot especially the film's regular car chases and shootouts. It's nice to see genuinely hairraising stunt work being used to achieve the effectiveness of these action sequences as opposed to the usual '90s dependency on digital trickery. Check out also the amazing scene in which De Niro has to cut a bullet from his own stomach using a mirror and a sharp knife! While Ronin might be a throwback to the films of yesteryear with a story every bit as murky and cloakanddagger as the old films it resembles it still comes across as an enjoyable and pacy piece of entertainment.".

The film follows an American exCIA spook Sam and a French mercenary Vincent as they are recruited along with a German exKGB agent named Gregor a British military man named Spence and another American named Spence. An Irish femme fatal Deirdre tells them about their mysterious mission to seize a case from some French gangsters before it can be sold to the Russian Mafia.The case is what Alfred Hitchcock called a McGuffin something the characters want but the audience doesn't care about. And whatever it is people seem to think it's of great importance. Whoever has the case has control of the situation.Spence proves to be a wimp at the job and is given an severence pay before walking away. Then in the impressive takedown where the case is seized in transit Gregor turns out to be a turncoat working for the Russians. But this is a difficult place to be for him since they want him dead just as much as the Irish do.Deirdre for her part is covering for a cruel IRA man named Seamus. Everyone has a reason not to trust their fellow man and shootouts and exhilarating chase sequences ensue.This was something of a precursor to the more recent Jason Bourne movies in style although since no one is working at the CIA we don't have the jumpy editing. But it certainly has equal or even superior chases to the Bourne movies.Robert De Niro is good as the wisecracking Sam. Jean Reno is even better as his comrade Vincent. Stellan Skarsgard is sinister but also a little sympathetic. NAtascha McElhone and Jonathan Pryce English and Welsh respectively play the two Irish characters whose accents are pretty good. Pryce is menacing in one of his more sadistic roles.Overall a good movie. There is of course some suspension of disbelief involved. But the way that Frankenheimer melds the environment to make it seem realistic it's easy to let it slide.".

	schema:reviewBody "Frankenheimer's back in Paris where he triumphed more than 30 years earlier with The Train. This time he has New York Bob DeNiro some shadowy Irishmen that's a new one Russian mobsters  an overlying Japanese motif. Provacateuse Deirdre McElhone assembles exCold Warriors who are at loose ends to do a single job retrieve a case from several men who will be intent on preventing us. The crew includes French scrounger Vincent Reno American driver Larry Sudduth English gunman Spence Bean Russian computer whiz Gregor Skarsgard  American tough guy Sam DeNiro. This talented crew is as trustworthy as soldiers garrisoned in a Bangkok brothel but lurking behind them are Irish nationalist fanatic Seamus Pryce  Russian kingpin Mikhi Atkine. Frankenheimer's use of the case as a McGuffin as Hitchcock described a material object used to cement the plot is too hamfisted to be effective in a fulllength film especially one as long as this. Once again we see why Hitchcock's old thrillers hold up so well today. But Frankenheimer's combination of action dialog  character development remains unique  as enjoyable as ever especially since he gets fine actors  makes them deliver. The streetwise New Yorker Sam should probably not have been believable as a sophisticated but haunted exCIA agent sort of a cross between Casablanca Rick  The Equalizer. But DeNiro's mastery of his craft is up to the considerable challenge. Most of the rest of the cast is fantastic and with a better plot might have been legendary. Standing out are Reno's wry Frenchman Everyone is your brother 'til the rent comes due Bean's nervous blowhard  Skarsgard as the slick steely ruthless Russian bookworm. McElhone is a oneofakind winner as the handler of the headstrong toughguy crew. Deidre is strong  competent but far from cold dedicated but not naive mysterious but not vague at her ease in pearls or behind the wheel of a getaway car. The tale of the 47 Ronin an old favorite of Asian lit professors provides the theme of outofwork Cold Warriors who have no place in society  must remain slaves to their training  experience no matter how tragic the consequences. The reallife proliferation of warsonterror  their selfdescribed experts  security specialists even before 911 renders this theme ironically implausible. Scenes where the characters discuss this depressing state of affairs are almost unbearably boring dragging down the second half. As with most thrillers of recent years the plans realized by DeNiro  crew are too complicated  violent to work relying heavily on advanced weaponry  electronics. They are just excuses to set up spectacular action scenes. But when has Frankenheimer ever let us down in that department? High production values permit TWO fantastic car chases in addition to several other gripping convincing bustups. Frankenheimer has remained immune to the overthetop bloodbaths of Tarantino the cartoon silliness of Lucas  Spielberg  the blowdried stylishness of Michael Mann. His action draws the viewer in without trying to induce sympathy laughter or vomiting. With a more coherent story  more convincing theme Ronin might have been one of the greatest films ever. As it is Ronin is an exciting enjoyable thriller if you don't think too much.".

Provacateuse Deirdre McElhone assembles exCold Warriors who are at loose ends to do a single job retrieve a case from several men who will be intent on preventing us. The crew includes French scrounger Vincent Reno American driver Larry Sudduth English gunman Spence Bean Russian computer whiz Gregor Skarsgard  American tough guy Sam DeNiro. This talented crew is as trustworthy as soldiers garrisoned in a Bangkok brothel but lurking behind them are Irish nationalist fanatic Seamus Pryce  Russian kingpin Mikhi Atkine. Frankenheimer's use of the case as a McGuffin as Hitchcock described a material object used to cement the plot is too hamfisted to be effective in a fulllength film especially one as long as this. Once again we see why Hitchcock's old thrillers hold up so well today. But Frankenheimer's combination of action dialog  character development remains unique  as enjoyable as ever especially since he gets fine actors  makes them deliver. The streetwise New Yorker Sam should probably not have been believable as a sophisticated but haunted exCIA agent sort of a cross between Casablanca Rick  The Equalizer. But DeNiro's mastery of his craft is up to the considerable challenge. Most of the rest of the cast is fantastic and with a better plot might have been legendary. Standing out are Reno's wry Frenchman Everyone is your brother 'til the rent comes due Bean's nervous blowhard  Skarsgard as the slick steely ruthless Russian bookworm. McElhone is a oneofakind winner as the handler of the headstrong toughguy crew. Deidre is strong  competent but far from cold dedicated but not naive mysterious but not vague at her ease in pearls or behind the wheel of a getaway car. The tale of the 47 Ronin an old favorite of Asian lit professors provides the theme of outofwork Cold Warriors who have no place in society  must remain slaves to their training  experience no matter how tragic the consequences. The reallife proliferation of warsonterror  their selfdescribed experts  security specialists even before 911 renders this theme ironically implausible. Scenes where the characters discuss this depressing state of affairs are almost unbearably boring dragging down the second half. As with most thrillers of recent years the plans realized by DeNiro  crew are too complicated  violent to work relying heavily on advanced weaponry  electronics. They are just excuses to set up spectacular action scenes. But when has Frankenheimer ever let us down in that department? High production values permit TWO fantastic car chases in addition to several other gripping convincing bustups. Frankenheimer has remained immune to the overthetop bloodbaths of Tarantino the cartoon silliness of Lucas  Spielberg  the blowdried stylishness of Michael Mann. His action draws the viewer in without trying to induce sympathy laughter or vomiting. With a more coherent story  more convincing theme Ronin might have been one of the greatest films ever. As it is Ronin is an exciting enjoyable thriller if you don't think too much.";

I don't think it's quite fair to criticize it for what it is not such as saying that it's a poor film because there are movies out there with better car chases.I saw it at the theatre and thought it was OK saw it on video expecting to be more disappointed and actually liked it better the second time.I don't think the plot is as difficult to understand as some might claim. I had no trouble following it. Whether or not it's credible well how many action films are? It's credible enough for me to watch it and not say is this ever stupid. That's about all that I look for in an action film sorry to say.I actually enjoyed the dialogue for the most part. DeNiro and Reno in particular were solid. The film did begin to fade towards the end especially once everyone was in the skating arena. I appreciated Frankenheimer showing as much of France as he did. That was a bonus.So yes I could point to a number of flaws in Ronin. But perhaps because of my low esteem for action films overall I would say it's a worthwhile watch if you're an action fan or a DeNiro fan as I am.".

One thing I've always enjoyed here from the first time I saw this movie is it features the best and longest! car chase scene I've ever seen on film.But the movie is far more than just spectacular car chases there are two incredible ones not just the one noted above.. It offers an interesting story that remains interesting with each viewing. That's because it's a bit confusing a la Mission Impossible so each time you see it you figure more and more out. There also are tons of twists to this crime story.It also features a wonderful international cast American Robert De Niro Frenchman Jean Reno Britain's Sean Bean and Natascha McElhone both of whom are better playing Irishmen as they do here and Swede Stellan Skargsgard. All of them are topflight actors as you know. As a bonus I get to see Olympic skating champion Katarina Witt from Germany.eAlso it's directed by John Frankenheimer a man who makes some of the most entertaining films I've ever watched. Speaking of watching De Niro and Reno are my two favorite guys to watch in this thriller. The French scenery  rural and urban  is also terrific. The action is not overdone and the only scene in the film I didn't care for was the gruesome one in which a bullet is taken out of De Niro. It's just too detailed and unpleasant to view but with a DVD can be skipped rapidly.The soundtrack also is outstanding. The Chinese instrument that plays here and there is fantastic. I've heard it before in a couple of Yanni concerts.This is a high quality crime movie and is very highly recommended. This was the first DVD I ever bought in 2000 and I couldn't have gotten by DVD collection off to a better start!".

Of course there were perhaps 7 or 8 anonymous reviews. Of the 70 reviews 50 or more made reference to the chase scene. Between 80 and 90 percent of those comments were basically positive. Although Robert De Niro and Jean Reno were the only two actors in the film who definitely had more onscreen time than Natascha McElhone Dierdre the chase car driver from HELL! around 20 reviewers commented on other actors whose onscreen time wasn't half that of hers. Only 6 or 7 chose to mention her at all! Probably more reviewers sited Katarina Witt's 3 or 4 minute cameo spot! Of course she was much more scantily clad than Ms. McElhone! Finally out of 50 or so who did talk about the chase scenes ONLY ONE linked McElhone to them directly! Amazingly paraphrasing here the reviewer's words The car chase scenes are very authentic. Except that Natascha McElhone looks like she has never driven fast in her life! Well all I can say is after having screened the scene at least a dozen times it seems to me that this reviewer was watching a different RONIN! Some might argue that THELMA  LOUISE had car chases. These were all together different because the movie revolved entirely around its title characters. In RONIN nobody seems to make a big deal out of the fact and it is actually Dierdre's boss who pointedly barks at her YOU DRIVE! Is there a lesson to be learned here?

More than anything else RONIN provides an utterly believable inside track on the postCold War mercenary and the shadowy detached world he inhabits reminiscent of the insider's glimpse of realworld spies offered in the classic The SPY WHO CAME IN FROM THE COLD. If it's John Woo style Action films that make your day...You'll probably find RONIN much too realistic too cerebral too noir and too explosionless for your tastes! On the other hand if you like your Action movies well grounded in reality RONIN is a near classic antiaction antiformula film with a most refreshing European aftertaste that you will find quite engrossing and enjoyable! 9 STARS.....ENJOYDISFRUTELA!".

More like frustration and negativity seem to fuel these message boards. Cynicism is alive and well. The knitpickers can make a nice lint blindfold if they choose not to see this movie for what it is entertainment. Like Spielberg Capra and many others the Polish brothers have arrived with a classic piece of storytelling.The Polish Brothers have depth and while it seems it's their glossy turn to make a Hollywood movie they continue with their wit and edge try and spot The Last Supper scene. Look for the homage to The Right Stuff Apollo 13 and Armageddon. The son is named Shepard after the astronaut. And I assume that the daughter is named Stanley after Stanley Kubrick since the Grandpa is named HAL  2001  Space Odyssey. There's definitely an undertone for the hardcore Polish brothers fans. The dialogue alone is worth the price admission. Of course you'll need to suspend your disbelief for a story that seems so far fetched a man launching himself into space although I have read of 2 rocket men who have attempted this same idea but every time you walk into a movie theater you have to surrender some logic. Just the fact it's called a movie should tell you something before you purchase the ticket.It's unfortunate that most reviewers feel like victims and have a need to share their boredom. I can imagine this movie not doing good with men who have lost their inspiration or desire. My brother in fact didn't like this movie because he said it wasn't possible. I don't remember him having this much trouble with E.T. or Forest Gump. My brother gave up his dream of being a writer he now teaches high school drama. I debated with him over the fact this movie is also metaphorical and it's about everyones dream. That is why the rocket is named The Dreamer because everyone is dreamer or has a dream they're building. This movie really shook up my brother and his dislike of this movie should motivate him.I enjoyed this movie so much. I was able to bring my dad kids and husband and that in itself is a triumph and the filmmakers should be awarded for that.9 out of 10 stars only because I am keeping one star for my dream.".

Bruce Dern's role as Fermer's fatherinlaw is disappointing. For a while it's unclear as to exactly who he is in relationship to the family.The Astronaut Farmer pretty decent if you can suspend your disbelief a little. The science of launching a rocket from an old wooden barn without burning down the barn is rather ah... questionable at best. However this is not a movie about science it is a movie about people.This film is pretty heavy on the relationship angle my 9 year old daughter was bored during large sections and getting ancy. Finally there were some good action scenes and she got interested again. I'd say children under the age of 12 wouldn't be very interested in this movie but there isn't anything inappropriate. No sex drugs or violence and very mild language.If you're just going for the entertainment value it's wonderful. It has some great laughs especially a dig on the CIA's ability to locate weapons of mass destruction. And it has a hilariously accurate running commentary on smalltown life. If you've ever lived in a small town I mean a really small town it is a riot.The Astronaut Farmer will probably remind you of the 1979 madeforTV familynight miniseries Salvage 1 about a junkyard owner who builds a rocket from parts in his salvage yard. This one is far better even if it does have enough similarities to make you wonder if it's a smarter cleaner remake.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this wonderfully charming family movie tonight at a free preview in Washington DC.The Polish brothers and the Warner Brothers taking a cue from Walden Media have hit the family movie sweet spot with this fun engaging film. I'm giving it an 8 on the basis of pure solid family entertainment value.If this movie were a car it would probably be a Toyota CamryAt the start of the screening Billy Bob Thorton proudly and accurately IMHO characterized this film as a feelgood Frank Capraesque popcorn flick  the sort of film that would have been on the A side of a double bill back in the days of his youth.Billy Bob and Virginia Madsen do terrific jobs with their characters. I think the timelessly beautiful Ms. Madsen is particularly effective as Farmer's patient loving and somewhat exasperated wife.and if I were Stephen Colbert interviewing Billy Bob Thorton I would probably ask this question  Virginia Madsen hot costar or the hottest costar?.The story and the arc of the film bring strong elements of Field of Dreams and October Sky to mind but absent the mysticism of the former and the somewhat dysfunctional family dynamics of the latter. As a large tasty helping of pure western Americana I don't doubt for a minute that this film will be a huge hit in Japan.This movie pays light homage to films like The Right Stuff and Apollo 13. Space fanatics rocket scientists and other members of the pocketprotector crowd might experience a few oh please you've got to be kidding moments but because of its charm likable characters and strong acting this movie requires a lot less disbelief suspension than a film like oh I don't know let's say Armageddon for example.Speaking of babyboomer asteroid wranglers I was also pleasantly surprised to see Bruce Willis in a small but key supporting role. I think it's really great when skilled immensely watchable actors lend their talents to bright young film makers. At the QA after the film it was revealed that Bruce took the role as a favor to the Polish brothers and that he essentially worked for free. It was nice of him to do that.All of the other members of the wellcasted supporting ensemble including some young members of the Polish tribe delivered solid performances as well.I won't give you a synopsis of the film here others are better than me at that sort of thing but I will tell you that I plan to take my wife and 4 7 and 12 year old kids to see this film for the pure joy of watching a fun happy and slightly quirky movie together as a family.".

The thematic content I believe was appropriate for someone as young as her but I might not bring a younger child to this movie. There were about 56 swear words but she didn't even pick up on them. Billy Bob Thornton did a great job in this movie. Bruce Willis' cameo really was nice. The movie was slow in a few parts. The grandfather's role wasn't totally clear to me and some of the comedic parts seemed a bit forced. Overall I enjoyed this movie quite a bit.".

	schema:reviewBody "I think you can pretty much gauge whether you're going to like this film by deciding whether you think these lines Farmer's thoughts during a funeral are goodThere are no stop signs up there. There is no defining space. We have always defined our space. A wall here a room there. A hallway a road. We have this way of dividing our space until it equals a direction. We even created a space for the dead. Space is a difficult thing to grasp.To me they read just like Bush speaking off the cuff where he's got an idea he wants to take a stab at but doesn't bother trying to or perhaps can't put the stab into coherent form. Here the writer clearly wanted to connect the funeral with outer space somehow and just figured any old combination of words would do.I really liked the part during the credits when Farmer is on the Leno show. That seemed so real that I almost thought Billy Bob Thornton himself had ridden a rocket into space. I'm assuming that was improvised. Good job Billy Bob! I also like what Farmer said to the guy appraising his property. But that's it. To me this is a textbook example of a movie make by people who think that movies are commodities. I could go on and onthere are examples of bad movie throughoutbut here is just a small selectionI've got this theory that a movie gets to feed you one impossible to swallow thing and still be good or great even. But that thing has to be mitigated as much as possible and you don't get to include a second impossible to swallow thing. I'm gullible enough to buy the premise of one guy sending himself into orbit. But with just his 15 year old son for technical help? I don't think so. I'd prefer they had a team of engineers but if it's gotta stay within the family at least make the kid older maybe a 22 year old engineer. And have Farmer consult with some technical people occasionally. It would take hardly anything away from his achievement. And if you're going to sell the idea of 1.5 people building a huge rocket you've got to convey the incredible amount of work involved. They say he works on it a lot but jeez show us a montage of him working or him being too exhausted or sleepy to move or something.Why am I supposed to like this guy? He puts his family at risk of complete financial ruin after seeing what that did to his father. He rents or buys a carnival ride to put on the property for the kids to play with when there is literally no money for groceries. He throws a brickhardat his friend who works in a bank. The first time he launches his wife in their house and unaware is so close that the windows explode all around her. He doesn't warn the crowd hanging out outside his ranch comes within feet of killing them then doesn't express regret or warn them the second time. He carelessly loses his wedding ring and doesn't give a rip or spend time looking for it and he has a surprising amount of free time even though it bothers his wife. And he yanks his kids out of school for a month to help him Tell me those little girls are going to be of any use beyond bringing him sandwiches and lemonade. And there's talk about how what he's doing is for the whole family but he seems to be in it completely for himself. For example he's not shown taking any photos to share later.Getting access to fuel is the main thing holding him back the other being permission to launch. When he gets the idea for an alternative fuel he tells his son we got all the stuff right here in the barn by which apparently he means a rocketful of fuel components because you never see anything delivered. Then to get fuel for the second launch he uses the tired guydressedlikehim ploy to send all of the people surveilling his place on a wild goose chase so the tanker can just drive right in unnoticed. Sure I believe that would work just fine.When they're building the second ship you hear an audio montage of technical talk to convince you that they're well doing technical stuff. They slip in an overlyobvious Oxygen could last three times longer than needed. But let's not put that to the test. Smooth writers Polish! Then in the event Farmer stays up in orbit way more than three times the planned amount and does just fine.Virginia Madsen who overacts in the film BTW brings home money from the bank to build the second rocket apparently in cash in a paper bag like she stole it. And in the span of one gesture the light switches from midday to sunset something you can't avoid noticing. Why didn't they fix that?Tell me that crash wouldn't have killed Farmer really really dead no matter how good his capsule protection was. I'm tired of films with a technical aspect making tons of gross errors that would bother an average 8th grade science student. Why the writers don't consult an 8th grade science student to patch that up is beyond me but I'd bet that if I were to point the errors out to them they'd say something like This isn't a film about science. It's a film about how 'Families is where our nation finds hope where wings take dream ' which is an actual Bush quote not a typo. Well it can be about families and dreams and still not yank people out of their suspension of disbelief.Tom".

The emotions are real they are strong and the film is always grounded in the earth. But you are never quite sure where it is going. It will veer into farce then melodrama then social commentary and back again.

It is strange and it is dreamlike and at times it seems to barely make sense but it all works. The audience I was with was enthralled and almost all of them stayed through the end of the credits  a good sign indeed.I can imagine what the highconcept presentation must have been like It's just your typical savethefarm family drama only dad is a . . .Don't tell me.

Throw in some cute kids and we've got ourselves a movie.I'm being cynical of course and this is not a cynical movie. There is not a false note in it in fact the music is perfect the cinematography is firstrate the casting is superb watch for Bruce Dern looking very similar to Doc Brown in the Back to the Future movies. While inspirational follow your dream movies usually don't work for me this one does it has such an amazingly goofy charm that only the stiffest of film critics could resist it and alas according to that wellknown movie review site as I write this just under 40 don't get it. If this movie in not on most 10best lists at yearend it is going to be one heck of a year. I don't know if the film is going to do well. Early box office looks weak but word ofmouth may help. See it in a theater now if you are at all hesitant. This one will be remembered.

	schema:reviewBody "I only considered this because I am a big fan of BillyBob. I expected the film to be full of bad science but I wasn't prepared for the torrent of nonscience and antiscience I got. Certainly filmmakers have licence to take liberties to some extent but I haven't seen anything this ludicrous since Spielberg had ET making a radio transceiver out of a SpeakandSpell.This film is really a venture into nauseatingly Spielbergesque schmaltziness which is guaranteed to make a profit by unfailingly attracting the same gullible folks who gush over the disaster film where the world got destroyed but fortunately the boy and his dog were saved.Launching a rocket from a wooden barn isn't just stupid. The stupidest person on the planet would know that the barn would be incinerated along with all other buildings on the property. In real rocket launches the pad is deluged with millions of gallons of water during liftoff to contain the damage to the massive reinforced concrete structure.Any liquidfueled rocket must be supported by a gigantic cryogenic plant which was nowhere in evidence.Any launch failure resulting in the rocket tipping over would most certainly not culminate in it being launched horizontally to go skimming along the ground for a few miles. What you would get is a massive fireball at about 10000 degrees F.The haphazard reentry firing results in a landing just a few miles from the launch point. How convenient. NASA could only predict splashdown within a 2000 or so square mile area.There are so many more but I would get ill if I went on. This film was made by people who know nothing about science for people who know nothing about science. There are certainly enough of those going by the proportion of gushing reviews seen here.I haven't even gone into how those same people don't seem bothered in the least by the fact that Charlie's dream is just so selfish and inconsiderate. There's nothing noble about pursuing your dream no matter how much it may damage those around you literally and figuratively.There is no way artistic licence can justify portraying science this bad. I believe even Spielberg wouldn't have touched this one and that's saying something. I give it a 2 only because BillyBob managed to get through it without throwing up once.".

	onyx:emotionText "I only considered this because I am a big fan of BillyBob. I expected the film to be full of bad science but I wasn't prepared for the torrent of nonscience and antiscience I got. Certainly filmmakers have licence to take liberties to some extent but I haven't seen anything this ludicrous since Spielberg had ET making a radio transceiver out of a SpeakandSpell.This film is really a venture into nauseatingly Spielbergesque schmaltziness which is guaranteed to make a profit by unfailingly attracting the same gullible folks who gush over the disaster film where the world got destroyed but fortunately the boy and his dog were saved.Launching a rocket from a wooden barn isn't just stupid. The stupidest person on the planet would know that the barn would be incinerated along with all other buildings on the property. In real rocket launches the pad is deluged with millions of gallons of water during liftoff to contain the damage to the massive reinforced concrete structure.Any liquidfueled rocket must be supported by a gigantic cryogenic plant which was nowhere in evidence.Any launch failure resulting in the rocket tipping over would most certainly not culminate in it being launched horizontally to go skimming along the ground for a few miles. What you would get is a massive fireball at about 10000 degrees F.The haphazard reentry firing results in a landing just a few miles from the launch point. How convenient. NASA could only predict splashdown within a 2000 or so square mile area.There are so many more but I would get ill if I went on. This film was made by people who know nothing about science for people who know nothing about science. There are certainly enough of those going by the proportion of gushing reviews seen here.I haven't even gone into how those same people don't seem bothered in the least by the fact that Charlie's dream is just so selfish and inconsiderate.

They said this movie cost 12 million dollars to make and was done as an independent. The movie shows how a family can come together to accomplish a task and achieve a dream even when the full weight of the Gov. comes against them. No matter which side of the political aisle you are on you will find the timely shots at the government funny. This movie will hit all your emotional buttons. Support the INDEPENDENT film makers!

Those who did scoffed and called it stupid. They missed the point.It's full of ludicrous situations and pontificating that is sometimes just laughable. There is no way this event could happen  a guy building a rocket ship in his backyard enabling him to orbit the Earth and actually doing it without someone stopping him and having his 15 yearold as head of mission control! And yes the portrayals of the government men are Hollywood stereotypes. Yet despite the stupidity of this story it was very entertaining but more than that  it was a nice film a feelgood one that made you glad you watched it. I simply viewed this as pure fiction akin to something like Field Of Dreams and totally enjoyed. It also was fanatically filmed. This is a beautifullooking movie. Kudos to David Mullen director of photography.What a nice family too! Boy if all of us could only have such a supporting spouse and great kids like Charles Farmer had in this movie. Despite coming with an eyelash of financially ruining his family his wife sticks with him and his kids all love him greatly and will do anything to help him. Virginia Madsen's plays Charlie's wife Audie. Outside of one fight they are seen in a loving manner. Even cranky old Bruce Dern is a good guy in here playing the grandfather.The film is filled with surprises including a bigname actor Bruce Willis who makes a small appearance. He looked like he enjoyed himself and I'm most viewers share that if they like a nice feelgood family fantasy adventure story. This is good escapism that should leave a smile on your face. Don't dismiss it or overlook it.".

Of course his adorable wife  kids help him along the way and maybe Bruce Willis can join to save the day when the reactor threatens to blow up due to the interference of federal authorities.And of course there will be a sequel to this movie where BB or his son... builds an even bigger rocket to take the whole family to the moon  start a new life there far away from federal hassling. Of course there will be plenty of setbacks along the way but hey  what would life be without a Dream? well...just life perhaps? Imagine the closing shot the Farmer family standing beside their newly erected moondwelling looking up at the beautiful blue earth in the sky. Ma saying thank god we got away from there!

He dreams about going into the inky blackness of space a place he has aspired to reach for a long time. So he sets out building a rocket in his backyard which soon draws the attention of NASA FAA FBI CIA and the press.When you go into Astronaut Farmer be prepared to throw the laws of physics and logic out the window as this one tries to be real but suffers from a few flaws. First the rocket is built in Billy's garage which is made of timber. Timber would incinerate immediately on take off. Good idea? NO! The movie also pulls out the clich handbook and takes an example from every chapter. The looming bad guys the goofy sidekicks the bank's foreclosures the family tension failing now and succeeding later and poor jokes. The movie is entertaining enough but there's something wrong with a movie that's 100 minutes and feels like 2 hours.Would I have purchased tickets to see this? No but I probably would rent it on DVD. It is a good film for the family though so on that level I'd say see it the movie is rated PG. Or just wait until it comes to DVD and rent it for the family then. Fun movie but only worthwhile in a family environment.".

Shame on you Billy Bob and Bruce for not turning down the roles after reviewing the incredibly sappy dialog of this script! I should have gone back to my book after seeing the missile in the Texas barn during the first few minutes. But since one knows that the main character can't possibly die before the end of the movie I felt compelled to watch for a successfullaunch in the overhead monitor while multitasking with a crossword puzzle and other things.

The movie was a very depressing one when you think of the expense and disasters that this man put his family through and the headaches he causes to pursuit a dream which is nothing more than bankrupting his family and sending them to the edge of sanity. Add to that this man cares nothing about bringing the government to his home and totally thinks of himself when confronted with the possibility that his family will be taken away from him and he locked up in the excuse the pun funny farm. Also he pursuits this goal not out a pure desire to see space or to open it up for many people. It is simply for himself and trying to get rid of guilt over leaving NASA and his father's committing suicide. Again this did not inspire me but rather depressed me. There is no grand Americana and there is no ground swell of support it is simply a man against the world which does nothing to bring people to his aid. In moment he threatens murder this is not the kind of inspired leadership that would hope for or expect. If you want to make yourself feel terrible feel angry at the world and your family and basically burn money for no good reason then go see this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've heard of suspension of disbelief before but this is ridiculous! The Astronaut Farmer features one of the loopiest looniest premises ever to grace a mainstream American movie. A middleaged rancher named Farmer you know a movie's heading into seriously pretentious waters when it starts dispensing heavily allegorical names to its characters has decided to fulfill his lifelong dream of flying into outer space. To this end he has singlehandedly constructed a fully functioning rocket that in the real world would require an army of NASA engineers and millions of dollars in government money to put together. Heck for sheer grandiosity and technological ingenuity Farmer's homemade rocket makes Ray Kinsella's backyard baseball stadium look like erectorset kids' stuff in comparison.In a film shamelessly bucking for the feelgood movie of the year stampofapproval Farmer is obviously intended to be an inspirational figure a little man with a Big Dream who is determined to make that dream come true at any and all costs and despite the seemingly insurmountable odds stacked against him. Yet even in a fantasy film the dream has to have some connection with reality some degree of plausibility to make us believe in it to the same extent that the character does. Unfortunately in The Astronaut Farmer we find ourselves more often siding with the derisive skeptics and cynical killjoys from NASA the FBI and the nearby town  who of course are portrayed as the villains of the piece  than with Farmer and his preposterously supportive family who already seem to be living on another planet anyway which tends to negate the need for any such trip in the first place.Indeed questions of mental balance are never far from our minds when we see Farmer well played by Billy Bob Thornton bankrupting his ranch to finance his quest and dragging his 15yearold son and two prepubescent daughters out of school so that they can function as his Mission Control team of experts who are going to be responsible for not only launching him into space but returning him safely back therefrom not too much undue pressure there eh?. And what are we to make of the fact that Farmer is so obsessed with fulfilling his own dream that he's willing to go on this potential suicide mission with the distinct possibility that he will leave his wife a widow and his children without a father? In his reckless disregard for the consequences of his actions Farmer goes well beyond the harmless Quixotic crackpot that the script intends him to be and becomes a genuine threat to the lives and safety of himself and those around him. Even his wife Virginia Madsen who is portrayed as a relatively clearthinking levelheaded pragmatist is really little more than an enabler who instead of putting the brakes on her husband's obvious foolishness encourages him to ever more dangerous heights of certifiable insanity.The actors  Thornton Madsen Bruce Willis Bruce Dern Max Thieriot  do what they can with what they've been handed but the screenplay by Mark and Michael Polish is so filled with sappy aguy'sgottadream inspirational speeches and cuedup musical crescendos that we feel workedover and manipulated from first moment to last. The movie does look terrific however with director Michael Polish and cinematographer M. David Mullen using the wide open spaces of the rural western landscape to impressive effect.I know that we're not supposed to take this movie all that seriously that we are expected to check our credulity at the theater door for the duration of the movie then pick it up on the way back out. But even a fantasy film has to make some sort of reasonable compact with its audience and The Astronaut Farmer asks us to accept far too much on sheer goodwill and faith alone. Yet you know a movie isn't working when instead of rooting for the protagonist to succeed in his adventure you find yourself hoping that some trained licensed professional will step in and perform an intervention on him before he does serious injury to himself and his loved ones.I have been a great admirer of the Polish Brothers' work in the past  Twin Falls Idaho Northfork etc.  but The Astronaut Farmer is a fool's mission that should never even have been brought to the launching pad let alone cleared for takeoff.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Astronaut Farmer At first glance it might seem as though the twin filmmaking brothers Michael and Mark Polish both write while Michael directs and Mark acts have scuttled their inclination toward oddball delights as seen in their previous films Twin Falls Idaho Jackpot and Northfork. True there are only upright Americans in The Astronaut Farmer and none of the conjoined twins professional karaoke singers or wandering angels here that populated their earlier work. Yet even though the Polishes' purview has downshifted from damaged exotics to grassroots individuals their perspective remains refreshingly skewed toward the unusual and uncommon. The Astronaut Farmer could almost be a relic from the golden age of Hollywood an inspirational drama about staying true to one's hopes and ideals no matter the social economic or emotional cost. If we don't have our dreams we have nothing goes the story's underlying refrain  a mantra that might sound like pure cheese were it not delivered with such noteperfect gravity by Thornton who stars as Charlie Farmer. A former astronaut Charlie quit NASA's program when tragedy struck on his family's farm back in Texas New Mexico filled in for Texas during the shoot. However having always wanted to go into space Charlie has taken his cando spirit and built a rocket ship in an empty grain silo on his property. With his 15yearold son Shepherd Theriot as his oneman groundcontrol operation Charlie eventually blasts off much to the government's chagrin. The feds don't seem to want anyone with a modified John Deere and contraband rocket fuel to steal their thunder. Plus the anxieties dredged up by our modern age of terrorism lend an extra edge of suspicion and confrontation to the government's interference in Charlie's affairs. Although The Astronaut Farmer feels something like a throwback to a gentler time what makes the film work is its utter sincerity and perfect command of the overall tone. Madsen as Charlie's wife Audie is equally disarming as the emotional ballast that keeps Charlie and their family afloat. The actors all achieve a certain ingenuous tone that helps sell the movie. It matters little that we have no idea of things like how the farm survives when nobody seems to be working it or why no one balks when Charlie pulls the children out of school to help him with his project. Shot in stunning widescreen by the Polishes' longtime cinematographer M. David Mullen Audie and the others are frequently backlighted to achieve that certain heavenly glow. And Willis turns up as a fellow astronaut in an unbilled role that provides the movie with some bomberjacket cachet. Fans of the Polish brothers and fans of inspirational movies may all depart the theatre scratching their heads The Astronaut Farmer is not exactly the movie any of these viewers expected to see. This is almost always a good thing  even if the movie is a deserved headscratcher.AUSTIN CHRONICLE Marjorie Baumgarten 20070223".

He totally put his family in danger with his bone headed self launch. Why didn't he use the launch escape tower that was right there on top of his spacecraft? This was a launch failure that is what the launch escape tower was designed to do. Pull you away from an exploding or otherwise out of control rocket like he had. This proved to me that he did not belong inside any spacecraft. When his systems failed in orbit he came across as an idiot who did not know what he was doing. I did not see a steely eyed missile man swinging into action. I saw an inept farmer astronaut wanna be whining for his son to come and save him. He built that spacecraft every nut and bolt. He should have been shown confidently swinging into action. Now he finally did fix the problem but that was after an eternity of dumb contemplation as to what to do. Where were the simulations? This movie meant well but I am sorry to have to say it. In my humble opinion the Astronaut farmer is a launch disaster. I do however completely support the idea of civilian like him pursuing space.

Eventually they grab one of their vehicles and find a million dollars worth of gold coins or Krugerrands in the trunk. Later Murtaugh is threatened by the men they're pursuing. That's when the Captain reassigns them to protect a man named Leo Getz who is suppose to testify in a big case. When they get to where Leo is someone tries to kill him and that's when they learn he laundered half a billion dollars worth of drug money. He then takes them to a place he once went to and that's when the people there start shooting at them. Later when they come back with back up they learn that the men work for the South African consulate and have diplomatic immunity. They deduce that they are the ones they were looking for but because of they have diplomatic immunity they can't do anything.";

	schema:reviewBody "Lethal Weapon 2 is the type of sequel you don't screw with for fear of getting seriously beat up if you do. Luckily the praise comes as easily as the film is good  and boy is it good.If you haven't seen Lethal Weapon 1987 get off your computer drop that CheezIt out of your hand rush to your closest video outlet and buy it. If you have seen it then drop that CheezIt out of your hand rush to your closest video outlet and buy the sequel Lethal Weapon 2. It's a real ballbreaker a bruiser the type of film where the heroes get beat up mercilessly but when they get mad boy are they mad and they tear apart everything in their path that is standing in their way. There's a particular shootout scene aboard a docked ship where Riggs Mel Gibson goes on a rampage and really kicks butt with a vengeance.But I think I'm getting ahead of myself.The film opens with a highspeed car chase on a freeway in Downtown LA. Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh Danny Glover are in hot pursuit tearing up Murtaugh's wife's brandnew car as they chase the speeder through an underground tunnel up a bridge and so on and so forth.When they finally catch the speeder they find African gold hidden in the back of his truck. Soon they are being threatened to stay off of the case by African diplomats one of whom Riggs really enjoys annoying. They can't arrest them because of diplomatic immunity so Riggs goes in and shoots up the place where they're staying.Riggs finds himself a new girl Patsy Kensit while Murtaugh protects a federal witness named Leo Getz Joe Pesci a lovable little blabbermouth who likes being one of the cops. He waddles around throughout the film like a little eager puppy ready to do anything he's told. Of course Riggs and Murtaugh pick on him throughout the movie but their friendship is a sort of lovetohate explained in Lethal Weapon 4 1997.What a hard action moviesequel this is. I had heard nothing very positive about this movie until right before I saw it. I sat down watched it directly after I watched Lethal Weapon and realized just how great of a sequel it really is. It's not repetitive  it continues the character progression and friendship seen at the end of Lethal Weapon while at the same time adding a bit more humor than the first film.One of the things I praise about the first Lethal Weapon movie is that the characters didn't just suddenly agree to like each other at the end of the movie like so many films. They gradually learned to trust each other throughout the film adding a sense of true friendship and realism to the film. In Lethal Weapon 2 the friendship between Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh is definitely expanded more to the point where they're best buddies. Most of the time when there is a sequel to a copbuddy film the directors and writers are afraid to continue the friendship. They seem to forget the end of the original film and in the second film the characters hate each other again and the progress of friendship starts all over again. As seen in such films as Another 48 Hrs.But Lethal Weapon 2 is brave  it isn't afraid to continue the story. I think that might be part of what makes it such a great wellrounded series. It never really repeats itself it always seems eager to move forward and ignore the past. The first film was a humorous hard copbuddy film about two opposites learning to trust each other. The second movie is a continuation of their friendship. The third film is almost a fullout comedy. And the fourth film is a tribute to the first three. Darn good filmmaking here.Lethal Weapon 2 is quite possibly one of the best sequels of all time. It avoids repetitions it avoids copbuddy clichs and when it all comes down to it Mel Gibson and Danny Glover and Joe Pesci are such an amazing trio that even if this film did follow the routine procedures I'd still love it. And you can't say that about many movies.".

The chemistry between Riggs Mel Gibson and Murtaugh Danny Gloveris still remarkable. The only thing now is that Riggs is less selfdestructive as he was in the first movie but I guess it's so that in the first he tries to get over the loss of his wife and he somehow has moved on. Not as exciting as the first but still very believable. Some historicalpolitical elements that provides some surprising educational facts are delivered here in the movie that's obscurely mentioned in classrooms. Here it takes aim the the South African apartheid fiasco that ran from 1948 up until 1994 by Nelson Mandela who overturned the government and became President of South Africa putting a stop to apartheid. During it's dying stages the government provided segregated communities to it diverse ethnics and tried to promote theocracy. The South Africans depicted may have been over the top but the political upheaval was executed immaculately. In spite of that cultural reference there's a setback to it as well. I don't understand why did the South Africans killed Riggs' wife and now have targeted his girlfriend. What's up with that? The whole logic was completely null and void and has no logic to it at all. Some editing should have been taken to consideration. It's still an enjoyable film but the first one stands above them all.".

	schema:reviewBody "First of all this movie is almost as good as the original. It retains all of the elements that made the first film so darn entertaining and adds some new elements.As all actors from the first movie appear in the second one as well its pretty clear what you can expect acting wise and surprise surprise The acting is still stellar close to perfection. Mel Gibson is always good and in the second installment of the series he gets to be a little more wild and add even more nuances to the character. For example we get to see Riggs hit on women which adds an entire new side to him as the side we saw in the first film was of him mourning. Also we find out how his wife dies in a beautifully underacted scene if you want to know how she dies you'll have to see the movie. Danny Glover returns as well and he plays the character pretty much as he did in the first film which is good because the character he plays is the one who is not supposed to change. He is meant to be square and combined with the character of Riggs this becomes highly entertaining. However a new element is put into the mix to make it even more entertaining Leo Getz played beautifully by Joe Pesci and is to this day still one of his most memorable characters. He is funny and fast talking but most importantly he is a crook and when you put him together with Riggs and Murtaugh the mix becomes explosive. The main villains are played by Joss Ackland and Derrick O'Connor and they are also good and a bit more developed than the villains of the first movie obviously because they had to focus more on the relationship between Riggs and Murtaugh in the first movie. Riggs' love interest is played Patsy Kensit and she is good if a bit underdeveloped. The story is excellent and is almost better than the story in the first one. It is entertaining and funny and best of all the incredible chemistry between Mel Gibson and Danny Glover is maintained and is almost as good as it was in the first movie. Furthermore the addition of Joe Pesci was a very nice touch because he immediately makes the scenes with him Gibson and Glover even more interesting and entertaining. The plot with the villains is kept relatively simple like in the first film which is good because the goal for the film is entertainment not to be thought provoking.The action of the film is kept in the same style as in the first movie and it is still both exhilarating and entertaining. The effects are still relatively realistic and this of course gives the movie a level of credibility that is sorely needed in many modern action movies.All in all a worthy sequel and an excellent film on its own. 810".

It has all the ingredients I think are essential to making a good action film. The movie most importantly has incredible loud action sequences that have weight because they aren't mired in computer effects or post production trickery and have stunt performers. It also isn't fearful in indulging in violence without being gratuitous. It isn't realistic and there's theatricality but it's not at the two extremes of cartoony blood or PG13 action fast cuts when someone gets shot. It has grit and blood but it's also so alive with great characters.Most importantly are the characters and the acting. This film solves the problem of the first film in having memorable villains. The whole South Africa apartheid villainy is played for all the hate you can project on these goofy characters. Joss Ackland is so delightful. His performance masterfully skates at being just campy enough to get all the smiles you can without going into the ridiculous. But of course the bulk of the praise must go to the leads. Glover and Gibson are so charismatic and likable that the scenes where they drive to the shoot outs are still highly entertaining. I had a ball revisiting this one.".

I think the main reason why in 1989 I couldn't enjoy the ultralame Tango And Cash which came out that year though at the end of the year was because I had seen this earlier and this to me was the real thing. Lethal Weapon 2 is one of those movies that still manages to entertain years after its release. I saw this as a teenager and thought it was the greatest thing ever and even now this is one of my most prized DVDs in my collection. Lethal Weapon 2 is a very exciting movie and when I look at other enjoyable movies that fall in the mismatched buddycop genre Lethal Weapon 1 I Come In Peace Beverly Hills Cop 12 Last Boyscout and Rush Hour Lethal Weapon 2 always stands head and shoulders above the rest indeed it is tied with 48 HRS as my favorite CopBuddy movie off all time. I think the thing that gives this movie that extra enjoyment is that we actually care about characters the acting is very well done and overall it's directed with a brutal punch which back up the action. Also Joe Pesci's comic relief wasn't annoying like it would be in the later sequels in fact his comic timing actually works. This is a great example of genre filmmaking and is a must see for fans of the genre.    out of 4Excellent a must see!".

	schema:reviewBody "A worthy sequel. In fact I think it's a bit of an improvement with tighter plotting and more kinetic action sequences. I also liked to my surprise the addition of Joe Pesci as a witness Riggs and Murtaugh are protecting. Yes he's more than a tad annoying but he's annoying in a mostly funny way. I also very much liked Mel Gibson's love interest played by the cute Brit Patsy Kensit who unfortunately never made it very big. The sequence with the bomb attached to Murtaugh's toilet is classic and the shot with the woman cop getting blown off her diving board is unintentionally hilarious. Also sidesplitting the aging henchman played by Derrick O'Connor who becomes a master of kung fu whenever the shot gets dark enough for a stunt double to take his place.".

Another thing about this movie that i disliked was when Danny Glover so artlessly describes an Afrikaans accent as being shitty! I mean what a slap in the face to the Afrikaans. There's also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit. I mean Mel Gibson's character is like so against the diplomats but then sleeps with their P.A. type! Don't waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film. If you want to see a film that doesn't completely insult a cultural group then rent Die Hard 2.".

I'm probably in the minority but I think this is better the the first movie and is the highlight of the series.I love the chemistry between Gibson and Glover they seem to have a real affection for each other. And they both look like they enjoy playing off Joe Pesci who is a welcome addition to the cast at times it's like watching the three stooges that's a compliment Patsy Kensit looks absolutely gorgeous. The surprise to me is how menacing Joss Ackland was as Arjen Rudd the villain of the movie he is superb.It has a few problems continuity errors and poor stunt doubles but it's well directed well acted with great pacing and the perfect balance of big action and big laughs. Although I'm not sure how I feel about the happier ending than what Shane Black wrote with Riggs dying but without it there would be no Lethal Weapon 3 or 4.With a domestic gross of 147 million Lethal Weapon 2 only Batman and Indian Jones out grossed it was by far the highest hit of Gibson's career.".

I expected a mindless Micheal Bayian action movie and what I got was a really smart interesting and entertaining look at transhumanism the freedom of choice politics and recklessness in corporate leaders.This movie really dives into the question of how a person could live his day to day live with almost all of his body amputated and stuck inside of a machine. So when people complain about the uncomfortable scenes between Murphy and his wife I can only imagine they mean what happened after his transformation and that felt exactly the way it was supposed to!So yes the original is way more graphic and still holds up to this day as a gruesome action flick but this one is smart and interesting and really is a good movie in it's own right.And by no means is it as bad as people say it is!".

I expected a mindless Micheal Bayian action movie and what I got was a really smart interesting and entertaining look at transhumanism the freedom of choice politics and recklessness in corporate leaders.This movie really dives into the question of how a person could live his day to day live with almost all of his body amputated and stuck inside of a machine. So when people complain about the uncomfortable scenes between Murphy and his wife I can only imagine they mean what happened after his transformation and that felt exactly the way it was supposed to!So yes the original is way more graphic and still holds up to this day as a gruesome action flick but this one is smart and interesting and really is a good movie in it's own right.And by no means is it as bad as people say it is!";

	schema:reviewBody "I love Paul Verhoeven's RoboCop from 1987 which remains iconic and I usually don't like reboots. But watching the new one I never got rid of the feeling that the remake is worth it. It is a whole new interpretation that sets the focus on the topics of our time robots drones the human aspect behind the technology media critics war propaganda. I felt the movie has a mission to enlighten people and I liked that. It became even more obvious how much the RoboCop story exists within the topos of Frankenstein which is the story about the human devilment and the lack of respect of life. That's why Padilha gives Murphy more of a face a life and feelings.Beside that the pictures the sound the music is pretty contemporary. You probably have to make some compromises today to get the millions to get the flick done. It won't become iconic but it's the right time for the right message in the right movie.".

There's no distinct feelgood actions scenes because the pacing is kept constant throughout and I don't see why there's an issue with the pacing being that way. It's hardly flat it's just a very honest straight flushed storytelling and it fits the themes that are underscored by the movie. Alex Murphy is a reluctant hero and he's ultimately a father and a husband whose personal agenda serves as his existential core. I like how these themes are teased out and zoomed in upon throughout the movie. Also there are some absolutely delicious production details and CGIs that are just absolutely feasts to the eye. Not to mention the superb cast and the wonderful performances. I think this is a honest and loyal reboot that will appeal to fans of Robocop who fell in love with the story precisely for the moralistic themes it explores.".

	schema:reviewBody "Full disclosure the original Robocop is among my top 5 favorite films of all time and I've easily watched it over 200 times. With that being said I still looked forward to this reinterpretation due to my love of the character whose legacy had already been profoundly tarnished by the redundant first sequel and catastrophically misguided second sequel and my admiration of director Jose Padilha's Elite Squad films as well as his documentaries. Suffice to say I came into the theater with a bias toward wanting the film to succeed.I'm willing to acknowledge that it may be for this reason that I found this film to be a resounding if slightly flawed success. Conversely it is my belief that a large contingent of overzealous fans were hellbent on seeing this film fail therefore had predetermined that the movie was trash. How could it possibly withstand several years of unwavering hatred during its production and be given a fair shot? Judging by the middling 6.7 IMDb rating and the 50 Rotten Tomatoes score many people loathed the film just as much as they'd hoped they would.This viewer simply cannot accept that Robocop 2014 is anywhere near as bad as people are rating it. For starters the film has been bashed mercilessly for idiotically trivial elements such as His hand is human! His suit is black! or worst of all I refuse to support a PG13 version of Robocop. It is my firm belief that all of these criticisms are merely the ravings of closedminded fanboys who are bizarrely searching for the next movie to ruin their childhood. It's a phenomenon that is baffling and absurd. Anyway I rated the film 1010 on IMDb because I wanted the score to weigh heavier in the positive direction. Truth be told I think the film is a solid 8 and may even grow to become a 9 over time. Of course it's not as good as Verhoeven's classic and obviously it's much different in tone. For that I am grateful  part 2 tried so desperately to ape the original that it felt like a rather soulless carbon copy albeit a copy salvaged somewhat by spectacular stopmotion effects and a great villain in Tom Noonan's Cain. I didn't want another movie trying to mimic the satire of the original nor did I feel that anyone could ever oneup the hyperviolence of the 1987 version so why try?There are those that argue that this film should have simply been called something else other than Robocop if it wanted to be so different and I get that...except the bottom line is few studios will ever greenlight a 120 million dollar film without some kind of name recognition. It's a sad truth. But in utilizing the Robocop brand name Padilha was given the funding to acquire a brilliant cast and design cutting edge digital effects. In my opinion a little brand recognition is a fair trade off if it helps the film achieve the look and feel of a highend scifi blockbuster.Anyway I've already babbled several paragraphs longer than I'd intended. The bottom line is you should abandon your preconceptions and watch the movie for what it is a genuinely smart heartfelt and wonderfully acted scifi featuring characters we know and love. What's so awful about that?".

Well it looks like butter it at times tastes like butter but brother it ain't butter. Believe it.The film lacks something and I think I know what it is there is no real villain. Instead of building up a supervillain for Murphy to fight to the death with it toys with different characters as his foe never really committing to one or the other. Kurtwood Smith is an evil son of a gun in the original because he shoots Murphy to pieces. Its up close and personal. In this well the guy that car bombs lame our robotic cop gets about 2 minutes of screen time with very little back story. Frankly you just don't care.The plot seems more concerned about Murphy trying to cope with becoming an amputee and him and his family learning to accept his new circumstances which frankly when you see what he looks like without the armour is just disturbing. Instead of being an awesome action flick you just feel bad for the guy. The reality of the situation is just too harsh in its portrayal and you end up thinking maybe he would be better off dead. Do you want to pay good money to question your ideological values towards quality of life or do you want to see robocop go toe to toe with a man who shot him to s? I know what I'd buy for a dollar. Also on a side note Samuel L. Jackson needs to stop being in films. While his appearance at first is welcome by the end it feels very cheap and unnatural. The antiAmerican war effort message starts to get a little forced down your throat and before you start screaming that I'm a flag loving American I'm a Brit and even I felt the satire was a bit in your face.The film shouldn't upset people too badly it could honestly be much worse and it does have some passable moments with a couple of good nods to the original. Just don't get your hopes too high.".

	schema:reviewBody "The new RoboCop is a surprisingly good and entertaining scifi action  thriller that appeals to the human heart by conveying emotions and the  humanity side of Murphy the main character who eventually becomes the  titled cyborg law enforcer. The film ultimately wins for not trying to  be the original 1987 version. The story of Murphy is similar since  it's a remake but does its own thing to provide something new instead  of retelling the same thing again. The film focuses more on the  development of Murphy's character his initial response to his cyborg  body and relationship with his family making the character more  emotional and relatable to the audience.  The film delves into the meaning of humanity family themes media  influence on public opinion corporate greed capitalism  authoritarianism and corrupt law enforcement authorities. It provides a  brief view of the struggles we might face with machines or digital  surveillance of the future. It also briefly raises the question whether  it's ethical or legal to eliminate the human factor in law enforcement  to reduce crime rates by creating merciless cyborgs or robots to  replace humans.  The action sequences are updated with a higher body count with better  CGI and sound effects making them cooler stylish and more  entertaining than the original. The new black tactical design of  Robocop is found to be acceptable and nice...the updated Robocop is  more agile flexible and stronger compared to the original. However I  personally find the right human hand to be slightly distracting. I  prefer no human hand at all entirely machine except the face  There's quite a lot of credible actors in this film Abbie Cornish Jay  Baruchel James Earle Haley Gary Oldman Michael Keaton and Samuel L.  Jackson all providing decent performances to this remake. Although it's  hardly a groundbreaking film or a masterpiece Robocop is a decent and  satisfying remake that delivers on many levels. There's currently no  plot problems inconsistencies or plot holes found in this film at this  time of writing this review. So it's good enough for a recommendation  to watch it.  Rating 7.510".

	schema:reviewBody "In 2010 acclaimed director Darren Aronofsky THE WRESTLER BLACK SWAN  was originally attached to direct the ROBOCOP reboot. Frankly I  thought he was the right choice to reboot the oncepopular franchise  back in the late '80s. Unfortunately he quits the project and  Brazilian director Jose Padilha ELITE SQUAD ELITE SQUAD THE ENEMY  WITHIN was brought in as his replacement.  WHAT IS IT ALL ABOUT?  When police detective Alex Murphy Joel Kinnaman is critically injured  during a car explosion in front of his home CEO of OmniCorp Raymond  Sellars Michael Keaton sees him as a golden opportunity to make him  feel alive again by turning him into Robocop  a cyborg police  officer which is touted as the future of law enforcement in America.  However OmniCorp doesn't realize that Murphy still has a personal  vengeance in his mind to pursue the criminals who nearly caused him  dead.  THE GOOD STUFF  Like the first two ELITE SQUAD movies director Jose Padilha delivers  the same raw intensity that gives ROBOCOP a quasidocumentary feel to  the action sequences. Even though Padilha utilizes shaky camerawork  at least he doesn't make the scene so wobbly until the viewers unable  to see what's really going on. The special effects are spectacular  while the costume design for the allnew Robocop in a black tactical  body actually looks quite nifty.  SwedishAmerican actor Joel Kinnaman best known in the US for TV's The  Killing delivers an emotionally engaging performance as Alex Murphy  and Robocop while Michael Keaton steals most of the spotlight as the  slimy CEO of OmniCorp Raymond Sellars and Gary Oldman gives a perfectly  restrained performance as the sympathetic Dr. Dennett Norton. Other  minor roles  including Abbie Cornish as Murphy's wife Clara Jackie  Earle Haley as the military tactician Mattox and Samuel L. Jackson as  the media host Pat Novak  are all equally impressive.  MOST MEMORABLE MOMENTS  The brief but intense battle between Robocop and a small army of ED209  during the climactic finale.  THE BAD STUFF  The biggest weakness in this ROBOCOP reboot is Joshua Zetumer's  captivating but bloated screenplay. First of all the story drags too  much with Murphy's personal family matter with his estranged wife Clara  Abbie Cornish and son David John Paul Ruttan. Then there's the  underwritten plot involving Murphy's personal vengeance against Antoine  Vallon Patrick Garrow who is responsible for the car explosion. Even  the socalled social commentary involving the robophobic issue  quoted by Samuel L. Jackson's Pat Novak doesn't really say much that  worth a debate.  FINAL WORDS  While the new ROBOCOP is far from a genre classic by any means at  least Jose Padilha's version isn't as bad as most people might have  expected. Just put your mindset of the Paul Verhoeven's original 1987  version aside and treat this as an entirely new movie altogether.".

Yes film is more of a personal struggle journey of the main character and that is what I like. For the fans of action it is also good why when quite often there is it is good one.

Yes film is more of a personal struggle journey of the main character and that is what I like. For the fans of action it is also good why when quite often there is it is good one.

	schema:reviewBody "With Hollywood at a loss to make original movies it was inevitable that the Robocop franchise would eventually get the reboot. In 1987 the original Robocop became an instant box office hit with its mixture of witty satire and over the top violence as well as top notch acting by Peter Weller Kurtwood Smith and Ronny Cox the deciding factor in what made that movie so fresh at the time was the addition of Dutch director Paul Verhoeven who seemed to understand what the audience at the time needed a high tech cyborg artfully designed by special effects whiz Rob Bottin and its robotic suit would become a cinema icon who fought crime in a near future world overwhelmed by greed hypocrisy corruption and excessive almost cartoonish violence.In this reboot the studios were able to acquire the services of Brazilian director Jose Padiha who directed Elite Squad and its sequel two intense police thrillers set in his native Brazil but unfortunately they forgot to give him a good script to work with there were rumors during production that Padiha had a lot of ideas that were nixed by studio bosses. Figures.. The other reason why the original movie also worked was because its R rating worked in its favor the enormous amount of bloodletting added to its satirical view of the future as well as that of American culture which really spoke to the audience. With this reboot aimed at more family friendly crowds the PGrated violence is filmed using rapid jump cuts which makes it totally confusing its like watching a video game on fast forward so that by the time your mind registers what's going on the scene is finished.The movie itself also suffers from pacing problems just when the narrative is about to steamroll forward the scenes abruptly change so that any emotional momentum is lost because there just isn't much characterization of the main parts everything that should have an emotional impact is glossed over by a jump to a new scene with way too much focus on explanations of what the characters are doing so that the audience fails to gain sympathy for anybody.I can't really judge Joel Kinnaman's acting in the title role since there really isn't much for him to do other than walk around in the Robocop suit and utter a few words every now and then he seems to spend too much time bug eyed and in shock more than anything else. The supporting cast also seems wasted with Michael Keaton and Jackie Earle Haley's screen time largely limited to trying to explain whats going on rather than actually doing anything. Even Michael K Williams seems lost as Robocop's sidekick. Patrick Garrow as the heavy is pretty much a cardboard villain compared to the 1987 version with the menacing Kurtwood Smith and his gang of killer psychos. Gary Oldman's performance is pretty much average since he's also got nothing much to do.Alas the biggest disappointment is the movie's absence of any sort of humor the 1987 film had boatloads of wacky commercials that interrupted the narrative yet provided a great view on how that future world was set up as well as crazy sadistic villains and a pun on the name of the chief baddie Dick Jones best name ever. Instead we get snippets of a news media show run by Samuel L Jackson whose presence in this movie is also wasted since he spends more time recapping what we already saw and his jokes fall flat.The only good scene happens right at the beginning with a battle between Iranian insurgents and the robot army but soon after the movie quickly loses momentum and never regains it. Better to skip this one and wait for the rental or better yet watch the 1987 version its way better.".

	schema:reviewBody "It would've been fine that RedoCop abandoned the themes of RoboCop but it didn't even get its own themes right.First there's Sam Jackson's O'Reillyesque character who constantly defends the use of robots overseas. The real problem with American media is that it tries to avoid controversial subjects like drone strikes altogether.Secondly there's the robots' use against foreign civilians. Rather than show Americans the real consequences of drones like innocent and unarmed women and children being shredded and mutilated the robots shoot suicide bombers and even the boy we're supposed to feel sympathy for is trying to attack them with a knife.Third the standins for drones are actual robots. The most heinous thing about drones is that the trigger is pulled by real humans and the targets are decided by our leaders with often little information about what they're attacking.Fourth there's the dehumanization of Murphy. He isn't a dead man brought back as an inhuman monster like the original he's a burn victim benefiting from alreadyexisting cybernetic prosthetics who transforms with a whirl of the camera and some Sinatra. There's no lose the arm moment here. Even as we find out that Murphy has been sapped of his free will Murphy is mowing down CGI robots to rock music like a superhero. There's no real moment when Murphy turns into RoboCop. He's normal at the beginning and just kind of fades into RoboCop mode inexplicably then fades out again just as inexplicably later on.Fifth the drones are supposed to come home but they don't. RoboCop only attacks two criminals before going on the revenge spree we want him to. Detroit is hardly oppressed by his presence.Finally Omnicorp builds RoboCop to get around the law that prevents robots from being used on American soil and spend a lot of money doing so yet they continue to focus on getting the law repealed. Not only that but they actually sway public opinion and get the law repealed in spite of the fact that they promoted RoboCop as a human operator and not a robot. Omnicorp furthermore seems preoccupied with making RoboCop popular with the public and as efficient as a robot but why? Their target market for RoboCop is governmental. It's like Dick Jones said Renovation program! Spare parts for 25 years! Who cares if it worked or not?RedoCop gets much worse when compared to the original film. The original RoboCop looks like a gleaming weapon but the new one looks like he's wearing a black rubber suit. The Omnicorp of the original is an imposing megacorporation filled with nothing but cutthroat suits whereas the face of the new Omnicorp is the avuncular and likable Gary Oldman and leader Michael Keaton who doesn't wear a suit at all. The dark humor is completely gone from this remake and there isn't a single memorable line. There's almost no profanity or blood for this thoroughly PG13 remake either and RoboCop doesn't start patrolling the streets until an hour in.There are only two good things about this movie. It tries to establish a relationship between Murphy and his wife and fails giving us only two scenes of generic wifelove before he's RoboCopped and one after before she spends the rest of the film whining and crying. The other is a scene where we see what's left of Murphy with his robot body removed. He's a head lungs and without reason a dangling hand. Yes a hand and no arm or shoulder. It's the best scene of the movie but like every scene just shows how poorly thought out RedoCop is.Overall RedoCop is a boring and idiotic CGI explodefest meant for children. Take that 13 of ticket money and spend it on the unrated director's cut of the original instead. You'll get far more enjoyment.".

Well it's like they heard me because the second half feels pretty much like the old ones!The script uses actually some of the best concepts of the first two films. Joel Kinnaman does a pretty good job as both Alex Murphy and Robocop. He doesn't manage to steal the impression that Peter Weller made of course but he truly does a good job. I hope we see more of him in the future. All in all to all those who like me had low expectations from this film give it a chance. It's much better than what the abysmal trailers let you think.

I mean  how can  you make a 'RoboCop' movie without excessive violence and blood squibs?  Now that I have seen the movie I can freely say that the PG13 rating  is the least of this movie's problems. Initially I didn't want to  compare the remake to the original I wanted to view it and review it  as a standalone movie. Now that I have seen it I think I'll have to  compare the two movies after all since the remake possesses none of  the qualities that made the original such a classic and by simple  comparison I can easily explain why the remake is an utterly flawed and  ridiculous movie.  The movie opens with a political show called the Novak Element led by  the host Pat Novak Samuel L. Jackson during which we see a news  footage of OmniCorp droids including the famous ED209 and the freshly  introduced humanoid drones called ED208 patrolling and inspecting the  streets of some Islamic state. Novak compliments the droids and then  starts attacking The Dreyfuss Act  a law that forbids the deployment  of such drones in the USA. We are then introduced to Raymond Sellars  Michael Keaton the CEO of OmniCorp who is trying to find ways of  tricking The Dreyfuss Act and start deploying his products in the USA.  He gets the idea of incorporating both man and machine into an ultimate  law enforcement product. We are then introduced to our protagonist   Alex Murphy Joel Kinnaman  who is soon heavily injured in an  explosion and is used as a guinea pig in this newest OmniCorp program.  Like I said before the 'RoboCop' remake lacks everything that was good  in the original movie. First of all there's no worthy satire in the  movie. Society is sometimes mocked through the character of Pat Novak  but the satire isn't very subtle nor intelligent  actually I'd say it  is very primitive and expeditionary. Second of all the nature of  Robocop's character is very different from the original movie he's not  a robot but more a man in a robotic suit and his family plays a  fairly big role in the movie. And I would be perfectly fine with these  changes if the main actor Joel Kinnaman didn't have the charisma of a  paper bag and could as a matter of fact act ! and if Abbie Cornish  who plays the role of Alex Murphy's wife  Clara Murphy wasn't so  irritatingly bland. The revelation of the RoboCop suit and the suit  itself were also poorly done. In one scene Michael Keaton's character  criticizes the suit design that appeared in the original movie by  saying something along these lines the original suit wasn't tactical  enough. Well at least the original suit didn't look like a black  dildo!  The villains in the movie didn't get a much better treatment either.  Among the several villains that appeared in the movie none was  memorable or even remotely interesting. But to be fair not everything  sucks about the 'RoboCop' remake. Some of the acting was OK mostly by  experienced actors like Jackson Keaton and Oldman and the special  effects did look really good. But what's the use of awesome special  effects when the majority of the movie's boring and tedious? Add to all  the aforementioned flaws the PG13 rating which destroyed the  potential of some scenes and you'll get one weak and forgettable  movie. In the original one of the most memorable lines goes 'I'd buy  that for a dollar'. In addition to butchering everything else the  remake also butchered this line. In one scene Jackie Earle Haley's  character Mattox bashes the concept of Robocop saying he 'wouldn't buy  that for a dollar'. As for myself if I knew upon purchasing my ticket  what horrors were awaiting I wouldn't have bought it for a dollar.  Rating 410".

Most of the film was contained to the subject of his development more so his combat mode where by his cyborg side killed so many targets in so many seconds.

	schema:reviewBody "I'm watching Robocop witch is not Robocop for the second time. Just to see if it is really as bad as I recall it watching it the first time. And I stilll don't like it.Despite better effects and a more robotlike Robocop the original still prevails.Here is why.First of all Joel Kinnaman is no Peter Weller. In the original despite only 15 minutes or so as a human Weller created a very likable Alex Murphy. Kinnaman can't create a likable Murphy. He comes off too much like a tough guy and a smartass. Murphys death in the real Robocop movie is to the date still a very hard scene to watch. And the evil sadistic Clarence Boddicker brilliantly played by Kurtwood Smith and his ditto gang are to this date still awesome badguys. And when Robocop remembers its an absolute delight to watch him kill every member of the gang one by one.In this Robocop movie Murphy is almost killed by a carbomb and I still don't like him nor do I care what happens to him either. That is a clear sign that the movie isn't working at all. And of course because Robocop is PG13 there is no blood whenever someone dies no Boddicker no Dick Jones awesome Ronny Cox no Bob Mortonawesome Miguel Ferrer or any other badguys just a Fallon whats his face and a Dennet Norton Bob Morton get it?Fallon a woman's namehas too little screen time to even be noticed.Robocop has no drive or motivation to go on living as a machine. In the real Robocop movie he had revenge that pushed him forward. The CGI version of ED209 that like OCP has a different name moves exactly like the much more menacing stopmotionrobot in the original. So what's the point? Much like the rest of the movie. They spend a lot of time letting Robocop go through the motions with his new robotbody and showing he he is made. And running simulation programs where he fights other robots. Again probably the rating. Had it been rated R he would have been send out on the streets right away killing badguys because that's what the real Robocop does.And what's with all that crap with his wife and son? Who cares. Like he could ever have a life with them again after his transformation. In the real Robocop movie they wiped his memory and he barely remembered them and that worked really well. There was not a single scene with Murhy together with his wife and son. And yet we felt Robocops pain now that is good acting from Peter Weller Seeing the new Robocop cry as he talks to his wife on a Skype like connection made me wanna puke.And all the satire and humor of the real Robocop movie is gone here. Instead we have a movie that takes it self way too seriously and the actionscenes feels like they were shot and directed by a teenager.Avoid this crap. Even if you've never seen the real Robocop movie from 1987 and you were born later and it seems outdated I guarantee that you will still prefer that to this crap.".

	schema:reviewBody "Dear fellow movie buffs and Robocop fans! Let's make something clear at the beginning I'm a huge RoboCop fan absolutely LOVE the original movie and I advice anybody who feel otherwise stop reading this review further because it is gonna be about something you do not care about the new RoboCop movie! I watched the RoboCop remake Saturday evening with my other half and as usual I came here to IMDb to check on the reviews and what other people thought of it. I do not write a lot of reviews but this time I absolutely felt the need to write one as I was shocked to see how people bashing this movie into the ground. Of course it is the usual drill comparing it to the original what the new one missed out the new robo design... etc. I just do not understand most of these people. When I heard that there is gonna be a RoboCop remake I was very happy to hear the news. And it is NOT because I dislike the original! It is because there were no RoboCop movies made for over than 2 decades and I love the material. I wanted the story to continue or something. And we finally got to what I wanted to say! This RoboCop movie is by NO mean bad! When I went to the cinema both me and my girlfriend  who also a fan of the original  were ready to be disappointed and we absolutely loved the movie. This is a different new age story of the now famous character. When I saw some of the reviews I just cannot believe that those people watched the same movie! Either that or I have low standards... which I don't think so.People I'm not saying that this remake was not created because the studios wanted to make some quick bucks! Most probably it was! What I'm saying is that they did care about the material and they took the time to create a new and exciting vision. I go even that far that the message of the movie is different slightly from the original and that is absolutely fine! The acting is amazing it was great to see Michael Keaton on the big screen again he is a very underrated and extremely talented actor in my opinion. Gary Oldman Samuel L. Jackson and I gotta say Joel Kinnaman was an awesome and very emotional Alex Murphy! The new RoboCop designs were something scared me off a bit at first too when I saw the first on set shots but do they look awesome in the movie! The action was great and the special efx of course are something have to work in a movie this caliber so no surprises there fantastic job! There is one thing though other reviewers also mentioned is a little bit dissatisfying there is no real enemy. But then again this is a different story. This one is more about a guy who's being thrown around in this crazy futuristic world where he tries everything to maintain his humanity even though they constantly shut him down or overload his brain with information. He is us! And finally let me say that much yes the original is a classic and it is indeed different but this new one is not only enjoyable but has the promise of starting the franchise over again with a first class cast emotional story and great effects so sit back and enjoy the ride! This is by no means resembles the hollow empty unoriginal and completely pointless Totall Recall remake! So just give it a brake and let's hope that there is gonna be a second part!".

	schema:headline " Failed attempt at remaking a classic";
	schema:reviewBody "ROBOCOP 2014 is the latest in a LONG list of remakesreboots that have come in droves in the 21st century. For the most part modern remakes just simply do not work and this film is no exception. The first strike against them is the seeming requirement that they have to be PG13 when the original was most probably R in the 80s and I can even remember a few PG13 movies back in the day that pushed the envelope more so than anything now! The original 1987 version of Robocop was a lightninginabottle classic a perfect amalgamation of action scifi horror satire and drama. Sometimes a film works simply because it doesn't TRY to be anything more than entertaining and everything else just comes together. I think that the problem with this 2014 version is that it TRIED to be different to the point that it focused so much on what it was trying to be that it forgot that movies are meant at their core to simply entertain.In watching this film in the movie theatre I could not help but be reminded of the relatively recent The Dark Knight a monumentally overrated comicbook film from 2008 that has unfortunately changed the way that superhero movies are being presented. First there was Man of Steel from last year which had way too much pontification meandering and dizzying action to be entertaining. Now with this film there is a similar tone of characters talking way too much about manversusmachine the price of sacrifice and similar to TDK minimal yet confusing action sequences. In this version the dialog spells everything out to the viewer and it feels like characters are talking directly through the movie screen. In the original the character actions spoke for themselves and everything felt organic. By the end of the original I felt uplifted. By the end of this I felt confused.This reboot tells a much different tale of Detroit cop Alex Murphy essayed by a veryunderused Joel Kinnaman from AMC's The Killing. In this film Murphy is an undercover detective and is fully entrenched within his department in the original he was a uniformedstreet cop who had just been transferred. Murphy's partner had just been shot in an arms deal gone wrong and he suspects a couple of his fellow officers of being dirty cops working for the city's biggest arms dealer Antoine Vallon a literal useless character played by Patrick Garrow.The MurphyVallon rivalry is virtually nonexistent in this film and acts as a red herring. Turns out the film is not really about revenge so much as Murphy's subsequent adjustment to living as a machine after one of Vallon's goons sabotages Murphy's car with a bomb thereby almost killing him and turning him into a vegetable. In steps Omnicorp run by billionaire Raymond Sellars brilliantly played by Michael Keaton in the film's standout performance who repair Murphy by making his body over 90 robotics only leaving vital organs and his right hand in tact. So in this version Murphy never really dies. He is actually still human. I know that this is supposed to be science fiction but even this plot point goes way too far over my head! When I saw how Murphy really looked without the suit I just couldn't wrap my head around how this was even possible.The main scientist tasked with rebuilding Murphy is Dr. Dennett Norton played earnestly by a very overused Gary Oldman. In fact Oldman actually has the largest role in this film not Kinnaman who's barely in it. And I couldn't really buy Oldman as a scientist. It seemed like he was channeling his Commissioner Gordon character too much from TDK.A decent subplot involves how Murphy's wife Clara wellplayed by Abbie Cornish and son David nicely played by John Paul Ruttan react to Alex's fate. This is in contrast to the original film where Murphy's family was only ever seen in flashbacks and as far as they knew he was dead. What worked about this in the original is it added to the tragedy of Murphy's fate. But at least in this one the family scenes felt like a relief from all the boring corporate and political shenanigans. Most of this movie was like watching a Sunday morning politico show! In particular Samuel L. Jackson has an odd and thankless role as a conservative talking point host of a national network news show. These scenes were a replacement for the satirical commercials that appeared in the original. But in the original those commercials were deftly entertaining and funny. In this one this faux news show is a boring chore to sit through! Jackie Earle Haley also has an annoying role as a military strategist who derides and trashes MurphyRobocop every chance he gets. I also found the actors playing the respective assistants to Sellars and Denton to be bland and annoying especially the nasal Jay Baruchel as Omnicorp's top marketing person.Of course the film throws in obligatory famous quotes from the original but in a very uninspiring and cheesy way. Every time I would hear this dialog it just made me cringe because it was so cheesy and didn't even belong in this movie which is too different from the original for that to work. And as mentioned above there is actually very little action and what there is it's confusing unrealistic and cartoony as most modern CGIladen films tend to be. The movie itself doesn't seem to know what it really wants to be. In trying to be something different it fails at being anything.".

	onyx:emotionText "ROBOCOP 2014 is the latest in a LONG list of remakesreboots that have come in droves in the 21st century. For the most part modern remakes just simply do not work and this film is no exception. The first strike against them is the seeming requirement that they have to be PG13 when the original was most probably R in the 80s and I can even remember a few PG13 movies back in the day that pushed the envelope more so than anything now! The original 1987 version of Robocop was a lightninginabottle classic a perfect amalgamation of action scifi horror satire and drama. Sometimes a film works simply because it doesn't TRY to be anything more than entertaining and everything else just comes together. I think that the problem with this 2014 version is that it TRIED to be different to the point that it focused so much on what it was trying to be that it forgot that movies are meant at their core to simply entertain.In watching this film in the movie theatre I could not help but be reminded of the relatively recent The Dark Knight a monumentally overrated comicbook film from 2008 that has unfortunately changed the way that superhero movies are being presented. First there was Man of Steel from last year which had way too much pontification meandering and dizzying action to be entertaining. Now with this film there is a similar tone of characters talking way too much about manversusmachine the price of sacrifice and similar to TDK minimal yet confusing action sequences. In this version the dialog spells everything out to the viewer and it feels like characters are talking directly through the movie screen. In the original the character actions spoke for themselves and everything felt organic. By the end of the original I felt uplifted. By the end of this I felt confused.This reboot tells a much different tale of Detroit cop Alex Murphy essayed by a veryunderused Joel Kinnaman from AMC's The Killing. In this film Murphy is an undercover detective and is fully entrenched within his department in the original he was a uniformedstreet cop who had just been transferred. Murphy's partner had just been shot in an arms deal gone wrong and he suspects a couple of his fellow officers of being dirty cops working for the city's biggest arms dealer Antoine Vallon a literal useless character played by Patrick Garrow.The MurphyVallon rivalry is virtually nonexistent in this film and acts as a red herring. Turns out the film is not really about revenge so much as Murphy's subsequent adjustment to living as a machine after one of Vallon's goons sabotages Murphy's car with a bomb thereby almost killing him and turning him into a vegetable. In steps Omnicorp run by billionaire Raymond Sellars brilliantly played by Michael Keaton in the film's standout performance who repair Murphy by making his body over 90 robotics only leaving vital organs and his right hand in tact.

But for a PG 13 movie the new RoboCop is packed with a lot of action!! The shootouts are intense. The drama and story were also very well done. YOU the viewer will actually CARE about Murphy and his family. You will want to see the villains get what they deserve. The Special EffectsCGI were AMAZING!! Fantastic job well done. I was not feeling the black suit but RoboCop does wear the classic armor suit in the beginning and at the very end. There's a few references to the 1987 RoboCop film. For example the ED 209 robot machines when Jackie Earle Haley said I wouldn't buy that for a dollar the classic RoboCop armor suit Dead or Alive  You're Coming With Me Thank You For Your Cooperation  etc. The movie does have its differences and tries to stand on its own.I would recommend RoboCop 2014 to new fans and fans of the original 1987 RoboCop. The ACTION scenes are HARD HITTING and FAST PACED. The bullets fly then RoboCop's targets die!!! Can't Stop RoboCop!!!! The only thing that I did not like was RoboCop riding on a motorcycle instead of in his traditional Police Car. RoboCop on the motorcycle made me think of Terminator 2 Judgement Day. Other than that small blemish I'd give RoboCop 2014 an 8 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Robocop ReviewThis is exactly the kind of movie Hollywood wants a convoluted mess full of plotholes unnecessary subplots bad direction and little fun to be had.Minor Spoiler SignaledPlot holesThe most infuriating ones are tied to the RoboCop character who by the way only starts actually doing something 50 minutes in the movie.They go too deep in how RoboCop works and how OGP can control him and shut him down whenever they want. But when RoboCop rebels the first time Gary Oldman's character is asked why and his line is literally 'I have no idea'.In the original RoboCop they don't explain how Murphy starts regaining his memories. It's left to the viewer's imagination just like the whole process of creating him was. But if you start going into that much detail about something you can't suddenly go 'I have no idea'. That's called a copout.The worst thing is that it happens twice. The most important time RoboCop manages to do something that goes against his programming they never explain why nor were any hints given for us to make our own idea. It just comes out of nowhere.SPOILER Another blatant plothole is this system that they implant into RoboCop which basically has access to all the digital archives of the police crosses evidence and tells him who to arrest. Which begs the question why didn't they give the police this system to begin with in a Computer if all they wanted was good PR?On top of it this system makes makes it appear like RoboCop is only needed because he has that program in his brain. It makes all the other policemen look like idiots and it makes him even less intimidating than he already is. END SPOILERUnnecessary SubplotsThe most unnecessary is Murphy's family. They have fifteens minutes of screentime and they add nothing to the plot. You could remove them from the movie put his colleague in place of his wife in that one scene and nothing would be lost or change.The one that made me the most angry was the one that was interesting and goes nowhere.The first five minutes of the movie are more interesting than anything else that happens afterwards. Surprisingly they seem to retain the spirit of the original movie. I would have much preferred to see RoboCop in that contest. But as I said it goes nowhere. And that's a damn waste.Bad DirectionThere's so much shaky cam in this movie that I almost got nausea.It ruins every single action scene in this movie. In the very first one there are cuts where I couldn't tell what is going on at all. Who got injured why how where did they shoot this guy from!It's even more aggravating when they use it in scenes where people are just standing in front of each other talking! There's no action to make 'more dramatic'. There's no need for shaky cam!And that's not the only questionable directing choice. There's an action scene in the second half of the movie where I literally had no idea what was going on from start to end because on top of the shaky cam you have another bad directing choice that also makes no sense plotwiseBut never is the bad direction as evident as it is in Samuel L. Jackson. Michael Keaton gives a great performance Gary Oldman gives an okay performance Samuel L. Jackson seems to not give a flying snake about the movie he's starring in.That's half on him and half on the director who I guess was intimidated by his star power and never bothered to correct him.Little FunThe movie is just no fun at all to watch. The fight scenes aren't fun because you can't follow them properly. There are very few jokes and those that exist are not exactly funny. The plot is a mess.Worst of all the characters are not entertaining. No bad performances in this movie but there sure are boring performances. Michael Keaton's character has that potential to entertain but the script gives him almost nothing to work with.Joel Kinnaman is no joke either. His character is not well written to begin with but even before transforming into RoboCop he's so inexpressive! No matter if he's making a weapon deal undercover playing with his son or making out with his wife he always has the same expression.When he puts on the suit his face's lack of expression becomes even more evident and his body language is not intimidating at all. Again half of this falls on the director's shoulders. If you really wanted to make this RoboCop have emotions make sure he emotes them well.I know it's not an easy role but we have lots of examples of people giving a great performance even with some kind of disadvantage. Like Marlee Matlin in Children of a Lesser God Hugo Weaving in V for Vendetta and of course Peter Weller in the original RoboCop.Final ThoughtsI wouldn't suggest going to see this. People who aren't fans of the original will find it boring and people who are fans of the original will come out of the movie theater infuriated and with their stomachs lurching.If you really want to see a fun movie based on the original RoboCop I suggest watching 'Our Robocop Remake' at OurRobocopRemake.Com. A joined effort from 50 groups of people to make a fitting homage to the original movie.It's completely free it's very funny and it's many times more entertaining than this Robot Bore Fest.".

	schema:reviewBody "Judging from the comments below I guess being a hitman is not much to laugh at...and the term 'black comedy' doesn't come to anyone's mind? Does that extend to the fact that without George Raft going after Jack Lemmon  Tony Curtis in Some Like It Hot they would have no reason to meet Marilyn get on a train to Miami etc. etc. ??Of course its not funny in real life that people get killed. But this comedy starring Bruce Willis and Matthew Perry is very well done and had me laughing about it even when it was over.  It was so over the top and so overpopulated with killers and gangsters and contract killings that at times its hard to remember what's going on and who is out to kill whom but it does not matter at all since its all in fun.I do not like either of the leads generally speaking.  I liked about five out of all Bruce Willis' movies and Perry I've seen on his tv show and enjoyed him but never really thought about him much.  In this they are both very well cast and when they strike up a friendship its believable.  Willis does not do a 'goombah fuggetaboutit' attitude or accent thankfully even though his character has an Italian surname and does not mug for the audience at all. Amanda Peet is very funny as a wannabe hitwoman and a fan of the real killers and Michael Clarke Duncan is also very funny. Only downside is Rosanna Arquette  bad casting choice here!  Maybe someone owed her a favor.  Ironically she is not one of the people who has a contract out on her though God knows she's annoying enough for one.".

	schema:reviewBody "Is a guy who has killed seventeen people necessarily a bad' guy?  Not a question everybody is going to have to ask themselves to be sure but what if that guy moved in next door to you?  It's a situation that just may induce an introspective moment or two.  Which is exactly what happens in The Whole Nine Yards' directed by Jonathan Lynn and starring Bruce Willis and Matthew Perry.  Hitman Jimmy The Tulip' Tudeski Willis ratted out his boss in Chicago and now he's on the lam.  He makes his way to Canada where he buys a house next door to a hapless dentist Nicholas Oz' Oseransky Perry who is suffering from inherited debts and a shrew of a wife Sophie Rosanna Arquette not to mention a motherinlaw from Hell Carmen Ferland.  When he realizes who his neighbor is about to be his first instinct is to run but Sophie has other ideas.  It seems there's a price on Jimmy's head one Janni Gogolack Kevin Pollak would like to take his revenge on the guy who's responsible for his father going away for a long long time.  So Sophie squeezes Oz into a corner until he agrees to go to Chicago and meet with Janni to put the finger on Jimmy.  Not a great idea Oz thinks but it at least sounds like a nice vacation so he goes. But of course he should have stayed with his instincts because he soon finds himself looking down the barrel of trouble.  And the only way out it seems is down...What Lynn put together here is actually a fairly lighthearted black comedy the nature of the story dictates that there will be violence in it and there is but much of it is implied rather than graphic.  The pace is good and Lynn develops the characters enough to let you know exactly who they are and what they are all about.  There's not a lot of depth but it's not necessary the actors have each made their respective characters unique to a point that puts them beyond stereotype and it works perfectly for this film and the story.  Some of what happens is inevitable though not necessarily predictable and certain aspects will keep you guessing right up to the end.  Typical of a comedy that leans to the dark side nothing in this story is cut and dried.Willis is perfect as Jimmy The Tulip giving a rather reserved subtle performance that puts Jimmy's guarded but confident manner into perspective. Underneath it all this guy is really rather coldblooded he has to be given his choice of employment but his relationship with Oz gives it some warmth at least externally.  Like Chow YunFat in The Killer' Jimmy is likable but when you consider at arm's length who he is  and what he is capable of it's a bit disconcerting.  And that's one of the aspects of the film that is so interesting because you know who and what Jimmy is you never really know which way things are going to turn. Perry is excellent as well as Oz.'  Henpecked and in dire straits he is something of an updated version of the W.C. Fields character in It's A Gift' or The Bank Dick' although a bit darker.  Perry is charismatic has impeccable timing with his delivery and uses physical comedy to great effect.  His reactions to Willis and the situations in which he finds himself are brilliant and hilarious and he seems to instinctively know just how far to take it to make it work.  And it's the little seemingly insignificant things he brings to the character that give the film that extra something and creates some memorable moments.The supporting cast includes Michael Clarke Duncan Frankie Figs Natasha Henstridge Cynthia Amanda Peet Jill St. Claire Harland Williams Special Agent Hanson and Serge Christianssens Mr. Boulez.  It may not be the most original movie ever made but The Whole Nine Yards' is funny has a great cast of actors who have taken characters you've basically seen before and made them their own and does exactly what a film like this is supposed to do  Entertain.  It's not going to make you ponder the universe or the state of the world today but it's going to give you a couple of hours of laughs and some residual chuckles.  Which when you think about it is not such a bad deal.  It's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 710.".

	schema:reviewBody "I rented The Whole Nine Yards a few days ago and just watched it this morning I'm such a huge Bruce Willis fan I don't see him that often in comedies so I was curious how this would work. But after viewing this film I have to just say that this movie was just so funny! I couldn't believe how much it made me laugh I know it's such a dark subject but it was pretty cool how they just turned into a zanny comedy. Bruce Willis and Matthew Perry were just the most perfect choices they were like ying and yang. Matthew as this guy who just is scared of everything and finally has something at the end to say where he has control and Bruce couldn't have been a more perfect choice as the cocky and yet charismatic hit man who could be threatening but yet the most likable guy in the world. The story was just very clever and worked so well with the cast.Nick is just your average guy he is a dentist and a very likable guy but he gets walked on quite a bit especially by his wife who he feels like he owes her family so he won't divorce her. But one day a new neighbor moves in Nick notices him pretty much off the bat it's Jimmy the tulip Tudeski the famous hit man who has killed 17 people and also ratted out his boss. He's on the run from his boss in Chicago and has a ransom on his head. Nick actually likes Jimmy but his wife Sophie says to turn him in and get the award. He goes to Chicago and falls in love with Jimmy's wife Cynthia. When Nick comes back home to Canada he learns from Jimmy that his wife has gone to hire a hit man to kill Nick. But Nick also learns that Jimmy wants to kill Cynthia Jimmy's boss wants to kill Nick Nick's receptionist is also a hit woman pretty much everyone wants to kill everyone.That's pretty much the best way to sum up The Whole Nine Yards but trust me when I say that this is such a fun movie. I really had a good time watching this movie Bruce Willis was just so great. But I have to admit that Amanda Peet's performance floored me when she was just admiring Bruce's work and getting advice from him on what her first hit should be like. She was just so adorable while being deadly. So please I would recommend this film it's a dark comedy yes but it's all good just learn to let go and have fun if you're very sensitive on the subject.710".

	schema:reviewBody "Now here is a rare breed a mainstream movie that works at just about every level without dumbing anything down or making the average viewer think too hard. The Whole Nine Yards is a great movie to simply sit back and enjoy.Nicholas Oz Ozeransky Matthew Perry is a mildmannered dentist whose stuck with a wife who hates him Rosanna Arquette in a hilariously overthetop performance and a huge debt that his partner his fatherinlaw left him when he kicked the bucket. Then his new neighbor moves in. This neighbor much to Oz's horror is none other than Jimmy The Tulip Tudeski Bruce Willis the infamous hitman for the Gogolak gang. Oz's wife tells him that they should rat Jimmy out to the Gogolaks to get a finder's fee. Oz obviously refuses but agrees to go when his wife agrees that if he does this she'll give him a divorce. Thus begins a hilarious story of double crosses new romances and hamburgers with mayonnaise.The cast is first rate. Matthew Perry is in full panicmode and his reactions to the situations he finds himself in and their resulting consequences are hilarious. Bruce Willis is perfectly cast as Jimmy. It's a typecast role but Willis plays him with a slight tongueincheek. It works wonderfully. While it allows for plenty of laughs it also gives him an air of menace which adds another layer to the humor. We are aware of Jimmy's capacity for violence but the way Willis plays it results in moments of laughter mixed with suspense. Natasha Henstridge radiates a cool sexuality mixed with vulnerability as Jimmy's exwife who falls for Oz. Michael Clarke Duncan is also wellcast as Jimmy's fellow hitman Frankie. Kevin Pollack and Rosanna Arquette are so overthetop that their performances must be seen to be believed.But as good as this cast is and it's great the film is stolen from all of them by newcomer Amanda Peet. It takes a great performer to steal scenes with actors at the top of their game. But Peet didn't just steal her scenes she walked away with the whole movie. Peet is positively delightful as Oz's ditzy receptionist who has more of a part to play in this than anyone realizes. Peet is hysterical her performance should have at least gotten her an Oscar nod if not a win.The Whole Nine Yards is a mix of filmnoir and screwball comedy. Director Jonathan Lynn has a lot of fun with the conventions of each genre including mixing and matching the character traits of the femmefatale and the good girl you'll see what I mean when you watch the movie. What I really liked is that the humor of the movie is not overthetop exaggeration humor like The Farrelly Brothers. This is more about timing and dialogue it's like a 1930's screwball comedy without the Hays Code. To be sure the film does not leave out the trademark of the noir genre the twisty plot. The Whole Nine Yards boasts plenty of surprises and quite a bit of suspense. Just because this is a comedy doesn't mean you can tell where it's going.Mixing these two genres would seem impossible because more often than not one would dilute the other. But Lynn manages to walk the line between the two opposite genres and play them both equally well. The film is wellpaced and the timing on the jokes is perfect. There are no overthetop visual effects and that's a good thing.The Whole Nine Yards may not be classic film material but it's highly entertaining. And with a movie like this that's just about all that one could ask for.".

	schema:reviewBody "I watched this one on the dish the other day eager to see Montreal in a movie actually playing Montreal as opposed to masquerading as New York or Chicago or some other city. Other than that I really didn't know what to expect.I was pleasantly surprised in a few ways. Matthew Perry was playing his usual goofy character as a result of total lack of any acting ability whatsoever. But Bruce Willis is always good Amanda Peet stole the screen in almost every scene she was in and the plot line was just quirky enough to be entertaining. Innovative and fresh I found this film to be more creative than most of what's currently out in the theatres. It didn't have that formula imprint of so many Hollywood films i.e. take the comedy formula off the shelf and cast it by Friday. I actually laughed out loud at a few moments.The movie did go wrong in a couple of places. Being a Montrealer I noticed a few things that most viewers might have missed. For instance that their obsession with Mayonnaise on hamburgers which is integral to the plot isn't based on any reality that I know of as I have yet to find a Montreal restaurant that puts mayonnaise on burgers. Rosanna Arquette's French accent is even worse than mine even though it's supposedly her character's first language. Matthew Perry's love scenes with Natasha Henstridge are so ridiculously unrealistic even the noncynical will yawn. And the director seemed to have an obsession with pointing out Montreal landmarks even if they had nothing to do with the plot.Those are small things in the grand context of the movie though. If you liked movies such as The Big Hit this is very similar. It's not meant to be taken very seriously so the plot turns are more for absurdity's sake than for any kind of buildup of suspense. Still if you're looking for some lighter entertainment it's a good choice.".

I have always liked Bruce Willis and Matthew Perry and I also quite like Michael Duncan and Amanda Peet. And of course I love a good comedy. So I was pretty excited to see THE WHOLE NINE YARDS. It did not live up to my expectationsit soared past them.A resident of Canada Oz Osercansky Matthew Perry is a dentist who is living with a wife Rosanna Arquette who he hates and she hates him but they don't get a divorce for money reasons. When a hit man named Jimmy the Tulip Tudeski Bruce Willis moves in next door Oz finds out his wife is trying to find hit men that will kill him. Jimmy who takes a liking to Oz doesn't agree to kill Oz but seeks Oz's help in getting Jimmy's wife Cynthia Natasha Henstridge and his enemy Yanni Kevin Pollak together so he can kill them. Oz along with another hit man named Frankie Figs Michael Duncan finds himself unwittingly helping but he starts to fall in love with Cynthia and won't let her die.My plot description sounds quite bad but the movie is very good and funny. The collection of actors in this movie are superb. Bruce Willis is good as the loveable murderer. Matthew Perry does a great comedic job as usual. Michael Duncan fit the part of the really big and scary hit man pretty well too. The adorable Amanda Peet was really good too as the hitwoman wannabe.I saw ANALYZE THIS a few days before I saw this and I thought this one blew it away. The actors are better the characters are cooler the jokes are funnier I was laughing out loud on many occasions and the mixture of crime and comedy is pulled off a lot better in this movie which is strange because there is more crime in this one than in ANALYZE THIS. Both the comedy and the crime are pulled off terrifically. Go see this movie now you'll love it.".

She has already hired a hitman the secretary at his office Jill Amanda Peet but she got to liking Oz and ended up permanently working for him. Bruce Willis is one of the nations most nitrous professional hitmen named Jimmy. He moves in next door to Oz conspires with Oz's spouse and that leaves Oz in Chicago to find Jimmy's arch enemy Ganni Gogolak Kevin Pollak and his estranged but beautiful wife Cynthia Natasha Henstridge over legal issues.Other important characters include Frankie Figgs Michael Clarke Duncan a huge bearlike individual who takes Oz to meet Janni. There is also Rocketman star Harland Williams as a local undercover cop who becomes involved with the devious doings of Sophie. What do all of these characters want? Jimmy Cynthia and Janni are after a ten million dollar prize on each other's heads Jill wants to become a professional hitman Frankie wants to kill people and please his leaders and Oz just wants out of the entire mess. The Whole Nine Yards has an engrossingly entertaining setup even without thorough character introduction. This kind of movie does not need character development as long as we can enjoy the premise. The comical atmosphere makes up for the few holes in the writing the story moves along smoothly. Although we have seen this kind of material before in Grosse Point Blank and Analyze This never has it been this imaginatively zany and hilariously inventive. What makes this movie so effective is the array of perfectly cast characters. Matthew Perry is hilarious in a reactive clumsy role that clearly fits his personality. Rosanna Arquette is also flawless in an annoying biting character. Bruce Willis is stunningly suave in a portrayal that for the first time in a long while creates a calm cool and collected character. Amanda Peet Whipped and Natasha Richardson Species are both immensely beautiful all they really need to do present themselves on screen for audiences to enjoy their presence.The labyrinthine plot in The Whole Nine Yards becomes more complicated than many viewers might expect. Bruce Willis eventually becomes more of an underlying tone in the film to propel the story along and a lot of active material is discarded rather than performed. There is a cute little romantic subplot also but it does not feel like much in a plot where so much transpires and the important story nuggets are scattered all over the board. Because of this the third act suffers from a mild case of the hiccups when the initial conflict is completely resolved only for the writers to build for yet another climax. This is an unusual structure...but this is an unusual movie. The Whole Nine Yards is not a terrific movie but it is a funny and amusing one. Compare this comedy caper to other socalled parodies released within the past year and you will see why it is such an achievement when a comedy comes around that actually fits the definition of a comedy.".

Amanda Peet Whipped and Natasha Richardson Species are both immensely beautiful all they really need to do present themselves on screen for audiences to enjoy their presence.The labyrinthine plot in The Whole Nine Yards becomes more complicated than many viewers might expect. Bruce Willis eventually becomes more of an underlying tone in the film to propel the story along and a lot of active material is discarded rather than performed. There is a cute little romantic subplot also but it does not feel like much in a plot where so much transpires and the important story nuggets are scattered all over the board. Because of this the third act suffers from a mild case of the hiccups when the initial conflict is completely resolved only for the writers to build for yet another climax. This is an unusual structure...but this is an unusual movie. The Whole Nine Yards is not a terrific movie but it is a funny and amusing one. Compare this comedy caper to other socalled parodies released within the past year and you will see why it is such an achievement when a comedy comes around that actually fits the definition of a comedy.";

The acting was of course not the best but there was no need for it to be good no one was trying to make this story believable. The movie never drags on and is quite entertaining with a few nice laughs. Also there are no annoyingly repetitive jokes. However the movie is very predictable and reeks of happy ending for almost all from the very beginning.I would say this movie is worth watching if one simply wants a light comedy with a happy ending.

Amanda Peet is a great actress and is really funny in tons of her films. I liked The Whole nine yards because it's one of those comedies that you may not see that much of.

That's why The Whole Nine Yards was a great surprise since Perry fits well into his role and the movie isn't yet another Friendsstyle copy either. The plot gets quite twisty but through it all it is propelled by the welldefined characters' motivations. The stage is set justifiably for the actors that make the best work in the movie Bruce Willis Natasha Henstridge Amanda Peet and Michael Clarke Duncan besides Perry. It is a comedy yes but very subtle and keeping with the realistic even when the characters or Perry's Oseransky mostly find themselves in absurd situations and the plot keeps turning until the end when it reaches a classic 50'slike tone. Also the film's beautiful women Hensridge and Peet simply deserve praise their allure is irresistible. This is all around a very good movie where all the elements have been brought together much better than the setup suggested.".

	onyx:emotionText "Matthew Perry hasn't been a leading actor to bank a good movie on. That's why The Whole Nine Yards was a great surprise since Perry fits well into his role and the movie isn't yet another Friendsstyle copy either. The plot gets quite twisty but through it all it is propelled by the welldefined characters' motivations. The stage is set justifiably for the actors that make the best work in the movie Bruce Willis Natasha Henstridge Amanda Peet and Michael Clarke Duncan besides Perry. It is a comedy yes but very subtle and keeping with the realistic even when the characters or Perry's Oseransky mostly find themselves in absurd situations and the plot keeps turning until the end when it reaches a classic 50'slike tone. Also the film's beautiful women Hensridge and Peet simply deserve praise their allure is irresistible. This is all around a very good movie where all the elements have been brought together much better than the setup suggested.";

	schema:headline " A highly successful French thriller by Mathieu Kassovitz...";
	schema:reviewBody "...who is famous for his intelligent films about social issues such as 'La Haine'. The suspenseful story IMO often wrongfully compared to David Fincher's 'Se7en' because of its seemingly similar thematic elements is set in the French Alps in the fictitious towns of Guernon and Sarzac. The marvellous scenery contributes a lot to the overall mysterious atmosphere of the film and is an ideal background for the movie's convincing cast. This is especially true for the leading roles which are portrayed by two of the most talented French actors Jean Reno and Vincent Cassel.The plot is based on a novel by JeanChristophe Grange who together with director Mathieu Kassovitz also developed the screenplay. With the book being quite complicated due to its many carefully intertwined lines of action a lot had to be simplified altered or simply cut out a wellknown issue with adaptations. Unfortunately many of the novel's explanatory scenes were omitted so that you end up with a film which is not boring but quite confusing' as main actor Vincent Cassel puts it correctly. The following is a basic plot summary that intends to spoil as little of the story as possibleCommissaire Pierre Niemans is called to the remote university town of Guernon to solve a gruesome murder case in which the victim  the university's librarian  was brutally tortured and mutilated. Neither the university officials nor the students prove to be too helpful during the investigation and Niemans soon gets the impression that there is something very suspicious about the whole situation. Meanwhile Commissaire Max Kerkerian investigates the desecration of a grave in Sarzac. Soon it turns out that the seemingly unrelated cases are strangely connected with each other and after a second corpse is found the two very unlike cops team up to discover a long kept secret. This knowledge eventually gets them into lifethreatening situations the most deadly of them marking the end of the movie which is set on top of a huge snowcovered glacier.The acting is simply excellent Jean Reno portrays Niemans as a surly reserved but brilliant professional with an attitude that often offends the people around him even if he does not mean to. Vincent Cassel is Max Kerkerian a quite lively character sharpwitted but at times lacking selfcontrol and totally unconventional in his methods the book even mentions him being a former carthief. The third leading role Fanny Ferreira a glaciologist working at the university and the one to find the first corpse is portrayed by Nadia Fars. Her enigmatic character is more involved in the mystery than it seems.The action is greatly enhanced by the spectacular panoramic views and camera trails used for the location shooting even though the opening scene where the camera follows Niemans' car as it approaches the first crime scene is obviously a ripoff of Stanley Kubrick's 'The Shining'. One scene shows Niemans and Ferreira the scientist descending a glacier a dangerous shot for which huge cranes had to be transported to the glacier in order to secure the actors. The wonderful score was composed by Bruno Coulais who managed to provide each scene with the appropriate musical background.As stated before major changes were necessary to transfer the complex novel onto the screen. The outcome was that many viewers felt puzzled by the movie's abrupt confusing and seemingly illogical ending as much is left out in the film where the book provides extensive background information. This is where the movie's biggest flaw lies. Other alterations include the renaming of Karim Abdouf novel to Max Kerkerian film. While his characteristics remained more or less the same it was the author's original intention to include a police officer of Algerian origin in the story. The characters in general are darker in the novel where Niemans even kills a hooligan before the actual story begins. The conspiracy revealed by the cops is larger and was also one of the aspects which were simplified for the movie.All in all one could complain that some of the action scenes look rather out of place like Kerkerian's fight with two skinheads or the obligatory car chase later on in the film. The 'mismatchedcop scenario' is not too innovative either but since it is depicted in such a unique way it would be unfair to dismiss it as a clich. While I can only reiterate that it may be difficult to completely grasp the movie at once it is not at all impossible to follow the storyline as some have claimed. The Crimson Rivers' is definitely a great movie in its genre featuring spectacular camera shots and an excellent cast and is in this vein well worth a visit.".

Meanwhile Detective Max Kerkerian Vincent Cassel comes to the same place following the investigation of a profaned tomb of a young girl. They join forces and find a plot of eugenics in the University with abductions murders and revenge.Yesterday I saw this great movie again trying to find some answers to questions I raised the first time I saw it four years ago. Unfortunately they have no explanations along the story. Les Rivires Pourpres has magnificent locations maybe the most beautiful landscapes I have seen in a crime movie. The cast is outstanding highlighting the charismatic Jean Reno and Vincent Cassel. However the screenplay has flaws and presents a deceptive conclusion. My questions are 1 If Judith was kidnapped in the nursery of the hospital exchanged by the daughter of another person what happened to the other child? 2 Who raised Judith if her mother got crazy and went to a dark cell in a convent? 3 If her mother knew where her other daughter was why didn't she go to the French justice and fight to retrieve the child? 4 How Judith found and approached Fanny? Anyway usually worths watching serial killer stories and this one is very above the average. My vote is eight.Title Brazil Rio Vermelhos Red Rivers".

Reno's character is a hotshot cop from Paris who is sent to investigate the body.So far so good. But this film quickly degenerates into a morass of trite dialogue puzzling 'clues' and stupid fight scenes. I had the socalled mystery figured out in about twenty minutes what there was of it.The director dragged this film out for a long time on a very minor and quite cheesy plot. It was painful to watch two such talented actors as Reno and Cassel wander through this trite film with absolutely nothing to do but spout hackneyed lines and in the case of Reno tremble and fairly ps himself every time his character came near a dog. Sad really.This movie is a below average thriller. The plot is a head scratcher. There were so many loose ends that I think I could have knit myself a sweater from them. And the demon twins at the end were just laughable. That last fight between Cassel and the 'crazy' twin resembled the fight scene at the end of the really bad and cheesy Canadian film The Final Sacrifice. I was sorely disappointed in this film.".

It's so full of clichs that at one point I thought the whole thing was a comedy. The painful dialogue and those silent pauses with fades outs and fades ins just at the right expositionary moments made me groan.

The climax on top of the mountain with the stupid revelation about the killers with Cassel and Reno playing buddies like Nolte and Murphy in 48 HRS completely derailed what little credibility the film had by then.It's difficult to believe that the director of THE CRIMSON RIVERS also directed GOTHIKA which though had its share of problems doesn't even come close to the awfulness of this overbaked confused film.".

	schema:reviewBody "I really liked LES RIVIRES POURPRES.When I first heard of this movie I thought What an unusual interesting and poetic title! I wonder what this movie might be all about! It could interest me. Then I saw this absolutely fantastic movie poster which I still like a lot a beautiful red  I had to think of the title again!  with the two protagonists in the background and some red blurs the blood cells of course but I didn't know that then.Then I learned something about the movie's content and thought Usually I don't like serial killer movies at all because often they're too violent but that mostly concerns Hollywood movies. So let's see what the French made out of it! Which I did shortly thereafter.And what shall I say? I really liked the movie because it was full of suspense. It had two great lead actors Jean Reno at his best Watch his face as he looks at the first corpse! and a great Vincent Cassel whom I didn't know before. The two stories in Guernon and Sarzac were well intertwined save for the end on which I will comment later on.The cinematography was overwhelming for example the shots in the mountains when Nimans drives to the crime scene in the very beginning and those when he and Fanny climb through the snowy mountains before finding the second corpse. And finally the soundtrack by Bruno Coulais was brilliantly adjusted to each scene.Moreover I liked the movie for not being too violent. Although the victims were drastically tortured before they were killed neither the torture nor the killing is shown. And the violence is not celebrated which means it's not shown as if it were any kind of fun or something the viewer also should do.Once again Watch Nimans' face while he looks at the first corpse this scene shows clearly what he thinks of the torture and the killing and that it's absolutely barbaric and immoral to do a thing like that. Hollywood movies often don't show that as clearly e. g. Is John Doe in David Fincher's absolutely disgusting and way overrated SE7EN not in a way shown as being sympathetic?.Are there any weaknesses in this movie? Yes of course there are. Firstly there are the first scenes of the movie while the credits start The camera shows a rotting human corpse which was a quite disgusting b totally unnecessary and c in no connection to the movie. Because of the corpses in LES RIVIRES POURPRES not one had the time to rot! Think about it for thirty seconds  you will see that I'm right!And then there's the end of the movie let's say the last fifteen minutes. I must admit that I didn't really understand it completely which in other words means that I don't think it's absolutely logical. In my opinion it's quite stupid and very disappointing compared to everything in the movie that happened before though I can't and won't tell you about the end in detail here go see the movie for yourself!.Shakespeare wrote All's well that ends well. Does that mean everything's bad that has a bad end? And let's face it The end of LES RIVIRES POURPRES can in my opinion only be described as really bad! The answer is no! Because for 90 of 105 minutes the movie is absolutely great and worth a watch.Behind BILLY ELLIOT and CHOCOLAT it's my third favourite movie of 2001 so far. And if not for the end it could have easily taken the first place of this list.I'd like to rate it an 8 but because of the end I can't. So I rate it a 7. But it's a strong one.".

Before anyone sends me a message pointing out that CRIMSON RIVERS is in fact a French thriller let me just say I know  I think it was the fact that everyone was speaking French that convinced me of this . When I said  A Hollywood thriller  I meant that I've seen too many of these types of movies being churned out by American studios since the early 1990s and I've no idea why the legendary French film industry would want to follow suit and if you cast Robert DeNiro and Josh Hartnett in the lead roles and set it in Montana it'd still be the same film . Come to think of it wasn't this made in the mid 1990s with Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt ? For a French film this lacks a Gallic identity People are being found dead in a French rural town with their bodies slashed  their hands chopped off and their eyeballs removed and it's up to Inspector Pierre Niemens to solve the murders while on the other side of town Sgt Max Kerkeiran is investigating the desecration of a young girl's tomb . Soon it becomes clear that the two cases are linked but what really lets the story down is the misconception involving eugenics which isn't in fact a uniquely Nazi ideal . Nazis also believed in state ownership so does that mean someone on the centre left who believes public transport should be owned by the government is in a fact a Nazi ? Aldos Huxley and HG Wells both believed in the benefit of eugenics but they were very much on the political left so characters gasping  They're Nazis  seems somewhat strange and considering the political subtext is something of red herring only introduced so Max can get involved in a quite laughable fight scene with some neofascists .The eugenics sub plot seems somewhat tenuous . It should also be said that the idea of two intellectuals breeding more intellectuals is somewhat silly . There's no evidence in the real world that intellect is in anyway down to genetics CRIMSON RIVERS is an okay film and I guess the producers were more interested in making a movie that would sell abroad hence the rather over familiar plot and techniques in story telling but certainly both Reno and Cassell will both be making better French movies in the future".

	schema:reviewBody "This film that starts out grabbing you ends out leaving you feel dazed and confused. The dead body found of a young men horribly tortured and left to die slowly is the reason d'entrance of Jean Reno. Answering a local investigators question where the unit to investigate is with a stoic I am the unit you feel you're in for something good. And that's pretty much what you get. A hunt for a killer slowly paced giving Reno all the chance to shine which he does leading you from clue to clue. Not a groundbreaking concept but the beautiful and meticulously filmed scenery quite makes up for that. Then a typical booklike twist is made introducing what appears to be another main character Vincent Cassel. His investigation into the desecration of a tomb seems to lead him to Reno's dead bodies. So far so good until out of the blue the writers feel the need to make Cassel go Chuck Norris on some wannabe Nazis's in a fight scene so absurdly bad including 1980's sound effects it makes you question what kind of movie you're actually watching. Or what movie the makers want you to watch. Unfortunately it's all downhill from here. As if the over the top action scene with the Goring 2.0's wasn't enough a whole lot more of Action Jackson is released upon the viewer as the more and more unlikely plot is revealed quite fast in contrast to the beginning of the movie. After the interesting fight the movie goes for two awards in the weird category with an even so interesting footchase ending up in the middle of anticlimax land leading right to a totally uncalled for Mexican stand off between Jean The Unit Reno and his local constabularies. From here the credit build up from the start of the movie has declined pretty much completely and the final revelation are met with a sincere Huh. So that was what that was all about. Huh. Still Jean Reno delivers which makes this film watchable.".

	schema:reviewBody "One can hardly avoid comparing this film with Seven'. But at the very least the feel of the film is different as the French influence and the beautiful mountain scenery is not something commercial American films can manage to create.  The rest however is only run of the mill crime story fare.The story has two detectives investigating seemingly separate crimes the clues for which leading them on to the same path eventually. The story can be so much better if the director and presumably the script writers can restrain themselves from all the unnecessary foreshadowing which only served to give the plot away and dispel the sense of mystery.  Have the clues from early on in the film served to distract or misdirect the audience this would have been a fine film.  As it is any member of the audience with an average IQ should be able to know what has happened and what is happening.  The only aspect I did not guess correctly during the film was the fact that eugenics was involved rather than genetic engineering. Had this been an American film I suspect they would have substituted it for genetic engineering.There are logical inconsistencies in the plot that seriously undermined the believability of the film.  For example Fanny's mother supposedly arranged for the death' of Judith yet she entered a convent and became a recluse a scant two years after the accident'.  The whereabouts of Judith is never explained and she simply popped out of nowhere at the end completely shattering the credibility of the plot.  While I am willing to take every aspect of the story as told on screen these inconsistencies are careless and cause the film to be far less enjoyable.Reno and Cassell are average in the film. They do however play their characters well giving a sense of the rebel cop with a sense of barely contained capacity for violence. Once the two are brought together the audience has a fairly good idea of what is going on and the film becomes more an action movie than a suspense.  Reno's attraction for Nadia Fares' character Fanny is however too contrived giving one the sense that the director suddenly realizes the film must end soon and is bringing the story to a close with scant regard for the abrupt change of pace. Overall the film is an entertaining piece even though it suffers from some glaring inadequacies.".

Contemporaneously Max Kerkerian investigates the desecration of a young girl's grave. Inevitably their paths are thrown together and they must team up to solve their mutual case.In its opening fifteen minutes Les Rivires Pourpres makes it seem as though it might take any of many routes to completely different films. A standard police thriller is what it eventually settles upon after some cinematographic flourishes hint toward the more appealing aspect of a drama of the effect upon detectives of witnessing the horrors they investigate. The flourishes I have mentioned are impressive but taken a degree too far on more than one occasion. Twice used is the classic dolly zoom and twice is it wasted adding nothing but wonderment at why the filmmakers would employ such a thing so redundantly. Technical highs and lows aside the film works with its two leads holding off their meeting for as long as possible. This adds to the sense that the film exists solely to pair these two playing off their respective career successes. Such careers it must be noted have come from a certain prowess in acting and this is on full display here. Reno and Cassel play off each other well Reno playing the straight man to Cassel's more comical less battlehardened cop. Speaking of comedy Kerkerian's two underlings are called upon to bear the majority of this unsuccessfully so. Their humour is misplaced and ineffective though not quite deleteriously so. The plot from which the mystery derives is a little baffling Cassel himself having gone on record as saying he doesn't understand it. It's not entirely beyond the threshold of understandability but the film doesn't exactly offer you much help in figuring out its every detail. Mentioned flaws aside it's cracking good fun truth be told. Cassel and Reno are a fine team their unveiling of this puzzling mystery well effected. Don't expect to be blown away moved to great thought or emotion or motivated to lend much memory but it's a perfectly fine way to spend one hundred minutes.A small number of narrative flaws some misused technical tricks and some poorly placed humour mar Les Rivires Pourpres to an extent but not so much so that it doesn't remain enjoyable. A nice fight sequence early on and some functional cinematographic flair are to be admired certainly giving the film a nice look to go with its decent entertainment value.".

In many ways it uses the same old cliches mismatched cops who must work together bizarre methods of death we've seen dozens of times in Hollywood thrillers but it manages to remain entertaining because of Kassovitz' energetic and inventive direction the spectacular backgrounds of the Alps and the contrasting acting styles of Cassel and Jean Reno who really seem to enjoy working together. I've heard this movie compared to 'Se7en' by several people but I really think that's not only misleading but just plain wrong. The movies are very different in style content and approach and I see very little connection between them.  While not a horror movie it's closer in many ways to 'Anatomie' only it's a much better film in every respect. It even at times reminded me of Dario Argento but I suppose most moviegoers are more aware of 'Se7en' than giallo so what can you do? Look there's no way I would argue that this is a masterpiece but it's a very well made and entertaining thriller albeit with a slightly disappointing ending. I even liked the nutty and gratuitous martial arts sequence which Cassel busted his nose filming. Not a great movie but a very good one.".

The plot can be confusing and might require a second viewing to put it all together in your mind. But the scenery the characterizations and most especially the chemistry a rarity when talking of two male leads between Jean Reno and another french actor who I am quickly coming to appreciate for his work in The Brotherhood of the wolf and Read my lips and also for being married to one of the most gorgeous women in the world Monica Bellucci the incomparable Vincent Cassell. Reno portrays a famously regarded homicide detective lured out to a remote university for the gifted by some Rural French police who have discovered a most unusual murder. It's not so much the way in which the victim was killed but rather where the body was found. On a rocky ledge high aloft a glacial peak. Attainable only by an extremely gifted climber. Cassell is a brash cocky cop working a strange defamation of a young girl's mausoleum. Somehow the two cases become entwined and the two find themselves working together to catch a killer the likes of which neither has ever seen before. See this movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!".

Was the basic idea to show that French film makers are able to do as well as Americans in the genre that include Seven and Silence of the lambs ? If so it is a total failure. It was quite a success though and has a sort of cultstatus as the first French serial killer filmand it seems considered as a good product to export. Strange.".

Was the basic idea to show that French film makers are able to do as well as Americans in the genre that include Seven and Silence of the lambs ? If so it is a total failure. It was quite a success though and has a sort of cultstatus as the first French serial killer filmand it seems considered as a good product to export. Strange.";

Casey without the doubletalk but the same nonstop garrulousness that I remember from my youth.But Casey had his captive audience of baseball writers and fans. Poor Joseph Kotcher is a retired salesman who lives with his son and his family. Though he's an excellent babysitter for his young grandson he's generally underfoot according to his daughterinlaw Felicia Farr. Son Charles Aidman gently persuades him he ought to move into a retirement home.But Matthau is just a lonely old man looking for someone to bond with. He finds someone quite unlikely in the person of Deborah Winters the new babysitter who finds herself pregnant by her boyfriend Darrell Larson. She moves in with him and not in a retirement home and they have some interesting experiences.Matthau lost the Best Actor Award to Gene Hackman and Kotch similarly lost as Best Picture to The French Connection. Still I think this one has stood the test of time a lot better.Marvin Hamlisch and Johnny Mercer wrote the song Life Is What You Make It for Kotch and it lost for Best Song to the Theme from Shaft. That one was truly unfortunate.Kotch is a picture about the person who's your grandfather old and a bit crotchety and some times a pain in the posterior as Deborah Winters says. But he's also the one with enough life experience to come through in the clutch.Come to think of it one of the things that drove Deborah crazy was his insistence on a car with an old fashioned clutch as opposed to automatic transmission.".

	schema:reviewBody "Just watched Kotch the only film Jack Lemmon directed with his pal Walter Matthau starring. Matthau plays Joseph Kotcher a retired businessman who's staying with his son Gerald Charles Aidman daughterinlaw Wilma Felicia Farr who was Lemmon's reallife wife and their baby son Duncan. Since both parents work and Joe isn't always responsible with his grandson Wilma mentions Duncan getting some beer foam and pizza from his grandpop they send him to a retirement home. This happens despite the babysitter they hired Erica Deborah Winters being not so responsible herself since she has sex with her boyfriend in Kotcher's home with Joe as witness. Needless to say Joe and Erica form an unlikely bond when she gets pregnant and he decides to go on the road instead of agreeing to the old folks home. I'll stop right there and say while I thought that the movie was going to be a little treacly with scenes of Matthau and the baby on the playground and the Marvin HamlischJohnny Mercer song Life is What You Make It playing which amazingly got an Oscar nomination it got a little better with Joe's amusing tangents throughout the picture. Erica took a little more getting used to since her tangents were initially irritating but she calmed down eventually. I was worried for her however when she first rode in Kotch's creaky 1940s car especially since neither wore a seat belt when they were running fast! The funniest scene to me was when they stopped at a gas station and as they were going to the ladies' restroom the sign near the door said Ask Attendent for Key! This happens as Erica's water broke and the attendants were very fixated on their motorcycle. Also appearing here are Larry Linville in his film debut as Erica's brother and guardian who provides some amusing moments a year before becoming Frank Burns on MASH and Ellen Geer actor Will Geer's daughter who plays Joe's late wife Vera in flashbacks in touching scenes. She was also Lemmon's exwife Frances on The Odd Couple II and recently played Katherine Mayfair's aunt on Desparate Housewives. Not a great dramedy but Lemmon the director provides some nice touches that makes one keep watching for the little moments that Matthau provides in a role that got him a second Oscar nomination. Worth a look for fans of both.".

But there was also a time that Lemmon stepped behind the camera. The result was Kotch based on a book by Katharine Topkins. Matthau plays an elderly man in the LA area who feels useless in the changing world. His son and daughterinlaw consider him a nuisance but he would rather not spend the rest of his life in a retirement home. But his life takes a new turn when he hooks up with a young pregnant woman.We're used to seeing Matthau play curmudgeons but here his character gets a new outlook on life. There's a scene towards the end that's a shocker let's just say that Walter Matthau is the last person whom you'd picture doing that. All in all a good movie. Not a masterpiece but I still recommend it.".

However somehow the script just didn't do justice for either one of these two celebrities. I've seen Deborah Winters in other movies and back then it seemed as though she gravitated towards controversial roles such as a 16year old drug addict or pregnant teenager. I absolutely hate that song Life Is What You Make It because they played it throughout this entire movie over and over again and seeing the pregnant teenage Deborah Winters and hearing Walter Matthau's New York accent as this unusually compassionate older man somehow reminded me constantly of how much I absolutely hate deadbeat teen fathers. I always got the feeling throughout the film that I just wanted a scene in which the teen father of this girl's baby got the tar knocked out of him for being such a jerk. I vaguely recall one scene in which he actually spoke with Deborah Winters after he had gotten her pregnant but he was more annoying than anything. The kind of teen father that would create a precedent in our court system to make justifiable patricide perfectly legal for all youngsters who have the indignity of having someone like him for a biological father. By the way I disagree with the title of that stupid song Life Is What You Make It. I can't believe that song even won an award. It's crass and callous in its lyrics because some people are born more privileged than others in the real world and the lyrics of that song just don't own up to that same reality of life. If you have nothing better to do with your time you may want to give this movie a peek. However if you have limited time like me it's probably not worth watching.".

Although Kurosawa himself thought of this film as a mere dress rehearsala preparation for Ran Kagemusha carries its own distinctive essence which makes it a work in the same category as its successor.The story deals around one of the greatest feudal lords and generals in Japan's history Takeda Shingen showing his unexpected and untimely demise. Although Shingen is the most powerful figure here he is used as a monument around which everything revolves and not as the principal hero.This film is full of sad and tragic moments starting with Shingen's untimely death and culminating with the rebuking of his impersonator Kagemusha. Nakadai plays the dual roles wonderfully. He is so emotionally involved in his part as Kagemusha that it seems almost uncanny. Thus we see why Kurosawa has chosen him as Mifune's successor. The other actors are also splendid and specially young Daisuke Ryu makes a startling appearance as Shingen's arch rival Oda Nobunaga.The ending is very hard to watch both the scene where Kagemusha is thrown out in the rain and the last scene which illustrates the death of the Takeda clan. What makes this film a pleasure to watch is the incredible cinematography and photography specially in the incredible dream sequence where the ghost of Shingen chases Kagemusha through red clouds as well as the hauntingly beautiful music and marvelous performances.All in all this is a great film that will grow on you the more you watch it. Although Ran is more spectacular and gripping Kagemusha is more compelling because of its epic nature. 910".

When the Lord is killed and because of a plan laid by Shingen before he died the socall Shadow Warrior must impersonate the Lord for three years. Aided by this clever plot Kurosawa shows us Japanese court ritual with help by a brilliant performance by Tatsuya Nakadai gives a fascinating picture of fifteenth century Japan.

When the Lord is killed and because of a plan laid by Shingen before he died the socall Shadow Warrior must impersonate the Lord for three years. Aided by this clever plot Kurosawa shows us Japanese court ritual with help by a brilliant performance by Tatsuya Nakadai gives a fascinating picture of fifteenth century Japan. This a fabulous movie with a particularly moving ending that shows just how great Akira Kurosawa is.";

Unlike Ran it is not Shakespearean. Unlike Seven Samurai my favorite alltime film and I believe the best film ever made it is not a western. Although epic it is about a sweet and rueful soul swallowed by karma and history. It is redemptive without overt sentiment and the lead performance by Tatsuya Nakadai is nuanced and unforgettable. I will always remember this film not for its complexity or savagery but for the simplest moments between Lord and subject between the highest self and the lowest self and most particularly the very real pain of a man caught in the vise of his own life and death.".

	schema:reviewBody "What happens to the doppelganger when the original dies?  Does he flitter out of existence or does he find his own.  Kagemusha shadow warrior in Japanese is the story of a thief who is to be hanged but is saved by a warlord's brother Katsuyori Takeda because of a peculiar resemblance to the king Shingen Takeda.  Tatsuya Nakadai brilliantly plays both roles of Shingen and the thief.  The thief is trained to fill in as Shingen's double a position previously played by his brother Katsuyori.  Shingen receives a mortal wound during a siege and the Takeda Clan retreat.  His dying wish is that he wants his death not to be known for at least three years.  Kagemusha eventually acquiesces to the role of not just doubling for the king but being a figurehead twentyfour hours a day. The intimate circle of Shingen's family and guard knows about the double. They advise him about how to be like Shingen.  He plays the part well. Shingen's son Nobukado who knows that he is the double is convinced that his father did this to spite him.  Nobukado was passed over as king and that position was granted to Shingen's grandson and Nobukado's son Takemaru as soon as he reaches of mature age.  Later in the film we realize that Shingen did this because Nobukado is too aggressive and is not leader material not to spite him.  The backing of Kagemusha helped Nobukado's one great military victory.  Nobukado would forever be in Shingen's shadow. The relationships between the thief and the Lord's men make this a fascinating film.  There is a rich tapestry of multidimensional characters. To some critics the action was too slow.  It was not as fast paced as The Seven Samurai or Yojimbo.  I think it is a mature film from a maturing director who would go on to direct another of my favorite films Ran.  This film was nominated for two academy awards and would cowin the grand prize at the Cannes Film Festival.  The juxtaposition between the titanic and minute is a favorite concept of Kurosawa.  Stolid men have tragic faults. Beggars can be kings.Kurosawa is one of the world's most famous directors.  Yet in the 1980's he did not get much respect from his home country Japan.  He had not had released a film since 1975  the beautiful and brilliant Dersu Uzala and he was reportedly suicidal.  This film would not have been made if it were not for George Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola whom helped finance this film. Lucas has always been a big fan of Kurosawa.  Star Wars was partially influenced by Kurosawa's film The Hidden Fortress.  I am a big fan of Kurosawa too.  His films always have the most beautiful cinematography intricate plots and grand characters. Kagemusha is no exception.".

	schema:reviewBody "Kagemusha is one of Kurosawa's later films in which he deals with such themes as vicarious existence and other personal illusions. One of the main ideas in the film is that if you deny your own personality as an individual and take on the superficial appearance of someone else you may experience gain and even happiness but eventually you are sure to be forced back to being yourself again and you may find yourself worse off than before. There is a piece of dialogue in the film that very clearly backs this up. The late Lord Shingen's brother in an emotional scene says I was once in my brother's shadow. Now that I have lost him it is as though I am nothing.'Kagemusha is the story of three different warlords who are all fighting for sole leadership of Japan. This premise is the foundation for the plot of the film. When one of the warlords is killed by a sniper his clan tries to keep his death a secret so they can avoid invasion and defeat at the hands of the other two clans. In order to do that they make use of a petty thief who bears a striking resemblance to the late Lord Shingen and he is put in the place of Shingen so that his death is not known by the other clans. At first this thief known as Kagemusha revels in the luxury and comfort of being in the place of Lord Shingen. He is thrilled to be the king and he literally becomes the leader of the clan simply because he bore such a strong resemblance to the previous leader. As his true identity gradually becomes clear the other clans begin to investigate his death suspecting that he is not really dead. Kagemusha's true identity is soon discovered although in the story he remained in Lord Shingen's place for over two years and he is coarsely cast out of the castle and into exile. Kagemusha is left to helplessly witness the subsequent overthrow and destruction of the clan over which he understandably seems to have developed some paternal feelings. He must now live his life with the feeling that he failed all of those people and was responsible for the destruction of their clan.When we are first introduced to Kagemusha in the opening scene of the film we find out immediately that he is a petty thief as Lord Shingen and one of his advisors are discussing in his presence his striking and almost disturbing resemblance to Shingen. For the vast majority of the rest of the film Kagemusha is seen in the place of Lord Shingen and he is ironically more likeable than the late Lord. He is more humorous he treats his mistresses better he even gets along with the Lord's own immediate family especially Takemaru better than Shingen did so the audience is able to develop a very positive attitude toward him. However it is always subtly known that he is still the thief that was picked off the streets early in the film and this is the life to which he eventually is forced to return.There is a fairly significant example of irony in Kagemusha because of the events following Kagemusha's inauguration' into the place of Lord Shingen. He is a petty thief in real life and he is put into the place of Shingen for no other reason than that he looks so much like him yet he turns out to be a very competent leader. His skill in making decisions led to the victory of many battles it even seemed that he was a more capable leader in this way than the rest of Shingen's council. It is ironic that a thief could be picked off the streets and put into a position of power and lead as skillfully as Kagemusha does. Kurosawa utilizes extensive long takes employing a film technique that seems to draw more attention to the story itself rather than the cinematography. As is almost a Kurosawa trademark there are many shots in the film where the camera as well as the characters on screen are largely motionless but they are engaged in significant an often heated conversation. Keeping in mind that Kagemusha is at least partly a war film this particular technique suggests that Kurosawa wanted the audience to have a deep understanding of the story behind the film and he used this muted technique to make sure that people were not distracted during important scenes. Kurosawa uses this realistic filmmaking technique to allow the characters tell the story rather than to fill the movie with fancy camera tricks. Very unobtrusive with incredible results.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw the director's cut about twenty years after I first saw the film. Kagemusha is as magnificent now as before but what has changed in the meantime is my appreciation of the meaning of Shakespeare's plays. The history plays and most of the tragedies were about the political dilemmas facing the new Tudor state. The Elizabethan audience sat on the edge of their seats waiting to see how political order might be restored once it had been set in disarray. The Wars of the Roses sequence culminates in the late political tragedies  Julius Caesar Macbeth Hamlet and Lear. The question is always the same. How is an impersonal modern state possible when its leader is a person the King? Or is rule by office compatible with the human flaws of the person occupying it? Shakespeare was the client of a conservative aristocratic faction no rabblerousing democrat he. But he went so deep into this political question in the course of writing all his plays that he dug deeper into this core issue of modern politics than anyone since.Kurosawa approaches the same question through the notion of a doublethe shadow of a warrior Kagemusha. Here the contrast between the office of the political leader and its personal incumbent is brought vividly to life in so many ways. The period is the Japanese equivalent of England's War of the Roses the transition from feudalism to the beginnings of the modern state. The losing side in this case is the one that tries to resolve the contradiction of personality and office by a subterfuge a thief masquerading as a lord. The winning side and founder of the Japanese state is the Tokugawa clan. The climactic battle symbolises the passage from traditional to modern warfare as the horses of the losers are mown down by fusillades of gunfire. The credits run as the corpse of the double crosses a submerged flag whose abstract symbolism shows us which aspects of feudalism the modern state will borrow. Personality is vanquished.The aesthetic vision animating this movie is incredible. There is so much to look at and admire perhaps interpret. One striking feature for me was the persistent strong breeze ripping through the banners a symbol of the winds of change running through 16th century Japan contemporary to Shakespeare's period. Because this drama was made by and for the modern cinema in many ways Kurosawa's masterpiece is better than Shakespeare.".

Rashomon Ikiru Yojimbo and The Seven Samurai may be the four most famous films he made and they were all in black and white. That format was wonderful. His films had a definitive look in that era. I would like to suggest though that he was the single best director of the color image who has existed thus far whose work I am familiar with. I have only seen two of his color films I don't even know how many he made this film and Ran but his sense of color in these two films is exquisite. I had to pause it several times during Kagemusha just to stare at the beautiful composition. I personally think that Kurosawa's talents rested mainly in the technical aspects of his films rather than the content and I'm sure many people would argue against me here. So as for the film itself I'd give it a 910 for two reasons. I was only emotionally involved during small sections of the film the end was particularly powerful and the story was somewhat difficult to follow I was confused during Yojimbo and The Seven Samurai too. I prefer Ran to this film and to all the other films of his I've seen which include Rashomon The Seven Samurai and Yojimbo. Still Kagemusha is very good.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is the best movie I have ever seen. In any language from any culture. I thought so when I first saw it thirty years ago and I still think so now despite not being able to see it in its original mind blowing widescreen form. It is not just one of the most visually beautiful films ever done. The positive reviews are all accurate but many focus too much on Kurosawa in general rather than on the particular theme of this film which is closely tied to Japanese history and ideals and which unites all the specific beauties of text and technique. This is not simply a film about historical belatedness a lament that the ancient idea of heroes is now exposed by the modern world to be a hollow fantasy as Ebert and other suggest or the Shakespearian tragedy of inevitable discrepancy between individual and historical role as in Henry V although the film includes something of these elements. It is morea beautiful elegy to a positive feudal ideal of leadership that goes beyond individual power to sacrifice for countryembodied in the figure of Takeda Shingin. Great tactician unsurpassed rider of horses and women inspiring and fearsome military leader he is also a student of the Sutras and a man who stepped right into people's hearts as one of his aides says. The opening scene shows he listens to criticism and has a sense of irony about himself when the thief who is to play his double accuses him of being a murderer he agrees but says he will do anything to unite the country in order to prevent endless war and bloodshed. The same actor plays the lord and his double with incredible depth and subtlety. Shingin is killed by a gun early in the movie as he is dying he tells his generals not to let anyone know he's dead for three yearsto let the thief replace him so as to give the clan time to prepare for confrontation with the western armed enemyand given that his clan is not armed with western firearms not to move out of its own territory. The double or shadow warrior who takes his place begins to identify with the role and finds out that literal crucifixion for theft would have been nothing compared to the loneliness at the top where the weight of the world is on the leader's shoulders. Every moment of his existence requires that he sacrifice everything personal to a role that no one can ever fill perfectly and that is now bereft of the one man who came closest to doing so. The kagemusha doesn't have Shingin's riding ability or his wounds or the depth of selfunderstanding to fill the lord's role and when he cockily believes he can do so for a moment he is discovered and thrown out. Neither he nor any modern man trying to live an identity larger than himselfincluding the artist who like the kagemusha is creating a shadow of the idealcan replace this feudal ideal which was superseded literally massacred at the end starting over 400 years ago by Christianized and technologized decadence represented by Nobunaga and Ieyasu. The kagemusha learns slowly as we do what the ABSENCE of the irreplaceable Shingin means to his people and symbolically to Japan. Many scenes build up as if to a great battle or political confrontation and the generals keep the show going but it is all hollowthe leader is gone. Shingin's ambitious and overeager son then leads the Takeda clan out of the mountainsto a destruction by western technology reminiscent of Hiroshima and Nagasaki especially since the historical battle was at a place named Nagashino. The point of the film is to show a lost ideal of the past which can never be regained and without which everything afterward is a shadow like the kagemusha shadow warrior. The double like the artist seems possessed with Shingen's ghost in the last scenes as he watches in horror while the son in a selfcentered Oedipal frenzy destroys the flower of his people by moving beyond the legitimate limits of his territory and his scope and the double can only throw a futile spear at the modern weaponry which destroys him. But a shadow identity from a meaningful past is better than none at all Kurosawa shores these fragments against modern ruins at least as well as T.S. Eliot in The Waste Land.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have seen nearly all of Akira Kurosawa's films so my opinion shouldn't be completely ignored. Although I am in the distinct minority I didn't particularly like KAGEMUSHA. Yes it was big and beautiful and had great scope but it was also emotionally sterile and bore little resemblance to Kurosawa's earlier more famous works. The same by the way can be said about RAN. Both films had relatively HUGE budgets but the dialog and connectedness between the characters was lacking. As a result I felt pretty bored when I watched both of themespecially this film. So if you compare these two movies with THE 7 SAMURAI or YOJIMBO for example they seem VERY different. These older films though not filmed in color had a greater sense of humanity about themgreat importance was placed on the INTERRELATIONSHIPS between the characters AND the camera work was very different with more closeups and a more intimate feel. So while RAN and KAGEMUSHA were pretty to look at I felt much more detached from them and cared much less about the characters. I really think the problem with these two movies and the reason I like them less than the average Kurosawa film was that the big budget in these later films actually HURT them as too much emphasis was placed on effects and dialog was purely secondary.So in summary I am the oddball that didn't love this film. You will probably disagree and might be tempted to mark my review as not helpful as the reviews on IMDb are generally glowing. But having seen many Japanese films I can't help but feel there are better films out there waiting to be seen. Most any other Kurosawa film and films by other great directors such as THE SAMURAI TRILOGY the films of Yasujiro Ozu are more appealing to me. I think the popularity of this film is in part due to its having been seen in theaters by more Westerners than any other of Kurosawa's filmsSEEK OUT HIS EARLIER AND MIDCAREER FILMSthey are better and far more emotionally involving.".

	schema:reviewBody "Another samurai epic by the master of the genre Akira Kurosawa which I find to be a mostly fulfilling attempt.The film follows the life of a peasant thief named Kagemusha who happens to look like the warlord of the Takeda clan Shingen. He is found by Shingen's brother Nobukado where he is trained to be Shingen's third body double in case of emergency. Of course this fate is realized when a assassin's sniper rifle finds Lord Shingen during a battle. Shengin remains alive for a while to let his men know that he wanted to be alive three more years for it was his goal to capture Kyoto and if he should die he would want it kept a secret so his clan would not go into disarray. Unfortunately Shingen passes from his wound and it is decided by the his cabinet that Kagemusha must pretend to be Shingen for three years this secret is even kept from Shingen's family.It is important for his double to keep his persona for if his enemies were to suspect lord Shigen dead then they wouldn't have fear of attacking but knowing that he may still be living made them second guess their attacks and kept the clan safe. It also helped to protect the clan from itself for the warlords replacement was a mere boy and a son who is blanketed by his father's shadow who is trying desperately to find himselfwhich is a major theme of the film.Their are many themes in this film of which to talk about but the most important one is finding ones self. Shingen's son Katsuyori is very lost even before his father's death. His son is the next in line to become leader of the clan which brings him much embarrassment for he has felt his father was not fairing of him making him want to distance himself from Shingen's lore. These feelings later in the film become cataclysmic as certain discoveries are made. Kagemusha himself is lost between loyalty to his master and still knowing himself which he is not able to be under the circumstances. There is a point in the film when he takes the persona too far it has dire consequences but it puts things back in perspective for him where he finds what he truly loves.The first two hours of the film are phenomenal but the battle sequences once began got a little confusing at times especially a scene at night where you're not sure who the friends or enemies are. I didn't fully understand the sequence until it had ended and I felt it was the weakest part of the film lasting I believe between 1520 minutes. I wasn't a big fan of the ending also it felt a little rushed to me for Kurosawa which I find to be out of character for him but I will say the films final shot was magnificent.To Conclude I would say that despite the weak final act the rest of the film was very entertaining with an interesting premise and strong characters. If you are a Kurosawa fan you will love it as I did however it is definitely not in the category of Seven Samurai or Roshomon. Visually astoundingthe nightmare sequence was my favorite at times and maybe a little confusing at others in the end it is to good of a film to pass up on even if it has its flaws.".

	schema:headline " perhaps the most visually stylistic in the plethora of films by the greatest Japanese director and one heck of a motion picture";
	schema:reviewBody "Akira Kurosawa 19101998 was one of the true masters of the cinema. It was he and people like him that proved to the audience that filmmaking is not merely a gallimaufry of the various forms of entertainment but art. Filmmaking is art inside as well as out. And Kurosawa's dark and brilliant 1980 film Kagemusha qualifies without fault. Though the art is more apparent on the outside there is plenty of it inside as well.Kagemusha translates in English as Shadow Warrior the alias given to the unnamed protagonist of the film. The Kagemusha is a condemned bandit who is saved from the gallows when the brother of daimyo Takeda Shingen discovers that he bears a striking resemblance to the bloodthirsty dictator. The bandit is promised freedom if he impersonates the warmongering lord for three years in order to confuse his enemies. However when the real Shingen is shot and killed by a sharpshooter the Kagemusha is forced to take all responsibilities of the lifestyle of the lord such as commanding his armies outwitting his enemies and serving as a fatherfigure to his grandson.The Kagemusha is played by veteran actor Tatsuya Nakadai whom fought against Toshiro Mifune in both Yojimbo and Sanjuro and would later work on Akira Kurosawa's highly acclaimed 1985 film Ran. He also plays the real Takeda Shinge in the opening portion of the film and Nakadai is utterly brilliant in the way he switches between both roles even though these two men are in a way identical. It's the way Nakadai acts that we can sense a character difference between the two. An enormous deal of credit is also due to the writers one of whom is director Kurosawa who made the brilliant decision of never revealing the actual name of the Kagemusha. And strangely enough because the writing is so good and Nakadai's acting is so pure though we don't know the man's name we can identify and sympathize with him which is exactly what we do in the last third of the movie. The most brilliant element of the film's human level is the way Nakadai bonds with the grandson of the man whom he is impersonating and the way he discovers that he is not only a better father figure but a better person than the actual ruler.Regardless of your opinion on the movie there is one thing everybody agrees on there is beauty painted all over the screen. There's not a badlylit or badlycomposed frame in the entire film. We get a surreal arrayflooded nightmare sequence gorgeous landscape shots majestic views of the ocean and much more. Kurosawa always storyboarded his films using painting as opposed to sketches and here he just let loose an array of passion and colors that undoubtedly mirror what he did while trying to sell the story to distributors. Like he would do with Ran although not quite to the same extent Kurosawa graphically reenacts violence with an artistic but harrowing nature that is completely foreign to the glorified stimulating duels of Yojimbo. Blood is let loose in torrents throughout the film but Kurosawa does not overdo it to the point where it might condescend into some kind of an unintentional comedy. The climax of the movie a recreation of the 1575 Battle of Nagashino brilliantly generates a reaction from the audience and the famous fourminute montage of death and suffering that follows is truly gripping. Like the final showdown of Sergio Leone's The Good the Bad and the Ugly very little happens and this may sound like a premise for an overdrawn sequence but every second of it is overwhelmingly strong. Perhaps the reason why Akira Kurosawa had such a difficult time getting backers was because he wanted absolute control over his films. Well he hardly got support and in this case he needed financial assistance from Western admirers George Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola but when he did have the money and the control Kurosawa was relentlessly brilliant.The running time of Kagemusha will question the full extent of its audience as will the scenes where very little happens for a while but for those who appreciate a good movie and have three hours to spare this is a tremendously enthralling experience. Kagemusha boasts a lot of exterior display but unlike a great many other movies that have the same accolade of looking good Kurosawa's movie shows beauty beneath as well on the human level encompassing the audience with a heck of a story. It had me drawn in right from the very beginning. This is the definition of a motion picture.Footnote keep an eye out in the film for Takashi Shimura one of Kurosawa's veterans Seven Samura Ikiru Yojimbo etc. in one of his last performances.".

However when the real Shingen is shot and killed by a sharpshooter the Kagemusha is forced to take all responsibilities of the lifestyle of the lord such as commanding his armies outwitting his enemies and serving as a fatherfigure to his grandson.The Kagemusha is played by veteran actor Tatsuya Nakadai whom fought against Toshiro Mifune in both Yojimbo and Sanjuro and would later work on Akira Kurosawa's highly acclaimed 1985 film Ran. He also plays the real Takeda Shinge in the opening portion of the film and Nakadai is utterly brilliant in the way he switches between both roles even though these two men are in a way identical. It's the way Nakadai acts that we can sense a character difference between the two. An enormous deal of credit is also due to the writers one of whom is director Kurosawa who made the brilliant decision of never revealing the actual name of the Kagemusha. And strangely enough because the writing is so good and Nakadai's acting is so pure though we don't know the man's name we can identify and sympathize with him which is exactly what we do in the last third of the movie. The most brilliant element of the film's human level is the way Nakadai bonds with the grandson of the man whom he is impersonating and the way he discovers that he is not only a better father figure but a better person than the actual ruler.Regardless of your opinion on the movie there is one thing everybody agrees on there is beauty painted all over the screen. There's not a badlylit or badlycomposed frame in the entire film. We get a surreal arrayflooded nightmare sequence gorgeous landscape shots majestic views of the ocean and much more. Kurosawa always storyboarded his films using painting as opposed to sketches and here he just let loose an array of passion and colors that undoubtedly mirror what he did while trying to sell the story to distributors. Like he would do with Ran although not quite to the same extent Kurosawa graphically reenacts violence with an artistic but harrowing nature that is completely foreign to the glorified stimulating duels of Yojimbo. Blood is let loose in torrents throughout the film but Kurosawa does not overdo it to the point where it might condescend into some kind of an unintentional comedy. The climax of the movie a recreation of the 1575 Battle of Nagashino brilliantly generates a reaction from the audience and the famous fourminute montage of death and suffering that follows is truly gripping. Like the final showdown of Sergio Leone's The Good the Bad and the Ugly very little happens and this may sound like a premise for an overdrawn sequence but every second of it is overwhelmingly strong. Perhaps the reason why Akira Kurosawa had such a difficult time getting backers was because he wanted absolute control over his films. Well he hardly got support and in this case he needed financial assistance from Western admirers George Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola but when he did have the money and the control Kurosawa was relentlessly brilliant.The running time of Kagemusha will question the full extent of its audience as will the scenes where very little happens for a while but for those who appreciate a good movie and have three hours to spare this is a tremendously enthralling experience. Kagemusha boasts a lot of exterior display but unlike a great many other movies that have the same accolade of looking good Kurosawa's movie shows beauty beneath as well on the human level encompassing the audience with a heck of a story. It had me drawn in right from the very beginning. This is the definition of a motion picture.Footnote keep an eye out in the film for Takashi Shimura one of Kurosawa's veterans Seven Samura Ikiru Yojimbo etc. in one of his last performances.";

But still I remained interested in this one and it looked good. But lordy did I find this one a big beautiful empty bore. I mean sure the visuals are crazy good at times lovely colors and it is just in general a great looking movie. Excellent design and all. But at the same time I sort of feel that's all that was to it.The performances here aren't nearly as stilted or obnoxious as some in Ran and in fact I really like Tatsuya Nakadai in this. The problem here is that I don't think anyone involved was given much interesting material to work with. It isn't that I don't think there is an interesting story to be told here but I sort of see this movie as a missed opportunity. Instead of focusing more on developing the character of the impersonator too much time is spent on scenes of rival sides scheming and questioning if Shingen is alive or dead. Things seem to only be addressed on the surface and the character interactions are never given enough time to breath. More importantly this might not be as much of a problem if the film didn't move at such an excruciating pace. Some films are deliberately paced a certain way and some films are slowburning but this one just feels slow period and without much of a purpose most of the time.Additionally I often found that scenes and drama were laboriously setup within the story then those scenes slowly unfolded and then there is little actual payoff. Take for instance the section of the story where the one Clan leader decides to send a priest carrying medicine as a supposed gift to Shingen but really they want to find out if Shingen is actually alive or not. This is thoroughly explained by the Clan leader. Then when the priest arrives Shingen or the impersonator and his fellow leaders discuss how they KNOW what the other Clan leader is up to and how they must hide it! Then when the scene actually HAPPENS there ends up being little to no tension and nothing actually comes of it. It's just completely frustrating to watch! Scenes go on forever and sometimes the film just feels dead. All of a sudden then we'll cut to a scene of rousing music as men on horseback prepare for battle. It felt like it all had no real flow at all. Even the battle scenes were really disappointing  the ones at night were very hard to follow.I will admit that the movie can be a stunner at times. That ending is really something but even then it feels like the film is shouting LOOK HOW EPIC AND TRAGIC I AM!!!! Sort of like Ran really. But in retrospect this film makes me appreciate Ran even more for where that movie sort of falls apart for me in its later stages at least it had a little umpf to it. Kagemusha feels like it never actually gets off the ground. Kurosawa is a great filmmaker but I can't get behind this one.".

	schema:headline " A war film with no battle scenes but a lot of heart";
	schema:reviewBody "This is Akira Kurosawa's penultimate historical epic made before his last such film RAN in 1985. Kurosawa is best known for his string of successful samurai flicks made during the 1950s  the likes of SEVEN SAMURAI THRONE OF BLOOD and HIDDEN FORTRESS which have wowed critics and audiences alike for the last half century. KAGEMUSHA THE SHADOW WARRIOR is a film that sometimes recaptures those glory days but for the most part is a lesser cousin to those classic works. Where films like SEVEN SAMURAI were epic in every sense of the word the only thing epic about KAGEMUSHA is the running time which is seriously overlong. This means that there are quite a few slowpaced scenes which add exposition detail and character so only the most patient viewers need apply.Yet this isn't the biggest problem with this flawed film. The major issue is the budget which ran out before production was complete meaning that George Lucas came in to supply funding when Toho lucked out. In the end this provides Kurosawa with the biggest joke of all he's made a war film without any battle scenes except he tricks us into thinking he has. He shoots a major incident during the night relying on some excellent sound effects to recreate the noise and feel of warfare my favourite trick is the use of a flickering red and blue back screen to simulate the burning of a castle. Even at the climax we only hear and then see the aftermath of a huge decisive battle.The good news is that these things aren't too much of a problem because at heart KAGEMUSHA is a character piece all about the guy who pretends to be Shingen. Tatsuya Nakadai takes the duel role of warlord and standin and he's frankly excellent the finest element of the film. He crafts a believable character a man living his life as a lie and his development from a petty thief to a man who really believes that he's Shingen himself is spellbinding. It helps that he's supported by a great cast all of whom are adept at the official Japanese 'stony face' stance. Kurosawa's is a film of small telling details and the fact that the whole thing is based on a true story makes what happens even more amazing. A mature intelligent work of film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Akira Kurosawa acclaimed Japanese film writer and director is probably best known in the west via his influence on many notable new wave era filmmakers. Here two of those Kurosawa acolytes George Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola repaid the debt as it were by helping to finance the Japanese veteran's most ambitious and stupendous epic yet. In spite of its grandeur Kurosawa would later dismiss Kagemusha as a mere dress rehearsal for Ran his even vaster epic of 1985. But when watching this earlier picture's awesome pageantry and historical reenactment one's likely response is some rehearsal! Kagemusha takes Kurosawa back to his biggest hits of the 1950s being set in wartorn feudal Japan. However the focus is very different moving away from the peasants bandits and disgraced warriors as protagonists and smallscale human relations as his themes now looking at the machinations of the highest echelon of that society with an often cold and distant eye. Since his 1971 suicide attempt Kurosawa seemed to become more cynical and detached from human affairs not just as a writer but also in his technical style as a director. Kagemusha contains very few closeups with even key dialogue scenes filmed with vast gaps between camera and actors and objective godshots for the busier scenes.And yet there are similarities here with Kurosawa's much earlier pictures especially in the director's aesthetic use of movement and stillness within the frame. Check out the scene in which the soldiers hear an enemy playing a flute from across the lines. The men are completely motionless and the only movement is a flickering fire in the background and the occasional twitch of a flag in the breeze. It makes for a considerably mystical moment. But this approach has a function beyond the aesthetic. The opening scene filmed all in one shot shows Lord Shingen the impersonator both played by Tatsuya Nakadai and Nobukado Tsotomu Yamazaki all sat in the throne room. The impersonator does not speak until near the end of the scene but our eyes are drawn to him because of his movements  the occasional change in posture or flash of the eyes  and the comparative stillness of the other two. This long unbroken take means the room with its great floral crest is imposed into our minds and resonates later on when we see Nakadai in the same room now instated as the lord.And despite the distances between camera and cast the colourful costumes against plain backdrops really puts an emphasis on the people in Kagemusha allowing them to express themselves through body language more than facial expression. Lead man Tatsuya Nakadai is really adept at this putting so much feeling into a shrug of his shoulders or a turn of his head. When you see in this picture the complex vocal arrangements and stylised movements of the Noh troupe or the drummers who are able to make two strikes a fraction of a beat apart you see examples of precise coordination in many formal rituals of Japanese culture. Nakadai has that same precision and control over his body and turns them towards both theatrical gesture and realist reaction. And in those one or two cases in which we get to see his face closeup we see his talent there too an ability to display a real look of emotional injury.So far there is very little I have said about Kagemusha that one could not also say about the later epic Ran with the exception of Ran being a little an even bigger production and a little more stylised. So perhaps Kurosawa was right to think of the earlier picture as being a lesser forerunner to the later one. And yet Kagemusha has the edge over Ran in one aspect. Whereas Ran is a totally dismal and inhumane affair Kagemusha retains the heart and humanism of Kurosawa's older pictures. Composer Shinichiro Ikebe provides a rousing orchestral score shot through with a touch of melancholy and this beautifully matches the tone of the whole piece. It may lack the hopeful message of Seven Samurai or Rashomon but it has the same warm regard for its characters that even with a more objective eye Kurosawa allows us to share in.".

The full version is almost three hours long when the American version is way too long at only 2.5 hours. This really is the only gripe about the film and if it were shorter it would be worthy of an 8 or 9 out of ten. As it is this is not recommended unless you have a lot of patience.".

	schema:reviewBody "After six years of break his last great film Dersu Uzala had made in the Soviet Union in 1974  Akira Kurosawa had the support of influential Americans Francis Coppola and George Lucas who interceded with the Fox to that funded his project Kagemusha in exchange for worldwide distribution rights of the film.Everything that came after the film had the technical aspect of a great production Hundreds of extras a carefully staged appropriate to the sixteenth century apparel obtained from museum collections true picture of high relief a majestic soundtrack performed by a full symphony and a protagonist of many carats and was Tatsuya Nakadai. They wanted to recreate the intricacies of power the life of the great warlords with their rivalries their struggles gut their affections and passions his stratagems and his use of humans for its sole convenience.

I have a personal problem with any script which talks about real people but tempers with the facts. This movie does that. Shingen is the most important figure in the medieval period in Japan. There is no mention anywhere in the history that his look alike ruled for three years. Other than that Its awesome. I think Kurusowa is one those great directors whose movies are bigger than the screen itself. The movie is unbelievable. Its a tearjerker at times and very hard hitting.

	schema:reviewBody "This film is set at the beginning of the Warring States era of Japanese history which most Japanese film viewers would have studied extensively in school. Unfortunately for Western viewers these historical aspects are therefore given little exposition making some aspects of the film hard to follow for those without such schooling.Here are some attempts at liner notes to help in understanding and appreciating the film warning I'm not Japanese and have not had Japanese schooling Shingen Takeda is a warlord vying for power with Oda Nobunaga and his ally Ieyasu. Takeda had a reputation for the military prowess of their cavalry. Thus you see lots and lots of horses featured in the film.  Horses were important to the clan. Takeda's symbol is the four diamonds the exact symbolism is explained in the film. Just as in the West use of such heraldic symbols in war banners and clothing was very useful in figuring out who is who. So keep in mind that when you see the four diamonds whatever their color those are Takeda forces. Nobunaga was known for his adoption of many Western ways. This is why he wears Europeaninfluenced clothing and doesn't have the standard samurai haircut basically shaved head topknot. Nobunaga was also known for his use of rifles in battles. So one of the themes of the film is the struggle of tradition against the influence of the West in the film mostly shown through the use of guns although their is also a brief shot of some clerics. Nobunaga's symbol is the fivesectioned flower. Nobunaga is also known for his love of Noh dramas a dramatic form incorporating difficulttounderstand archaic language and restrained careful action somewhat like the film Kagemusha itself.  Nobunaga launches into a bit of Noh at one point in the film. At this early time Ieyasu was mostly known for his political survival skills. Ieyasu is probably best known to American viewers as the basis for James Clavell's Toranaga character in Shogun.  Nobunaga is also in Shogun albeit as a minor character and under a different name.  The events in this film take place roughly two decades prior to those in Shogun. Takeda's generals each also have their own symbols to help you track them. One of Ieyasu's generals also has a symbol actually the character hon which IMDb will not display. Haircuts are a sign of rank. This is why all the lords except Nobunaga have a certain haircut all the pages have the same hairstyle and so forth. The haircutrank connection figures even more strongly and explicitly in Kurosawa's Throne of Blood. Japanese men during this period often changed their names as their status changed. For example in Toshie to Matsu Toshie who is one of Nobunaga's and later Hideyoshi's and Ieyasu's generalslords is granted the honor of changing his name to one which incorporates part of his lord's name into his own. Keep this in mind as Takeda's son discusses the use of his father's name and symbol. Miltary success and bravery in battle were key means of advancement. Thus military leaders of this time are often depicted as evervolunteering to do brave even stupidly brave things in hopes of gaining greater status. In Kagemusha Takeda's son is desperate for such advancement.".

	schema:reviewBody "Debutant director Vivek Sharma's 'Bhoothnath' is a delightful treat to watch. His execution shows that he's among the promising directors. The camerawork is very impressive. The special effects are superb something one hardly witnesses in an Indian film. Not only do they look great they are very effectively used. What makes 'Bhoothnath' better than other films of its genre is that it appeals to both adults and children especially because of the comedy. Viewers can easily connect to the characters as are very likable and very real. Anjali isn't just the stereotypical mother one has grown too familiar with in a children's film. She's a loving mother alright but one that hates to cook and one that's honest enough to the principal to tell him in good humour that her son is a 'nightmare'. Banku isn't your average filmy kid and credit goes to the actor for that. He is the likable little brat one would recognize in themselves. And of course there's 'Bhoothnath' who could have easily been a caricature but remains a welldefined character that is courageous stubborn vulnerable caring and eventually friendly.The writing is mostly good. The inspiration by films like 'Bogus' 'Casper' and 'The Sixth Sense' may show but 'Bhoothnath' is very much its own film. The dialogues are great and the film moves at a steady pace. However the Ashish ChaudhuryNauheed Cyrusi track could have better been left out. Their belowaverage acting give the impression that 'Bhoothnath' is just another cheesy horror film. That may have been Sharma's intention in order to surprise the viewer but I don't think it's necessary. The demonic daughterinlaw is a caricature that feeds the stereotype of Americans being careless towards family. There are a few plot holes. how is it that Bhoothnath can touch Banku at times but during a key scene Banku is about to fall down the stairs but Bhoothnath is unable to save him because his hand moves through Banku's. Also the whole death ritual track looks a bit out of place but at the same time this scene brilliantly displays Banku's innocence. Banku thinks that ritual is to celebrate Bhoothnath's birthday and he happily participates. Moreover this scene is wonderfully executed. The closeups shifting back and forth from Amitabh's sad face as he knows he'll never see Banku again to Aman's thrilled face as he thinks Bhootnath will be promoted to 'star' angel. Though things get more emotional in the second half Sharma manages to balance it well with the rest.I have to say that Amitabh Bachchan really blew me away as 'Bhoothnath'. I did not like him in any of his films post 1980something with the exception of 'Baghban' but he totally owns Bhoothnath. There is one scene where he overacts but I suppose it's become his trademark to have at least one scene where he screams. Nonetheless this flaw is very minor and can be overlooked given his otherwise consistent performance. His heartbreaking acting scene while he watches a happy Banku and his parents perform his 'last rites' reminded me of the exceptional actor he was in the 70s. Juhi Chawla is excellent as she brings charisma devotion and liveliness to Anjali. Her Anjali is a laidback woman but a caring mother. I don't understand why they people compared her to Aishwarya Rai's glycerin shedding performance in 'Umrao Jaan'. Whether she used glycerin or not in the crying scenes she played her part very well and brought out Anjali's fear of losing her child and her sympathy for Bhoothnath. Last year there was 'Taare Zameen Par's Darsheel Safari and this year it is newcomer Aman Siddiqui who surprises the audience with a superb performance. Siddiqui simply acts like a child in a very natural way. He isn't one of those kids who overly tries to be cute begging for the audience to go 'awww'. He too owns his part. Shahrukh Khan has a strong presence in a small role. He and Juhi have always been magic together on screen and it was great to see them play parents. Satish Shah and Rajpal Yadav are respectively hilarious as the 'bullying' principal and thief. All these actors share a good chemistry. While it's good to see Priyanshu Chatterjee after his absence from films he is simply okay here.Among the songs I really liked the 'Aandhi' track filmed on the children in their different getups. But it was weird to see the little girls dressed as prostitutes. 'Chale Jaane Do' is a sweet track sung by Amitabh and Juhi. I didn't like the hip hop track 'Mere Buddy' so much.In a nutshell 'Bhoothnath' is one of the better films of the genre. Forget all those pretentious crap 'Krishh' and 'Koi Mil Gaya'. 'Bhoothnath' too may be a larger than life film but one that connects to both adults and children. In spite of a 2hour 15 minutes length it didn't feel like a waste. Why should it if you're having fun?".

But it was weird to see the little girls dressed as prostitutes. 'Chale Jaane Do' is a sweet track sung by Amitabh and Juhi. I didn't like the hip hop track 'Mere Buddy' so much.In a nutshell 'Bhoothnath' is one of the better films of the genre. Forget all those pretentious crap 'Krishh' and 'Koi Mil Gaya'. 'Bhoothnath' too may be a larger than life film but one that connects to both adults and children. In spite of a 2hour 15 minutes length it didn't feel like a waste. Why should it if you're having fun?";

In a way this is not a typical BR Chopra film and yet in a way it is  a simple film portraying a simple story.Anjali Sharma with her husband Aditya who works on cruise liner and their son move to Goa and when they inform several taxi drivers as to where they want to go all except one refuse to take them. Enroute to the house the driver informs them that the house is haunted and soon Aditya has to go to work leaving Anjali to set up everything and including sending their son to a nearby school. One night upon waking up she sees her son looking for an ice cream bowl that he dropped only moments back. He even tells her that he has seen a ghost. But soon the ghost and the little boy become friends.The movie stars Amitabh Bachchan Juhi Chawla Satish Shah Rajpal Yadav Lalit Parasher and both Priyanshu and Shah Rukh Khan make a friendly appearance. This is produced by Ravi Chopra and is directed by Vivek Sharma.This movie to an extent has the echoes of Baghban where family drama is concerned and is a good comedy where the friendship between the boy and the ghost as well as Rajpal Yadav and Satish Shah are concerned. But the friendship between the ghost and the son is more like a relationship between a grandson and grandfather. Besides the director Vivek Sharma roping in two of the most popular Bollywood stars in his directorial debut what is really interesting the family drama angle of the story  its not just for children as some have suggested or as some think its also for adults.The music by Vishal  Shekhar is quite melodious and worth listening and more so when Amitabh sings.Conclusion This is one movie that is worth while watching with family including children. But if a family drama does make you cry then I suggest you take some tissues with you.".

Acting wise Amitabh Bachchan comes again with a spot on performance I didn't know that a Ghost character can be played so naturally. The small boy does his part high great confidence and comes up with great performance. Other cast have less time in the movie but they do their parts neatly. No songs a plus point. Direction is good.

A simple story told in even simpler format by Vivek Sharma touches your strings. The music is okay so is the cinematography but what stands out is the chemistry between the duo and its fun to see an 8 year old standing and matching shoulders with the greatest actor of all times..But in any case it's a movie worth watching this summer and might provide for some good lessons on forgiveness. As for parents watch out for the athletic meet scene where Amitabh explains that success can be achieved only by hard work and not magic A good lesson to be learnt...And yeah Juhi Chawla is good and so is Shahrukh Khan who is there for a few scenes..Go watch this at least its far better than the so called mindless movies dished out..Do take a few tissues with you..You might just need them but wouldn't mind nevertheless..".

	schema:reviewBody "Frankly speaking after some big recent flops I decided to leave all my expectations at home before watching Bhoothnath. And what a pleasant and quality surprise it was. Director Vivek Sharma's debut movie is purely as per the tradition of BR films who believe in simple family dramas told in a sober way. It is not a scary movie at all but on the contrary it is a loving emotional family movie mainly for the kids.As a cool breeze in the summer here comes a novel script with a new outlook towards the Atma phenomenon. Don't expect a tried and tested formula as the movie does have some fresh content with an emotional touch. The usual family drama is also there which can be termed as the trademark of BR films. But putting all together you will enjoy watching it with your family especially with the kids.The main character of the movie is a 8 year old Aman Siddiqui playing Bonku who becomes friend with the spirit in his house. Amitabh Bachhan plays the old man the spirit living in the house and is visible only to Bonku. The child Aman has given a splendid performance high on confidence. He has delivered an act at par with the veterans. Amitabh Bachhan has again proved that he is the one  only in the industry capable of giving such performances at this age. The people who gave comments about his retirement should start searching places to hide after seeing Bhoothnath.Though the movie starts a little slow but then picks up fast as the spirit is introduced. The first scene of Bonku's interaction with Amitabh is well executed and has excellent special effects. The best scene comes before the interval when Bonku gets injured in an accident. This well written and brilliantly executed scene at once connects you with the key characters and you start enjoying the movie more.The second half is heavy on emotions but all the emotions are on the happy side. You enjoy the tears along with the happenings on the screen. The last 20 minutes of the movie are very well written and directed. The director is right on his tracks all the way and does a brilliant job in his first venture. He shows his hold over the medium as he talks to the point and has very less unwanted scenes in the script. It is clear that he doesn't believe in too much style but believes in content told in a simple but impressive way without any gloss.Performance wise no doubt both Aman  Amitabh are at the top of the list. Juhi Chawla is fresh and bubbly as ever. Surprisingly Shahrukh Khan in special appearance gives a very soft and underplayed performance and manages to impress in the few scenes he had. There is one underrated actor in the movie who shines bright in the climax and he is Priyanshu Chatterjee. He is a bundle of talent still waiting for the right opportunity to come his way and he proves this in his small role in the movie. Satish Shah is enjoyable as the School Principal but Rajpal Yadav is completely wasted as a mad man.The weakest point of the movie is its music by Vishal  Shekhar. This is their second let down in a row after Tashan. If only they had given some better songs the movie would have been more enjoyable. Still it was nice to hear Amitabh  Juhi Chawla singing a song. Sukhwinder's voice was perfect in the climax song. And the act by Aman  Amitabh was of first rate in the song Mere Buddy. They both look very cute together in the Hip Hop avtar.In nutshell Bhootnath is an entertaining family movie with two Amitabh's in it one 8 and one 60. It looses point only due to its music.".

In other words it had a little bit of everything for every age e.g. First half is for children  second half is for adults. The film had a very nice funny emotional and heart touching relationship between a little boy and a ghost.It is the directorial debut of Vivek Sharma and is produced by the team behind Baghban  Baabul. This year their have been extremely disappointing directorial debut films that were completely rubbish like U Me aur Hum  Tashan but Bhootnath isn't. It also has been a long time since Shah Rukh Khan  Juhi Chawla came back together on screen. I have always liked their on screen chemistry ever since I've seen Darr so I was glad to see them together again. The music is OK and they will appeal to children and the only catchy song is Mere Buddy.The only scene I didn't like is the very first song were all the children are dressed up like teenagers I felt like it was unnecessary and did not suit the mood for the film otherwise Bhootnath is a very sweet film that leaves a smile on your face throughout and I also liked the teacher who steals all the lunchboxes and the photo of him on his desk eating a huge sandwich was really funny. The opening credits was interesting when the candle burned out and the smoke turned into the title of the movie.".

There's plenty of genuine family entertainment with a few nice songs and it starts out very well but the film eventually gets bogged down in vapid sentimentality albeit always with a high moral tone. Avuncular Amitabh is the only reason to stay to the end to see him go through every conceivable emotion although one of my favourite pieces was Samay Ka Pahiya sung at the climax. I felt it when he fell all the way down the stairs even if he didn't!

	schema:reviewBody "The film starts out well...family shifts into desolate haunted mansion...child stumbles onto resident but friendly spirit...makes friends...get the picture? This premise could have been turned into an unforgettable children's movie...throw in some CGI effects school pranks the bully at school a treasure hunt maybe? This formula works...at least in the first half of the film and you rush to get more popcorn and ice cream for the kids anticipating the fun and games that follow in the second half as well...Alas this is where it comes apart...for some strange reason the script decides to get into the story of the spirit and how he got there in the first place...what a waste of a brilliant plot! What follows instead of a laugh riot in the second half is a melodramatic and clichd saga of parents being neglected by a heartless son and a story of forgiveness and liberation. The story is well told in Bollywood melodrama style no problem there  but what is this bit doing in a kiddie movie?! Im sure the filmmakers want to educate children on the rights and the wrongs of life and build moral character and all that...but not after setting the tone for a fun filled light hearted comic caper about a friendly bhoot! My problem with the movie is the way the script changes track from being a wholesome summer entertainer to a rather serious tearjerking sermon about duties towards parents and liberation of an unsatisfied soul...Technically the movie is excellent...great cinematography...brilliant visuals...some really stunning shots of Goa neat editing and a passable music score.Performances AB is brilliant as ever proving once again that this is one actor who continues to amaze us with his versatility and dedication to the role. AB looks and feels every bit the Bhoothnath that he portrays. Juhi Chawla comes up with a good performance as the exasperated mother and SRK is thankfully restrained. Satish Shah as the school principal tickles the funny bone with his fake irani accent and Rajpal Yadav plays the drunken bum to the hilt. The icing on the cake though is the performance of the child artiste Aman Siddiqui who plays the lively cherubic four year old.This could have been the ideal summer holiday movie but for the second half!".

Also the part with the dry leaves have also been handled very deftly both from the technology point of view and from the story narration point of view. On the whole without realizing i enjoyed the movie thoroughly. I am taking out the 1 point if only the ending could have been more crispier... Check out for its sequel ..!!!. Go for it ..

	schema:headline " Mr B Does it Better";
	schema:reviewBody "Right from Scene 1 Shot 1  I knew what I was going to expect. The very first scene of this movie shows two people trespassing into an abandoned home and being scared away by a ghost. Um sounds familiar  awe come one! You watched it in Casper didn't you? Yep so did I.Bhoothnath is a movie that loosely inspires itself from the 1995 Hollywood movie Casper. It's about a ghost Amitabh Bachchan who doesn't allow anyone inside his home but fails every attempt to scare a little boy out of the house. Soon he discovers that this boy isn't afraid of him at all and then they develop friendship. Then there is this mother played by Juhi Chawla a principal Satish Shah and a variety of other supporting actors  and yes I almost forgot to tell you there is Shahrukh Khan as well. So to all those people out there who love these star studded nosubstance movies  welcome aboard.The basic problem of Bhoothnath is that the spine of the story is very very flaccid. It's simply about this little boy and a ghost who do nothing but develop intense love for each other. They become friends hang out take part in sports and drama contests and well that's about it. Can't tell you a great deal of things because the film simply deals with more eventoriented storytelling. Then there are these characters who do not develop at all there are comedians who fail every attempt to make you laugh though Juhi is funny at times those clichd jokes simply take away from humour from the situation. In fact the film is so clichd that watching the first 20 minutes will tell you most of the story but then that's where things become a bit tricky and believe it or not I grew more and more inquisitive as the film started taking a bloody Baghban twist. Surprised don't be  it's BR Films trademark.I went absolutely stunned when the back story about Mr AB becoming a ghost started unfolding. It's about these helpless parents whose son has left them and believe it or not that the mother DIES in grief and father Bachchan meets an accident well falls off a flight of stairs and dies. Though I loved the scene when he discovers he's dead. Then he decides to keep everyone off his property and that's the part supposed to scare us.Characterwise Mr Bachchan is fine. Well over acted a bit here and there but one thing is for sure that he is able to get into any character. He fits in this one as well. He still manages to make us adore him with unwashed clothes the movies says so and unfiled nails with hideous silver paint on his face. Juhi Chawla is opening up to experimental roles and glad she accepted this part. She has fully justified her character and has shown that's she'd good as a mom too. The ShahrukhJuhi chemistry works this time around too but I simply did not understand the reason to have SRK do that role.For Heaven's sake just picture SRK standing in the background and only his hands visible in the frame. What a waste. Thankfully he did not charge a penny for that role because if he would've it would make his worse choice of character in his entire career. Delnaz Paul Priyanshu Chaterjee and Rajpal Yadav too are such a waste of paychecks. Satish Shah is rather irritating than funny. Rajpal Yadav sucks big time and we're not even told what happens to him in the end.However the good thing is that we have yet another Darsheel Safary in the block. Little kid charms us all the way through the movie. The best moments of the film are credits to him. The scene where he challenges Nath to arrange the furniture was simply adorable and the other one when he's looking up in the sky and calling out to Bhoothnath.Overall there's nothing great you'd want to watch in this movie. Your kids mind it very very small kids with absolutely no sense of judgement may find it nice but even 1213 years will find this movie going to the nuts. It's predictable it doesn't make use of the comic potential the plot has to offer big names are attached to the film but their presence does not add any substance to the movie at all. You'll simply hate some scenes for the rest of your life. Music is soso. Vishal Shekhar flunk again after Tashan. Javed Akthar had given some nice compositions but I think they're a bit over the top for a kid's movie. Production design ageing dept sucks big times especially the first time we're shown this aged building with brightly polished wooden door and shining door knobs. Background score is thrilling at times but couldn't understand the reason why they composed one particular score very identical to that of Baghban's. There was definitely more room for special effects you'll love a leaves animation sequence though what's been done feels right in the place.The director definitely needs to come up with something better next time because with such a big production house all the best choices of actors and still a big hole persists in the whole thing. I don't know what went wrong  but Bhoothnath failed to impress me.610  for you Mr. Bachchan. Been a big fan of yours.".

	schema:reviewBody "He sings and dances arranges the furniture and even puts the school's lunchboxraiding principal in place. Yes that's Bhoothnath for you the friendly ghost played by Amitabh Bachchan in director Vivek Sharma's film by the same name. After a failed attempt at scaring away little Banku and his family who have moved into his sprawling Goa bungalow Bhoothnath becomes buddies with the precocious kid. So far not too many complaints. It's silly and childish yes but also very watchable. Problems arise somewhere beyond the halfway mark of Bhoothnath when this kidsfriendly entertainer turns into something of a ronadhona heavy Baghbaan rehash. You sink into your seat and cringe with embarrassment as our tearyeyed ghost goes into flashback mode and bores us with those sad stories of his neglectful son. Despite its fairly basic plot and predictable screenplay for the most part Bhoothnath works just fine as a children's film. It is after all a formula that never fails when done even half right. Although it's nothing you haven't seen before the adventures of Banku and Bhooth are enjoyable to watch largely because the chemistry between Bachchan and child actor Aman Siddique is so riveting. So whether they're pulling a gag on the school principal or devouring aloo parathas that Banku's mother is struggling to prepare it's this unlikely friendship between boy and ghost that is the film's main draw. And that's why it hurts as hell when writerdirector Vivek Sharma steers his ship in an entirely different direction as the film enters its third act. Melodramatic and needless the track involving Bhoothnath's backstory is a cumbersome bore. Even Shah Rukh Khan and Juhi Chawla who play Banku's parents in the film look embarrassed to be participating in such sentimental silliness. For me Chhota Chetan and Mr India are the ultimate children's films at least to come out of India . Bhoothnath sadly doesn't compare to either. For one both Chhota Chetan and Mr India were involving and engaging stories that had heart. Bhoothnath seen in its entirety is a confused film at best. Sure it's got its moments but it's hardly the kind of film you'll remember years from now. The other reason Bhoothnath doesn't come anywhere close to a film like Mr India is because it simply doesn't push the envelope as far as special effects are concerned. 20 years after Mr Indiaand the best Bhoothnath does is show us furniture flying around a room Bachchan walking in and out of walls a child's arm elongating to ridiculous proportions and some gimmicks involving dried leaves. Such a shame one would have expected more! Of the cast Shah Rukh Khan in a special appearance looks uninspired and unhappy to be there while the usually dependable Juhi Chawla tends to overact for no reason. Some genuinely funny moments are provided by Rajpal Yadav who plays the local drunk but of course the film belongs to Bachchan and little fellow Aman Siddique who give the film its best moments. Siddique is sharp and ontheball and he turns in a sincere performance but if I were to pick the one single thing about Bhoothnath that's superb then that would be Amitabh Bachchan. He's perfectly cast he's uninhibited as the scruffy irritable ghost and even in the film's tedious bits he's the only reason you stay in your seats. Take your kids to the film but make sure you don't stay longer than intermission!".

Nevertheless being a first timer it can be pardoned but you missed a brilliant opportunity to strike it gold!.The pranks fall flat  it's an infant's play for the kids of today's generation. And the Bhoothnath's magic I don't think it would even tickle a bone.The chemistry between Big B and Amaan is OK. Pity the story lets down and not giving scope to raise to a different level.Juhi Again the story is the culprit for not providing scope.SRK Surprisingly his role and performance are justified to the T.Raghuvir Yadav Why force him to reprise Kesto Mukhejee? Priyanshu The crocodiletears were a bit over the top alright? Music Not worthy of being mentioned.CGI deserves a special mention.And Chopra Saab let go your obsession for Baghbaan.

Therefore I needed to be acquainted with the source material other than bits and pieces from the extended television serial.Jack Neo has made movies which have been boxoffice successes locally grossing millions starting with the very popular but very raw Money No Enough. It captured the attention and appealed to the heartlanders who gave him a resounding vote of confidence at the box office. Following that are many social dramadies like That One No Enough Liang Po Po and the likes.But perhaps none struck the chord so closely as that jab at the typical Singaporean kiasuparents school administrators who are fearful of their rankings the much criticized EM123 streaming in primary schools and the introduction of perceived foreign talent on our shores.And that's what I Not Stupid is about and more. Compared to his previous movies I Not Stupid has matured in refining its story telling techniques having social issues subtly weaved into its dialog and giving the audience the ability to draw chuckles out of caricatures of the government in its characters Selena Tan as the bigmomma dressed in all white all the time anyone? The casting also took some major changes without having JTeam members as lead characters here. The 3 child leads did quite OK given that they have veterans actors as their parents helped a lot too.The plot did seem to wear on as it seemed to drag to make it 2 hours which contributed to quite a bit of plot holes. Also some subplots seemed unnecessary too or if retained in the film wasn't succinct to the point like the kidnapping subplot.However if you've been following Jack Neo's movies then it is marked improvement. The jokes are less slapstick though it was kinda strange to have characters telling jokes and everyone around laughing. Not that it was bad just quite unnaturally acted.So am I ready for I Not Stupid Too? Frankly yes. Though the trailer did not reveal too much except for the public caning scene I'm silently geared up for more social issues being taken to the stand and awaiting to see how Jack Neo spins them together for another ride.Special Edition Code 3 DVD contains 2 music videos from the movie song lyrics packaged into a pictorial book containing the synopsis and cast and crew interviews and biographies.".

The shame of being considered stupid is one I know and understand and yet there is also much to keep parents preoccupied with especially those living on both sides of the Causeway such as the idea of Caucasian superiority the behaviour of the Singaporean government etc.It has been argued that much of Terry's narration is unnecessary especially his explanation of the Mrs. Khoo  Singaporean government analogy.

However I think this is an artistic thing done to reflect Terry's simplemindedness as well as for the benefit of International audiences.If you live in SouthEast Asia give this movie a go. You most likely won't regret it.1010";

	schema:headline " You Stupid?";
	schema:reviewBody "More than a month ago my eyes got all puffy again and I blamed Jack Neo for it. If a law was ever passed against making women cry using movies he would be in death row by now.Of course as you can gather from my reaction I am actually starting to love Neo just don't remind me about his Liang Po Po slapstick. After watching Homerun here was another Neo flick that had my tears streaming down my face uncontrollably  I Not Stupid I.N.S.. Clever devil. Even his title screams with comic irony.Compared to the first film aforementioned I.N.S. is another Singaporean political and more specifically social satire. The treatment however is more direct though not literal. Without ever having to guess one would not need to read any background on Singapore to realize that the film is satirical.The whole movie is full of similes and metaphors  mostly directly injected in dialogue  that pertain to the country's government and its people. For around two hours we are given a peek a good peek at one of Asia's wellknown nations. At the same time neighboring countries may recognize a thing or two about Singapore that resembles a thing or two about themselves.Strictly speaking the story is about and narrated by Terry Huang PoJu a little rich boy who could be so obedient to an annoying fault. Actually the story revolves not only around Terry but also around poor toughie Boon Hock Joshua Ang and misunderstood artist Kok Pin Shawn Lee. Well around them and their parents to be more exact. The adults have their own subplots that cannot be simply ignored. Each of the boys belong to section EM3 where all the kids perceived as lazy troublesome and dumb always end up and are considered hopeless future adults. The parents on the other hand basically play the part of society and government. Special focus is on Singaporean education both in school and in society.As a satire I found I.N.S. simple direct and effective in communicating the message. As a nonSingaporean I cannot in all honesty agree with all of Neo's opinions. I cannot simply because I have never been to Singapore personally talked to anyone who has discussed the country with online buddies nor met a Singaporean in the flesh. But as far as freedom of speech is concerned through the use of a powerful medium I say yes Neo conveyed his message very well. In fact right at the start he made it clear through the narration.However it wasn't the underlying content that got to me. It was Kok Pin and his mother that made me cry. I was doing fine until Kok Pin got up the building and...I should have known it would be about family again or I would have bought some tissue! As for funny moments even if it was supposed to be comedy there wasn't a lot to laugh at literally or not. At least I didn't find much of the story funny. Sorry.I.N.S. is a brave intelligent film done inyourface. It was created not to confuse but rather inform the audience and perhaps serve as a wakeup call. It is not a stab in fact there is an appreciative comment near the end regarding mothers but rather just a prick to remind the government to do what is proper and right when it comes to educating its people. No need to beat around the bush. After all we not stupid.Therefore I highly recommend this movie. Not as powerful as I found Homerun but still a very commendable piece. I can't wait to see another one of Jack's Neoisms. This guy is not to be missed. After all he most definitely not stupid! May 15 2005".

	schema:headline " Wonderful story but poor presentation skills";
	schema:reviewBody "No doubt Jack Neo has created a great impact in Singapore and Asia with his second directorial outing in I Not Stupid considering its recordbreaking boxoffice success in Singapore and Hong Kong even the Singapore prime minister mentioned his success during the National Day Rally.  However is the film really as good as it has been deemed to be?  I really beg to differ.First of all I have to admit that Neo is a wonderful comedian on TV and has brought a lot of laughter to millions of television screens in Singapore over the years.  His longlasting variety show Comedy Night has him entertaining our Monday nights for over ten years.  However TV and film are two entirely different matters.  Looking at the way Neo handled his script for his three movies Money No Enough which he did not direct That One No Enough and I Not Stupid it is evident that Neo is too used to writing skits on TV.  Normally a skit would last for 1015 minutes and will be held together by several jokes on a certain issue.  But if you put the same formula on film it will appear nothing but weird.  Watching Neo's films is like watching a film that is not really a film but rather a 2 hour presentation made up of several 15minute skits.That is the main problem with I Not Stupid and all the other Neo films.  Throughout the whole film audiences are trying so hard to find linkage after every 15 minutes that the film loses its focus.  One moment the film seems to focus on the problems EM3 students face in school another moment it seems to focus on the misconceptions people have on foreign talents and the next moment out of the blue Kok Bin's mother has leukemnia.  So what exactly is Neo trying to focus on?  He has too many points too many subplots but he failed to explore deep enough to each of the issues.Secondly the definition of a film is to tell a story or to convey a message through visuals.  Yet Neo's excessive usage of monologues totally loses the point of making a film.  A lot of the messages could have been better conveyed without the monologues.  For example when Liu Qian Yi's character first appeared on screen Terry's monologue went This is my father he is actually a very nice person just that he speaks very loudly and when Jack Neo's character appeared Terry's monologue when again This is Kok Bin's father....  Are all these necessary?  From the scene where Liu Qian Yi scolds Jack Neo for snatching his parking lot I'm sure all audiences will be able to tell that Terry's father speaks very loudly. I'm sure audiences won't have any difficulty figuring out who is who's father either.Other monologues also spoil a lot of fun.  The film could have had more depth if certain things are not being made too obvious.  For example Terry's mother is being portrayed as the government as she likes to have a say in everything her children does.  She is even dressed in white all the time just like our People's Action Party members.  On the other hand Terry's sister is being portrayed as the opposition party being rebellious and wants a say of her own life.  This is upmost interesting and i salute Neo for coming up with this brilliant comparison.  However Terry's monologue again spoils everything.  When his mother first appeared in the film he went The woman in white is my mother...... ...likes to have a say in everything... ...but she really cares for us.... and finally she is just like the government.  And when his sister appears his monologue went This is my sister.... ...she is getting rebellious... ...likes to oppose to what Mum says no matter she is right or wrong... and ....she is just like the opposition party.Talk about being subtile.  We can tell his mother is wearing white.  We can tell she wants a say in everything form the way she behaves in the film. We can tell she is being portrayed as the government even without the monologue.  The same goes for the sister.  In fact if audiences were not told but shown all these points  the film would have been much more interesting.  But Neo opted for the easy way out which obviously is not the best way out.Or maybe Neo felt that audiences are just too stupid to notice his point? Therefore he felt the need to explain everything to the slightest detail through the use of Terry's monologue.If that is the case then the only thing I have to say about this movie is I Not Stupid.".

	schema:reviewBody "I watched this movie in 2002 which was like four years ago now...and I actually watched it during school time. My Society and Environment teacher probably thought it was educational and she put it on for us to watch and being eleven at the time I just thought it was really funny. It didn't really touch me because I didn't understand the issues. I went crazy about it and I must have watched it ten times but now that I watch it again it seems to me there's a deeper meaning in the film Ritz something cool and it's one of the films that really got my attention. I know that Singapore's system is quite a bit like Malaysia except we're a teeny bit more laidback. I couldn't quite identify with the characters since I've been educated in an international school my whole life but the thing about it was the acting. You have this chubby guy who messes everything up and you sometimes feel like you want to shake him but other times you just feel so sad that he has such misguided parents. And then there's Kok Pin...he's just really depressing. I mean...wow he's got such puppydog eyes and he's so sweet and nice...I kind of find it hard to believe that there's a kid who acts like Kok Pin does. The characters...the boys...they're all pretty young but the thing about is them is that they're all so GOOD. Maybe that was unnecessary but it's a bit freaky because I'm pretty sure there aren't any kids that age who are always doing the right thing. So when I watched it it was for the funny parts at the beginning and I loved the soundtrack! P I like the song!!! That was one of the things that reached out to me because all the lyrics really spoke out how students felt and sometimes how I felt. It was cool. And I also loved the way they talk because I'm used to seeing Hollywood and Hong Kong films and the familiarity of the dialogue is just...nice. Comfy. It's so much like real life it's like seeing the lives of someone you could've been or realising how things are for so many students in Singapore and Malaysia. It's a movie that's great for kids and adults and everyone will find something that they can relate to that will make them think. Bottom line this is my favourite movie so far and it's nice to see a teenchild flick that's not filled with angst and uncertainty and boygirl relationships.".

It also shows the highly competitive society we live in today. It reminds us to take a break to think and reflect. Parents should watch this movie to better understand their child's live. I also really like this show as it reminds me of my primary school days where the popular kids would always challenge the teacher. It is a great movie which is worth your time.

It also shows the highly competitive society we live in today. It reminds us to take a break to think and reflect. Parents should watch this movie to better understand their child's live. I also really like this show as it reminds me of my primary school days where the popular kids would always challenge the teacher. It is a great movie which is worth your time.

Terry's mother is a female aristocrat in her family taking care of each and every aspect of the family. This almost stifling style of handling her children results in a rebellious Selena her daugther and a timid and obedient Terry. This is obviously an analogy to the situation in Singapore.

	schema:headline " Must watch for Utpal Dutt lovers";
	schema:reviewBody "We have seen him as one of the most whimsical funny old man 'Bhavanishankar' in Hrishida's timeless classic comedy 'Golmaal'or 'Naram Garam'. Utpal Dutt was one of the absolutely brilliant and rare breed of actor. I don't remember any other actor who became so graceful at one time and so funny at the other as he grew old in his characters. He was one of the original Indian comedian who didn't require funny dialogues or situations to make you laugh. Humor is the integral part of his natural body language.The film is Winner of President's Gold Medal and made by India's art house director Mrinal Sen. It's a limited budget small film with the length of one and half hours. The plot is more seems like reading one of R K Narayan's Malgudi tales.Bhuvan Shome is typical Bengali Babu who is very principle loving strict angry old man serving as a Railway Officer. Due to his arrogant typical characteristics he always regarded in staff as the dangerous man whose sight everyone likes to avoid. He didn't pay heed to his own single son and left him from several years. Now at the ripe age he cultivated a new suitable hobby of hunting birds. He landed up in one of the local Gujarati town for hunting and met a smart local Gujarati village girl with whom he shared a strange relationship as she helped him in his hunting task. How his encounter with the girl transformed him from a whimsical arrogant old officer into a lovable life loving gentleman is a thing to watch for all Indian cinema lovers.I don't want to ruin the characteristic charm of Utpal Dutt while praising him much but let me say that I surely include his act here in one of my favorite Indian movie characters list. Watch his mood in the last scene when he committed a single good act of his life and you can't resist smile on your face. The film also has fine act by young and charming Suhasini Mulay. Remember the modern age mother of Akshay Khanna in 'Dil Chahta Hai' You just love his natural act here.The only thing you have to bear is few tiring long shots which sometimes bore you. But if you tolerate it I guarantee you will surely enjoy a quality cinema.Highly Recommended for all Utpal Dutt fans.Ratings 810".

He has had so many films where he can overemphasize overdramatize and simply overact.  Ford has the maturity to keep this from happening and he does so again in this film.  Ford is supported quite well with such actorsactresses as James Earl Jones reprising his role as Greer from The Hunt for Red October Samuel L. Jackson and Anne Archer.  For an action flick acting is much above average.It was also suspenseful...thrilling.  I thought the ending had a nice buildup and climax.  I realize this is different from the book's ending...but remember these are two different visions...not the same one. This brings up a big point in moviewatching  Comparing a movie to a book is the worst thing you can do.  They are two completely different genres. More importantly as I said before they are two different visions.I'm not a big action fan.  I used to be but anymore most stories are the same.  To this end I would say Patriot Games is fairly mainstream. However it was always fun to watch and sometimes thrilling to watch.  I'm also not a big Tom Clancy fan but I've given the movies based off his books a shot because again they are different visions.  The result is at least with Patriot Games a good film to watch on a Saturday night with a bowl of popcorn.  Don't expect great things but don't expect to be disappointed either.Rating  710".

And it's predictable and artless and has plenty of clichs.  I make it a point not to read IMDB reviews for a movie until after I've written my own but even so I can guess that this one has been torn apart on these points probably at least a dozen times.  Now that that's over with I'm going to admit that I like this movie.  It feels like a tight thriller good for those nights when I want entertainment with some minor complexity.  I like to go along for the ride so to speak even though I know how it ends.  And going back to the first time I saw this before I'd read the book I remember being on the edge of my seat quite a bit.Thora Birch does this film a lot of good.  Her expressions and lines are quite wellacted and she's cute without being syrupy.  Harrison Ford is Harrison Ford you either like him or you don't and this movie isn't going to change your  mind I happen to like him.Don't go renting this one if you want an artsy movie or a beautiful movie or a movie with a perfectly tight script.  But if you can enjoy a film for simple entertainment value and you like Harrison Ford  this is a good one for after the kids are in bed.".

The acting on show is more than adequate Harrison Ford is great in the role of Jack Ryan he manages to portray him as a sensitive family man who can step up to the plate when things get ugly and Anne Archer is solid enough as the wife and mother caught up in the web of nastiness unfolding.The baddies are led by the brooding Sean Bean who is a little under written whilst Richard Harris is sadly underused but the action set pieces make their mark and thankfully we get a riveting final reel that cements the steady ride we have under taken.

Ford is the man best able to stop him and the film is very interesting starttofinish and smart enough not to overdo the violence. Suspenseful is probably the best word to describe the movie as Bean goes after Ford's family. Anne Archer as Ford's wife along with the rest of the cast actors such as Patrick Bergen James Earl Jones James Fox Richard Harris and a young Thora Birch make this a well acted movie.This is simply one of the best thrillers I've ever seen and almost every scene is interesting.".

The plot is a generic revenge tale but it takes place within a world that is genuinely interesting CIA conferences Pentagon backrooms hightech gear telephone calls from the president etc. Building on the work of political thriller directors like Costa Gavras Pakula Frankenheimer John Schlesinger and Fred Zinnemann and mainstream novelists like Michael Crichton and Frederick Forsyth in the 70s and Tom Clancy in the 80s an entire vocabulary was being added to here.Beyond the classy direction and the cool gear on display the film has 3 good action sequences  one involving a CIA raid viewed entirely through a spy satellite a big deal back in 1992 Patriot Games is mildly interesting for a couple other reasons. This is another in a long line of movies in which Harrison Ford finds himself playing a meek everyman who bravely protect his family and it's funny to see the film's scriptwriters struggling to be politically correct. They want IRA bad guys but they don't actually want to offend the IRA so they opt instead for an Irish bad guy who is too hardcore for even the IRA. End result writers able to serve up easy cartoon villains whilst also placating their conscience.More interesting is the way all these films popped up during the First Gulf War. Like an unconscious display of American prowess in the form of super advanced technology and all seeing surveillance gear Patriot Games might as well have been an advertisement for the military industrial complex and the long reaching arm of Uncle Sam.In terms of flaws the film has two at times the villains are pure cartoon and the film's ending features a silly action scene on a boat hastily tacked on by nervous studio heads. A better director would have extended the action sequence in the house the film's climax features a battle in a CIA safe house and omitted the boat sequence entirely.Released 2 years before Patriot Games The Hunt For Red October trades Gulf War muscle flexing for post Cold War pro SovietAmerican bridge building. But though it pretends to be about the healed wounds between Russia and America this is still a rather propagandistic flick about a Russian submarine captain who seeks to defect to the glorious promise land of Uncle Sam. Here like Patriot Games a technoculturally superior America is filled with good leaders and upstanding generals and Russians would be crazy not to come on over for a slice of freedom.Still the film was directed by John McTiernan Die Hard Predator Die Hard 3 Thomas Crown Affair  all good action flicks so it has a certain style to it. Like Patriot Games once you get past some clichs and some clownishness it's a rather serious picture with some nice hardware on display for the boys and some well mounted action scenes.Released in 1994 and again directed by Phillip Noyce Clear and Present Danger is the most sophisticated of these films which were all based on Tom Clancy novels Clancy a major techhead fantasises about World War 3 for a living. Here the world isn't made up of good guys and bad guys and there are lots of conflicting self interests. The villain here is also nothing less than the President of the United States a gutsy move though by now this paternal villain clich is getting old The Fugitive LA Confidential Monster's Inc Minority Report etc. Unusual for such films Danger points out the immorality of affairs such as Irangate doesn't salivate over the film's depiction of a secret war in South America which Noyce links to Vietnam considers somewhat the moral implications of violence criticises snap emotive responses and deals with political betrayals and private agendas among both the President and his advisers. Where the film differs significantly from its 1970s predecessors is it's total lack of impotency the 90s spyhero doesn't shy away from responsibility and will go so far as to topple the Presidency to maintain the good of his countryWhat's funny though is that the film treats its central idea the President mounting an illegal covert war in Panama as a shockingly evil thing. In the real world despite the fact that the American President is not allowed to deploy or instigate any military actions without Congress first declaring war he routinely does so. Iraq Vietnam Korea etc not to mention countless CIA instigated coups in places like Haiti Iran Chile and Ecuador were all illegal by the Constitution of the United States. The fact is Congress is always sidestepped most recently in the bank bailout package fiasco.This being Tom Clancy the main attraction is once again the gear on display laser guided bombs F18 hornets sniper's hidden in the grass an RPG attack on a convoy etc. From here many computer game franchises would spawn and from there a banalization of military technology. People used to go to these thrillers and marvel at the hardware gasping at the inside looks offered of the Oval Office and Pentagon but now such things are routine countless TV shows West Wing 24 The Unit JAG and video games why be wowed by the sniper on screen when you can BE him online diluting the spectacle that made these films popular in the 90s.810  With the down sizing of armies around the world and all technology fetishized to the point of disaffection the technothriller genre itself a genre borne from war see Lang's 1928 Spies looks like it's winding down again.".

Sean Bean plays a convincing villain as usual donning a convincing Irish accent and his signature sinister expression. His performance was one of his best to date and kudos to Mr. Bean for creating a villain with whom we can sympathize. Anne Archer's character is weak however typical damselindistress wife and mother relying completely on her husband for protection and having no selfdefense skills whatsoever. Thora Birch is adorable in her prepubescent innocence. Samuel Jackson as usual does little to step out of his smoothtalking sarcastic typecast and again plays the same character he plays in every film to date.

Patriot Games is a great thinking man's thriller although its much less difficult to follow than Clear and Present Danger. It has plenty of suspense and action and Ford's acting is terrific. I am so surprised that Patriot Games is often considered the worst Clancy film and The Hunt For Red October considered the best but I think it should be the other way around. Overall a great suspenseful movie. 9 out of 10".

Unfortunately a novel adapted to a film will almost never be as good as the book because there just isn't enough time or money to include everything and make everything look as good as it reads. This is evident here. Having said that they certainly didn't leave it to the story to support itself. Impressive heroics from Ford and a superb bad guy performance from Sean Bean strikingly similar to his performance in the James Bond film Golden Eye turned Clancy's classy classic book into a classy film. I was also impressed to discover that the director was none other than Australia's Phillip Noyce. As is also sadly common among films made from books the plot was a little hard to follow due to the audience having to fill in the gaps that were left by the film makers not having time or money to include it all.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was not a fan of The Hunt For Red October. It was very boring in my opinion. Alec Baldwin never really cut it as Jack Ryan for me so needless to say. It's refreshing to say that an ideal hero like Harrison Ford took over. Harrison Ford is able to keep your eyes glued to the screen throughout the film and I was fully involved in his plight. I wouldn't say this movie is action packed. It's more of a suspenseful thriller with cat and mouse stuff. It does the job extremely well as a thriller. It also helps that the Ryan family is a unit and so likable. I cared about every one of them. This also has one of the most intense finales you'll ever see. It's not very often these days in which I am on the edge of my seat anymore but the invasion scene at the end will get your pulse rising but quickly. The boat chase sequence is especially memorable. Harrison Ford is fantastic as I explained. He's not superman he bleeds he gets wounded and he's human. I felt Ford did a perfect job of conveying his emotions and I was on his side the whole way. I'm not a fan of holier than thou heroes but Ford isn't one of those people as Jack Ryan. I loved him. Anne Archer is excellent as the supportive wife who reluctantly goes along for the ride. I always felt she was underrated. Her chemistry with Ford was very good. Sean Bean makes for a chilling villain. His morose  psychotic performance gave me the creeps. Thora Birch was cute as a button and played a very likable kid. Samuel L. Jackson  James Earl Jones both do well in their respective roles and add class to the proceedingsFinal Thoughts This is a tense thriller that will make almost two hours fly by with ease. Watch Harrison Ford go to work and have a blast! Highly recommended8.310".

Harrison Ford is now Clancy's reliable hero Jack Ryan and Ford is a very good fit. In best Clancy fashion Ryan is a very reluctant hero as well. He hates getting involved in other peoples' affairs and being forced to settle them just as he hates being forced to kick ass but what's an exMarine CIA agent to do? The villains this time are an ultraviolent faction of the IRA Ryan gets on their bad side when he busts up an attempt by them to kill the British Home Secretary and his family. The rest of the movie is essentially a titfortat series of confrontations between RyanCIA and these IRA murderers. The best scenes in 'Patriot Games' are the action ones as well as the parts showing the CIA's supersecret and supersophisticated technology at work. Less successful are the scenes having to do with Ryan's home life and his wife and daughter. There is an upperclass peachykeen smugness to them exemplified by Anne Archer Cathy Ryan and her boy this CIA stuff is a pain in the ass attitude. This type of material is not Clancy's strong suit or the screenwriter's apparently and it shows. The trio of Irish baddies are all portrayed convincingly Patrick Bergin Polly Walker and particularly Sean Bean in a menacing and venomous performance. 'Patriot Games' succeeds mainly because of Harrison Ford's tough likable and sometimes vulnerable presence. Several key plot points do not bear close scrutiny it strikes one as unlikely the IRA and the CIA would take on one another over what is essentially a personal vendetta. But don't think too hard or too much and you'll find 'Patriot Games' a reasonably exciting thriller.".

During the ensuing scuffle Ryan shoots dead one of the terrorists Patrick Miller. Miller's elder brother Sean is jailed for his part in the attack but is rescued by his comrades and vows vengeance on Ryan who is a former marine and CIA operative. When Ryan realises that Sean Miller is targeting his family he returns to work for the CIA to help with the fight against terrorism. There are a number of fairly obvious goofs and plot holes. No member of the British Royal Family could serve as a Government minister as they are constitutionally obliged to remain politically neutral. If a foreign citizen were being made a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order one of the highest awards in the British honours system he would be invited to a formal ceremony in Buckingham Palace to be knighted by the Queen in person. He would not be presented with the decoration in his own home by a junior member of the Royal Family. It seems unlikely that any Irish republican terror group would carry out an attack on American citizens on American soil as to do so would risk losing the support their cause has long enjoyed among sections of the IrishAmerican community. As others have pointed out it seems illogical for Ryan to take his family to their isolated summer home to get them away from Miller doubtless the CIA could have found a safer location for them. The film lacks the political implications of Clear and Present Danger Philip Noyce's next attempt to film a Tom Clancy thriller which involved Watergatetype misconduct by the President and his closest aides. That film also starred Harrison Ford as Ryan. Despite the involvement of the IRA Patriot Games makes no attempt to analyse the complexities of the Northern Ireland situation. The film also lacks any detailed characterisation. The moral divisions are straightforward Ryan his wife Cathy and his CIA colleagues are good and Miller and his gang are bad.The film does however have a strong hero in Harrison Ford. Ford has always been good in the thriller genre and gives another good performance here as Ryan combining decency with a strong sense of intelligence. Anne Archer and Sean Bean are also good as Cathy and the villainous Miller. There is a good cameo from Polly Walker as Miller's glamorous but ruthless female associate Annette. Despite the occasional implausibilities of the plot this is a tense and fastmoving thriller with some good action sequences. It is not Ford's best thriller that must be either Witness or The Fugitive but it is nevertheless a good one. 710".

	schema:headline " Lacks oomph";
	schema:reviewBody "This is one of many Harrison Ford action thrillers from the 1990s and it follows the standard formula for a film of such nature so expect no cinematic miracles. Ford is former CIA agent Jack Ryan and he gets tangled up in socalled patriot games when he interferes in an IRA assassination attempt in England. Suddenly his whole family is in danger because the IRA guys want revenge and Ryan needs get back to his old CIA ways to be able to defend his wife and daughter. While Patriot Ganes is a wellmade film it lacks the oomph of most of Ford's other action films and I found myself truly unable to get into the plot at several points.Had it not been for Ford's imprinted 'good guy' status and emotive eyes I would probably have pulled for the 'bad guys' in Patriot Games because Sean Bean has never been sexier than in this film. What stuck with me besides rentable bad guy Sean Bean was an interesting use of an Enya song during one murder in the beginning.Patriot Games is possibly heavier on the thriller part than the action because frankly not much happens during long segments of the film. This would be fine as a means to build up tension in the plot but there are never any satisfying culminations to follow the slow suspenseful pace until the very endand these scenes can hardly be labeled as satisfying. Maybe satisfactory. I think the whole film is most accurately labeled satisfactory. 610".

Now that that's over with I'm going to admit that I like this movie. It feels like a tight thriller good for those nights when I want entertainment with some minor complexity. I like to go along for the ride so to speak even though I know how it ends. And going back to the first time I saw this before I'd read the book I remember being on the edge of my seat quite a bit.Thora Birch does this film a lot of good. Her expressions and lines are quite wellacted and she's cute without being syrupy. Harrison Ford is Harrison Ford you either like him or you don't and this movie isn't going to change your mind I happen to like him.Don't go renting this one if you want an artsy movie or a beautiful movie or a movie with a perfectly tight script.

Harrison Ford in the role trying to protect his wife and daughter from the revenge minded IRA terrorist had more of an emotional impact and really got you going whereas Present Danger just was missing that and basically banished Ryan's wife the character Harrison Ford plays to nothing more than a guest appearance or cameo. This one is about Jack Ryan who I think works for the CIA he is over in England and spots in the nick of time a couple of IRA guys about to do some bad stuff. Well he basically thwarts them killing one of them and getting himself injured in the process. Well the other guy ends up going for revenge as the other guy killed was his brother. Some good action scenes and drama in this one and it has a really nice concluding scene. As an added bonus Richard Harris is also in it it in a fine supporting role and Sean Bean is great as the IRA terrorist.

In fact the quality is I believe as one of the best in Chinese movie history.All those black humors in the movies deserve to be mentioned. However people who have not lived in China for years could not understand why it's funny or even worse it kills interests of people who get used to the vision effects of Hollywood productions or the romance and depressions of European movies.In a conclusion this movie is highly recommended for people who are living in China and would like to learn about this country.

The film title says all. It is a crazily hilarious film about three groups of people trying to steal a piece of emerald. The language is in Chinese local dialect from Sichuan. Even you don't understand the dialect Chinese subtitle is available. All performers did a great job in their roles. The story is simple but very close to nowadays people's life which brings proximity to different audiences. The film is currently a big hit in China outruns all other foreign films. If you like to have a good laugh or to know a little bit about nowadays Chinese plebeian life you shouldn't miss this film.".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Crazy Stone";
	schema:reviewBody "So far the FOCUS First Cuts series of movies have been rather mediocre. Taiwan's The Shoe Fairy was rather plain Hong Kong's I'll Call You was concentrated too much on its effects and Singapore's Love Story was just awful. The three aforementioned movies lacked a compelling story to tell and I was holding my breath on how a movie titled Crazy Stone will present itself.I bought into it hook line and sinker within the first ten minutes. The opening scenes were a class act in editing presentation with a mixture of humour and wastes no time in introducing the ensemble characters of the movie  an excop turned Chief Security Officer his Totofanatical sidekick the arrogant crony of an unscrupulous real estate developer a skirtchasing photographer a trio of bumbling crooks and a professional thief who just has no luck.Directed by China's Ning Hao Crazy Stone is one heck of a heist movie with deft touches in presentation. Never too flashy with its special effects or repeating its nonlinear narrative technique too often it just about presents itself almost perfectly keeping the audience constantly engaged throughout the movie. I can't finger a dull moment in any scene actually and the real reward is when you pay attention to the little details as these will be used at some point to deliver that awaited punctuation to the story. There're plenty of irony infused which somewhat brings about certain pleasure in recognizing them. The sets are beautifully urban and at times just plain ugly  the toilets just have to be seen.The casts are a joy to watch and although relative unknowns they bring out just about the best in the story which is something like a Spy Vs Spy cat and mouse cloak and dagger game between the protectors of a piece of valuable jade and the crooks who want to steal it for the various motivations they have. The story's akin to the guessing game of correctly selecting which cup amongst three is a coin hidden under once the cups are shuffled randomly with sleigh of hand and to the characters presents itself like a huge maze set to an eclectic soundtrack.I don't get the opportunity to watch that many Chinese films and here I mean those made in China and I'd say that if this is how a heist movie can beat in my opinion some of the fare that Hollywood churns out in the same genre not that they were fantastic but I enjoyed them nonetheless then I would be eagerly waiting for another Chinese movie from another genre proving itself to be amongst the best. This movie doesn't look expensive and it's an apt reminder that it almost always boils down to the quality of the story to make it a hit with a viewer.As with the other First Cut movies a touch of Andy Lau is included and though he did not star in a cameo here his song Wang Qing Shui was featured in part I believe twice in the movie though only in passing but enough to ID it.Looks like his venture with these 6 films has uncovered a gem and I'm secretly hoping the remaining films in this series  Malaysia's Rain Dogs Yasmin Ahmad in a role you know? and Hong Kong's Parental Guidance will also prove to be as entertaining and refreshing. Crazy Stone will go into my list as a contender for one of my favourite movies of this year. It's a pity it's only screening at ONE theatre in Singapore so make every effort to watch it soon!".

It is not difficult to speculate what would happen from this kind of stereotyped beginning. We can't tell which part is the imitation and which is the original. It's a concise and smart comedy somehow whose genre is quite different from traditional dramas we can watch at the Chinese cinema. Anyway for the director we can say it's almost an perfect homework.

	schema:reviewBody "Sinful Davey 1969  out of 4 Pleasant but ultimately disappointing comedy from Huston about a highwayman named Davey John Hurt who wants to be like his father even though his father got killed for his lifestyle. Davey goes on one adventure after another as he gets closer and closer to danger but thankfully the woman Pamela Franklin who loves him is constantly showing up to save him. Apparently this film had two different previews both disasters yet Huston refused to edit the film so the producer had to do it for him. This in return set Huston off who pretty much disowned the version that was eventually released and seen here. I don't believe Huston's version has ever been released or seen since those two previews but one has to wonder if anything longer than what's here could have been taken by anyone. I should say anyone but Huston because while watching this comedy I couldn't help but imagine Huston sitting in his chair smoking a cigar and laughing his butt off at everything on the screen. The movie remains pleasant from start to finish because of Hurt's fine performance and the loving care that obviously went into making it but in the end there's just not enough laughs. The movie is technically impressive and I really did love the pacing and style that Huston made it. The movie has an oldfashioned look that perfectly suits the situations and the pacing is fast just like the main character. Hurt is obviously having a lot of fun in the film as he's perfectly fine as the dashing young man who won't stop until someone else stops him. Franklin isn't too bad either and we get Nigel Davenport and Ronald Fraser turning in fine work. Look quick for Huston's daughter Angelica. This film was based on a true story and I couldn't help but think the book probably had a lot of stuff that didn't make it into the movie but I also figured a lot of it might not have worked and just got cut out. Either way this is an interesting piece from Huston but the lack of laughs pretty much kill it.".

The only thing could stop Hurt is Pamela Franklin from his old village who is a good girl in a debauched age and she's determined he have a moral makeover.This will never be classified as one of John Huston's better films but it's entertaining enough.

The interesting scenario our main character Raymond Saxx finds himself in the characters that surround him and the interesting dynamic of K11 make for a sometimes difficult but ultimately rewarding experience.

	schema:reviewBody "I heard about this film and looked it up. The premise seemed fascinating and the first thing that came to mind is I must watch this. Anticipating from the visuals and advertising this film would be a trippy ride through prison lane. Unfortunately as soon as I started watching I got the sense of a very sanitized film with actors who I am sure had lots of terms and conditions imposed on the filmmakers prior to diving into making the film. In one word the film just does not seem authentic. A simple a word as that maybe it is the lifeblood of films of this type. If you are going to go through the troubles of doing a prison drama get in there and get your feet wet. The actors skimped on all situations. Not sure if the script was written like that or what happened between the production and final cut. Whatever may have happened in the process it is obvious many things got chopped and with them the fear and tension that this sort of situation brings about for any straight attorney who would have been wrongly classified in a prison system. The girl that the attorney meets at the beginning is so obviously female she was miscast in the first place. Nowhere did her performance remotely resemble that of someone who may have been previously male. If you are going to do something like this.. go all the way. Get the real thing. You would never see obviously real women in a K11 section and that is what spoiled it for me. Sometimes playing it safe can inhibit your film from all of the wonderful possibilities that could have been effective if more time and effort was placed in finding actors who could accurately portray a grim situation successfully in a rather dark place. My suspension of disbelieve got interrupted several times and at every attempt I made to try to immerse myself in the reality of what should have been a very dark disturbing spine tingling situation for the viewer. In other words I expected something around the realm of OZ the very successful cable series that did exemplify the tensions and fears that prison life entail. Sad to say I felt instead of OZ I got something along the lines of the wizard of OZ version sprinkled with mild to light tension. Unfortunately this was a missed opportunity.".

Since none of the other reviewers have touched on this yetor seem to think the words transsexual and transvestite are interchangeable I'll be the one to say it.Transgendered women are women. This film blatantly implies that we're simply men who transition our bodies to look like women for the purpose of sexual deviancenot only in the premise but in the dialog from trans and cisgender characters alike. This is simply not true! Contrary to popular social belief we were not born as men we're born as women with a male body. We spend years correcting our bodies to fit who we are inside and it is no easy process. Films like this only further serve to set back the leaps and bounds of progress we're making within society to achieve a sense of normality. To be clear being transgender has absolutely nothing to with sexual orientation.This film isn't overtly hateful towards transwomen but it does further the many misconceptions we suffer from on a daily basis. As a transwoman I feel compelled to dispel them where I can.".

And this was from actually seeing the movie and giving it a fair chance so there goes that rather ignorant assumption. Some people probably didn't even see the trailer and saw it only for Visnjic myself belonging in this camp. The script is confused it is not sure whether it wants to have exploitation laughs or sombre tragedy. Instead it tries to incorporate both and neither work the comedy being forced and can fall into the distasteful category for some and the tragedy being mawkish and you never care enough for the characters to genuinely feel it. Okay some of the grindhouse punchlines are not so bad but they are too far and between. The dialogue at best is tepid also. Another major failing is the story it is slow and almost nonexistent and you don't feel any of the tensions and fears of prison life. Part of the reason why you are not engaged with anything here is because the movie in an attempt to trying not to offend plays it too safe. There are also campy elements that are too artificially done and while the comic exaggerations are played for shocks there was little that came across as genuinely shocking and instead it was too exaggerated and too overdone. There are cheaperlooking movies out there however K11 does nothing interesting with the photography or the singleroom cellblock they are just there with no signs of life. The music is pulpy and loud but often overbears everything. I couldn't care less about who Jules Stewart's family is that's never been an overriding factor in my judgement of movies never has been never will be and also it shouldn't be what really matters is whether her involvement in K11 worked in its favour. It didn't it had intent sure but turned out to be every bit as confused as the script. Visnjic gives the only good performance the rest struggle with the cardboard characters and give cartoonish caricatures in the process. All in all apart from Visnjic who deserved better than this a messy movie that played it too safe and didn't know what to do with itself. 210 Bethany Cox".

This one steps away from offering a realistic approach to instead go allout with overthetop characters and outlandish situations. The main character as played by former E.R. actor Goran Visnjic is the usual innocent guy who wakes up one day and finds himself thrown into the homosexual wing of a Los Angeles jail.This film seems more occupied with detailing transsexual culture more than anything else. The cast features a bunch of actresses playing transsexual or transvestite characters and many of them are believable in their parts particularly Kate del Castillo who steals the show as the completely convincing Mousey the woman who runs the wing. Others like Portia Doubleday MR. ROBOT fare less well but still deliver kooky performances.The main problem with this film is the story or rather lack of it. It seems to slide along aimlessly giving a good example of prison life but failing to involve the viewer in any way. Take Visnjic's plight which is predictable and extremely uninteresting. The supporting players are more interesting than the lead including D.B. Sweeney's slimy prison officer Tommy 'Tiny' Lister as the resident rapist and Jason Mewes as unsurprisingly a drug dealer. The usual sex and violence fills the screen giving this a hard grindhouse edge.".

	schema:reviewBody "Such an odd film. Man wakes up in jail and finds himself in a strange prison cell it appears to be a ward for gay and transgendered people. Goran Visnjic is Saxx and he tries to navigate survival everyone he meets is either a friend or foe. From the start we're shown one main corrupt officer that we can tell is going to be trouble. And we're also shown Mousey Kate del Castillo who runs the joint. The main plot here is that Saxx says he doesn't belong here and he keeps making phone calls for help. About halfway through we find out what he's at least accused of but we have yet to find out if he actually did it or not. Of course the most famous face here is Jay from Clerks... Jason Mewes. yes they are making Clerks III so we'll see Jay and silent Bob again. We almost don't recognize him with short hair. In K11 he's part of the drug dealing crew. Gets pretty rough so definitely NOT for the kiddies. It's a prison so expect anything to happen. And the ending is a little cheesy but not bad for a first film. The sound and photography were actually very well done for a firsttimer but as she has been in the business for a while Stewart certainly had the connections to hire professionals.  Stewart is also Twilight star Kristen Stewart's mom! Will definitely look for more projects from Stewart. Written and directed by Jules Stewart based on an original story by Jared Kurt. K11 seems to be the first project for her. Also son Cameron makes his first acting appearance. A whole lot of violence cussing and nudity. It is prison after all. Not for the faint of heart.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's obvious that the movie is adapted from a book or there can be no way that 2 of the more popular stars in Japan will agree to act in this movie provided that the screenplay is horrendous. It's incredibly slow and the slow shots are meaningless. They are just taking one minute to be ten minutes in the movie. And I was typically waiting for the guy to collapse and die the whole time for that is obviously what is going to happen at the end. You can see it coming from the beginning. The book which the movie based its story on should be a pretty wellwritten book but I highly doubt that it is suitable to be adapted into a movie. That's the thing with Japanese novels typically. Japanese authors use beautiful words and construct beautiful worlds but unfortunately the beauty is so surreal that it can only exists in the head. Well there are some very good adaptations of Japanese novels say Yogisha X no Kenshin for example. However in that case apart from the allaround brilliant acting from the actors the plot plays a very important role too. The novel itself has a very strong plot and the truth behind the crime is so impactful that it makes it difficult for anyone or anything to screw its adaptation. Unfortunately this is no Yogisha X no Kenshin. I have not read the book and i'm not prejudging but still i know it is a horrible movie. Just like I have not read Twilight but I know it is not adapted well.".

	schema:reviewBody "Bibi Blocksberg is a German 100minute movie from 2002 so this one has its 15th anniversary this year already. It was directed by Hermine Huntgeburth one of Germany's most known female filmmakers and the script is by Elfie Donnelly actually the one who invented the Bibi Blocksberg character a long time ago. Everybody here in Germany knows her really even today so so many years after the cassettes etc. original came out. This of course also has to do with Detlev Buck's recent films about the little which even if these are really only very vaguely based on the Bibi Blocksberg character. But back to this one here. this is the first of two films starring child actress Sidonie von Krosigk as Bibi and looking at her body of work it seems she has stopped acting now. The fact that kids films were already incredibly popular back then is also easy to see with the names Riemann Noethen Harfouch and maybe also Hain in the cast. Harfouch playing the main antagonist even won a German Film Award for her performance here and while I like her as an actress I am not too sure how much of the character was really great performing and how much was costume and makeup. Anyway the movie was also nominated for Youth Film of the Year but lost out to a modern version of Das fliegende Klassenzimmer. Saw that one as well and I think Bibi is better and should have won.So yeah the story here is basically about Bibi being introduced to the circle of witches very early thanks to great achievements and this upsets another witch who even has to give her magic glass ball to Bibi. Also there is a lot of talk and action about the equivalent to a fountain of youth in here. And the major conflict is about witchcraft vs. no witchcraft as Bibi's dad is of course a normal human which also brings some solid comedy. I also think the comedy here is the best aspect about the film. Every time it got a bit dramatic like the missing money or ability to perform witchcraft taken away from Bibi's mother is when the movie is not exactly at its best. Still I think Riemann was somewhat bearable in here despite occasional overacting as usual and I am not a fan of her at all. The music was soso. Not bad but also the songs weren't really catchy. This film is for everybody who wants their Bibi close to the audio cassettes and not as a youth film that almost exists on his own Buck's approach. But the latter has Tina and horses in it after all while this one here really almost entirely focuses on the concept of witchcraft. There are reasons why one is better than the other and the other way around. Eventually it all comes down to subjective taste I think. I myself enjoyed the watch here and I think back then when Harry Potter was really trending hard we also have a decent film on a similar subject from Germany. Go check it out.".

	schema:reviewBody "A copsnrobbers movie but not at all typical.  An interesting departure from the stylized violence of classic HK movies such as those directed by John Woo.  Despite the chaos of those movies there was always something neat and organized about the action a choreography.  Kind of like a fireworks display.  As exuberant and fun as that style is Beast Cops is an example of a new sort of HK cinema.And it's a bit messy.  Even the characters are somewhat sloppy spitting on sidewalks flinging beer cans in the backseat etc.  No one in this movie looks particularly dashing.Even the violence is messy.  For some reason guns are seldom used and most of the damage is caused by beating people with sticks or stabbing them with knives.  And the knives aren't even coollooking they look like kitchen cleavers.  So there's a more handson and labored feeling about the violence as opposed to the more effortless killing accomplished by guns.But the slapdash feel and somewhat primitive action actually amounts to a very purposeful sophistication and insight about the characters.  All the characters are realistically flawed and the emotions feel genuine.  The usual conflicts of loyaltybetrayal and the notion of brotherhood are all addressed but the outcome is not formulaic or predictable.Over all this is a very wellmade movie.  The acting is firstrate with Anthony Wong as Tung being especially good as his character spans a confident wiseass a dejected lover a ballsy hero to a fullon psycho. Instead of a fireworks display this movie is more like abstract art  a whole different kind of pleasure.".

	onyx:emotionText "A copsnrobbers movie but not at all typical.  An interesting departure from the stylized violence of classic HK movies such as those directed by John Woo.  Despite the chaos of those movies there was always something neat and organized about the action a choreography.  Kind of like a fireworks display.  As exuberant and fun as that style is Beast Cops is an example of a new sort of HK cinema.And it's a bit messy.  Even the characters are somewhat sloppy spitting on sidewalks flinging beer cans in the backseat etc.  No one in this movie looks particularly dashing.Even the violence is messy.  For some reason guns are seldom used and most of the damage is caused by beating people with sticks or stabbing them with knives.  And the knives aren't even coollooking they look like kitchen cleavers.  So there's a more handson and labored feeling about the violence as opposed to the more effortless killing accomplished by guns.But the slapdash feel and somewhat primitive action actually amounts to a very purposeful sophistication and insight about the characters.  All the characters are realistically flawed and the emotions feel genuine.  The usual conflicts of loyaltybetrayal and the notion of brotherhood are all addressed but the outcome is not formulaic or predictable.Over all this is a very wellmade movie.  The acting is firstrate with Anthony Wong as Tung being especially good as his character spans a confident wiseass a dejected lover a ballsy hero to a fullon psycho. Instead of a fireworks display this movie is more like abstract art  a whole different kind of pleasure.";

Anthony Wong gives an astonishing performance as a cop who walks the line between police officer and triad. Michael Wong is for once not completely bland and even has a couple of wonderful comic moments. And the violence in this film is remarkably startling which is not something I find too much in Hong Kong cinema. In most films even in masterpieces like The Killer or City on Fire the violence is relatively unsurprising. Here perhaps because it's mostly committed with crude machetes the violence is brutal and tough. And the way it's cut and edited makes it all the more effective. For fans of Hong Kong cinema it's not to be missed. And even for people who aren't usual fans of that genre this is an interesting film to check out. From me this is easily a 910.".

This is a totally different kind of film with casual believable dialogue some great acting and its cowboys and indians not so clearly defined. Not that it isn't high on stylish shotframing editing and dynamite costume design this is after all still a Hong Kong production. But I saw flashes of Cassavettes and Pedro Almodovarless homage to Ringo Lam or Ronny Yu. Anthony Wong's character Brother Tung still gets to go crazy at the end and spill a lot of blood in a gritty handtohand fight scene. What more could one ask? I've seen more than my share of slowmotion shootouts. This film is something more a drama at times a comedy with cops and triads as its milieu rather than its reason for being. An easy five stars.".

But an actioner this is not. Sure there are some violent scenes consisting of some sword fighting and occasional gun firing but just not enough to qualify it as hard hitting action that you can expect from this type of Hong Kong film. And before you condemn me for being superficial or not open minded enough. This is advertised as a brilliant action film. You got to put the money where your mouth is. Plus when a film doesn't offer what is promised I will be the first one to embrace whatever goodness that is delivered.Except there is none. Even for a triad film Beast Cops doesn't convince. Yes there are gangsters and the usual betrayal shenanigans. But it hardly shows what the triads do or why they are so feared. Plot wise this seemed such an important factor since these triads were so friendly with the cops. With the lack of story and suspense I at least expected some interesting things to happen. I mean why else would so many praise the hell out of this.. Well I kept waiting and waiting and it never came.And what was Michael Wong doing in this? It seemed he was lost and on his way to the set of another crappy film he is featured in. Honestly I do like the guy but let's face it he is one of the most boring actors in Hong Kong cinema. He didn't make much sense here. The only thing I could think of was that the director wanted to show some contrast between him and Anthony Wong's character. If that was the idea than he failed miserably. Compared to similar Hong Kong films Beast Cops doesn't add anything new other than humour which in my book wasn't enough for me to truly enjoy this.Ignore the fact that Beast Cops has won many awards and that it is praised. It is not deserving of that at all. Avoid!".

The film is neither of these extremes and its quality really is a compromise of both stances.The begin with the story it tells is rather straight forward with a typical flow of narrative we have seen in several other Asian thrillers. The story however is not a complete carbon copy of these other films and does have its own unique flavor but the similarities can not be ignored.What does set it apart from these other Asian thriller is the way it is told. The film is disclosed in a terrific and unique visual flair. The film features some savvy cinematography and flashy lighting to really add a wonderful ambiance and atmosphere to the proceedings which does help elevate its otherwise mundane plot.The narrative also is infused with a good amount of comedy causing the film to operate more as an action comedy rather than a straight action thriller. However this is both to its advantage and disadvantage. The comedy does add a refreshing spin on the genre making the film feel fresher than others of its ilk but the comedy and serious violence is presented too unevenly making the film have a crisis in identity. At one moment the audience is expected to laugh and the next we are to cringe at the intensity and brutality of the action. This leads us to assume the film wasn't quite sure which direction to embrace.However the acting really is a key point that aids in its overall success. Anthony Wong is on hand to give another terrific performance. Many critics cite this as one of his best roles if not the best one he ever had. The reasons are quite clear as Wong can both exemplify a tender heart in softer scenes and a determined vengeful soul in harder scenes. On account of his performance some of the uneven issues in tones are brought to an equilibrium but are unfortunately not entirely resolved.The acting form the supporting cast are adequate but nothing noteworthy. Some of the performances are rather over the top but that seems to be often the case in Asian thrillers The rest are fortunately competent.Overall if the script had greater focus and didn't conform to several conventional elements then this film would have been one of the better thrillers to come out of Hong Kong. As it is the film is a rather typical action thriller told in an invigorating manor. Recommended for anyone interested in thriller genre but if you are a causal film viewer or if the genre isn't your forte then there are better examples out there.".

Harrison Ford perhaps the true star of the show fully embraced the character of Pomeroy did a wonderfully fantastic job being grumpy conceited and an allaround asshole in one of his best roles as of late.Morning Glory is a nice tale that will leave you with a sweet taste in your mouth.

The Plot Morning Glory is the story of one enthusiastic workaholic Becky Fuller Rachael McAdams who is fired from her job at a Morning television show. Unemployed and desperate she jumps at the offer of Executive Producer for a low budget failing Morning show. The presenter of which is the sour wannabe diva Colleen Peck Diane Keaton and the employees of which are under constant pressure to raise the audience ratings. Determined to prove her boss wrong Becky Fuller goes to great lengths to improve the standard. One of her missions is to employ world famous reporter and the third most horrible person in the world Mike Pomeroy Harrison Ford as copresenter. My Opinion There are some movies that leave you indifferent. You walk out of the theater shrugging your shoulders and contemplating what to cook for dinner. Then there are those that leave you with a definite emotion. Morning Glory for me was the latter. As the closing credits scrolled I was inspired. I skipped out with a cando spirit. Maybe its due to Rachel McAdam's contagious radiance. Maybe its Harrison Ford's excellent acting. Maybe it was the simple plot and happy ending. I don't really know. All I know is that even now the after effect of this light comedy was pure conviction that anything can happen if you work hard and really want it.To put it plainly this romantic comedy was a pleasure to watch.

A plot like this doesn't really have much in the way of surprises. What really matters is how well the characters are written and how well the actors play their respective parts. While none of the cast is terrible standing out are a lowkey Jeff Goldblum playing a cynical network executive. While an over stated loud performance would have sufficed Goldblum plays it a pragmatic working guy. He gets in a few good zingers early on though. The other standout is Harrison Ford. While he hasn't had much success in the field he is actually very good at comedy usually playing the straight man to what is going on around him. Here he plays the gruffly lovable curmudgeon pretty well. A significant part of the the plot is his character's personal growth. On the whole Morning Glory isn't going to sweep any of the major awards but it's a gentle way to pass two hours and get a few good laughs in the process.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's no secret that people go to see movies touted as being comedies for one reason they want it to be funny and thereby make them feel a little better or at least lighten their mood. That's what I was looking for when I went in to see this film. Thankfully I was rewarded with more feel good value than I had paid for. This film is terrific entertainment.I'll add that I enjoyed this film on a number of levels.First was the pure comedic value which was high. Rachel McAdams owned nearly every scene she was in with not just her dropdeadgorgeousgoodlooks but with her well applied talent invested into this somewhat quirky high energy character. McAdams' Becky was a finely crafted portrait of a warm likable very intelligent hyperkinetic lovable screwball of a young woman. Her every moment on screen exuded lovable charm by the truckload she's never looked more appealing or more lovely.But McAdams certainly didn't have to carry this funny film on her own. She was ably assisted by some of the finest people in Hollywood in the persons of Harrison Ford Diane Keaton Jeff Goldblum John Pankow Patrick Wilson Matt Malloy Ty Burrell Patti D'Arbanville and a long list of equally great supporters. What a great selection of professionals.Ford was splendid as the emotionally parsimonious codger of an overthehill anchor. Not to be outdone Diane Keaton was as terrific as ever in her turn as Ford's cynical combative coanchor which she carried off with a wonderful exuberance and energy.Jeff Goldblum  who always seems to land roles as some kind of different personality  was excellent as Ms. McAdams' crabby boss. McAdams' colleague Lenny was well worn by John Pankow who seems to add to everything I've ever seen him in. Patrick Wilson as McAdams' love interest wasn't given much material to work with but his time on screen was well spent adding a quality performance in just the right place. Ty Burrell was funny and at the same time kind of spooky as an unappealingly unctuous departing anchor. Though a small part it was pleasant to see Patti D'Arbanville play McAdams' mother with appropriate love and concern.I saved Matt Malloy for last because he was an unexpected treasure. His portrayal of the show's weatherman suddenly thrust into a new and challenging role was particularly hilarious the proverbial icing on the cake.The second area of enjoyment was the overall effort put into the sets art direction sound and the other technical areas. Everything was first rate which added to the realism.Finally their depiction of the behind the scenes areas of a hectic television studio came across as spot on actually heightening the chaos that seemed to follow McAdams everywhere. You can't go wrong seeing this film if you're looking for a fun night at the movies.A big thank you to the makers of this entertaining gem! By Bruce L. Jones httpwebpages.charter.netbruce.jones1".

	schema:reviewBody "Daybreak pokes pleasant fun at today's 3 morning TV shows and the ins and outs of it and the world of television news broadcasting. It portrays all types of news and society archetypes  the ambitious young TV producer fired from her local TV station who wants higher ratings Rachel McAdams the brash nononsense seasoned and substantial anchorman Harrison Ford the perky female anchorman who smiles at everything yet is not completely comfortable working with an anchor who doesn't smile Diane Keaton the comical weatherman who breezes through forecasts and does humorous onair stunts Matt Malloy the producer's boss who gets angry when things don't go well Jeff Goldblum the onthejob boyfriend who wishes the producer wouldn't take her job too seriously Patrick Wilson the sexually charged younger anchor who the producer fires right away before hiring her the more seasoned veteran anchorman Ty Burrell and the producer's mother in a small part who makes her aware of today's unemployment and downsizing Patti D'Arbanville. All these people and much more elements make up Morning Glory and tells us about the world that we live in today.McAdams is young Becky Fuller fired from her local TV station as the producer in New Jersey and then gets her big break accepting the job of a fourthplace morning news show producer at a fictitious TV network across from 30 Rock called IBS. That morning news show is called Daybreak which relies more on style than substance. Right away after Becky fires the lecherous anchorman Burrell she meets her childhood idol in the elevator named Mike Pomeroy Ford. And as much as she has loved him all her life from afar he initially doesn't reciprocate his feelings to her. She meets Colleen Peck Keaton who despite her onair smiles has a tough edge. She spent 11 years on the show and has worked with at least 15 anchorman none who she really got along with. Now Peck and Pomeroy meet she smiles he grunts and they eventually go head to head over their news styles. Ratings are close to cancellation due to clashing anchorpeople in contrast to the friendly repartee of Matt Lauer Meredith Vieira Ann Curry and Al Roker that we get to see every day on The Today Show and the silly stuff played on the show all the time.After an important interview with the governor where Pomeroy whisks Becky to see the substance of his career Becky is offered a job as the producer of the always toprated Today Show and feels that she had enough of Pomeroy's arrogance and ego and demeaning attitude towards her. Predictably enough Pomeroy loosens up and shares his secrets of cooking frittatas something he did share personally with Becky. Ratings soar. We get that conventional happy romcom ending just as we are always manipulated to believe that the heroine and hero depart after a quarrel in the third act.Morning Glory won't be as Oscarworthy as Network or Broadcast News since both have more substance in them. But despite the fluffy nature a word that Pomeroy avoids there is more intelligence in this movie than you would expect. The first rate cast of older pros Keaton Ford Goldblum and younger rising stars McAdams Wilson Burrell make it worthwhile and deliver smart sassy humor and snappy zingers.".

The story focuses around a young female producer that is hard working and hoping to get her dream job of Executive Producer EP of a well known TV morning show. Instead she is accepted into the EP position on a failing TV morning show. Dedicated to her career which was her dream since age 8 she has little time for men and romance. As the story progresses she has countless obstacles she must overcome and a high amount of stress that comes with the job. There are many comical scenes as the producer is practically at wits end during the main duration of the movie. She doesn't seem to lose her cool much of the movie and when she does become infused with anger or passion she is constructive in using it to complete her job. This is a feel good story that shows with hard work dedication following a dream since age 8! a bit of luck and having faith in yourself you can accomplish your goals. A nice change from the current female lead characters currently out there.I left the theater thinking about my own career and how I could improve myself or work ethics. This movie is definitely a gosee!".

	schema:reviewBody "Morning Glory is a splendid work of film making comprised of a winning storyline and characters we come to care about. Hats off to the writers as the script really gives the movie a shot of adrenaline and reels you in. I consider it one of the year's finer comedies in an environment where abrasive humor seems to draw people in droves. What Morning Glory isn't is a romantic comedy or a chick flick as what we are tending to see on the previews. Rather a story of an executive producer determined to turn around a dying TV show in comic fashion.Rachel McAdams plays Becky Fuller a laidoff executive producer scratching and clawing for a new job in the industry. She comes across a network station at the bottom of the totem pole and sees her chance. Working with Mike Pomeroy Harrison Ford and Colleen Peck Diane Keaton as her 2 cohosts the challenge just begins when she starts her plan to increase the show's viewer count.McAdams' character Becky Fuller is inspired the hard charging workaholic personality on the laptop late at night searching for that next breaking news story. Of course by working all the time her social life is nonexistent. Her energy and optimism is infectious as she impresses us with on her first day taking many drastic measures needed to make the station better. We come to root for her as she faces complacency and apathy all around her she rises above it and we watch with bated breath to see what she'll do next. She is very diplomatic and manages to deal with all sorts of personalities for the betterment of the show.Harrison Ford redeems himself from his role as a scientist in the year's earlier flop Extraordinary Measures. He portrays Mike Pomeroy the seasoned news anchor who only does the big stories. His comments about famous people he's interviewed in the past and now has to do a silly morning TV show arouse laughs. Pomeroy is the gruff seasoned veteran of the show stiff and stern and brings a prima donna attitude in with him that he has standards and much of what is requested by Fuller is simply beneath him. Pomeroy comes to change his character to someone more likable by the time the film ends. Pomeroy's best moments are no doubt when he is putting down his cohost. The adversarial relationship between he and Peck is all too fun to watch. One of the finer moments with Pomeroy we discover that his workaholic mentality voided him of any close family relationships and we feel for him hoping that Fuller will take his wisdom and adjust her approach.Diane Keaton plays Colleen Peck the primary face of the show who has been through all the changes over the years including 15 different executive producers. She is skeptical of Fuller because of how terrible the show is and beyond help and believes there is no hope. Peck is lively and shoots back at Pomeroy's comments with her own zingers. She is willing and receptive to Fuller's ideas to improve the show and shows us her zeal by stepping out on faith with the new changes. Definitely one of the gems in the movie and a true pleasure to watch.There is no doubt magic and chemistry in the air with the strength of the cast. It is fun to watch Pomeroy drive Peck and Fuller nuts and the sparring cohosts bring a lively and light mood to the film. We come to care about what Fuller is trying to do and root her on as she encounters what seems to be insurmountable odds. This is a feelgood inspirational story that builds from the very beginning never backpedalling with a minor romantic element added in.810 stars".

	schema:reviewBody "I can understand when a single big name actor signs on to a dreadful movie for the sake of a paycheque. Why not? I do wonder though when three veteran and fairly big name actors do it. Harrison Ford? Diane Keaton? Jeff Goldblum? OK. I'm not huge fans of any of them and I've had mixed reactions to their work over the years but I can't deny that they're pretty big names  and they signed on for this. Did they not read the script beforehand and realize how pathetic this was?Rachel McAdams is the star of this as Becky Fuller a young producer who gets a job putting out the worst morning show in the country on the fictional IBS network. Her challenge? Get the ratings up or the show is finished  and her along with it. She hires big name anchorman Mike Pomeroy Ford to give the show a degree of credibility gravitas as it's referred to at one point only to find that he's a shallow and egotistical twit who won't do any of the things needed to make morning television work and who makes his attitude toward the show and his co workers quite clear. Keaton is his coanchor and Goldblum is head of the network's news department.There's some humour in this  mostly provided by Ford although at times I couldn't figure out if his deadpan approach and rather bored look throughout was his take on the character or his take on the movie as a whole. Goldblum's part wasn't a big one but Keaton shared a bit in some of the humour with Ford especially when the two took to insulting each other on the air which did make me smile a little bit. But a bit of humour really doesn't save this. McAdams seemed to struggle valiantly with the role and attempted to inject a little bit of energy into it  which was desperately needed because this is simply not an energetic movie. Like Pomeroy it's shallow it's dull and it's predictable. It's also rather hard to believe that in the space of just a few weeks Becky goes from being fired as the producer of a local morning show to being hired as producer of a network morning show to being offered a job with the Today Show. The writers also decided  for no apparent reason except that it's apparently considered necessary in this kind of movie  to throw in a rather poorly developed romance for her which seemed to accomplish little except allowing her to shoot a couple of scenes in her underwear. Yeah. She's pretty cute. But that's certainly not enough to save this.This truly isn't worth the effort of watching. 210".

But a bit of humour really doesn't save this. McAdams seemed to struggle valiantly with the role and attempted to inject a little bit of energy into it  which was desperately needed because this is simply not an energetic movie. Like Pomeroy it's shallow it's dull and it's predictable. It's also rather hard to believe that in the space of just a few weeks Becky goes from being fired as the producer of a local morning show to being hired as producer of a network morning show to being offered a job with the Today Show. The writers also decided  for no apparent reason except that it's apparently considered necessary in this kind of movie  to throw in a rather poorly developed romance for her which seemed to accomplish little except allowing her to shoot a couple of scenes in her underwear. Yeah. She's pretty cute. But that's certainly not enough to save this.This truly isn't worth the effort of watching. 210";

	schema:headline " Diane Keaton Kisses a Frog";
	schema:reviewBody "Rachel McAdams has been at the summit of the romance genre since her performance in The Notebook in 2004. However her acting talents go far beyond this lovey dovey genre placing her in movies like Sherlock Holmes in 2009. Most of her past films reach out to the audience itself in order to connect to them however her newest film is a little harder to connect to and read. Instead it is the viewer's job to try and get something out of it. This is attributed to the film's very slow start that leads to a very funny core and an inspirational reward at the end. However the entire film is very slowly paced. So what's the story? Morning glory begins showing Rachel McAdams's character Becky Fuller attempting to be on a date with a man while she is constantly connected to her work cell phone. And yep you guessed it the date doesn't go very well. Becky is a workaholic TV producer who is fired from her producing job at her local low budget early morning news program. Consequently she feels like she has lost everything and is caught in a downward spiral with no one but her job ready to pick her up. She is finally hired to produce the failing secondrate early morning show Day Break on the network IBS. In order to save the show Becky teams up with her famous yet washed up news anchor hero Mike Pomeroy played by Harrison Ford and ditsy Colleen Peck played by Diane Keaton as they go on a journey to selfdiscovery. Along the way Becky meets a man named Adam Bennett played by Patrick Wilson who he ultimately has to decide what is more important her job or her love life?The film is best at its core bringing gut wrenching laughs by the dozens with its ridiculous morning show TV antics. Ranging from kissing a frog to skydiving everyone at Day Break are let loose by Becky giving the film its best moments. Diane Keaton is in the center of these comedic moments as her ditsy news anchor character Colleen holds nothing back. Therefore the actors are the most important part of this film. Rachel McAdams and Harrison Ford create a peculiar father daughter chemistry as they portray the struggle of their characters to work with each other. Therefore their different acting styles mesh very well. Rachel McAdams being one of the sweetest and most talented present day actresses is so absorbed in the part it is almost impossible to separate her from her character Becky. Harrison Ford's performance differs a lot from his Indiana Jones Star Wars and Blade Runner roots as he fuses the washed up hard exterior of Mike Pomeroy with heart and soul.The film suffers from the addition of extra characters and failing to fully develop their story and background. They are only relevant to one scene and do not have any impact on the film as a whole. Becky's mother Patti D. Arbanville is one of these characters as she gives Becky her I think you are throwing your life away speech at the beginning of the film. This is followed by the appearance of other nothing characters that take away from the impact of the film. The film is also very slow to start and very slow to inspire until a little snippet at the end of the film. Yes it is inspiring but it comes at a time a little too late instead of building gradually throughout the movie it hits you in the face just before the movie ends.Everyone deserves to have his or her own glory in oneway or another. However even though hard work is important everyone needs help at one time or another from close relationships and family. So that's the story Morning Glory is a very enjoyable story that you should see at least on DVD.".

	schema:headline " McAdams and Ford shine!";
	schema:reviewBody "'MORNING GLORY' Three and a Half Stars Out of Five Rachel McAdams shines in this surprisingly clever and uplifting news comedy reminiscent of similar films from decades ago. It's directed by Roger Michell who also directed the exceptional 'CHANGING LANES' and 'NOTTING HILL' and written by Aline Brosh McKenna who's written a handful of similar themed romcoms including 'THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA' 'LAWS OF ATTRACTION' and '27 DRESSES'. It's produced by J.J. Abrams and features a top notch supporting cast including Diane Keaton Jeff Goldblum and Patrick Wilson. It's costar Harrison Ford that really steals the show though giving one of his best performances in years.McAdams stars as a work obsessed TV show producer named Becky who's so obsessed with her job that she's relationship challenged and awkward around men of course not convincingly so but McAdams does a more than adequate job trying to pull it off. As the film opens she's let go from her current job and hired on to the struggling morning news show 'Daybreak'. The show is long past it's prime and it's ratings are barely able to keep it on the air. On her first day Becky fires the sexist cohost Paul McVee Ty Burrell of TV's 'MODERN FAMILY' and then is faced with the dilemma of replacing him with no budget. She soon discovers that legendary veteran news anchor Mike Pomeroy Ford who she idolized as a kid is still under contract with the station for two years. So she forces the aged superstar who thinks the show is beneath him and his standards into taking the job. He of course clashes with his veteran cohost Keaton and everyone else on the show. Becky fights hard to make it work though and save the show from it's dismal ratings while trying to juggle a newfound relationship.The film is somewhat clichd and predictable fluff but it's pumped with a lot of lovable energy from it's A list cast. I've been a fan of McAdams for several years now and this might be one of her best performances yet. She brings a believable likability to the role that the usual bigger stars that are typically cast in a movie like this Julia Roberts Sandra Bullock etc. never could. Her energy and enthusiastic performance really make the movie and the only thing that possibly outdoes her is Harrison Ford. He hasn't been this funny and likable in several years and he and McAdams have great chemistry together. The rest of the cast is adequate but those two really make the film work. There's some clever writing and the directing is fitting although the film feels a little rushed towards the end. As far as this type of material goes it's definitely not a bad little film.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at httpwww.youtube.comwatch?vdVckROOANw".

What is he doing in this movie? Diane Keaton shouldn't have done such a shrill and desperate looking role  its beneath her stature. Patrick Wilson looks ill at ease.The screenplay is just bad. The story is predictable and drawn out. After a few jokes in the beginning it's just downhill from there and there are so few laughs its almost hard to understand how they could make such movies.".

The story starts with Becky going to work at a failing morning show she brings in Harrison Ford's character Mike to help the falling viewer ship. An so starts the battle of the personalities. The main characters play well off each other with a very well written script. I saw the movie with two friends and we all agreed that we hadn't laughed so hard at a movie in a long time but it had its sweet moments that brought a tear or two as well. I will definitely be adding this to my movie collection.".

Even if you don't know the actors even if you're not into the music of the 60s you've got pure feelgood fun thrown in to top it off for a great evening of the 60s Rock'n'Roll partying. And it's partying in the true 60s sense of the word.On the other hand if you're looking for profound plot development historical accuracy and consistency or a true story of a real pirate radio station Caroline that inspired the story or in fact would like to see a true depiction of the life in the UK in 1966 do NOT go see this film because you might leave disappointed.It's as simple as that.So a definite recommendation for cinema viewing because of the necessary volume that the speakers allow you there to enjoy the music to the fullest and let me say one more time what music it is! but stay out if you're not in a party mood.I give it 810 for the feelgood cool entertainment it brings and.... well for the Rock'n'Roll.Have fun!".

	schema:reviewBody "Richard Curtis' first 'non romantic comedy film' is really another romantic comedy film it's just that the romantic bit gets swamped within 20 other subplots so you try and not notice.The Boat That Rocked sees Carl  Tom Surridge  go aboard Radio Rock a pirate radio station owned by Quentin  Bill Nighy  whose DJ's Phillip Semour Hoffman Rhys Ifans Nick Frost Chris O' Dowd Rhys Darby etc.  broadcast 24hour rock and roll music to the UK. They are adored by the populace but hated by the government including the Minister of Communications  Kenneth Branagh  and his chief subordinate  Jack Davenport  who aim to shut them down.If that was the extent of the plot then it would probably be a 100 mins film. However the Boat That Rocked has so many little subplots many seeming like excuses to put in another montage or cameo cast appearance that the time has ballooned out to 154mins and it does tell at times. Furthermore while Richard Curtis is entitled to look back on these days with an air of nostalgia he sometimes seems to get a little too weepy eyed with the story.But these faults are more than made up for in the performances all of which are good and some are outstanding. Phillip Seymour Hoffman's Count is a lovable character who approaches everything with great gusto while Chris O' Dowd's Simple Simon has a wonderful part in the middle section of the movie which brings a little bit of emotion to what is a pretty emotionally vacant movie. Nick Frost is cheeky as Dr Dave and finally Rhys Darby fresh from Flight of the Conchords simply shines in his role as the unpopular and daggy Angus who nonetheless gets arguably the best line in the whole movie.Overall the Boat That Rocked is silly and entertaining fun. It does get overweight by a looong script but the soundtrack and the cast are good enough to carry it through.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you think of Four weddings and a Funeral or Notting Hill you will be a little disappointed being here the overall tone not so brilliant dialogues not so sparkling however the both humorous and moving atmosphere of Richard Curtis's comedies is still recognizable.I think the real protagonist in The boat that rocked is music that sound poprock that in the 60's began to move the world and to be opposed by the establishment as a dangerous weapon in the hands of the multitudes as a threat to a well consolidated but no longer valid system. Among unreal situations a totallylacking plot among odd and eccentric characters what only matters is that power of music to revive one's spirits to give voice to the most uncontrolled animal ancestral instincts of man. And thus becomes in my opinion the most vivid scene that of those hundreds of records floating on the water the symbol of a generation of an era that was then ready to explode and that no strict establishment could have wiped away even once illegal radio stations were shut down.No revolutionary message is conveyed it's a goodhumoured and at intervals melancholic tribute to a generation who maybe ingenuously but deeply and truly believed in out of timevalues friendship respect love and believed that music was a strong and powerfully effective means to convey them. Even if you don't belong to that generation each of us has experienced one or more times in one's life the communion of a piece of music with the most sensitive chords of our soul it's about something emotional but also physical and that's what the director just wants to celebrate. If you are fond of music or simply you have once in your life been moved by a song you will like this movie or at least enjoy it for what it is without the necessity of too much criticism.".

I have some tapes sent to me by a friend in the UK of different pirate radio broadcasts from pirate ships in the 1960's70's and could only imagine what it would be like to be broadcasting from sea. This film brought that imagination to life bringing you back to a time before automated bland format radio stations with no personality became the norm to a time when DJ's were celebrities.I'm sure it's a fanciful interpretation and probably nowhere near to reality but it was definitely entertaining to watch the antics of DJ's and radio crew who just wanted to bring a genre of music to the British Isles that for some reason the BBC and British government didn't think it necessary at all. The movie is entertaining and gives quite a few funny moments like when the nighttime DJ risks his life to save an album from the sinking ship only to have another DJ call the album crap and toss it back into the water.Even if you're not a fan of pirate radio you should be entertained by this movie. It is kind of a David vs. Goliath story even though Goliath doesn't fall down dead. This is a movie I'll want to watch again and again but then again I'm a radio nerd.".

The very wellscripted allstar casted characters created as organic a cast performance as I can remember seeing since Milk. The story of pirate radio leaves its foamtrail through the leaders of p2p filesharing and their unwavering declaration that art should be enjoyed by all not only the few who are able to pay more than a meal's worth to be able to purchase a copy of the product prepackaged by an Industry that is certainly not furthering music as an artform. Getting back to the movie. This roll of film has put it together in a way that's only really reserved for good Academy Award winning pictures but it doesn't get all Curious Case of Benjamin Button on you. The superb cast of actors all deliver quite genuine performances even though it takes some growing into like the movie but there's enough sarcastic profanity that doesn't push it over the comfort zone. The tale of Radio Rock and its crew is one that transcends personality and nationality. Lots of sex and friendship and love this movie is the antithesis of the consumeristic slavery of our civilization and is a loose guide to what we should all strive for in life. The Hitlerlike English committeeman in charge with taking care of the Radio Pirates is an unabashedly serious caricature of governmentled regulators holding the link between revenue generating industries and the voices of progress each always trying to tip the balance in their favor. The plot gracefully glides into its climax and with no extended cuddling it exits leaving us a nice retrospective of the experience. For the patient and passionate viewer this film is highly recommended.cypheristikal".

	schema:reviewBody "The basic premise is that if you can pick music from nine years in the most productive periods in popular music you should have a great basis for a film. Sure enough the tracks were well chosen in general even though only snatches were heard of some. The soundtrack CD has some eccentric choices such as Crimson  Clover by Tommy James rather than Mony Mony but I can't remember this in the film anyway. After its wellloved soundtrack I am struggling to think of something good to say about this film. It has Richard Curtis's standard themes of each person has someone out there with whom to fall instantly in love and that a fourletter word will always cause a laugh but sadly there are few other comedic moments. What is worse is that the characters are barely developed and so you never identify with anyone. Instead I got the impression that writers had several halfbaked ideas but no one ever got round to picking just one or two. For example after the son discovers his father they just look a bit uncomfortable and the scene shifts to something else. In short this is a film still in search of a script. I think Richard Curtis thought his reputation would be sufficient. He was wrong.And do not expect it to bear any relationship to history though in fairness Richard Curtis admits that its objective was only entertainment rather than truth. Even so it is still worth mentioning that instead of being a bunch of idealists who would go down with the ship many of the DJs simply joined the BBC in 1967 Tony Blackburn Dave Cash Kenny Everett Ed Stewart Dave Lee Travis Johnny Walker etc. All in all a waste of an evening though sitting through some of trailers before the film made me realise the forthcoming attractions would have been far far worse so I ended up feeling grateful!".

Not a single moment of truth not a single moment of beauty. It is quite simply atrocious. It also felt endless and I'm not giving it a 1 because there are some spot on musical moments within the otherwise opportunistic score. I liked Richard Curtis but he is taking his formula of odd ball characters to a place where no human being the thinking kind ever ventures. A French farce with typically scatological British touches. And Philip Seymour Hoffman? What's with this guy? Very good actor but his dishevelment is starting to get on my nerves. Even as Truman Capote I felt he needed a shower. Emma Thompson has a grand cameo but quite frankly it belonged to a completely different film. None of it ringed true and if I sound angry it may be because I am. I left my house I drove under the rain had to park paid outrageous fees for parking tickets a drink and then I had to sit through this mess of a thing. There is a moment on the last third when the characters hit by a Titanic style emergency have to transmit their boat's location and you wait with unbearable impatience for the inevitable crowd of boats coming to their rescue. Oh dear Oh dear. Kenneth Brannagh comes to elevate slightly the boring proceedings with a fine tuned cartoonish villain. Lost at sea that's how I felt and as you may very well imagine I didn't like it one bit.".

I thought the characters and the actors were great although some of the characters we're a bit useless i liked them after i was about 20 min into the film.

The humour is pitiful and crude the characters obnoxious and the storyline both manages to feel inauthentic and uninteresting. The film follows the unengaging waifish protagonist Carl Tom Sturridge finding love and reuinting with his estranged father in the most obvious plot twist of the century. The film is then stretched to over two hours and decorated with a repertoire of cringeworthy sex jokes from the crusty ageing cast all the while trying to convince us we should care about their pirate radio station being shut down.Now inexplicably repackaged for the US markets as Pirate Radio I can only advise our transatlantic cousins to steer well clear of this mess.".

	schema:headline " The Boat That Sucked a.k.a. Carry on Broadcasting";
	schema:reviewBody "The Boat That Rocked should have been a great movie given its subject matter but unfortunately writerdirector Richard Curtis has provided a poor script that really should have had a number of rewrites before it was put into production. Unfortunately Curtis has really has lost his way in the last few years since he wrote and directed Love Actually which was a good film actually. But whilst he has undoubtedly done good work in the past he clearly needs a director who can tell him what works and what doesn't. It is telling that he has reportedly credited director Mike Newell for the success of Four Weddings and a Funeral in steering his script towards a general story arc rather than a collection of comic setpieces. Unfortunately this film could have done with Newell's input it is nearly all comic setpieces most of which are not that funny. Curtis is clearly not the best director of his own material and if he ever gets to make another film for Working Title one hopes that Tim Bevan and Eric Fellner will hire someone other than Curtis to direct it.Some of the actors in this film fare better than others. Philip Seymour Hoffman is excellent as The Count obviously based on Emperor Rosko proving that acting quality can make up for a lot. Bill Nighy plays Bill Nighy excellently and Rhys Ifans Ralph Brown Nick Frost and Chris O'Dowd do a lot with what they are given. However newcomer Tom Sturridge the son of Brideshead Revisited director Charles Sturridge is lumbered with the Hugh Grant role complete with ums and ers and the floppy hair style while Tom Brooke playing Thick Kevin gets saddled with dialogue that is clearly stale Baldrick leftovers from Blackadder. Recycling is a good thing to be sure but it shouldn't extend to recycling characters from filmstelevision programmes that you may have written in the past. Feel free at this point to rearrange the words trick one and pony into a wellknown phrase.As for the female actresses they suffer a worse fate. The talented Gemma Arterton and Tallulah Riley both get cough and spit roles that mainly consist of taking their clothes off and getting into bed with Nick Frost at least I can see what attracted Nick Frost to this film. January Jones from American Pie The Wedding and Curtis' Love Actually turns up long enough to marry Chris O'Dowd before running off with Rhys Ifans 17 hours later and Emma Thompson as Sturridge's mother is depicted as a slut a sexual legend. Doesn't Curtis realise how sexist his portrayal of women is in this film? Only the lesbian character portrayed by Katherine Parkinson is treated with any sympathy more I suspect due to the diktats of political correctness than how a lesbian would really have been treated on a boat full of sexstarved men in the Sixties. As for the token coloured character don't even get me started on that. This is wish fulfilment stuff of the worst kind and completely unbelievable.However the two actors who get the rawest deal of all are Kenneth Branagh and Jack Davenport. Branagh plays the film's main villain Dormandy a stereotypical portrayal of a repressed Tory determined to clear the airwaves of anything except for classical music. In case we haven't already twigged that Branagh is the villain of the film he is always seen wearing a suit his hair slicked back and sporting a moustache that makes him look like the mutant offspring of Adolf Hitler and Blakey from On the Buses. The only surprise is that his moustache is not the twirly type beloved of Victorian melodrama. As his henchman Jack Davenport's character rejoices in the name of Twatt the sound you can hear at this point is the sound of the barrel being scraped in the search of a very cheap laugh. Naturally Branagh gets to address the unfortunate Twatt by his name at every possible opportunity as if this constant repetition will make it funnier. Memo to Curtis No it doesn't. Given that these two work in a vacuum from everyone else in the film it really would have been a good idea to get rid of them altogether and cut down the film's indulgent running time. They would not be missed.However despite all this at around the 105 minute mark something very strange happens to this film. It's the equivalent of jumpstarting a car that has a flat battery. Just when you think this particular boat is holed below the waterline and is about sink with all hands taking the careers of a number of very good people with it the boat itself starts taking on water and sinks just as happened with the Radio Caroline ship on which this film is based. And this last 30 minutes of the film is great. It's everything the previous 105 minutes should have been and wasn't. Okay so some shots in this sequence have clearly been inspired by Titanic including the plates falling off the shelves in slow motion here replaced by records but as this segment of the film is so well done I'm prepared to cut Curtis any slack I can at this point. The juxtaposition of some great music with some memorable images is particularly well done and the special effects shots are astonishing this really looks as if it was done for real even though it can't possibly have been  just like the climbing race between Rhys Ifans and Philip Seymour Hoffman earlier on.So if you get lured to the cinema or video shop to see this film on the strength of Richard Curtis' name and the great films with which he has been associated previously start off at the 105 minute mark and just watch the last half an hour of The Boat that Rocked. Because trust me it isn't going to get any better than that.".

The ending is like the beginning  a stab at a serious conclusion. The middle is total and utter garbage. My take on the middle the guts of the movie is that it is if the original script was substituted for one written by Howard Stern imagining what it must have been like to have been an offshore pirate DJ in 1966. But Stern was not there and the real story had no relationship to his style and manner of broadcasting. I saw this movie in England about a week after its original release. Having written about the real events concerning offshore pirate radio in 1966 for academic journals having been a teenager in England in 1966 who listened to those stations and having met many of the real people who made those stations a reality I was offended bored and annoyed. So avoid the movie and buy the DVD if you must in order to get the outtakes. There were two ships used in the filming but one of them ended on the cutting room floor  possibly as a result of the script change during filming. Better still save your money and hope that someone makes a movie about the real story. This movie is a total insult to anyone who listened to the real offshore pirate stations of 1966.".

Yes the characters are clich and very 1D but they are played with enough enthusiasm and charm to make up for the 'weak' script. There are places where the movie falls on the 'wrongbad' side of cringeworthy like some scenes with Herbiethe manager and Stan the best friend but overall it's an enjoyable way to spend two hours.And then there's Jimmy Orlando Bloom's character who with his naivete and haplessness manages to 'preach' without ever sounding preachy or cheesy. I know this is no Oscar movie but it isn't as mindless as some comedies out there. At its heart spoken through Jimmy's dad's quotes are some good really messages. It's almost a shame that the movie isn't cut for a younger audience. It'd be a good diversion from the usual 'teen queen' movies flooding the cinemas these days.".

But at the same time his presence in this quirky British 'mokumentary' brought the film publicity which it wouldn't have been privileged to without Bloom's status. A doubleedged sword.Orlando Bloom is clearly a pretty face. And as shown in the Calcium Kid a very pretty body ATTENTION to all teenage girls who are a fan of Orlando he is topless for a fairly long time!. But people are eager to see if Orlando can stand on his own two feet without highprofile and highlytalented actors like Johnny Depp Pirates and Brad Pitt Troy to help save his films. So far Orlando hasn't really had a chance to showcase his acting talents as he hasn't yet played the lead role in a film. Until now. Granted the Calcium Kid is a little British flick sort of in the same category as Bend it Like Beckham and it is a comedy obviously audiences aren't going to see a really insightful glimpse into Orlando's capabilities.Still the Calcium Kid is surprisingly...good. That's right. It's funny. It's simple charming and...funny!Bloom plays milkman Jimmy who is an amateur boxer a hobby of his. Jimmy has had 0 wins. 0 losses. and 0 knockouts. But a few bizarre mishaps have Jimmy facingoff with a world boxing champion and things start going terribly wrong as his ignorant and moneyhungry manager Herbie Bush very funny Omid Djalili lands him in the badbooks with his local town.Look Bloom isn't going for an Oscar with this film. It is a quaint funny little British comedy. It is a guarantee'd laugh and I highly recommend it.As Jimmy's dad says in a twohorse race one horse has to win  the Calcium Kid is a winning comedy.

	schema:reviewBody "My sister managed to track down a Region 1 copy of The Calcium Kid for me on DVD.I thought it was a good little movie. It turned out to be MUCH better than I thought it would be I figured it'd be a comedy and some good laughs but it had some serious quality to it too which was deftly executed by the writers director and the actors. Anyone who says Bloom isn't a good or even competent actor needs to watch this film honestly he lands on the scale talentwise down below Johnny Depp admittedly but he's still as good or better than a lot of stars I see on the big screen. Give me an actor any day of the week over a star has always been my motto.I've always in the past liked actors hardly anyone knew. The story is pretty simple proving yet again as I beat my head on my keyboard trying to come up with a good book idea the best stories have the least bullshit to them. Jimmy Connelly is a milk deliveryman with a dairy. This guy loves milk not just in his job but in his real life and has imbibed so much over the course of his life that his bones are hard as granite.For exercise Jimmy likes to spar in the boxing ring and answers an ad at a neighborhood gym to help English middleweight hopeful Pete Wright train for his upcoming match with MexicanAmerican middleweight world champ Jose Mendez in London. Wright breaks the bones in his hand on Jimmy's head and Pete's manager Herbie Bush is forced to find someone to step into the ring in only 7 days for the heavilytelevised match. He picks Jimmy who has no sports career and the press quickly picks up on the new kid in the David and Goliath vein of storytelling.Without giving too much away I'll just say Jimmy encounters obstacles along the way both humorous and poignantly sad. He starts the movie as a wideeyed cheerfully simple fellow and ends it pretty much the same way but does grow as a character. There are several points where Bloom's expressive facial features  eyes mouth eyebrows  tell a lot more than even what Jimmy is saying and it seems he takes direction very well from whomever is behind the camera. Jimmy's no brain trust but when push comes to shove he's smarter than he looks at least in common sense.The movie is filmed mockumentary style  the director is setting out to document Pete Wright's training a week before the match as well as his daily life and background but switches to Jimmy's story once he steps into Pete's place. The use of cutaway shots and still frames is a bit odd at first but you get used to them and it works ditto with the soundtrack choices.There were several supporting characters I liked a lot in addition to Jimmy. His manager Herbie Bush forgive me I don't have all the actors' names in front of me as I write so I'm going to refer to the character names is a guy looking to make a buck any way he can and usually comes off as strictly an opportunist lout. He's not really a bad guy though  he thinks fast on his feet and talks too much but his schemes just don't usually work out the way he envisions.Probably the characters I'll remember the most though are the crazy neighbor girl Margaret and Jimmy's pal Stan. Margaret reminds me of those celebrity stalkers you read about who just adores Jimmy. She is not however the woman you want to see him with at the end of the day. Stan is a comfortably slovenly overweight fellow who sticks by Jimmy when things go bad and ends up helping him train in odd ways. Another character I liked was Paddy Jimmy's trainer who keeps calling him the wrong name LOL. You mad old Irish bastard! My name's NOT Johnny! It's Jimmy!All in all I will definitely watch it again. I get excited by good storytelling as a writer because it inspires me in small ways.".

	schema:headline " Great underrated little film";
	schema:reviewBody "I first saw 'The Calcium Kid' at the end of 2004 and have since bought the DVD. This movie is very underrated with great performances from a mostlyunknownoutsideoftheUnitedKingom at the time cast. The film begins a week before a muchanticipated title fight between World Champion Jose Mendez Michael PenaCrash of the United States and the undefeated British challenger Pete Wright Tamer HassanThe Football Factory. Wright is injured while sparring with Jimmy Connolly Orlando Bloom a milkman who is yet to have his first fight. Fearful of losing his chance at fame Wright's manager Herbie Bush Omid Djalili replaces Wright with Connolly without telling Mendez or his takenoprisoners manager Artie Cohen Michael LernerBarton Fink. The fight gains huge amounts of publicity due to the unusual nature of it and the days preceding the fight send Connolly spiraling from underdog hopeful to fascist and everywhere in between.Orlando Bloom is great in his performance as Jimmy Connolly. I think it is his best yet in fact. As the leading man he shows his skills at comedy and is free from being overshadowed by the ensemble cast of Lord Of The Rings and Pirates Of The Caribbean. His reactions to the situations he finds himself in over the days before the big fight are priceless and pulled off realistically. Bloom acting outside his normal period piece roles proves that he can pull off many a different role.Tamer Hassan is also great as the disgruntled Pete Wright. Despite his attempts to publicly humiliate Connolly and Bush you really feel for his situation. Having the chance of a lifetime taken from you by a milkman is enough to set anybody off and Hassan does the role justice in a hilarious way.The Calcium Kid features great performances all around such as those I've already mentioned as well as Michael Pena Michael Lerner and Omid Djalili. Look for supporting roles by Rafe Spall and Billie Piper as well.Lastly something must be said of first time writerdirector Alex De Rakoff. The script is hilarious and the mockumentarystyle directing are spoton. I only hope this is the first of many for De Rakoff.To conclude The Calcium Kid is one of the funniest films I've seen in a long time. Not only that but Bloom's performance really makes you want to see his character pull off the upset of a lifetime. See this film you will not be disappointed.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a sweet and charming comedy about the milk delivery man Jimmy Connally played wonderfully by Orlando Bloom who gets the chance to fight against the undefeated world championship holder Jose Mendez in a boxing ring in London.I must admit I didn't have much hopes for the film I like British comedies but the story seemed uninteresting to me as I had only read a few bad summaries on the Net. I came across the trailer and suddenly the film seemed exciting and because I'm such a sucker for Orlando's pretty face I got the film and I fell for it almost immediately!This is without a doubt one of Orlando Bloom's better films. Comparing it to his other films let's say Troy...Troy might have been a major Hollywood movie with a famous cast expensive sets and a huge budget but as Hollywood destroyed the story I suspect everyone got disappointed by it. Calcium Kid has no flashy film sets no huge Hollywood Superstar names lining up on the posters and not an especially big budget but it only proves that everything mentioned above isn't needed to kick Hollywood's ass. The cast of this film is great with the exception of Billie Piper who destroys every scene she's in Orlando may be the big name but the other actors shouldn't go unnoticed. Omid Djalili and David Kelly especially are doing terrific jobs!!It's a wonderful film that makes you want to see it over and over again. Don't forget to check out the Deleted Scenes on the DVD!!!".

The movie is shot in a pseudodocumentary style so you really get to know the characters personally. There are quite a few laugh out loud parts and the story goes along pretty well. The filmmakers used some standard movie cliches and stock characters but they used them quite effectively.Orlando's character The Calcium Kid is very endearing. You just want to hug him and pinch his cheeks through the whole movie! xoxo The cast meshed really well. Even if you don't like boxing you'll love this movie.

It's a simple made little movie that tries to be original in several different ways but fails at it in about every way possible.This movie is supposed to be a fake documentary a so called mockumentary that focuses on the build up to a titleboxing match set in London between the champion Jose Mendez Michael Pena and the underdog and milkman Jimmy 'The Calcium Kid' Connelly. It makes you wonder that if this is supposed to be a fake documentary than why isn't it made in documentary style. It uses movie camera positions lighting and editing complete with cuts and different positions and a chronological scene build up. Basically the only way they tried to make it look a bit like a documentary is by adding a 'camera' voiceover and they let the camera being attacked and talked into a couple of times. It's really lame and it certainly doesn't add to the credibility or realism of the movie. The movie as a whole is hard to take serious since it goes comically so overthetop that it isn't even good as a funny one. The humor is lame and simple the sort of stuff a 9year would normally come up with.The movie is made in 'newEnglish style'. The kind of style which Guy Ritchie first began to use in his movies. Fast editing fast pace a cool style and music overthetop character and lots of humor. This is probably the only reason why this movie still remains a perfectly watchable one. It however does not always work out perfect. The characters for instance are all far from likable andor comical. The humor itself on its own is also quite simple and awkward. This movie is far from funny or clever.The movie is filled with surprising many good and well known actors for such a small movie as this one. The material and dialog they have to work with however isn't world class and the barely manage to make certain sequences and situations to still work out. Most of the actors also feel out of place. Orlando Bloom certainly isn't in his element as normal and simple everyday person. He just isn't the greatest comical talent around which shows in this movie.Reading the premise of this movie a inexperienced underdog against the boxing champion one could immediately scream Rocky ripoff! It certainly is true that this movie is far from original and the fact that the movie literally also spoofs some moments and entire sequences completely with the same music from the Rocky movies doesn't help to make this movie an original one that you can take serious as a boxing movie not even as a comical meant to be one. In the end the movie still tries to take a surprising and nonformulaic twist but the twist is far from good interesting or funny for that mater. As a matter of fact it gives the movie a bad aftertaste.A failed movie on many accounts. Still somewhat watchable thanks to its style.510httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

In every single scene things are done in such an exaggerated way that it becomes unbelievable. The plot is ridiculous that only a kid would find it interesting. The jokes are not even funny. The only entertaining scene in the film is the performance of a hip hop version of the British national anthem which is actually rather good. It goes down as an embarrassment to Orlando Bloom's portfolio. This film is so ridiculous that it is no wonder that it is not surprise that it went straight to DVD in most countries.".

	schema:reviewBody "This little gem of a movie is quite a rare find if you come across it then you should definitely go the full ten rounds and give it your best shot. Set in modern day London and starring a very young and fresh faced Orlando Bloom no less. Derek Boyle Alex De Rakoff who also directed and Raymond Friel have written the screenplay. They have done an excellent job of giving every character in this movie its own identity practically the role's of the dodgy boxing promoter Herbie Bush what a fantastic name played by The Mummies Omid Djalili. Then there is the very talented and extremely funny David Kelly who plays Jimmy's always drunk too old and talent less boxing coach who was found in the pub five minute's before he meet's Jimmy. There is also Jimmy's yet to be girlfriend Angel played by a young Billie Piper. Jimmy's main ambition in life is to become the regional manager of the milk delivery firm he work's for but these plan's don't come about due to a very unexpected accident at the Boxing Club he hang's out at. This is where is troubles begin as Jimmy has drunk a bottle of milk every day all his life it has turned his bone's as hard as steel so when sparring with the British World Title contender he then hit's Jimmy's head thus breaking his wrist week's before the important bout. In the meantime there is a fly on the wall film crew following their every move Jimmy has a stalker lady friend who he just cannot get rid off and then the local skinhead's get involved by mistaking him for a fascist. His father is in prison for A.B.H. and his mum is a sex therapist that works from home and to top it all off he has to fight the World Champion an American as a stand in for the damaged British contender. This really is a very funny movie well written and very well acted and to see the future star's of tomorrow young and fresh makes this movie quite a novelty. My best advice for this movie is don't throw the towel in until you have had at least one round in the ring with this great rarity.".

Felt sorry for Jimmy as he was turned against because the manager was a bit of a prat and only wanted tension. Poor guy. The fan who went to Jimmy's house was quite good as well.

Best watched at face value  the comedy is upfront and there really are laughs rather than smiles to be had throughout  it is out and out Souf Lundun innit but has heart and spirit that will translate into any viewer's world.As you can tell we just simply loved this  and what's not to love  Orlando Bloom who at first seems like a fish out of water grows quickly on you as the milk man who becomes the unlikely contender for the middleweight world title.It reminded me a little of Michael Crawford's turn in the excellent film from the early Seventies The Games though that's a serious take on sports they are both milkmen and both have a charm and naivety that carries both films well. It is both silly and serious without being embarrassing with an excellent support cast and I would warmly recommend this as one of the better British comedies of the decade  if sports and comedy are two of your favourite genres then you could do far far worse a fun and surprisingly uplifting film that deserves a wider audience.".

Best watched at face value  the comedy is upfront and there really are laughs rather than smiles to be had throughout  it is out and out Souf Lundun innit but has heart and spirit that will translate into any viewer's world.As you can tell we just simply loved this  and what's not to love  Orlando Bloom who at first seems like a fish out of water grows quickly on you as the milk man who becomes the unlikely contender for the middleweight world title.It reminded me a little of Michael Crawford's turn in the excellent film from the early Seventies The Games though that's a serious take on sports they are both milkmen and both have a charm and naivety that carries both films well. It is both silly and serious without being embarrassing with an excellent support cast and I would warmly recommend this as one of the better British comedies of the decade  if sports and comedy are two of your favourite genres then you could do far far worse a fun and surprisingly uplifting film that deserves a wider audience.";

But to those of us who appreciate the suds and debauchery of five cartoonish characters embroiled in a super secret international beer drinking contest to take on the Germans for national pride this is an instant classic.To be fair BeerFest utilizes a much feebler narrative than some of it's grossout contemporaries such as Van Wilder but definitely has a much stronger vision than something like Harold  Kumar go to White Castle. Within this genre the latter is a fine movie as well  BeerFest simply stays on track a little better instead of being a slapdash montage of funny scenes. That said BeerFest really triumphs by giving us characters so lampoon you are able to sit back and enjoy two hours of gaseous gaffs without too much mental investment.

It is certainly necessary to shutdown the brain and stop thinking to enjoy the lowlevel and gross jokes but what is better than watching this type of film to relieve the daily stress of work and personal problems? I confess that I love to watch every now and then this type of comedy which changes my mood for better with a perfect combination of beer and fun. The participation of Willie Nelson in the end is hilarious and a good hook for a Potfest. My vote is six.Title Brazil Beerfest".

It starts off kind of slow but when the brothers get a beer drinking team together and start the training i don't think there has ever been anything funnier in a movie in the past few years. When it gets going man non stop laughter. I was even crying because i was laughing so hard. Go and see it and trust me you will not regret those 9 dollars you spent at the theater!".

In my neck of the woods a matine is 7.50 and that was about what I'd say it was worth. It can vary slightly at times from the plot to make a bad joke and it gets a little hokey after the funeral I'm not spoiling anything there but it has a few classic lines some interesting comments on society and American prejudices dishes slightly below the belt without offending anyone is filled with toilet humor and throws in some eye candy to das boot. If you know your Germanic cinema history there are some subtle and not so subtle homages. Just like SoaP don't go in expecting art and you will come out with a smile. Ribbit!".

The breast shots weren't bad either The drinking games were solid they had most of the classics in there Beer Pong Beirut Quarters although when they had the Turbo Quarters scene I found it to be inaccurate as they had a long table with players on both sides all having their own glasses to shoot in. Real beer gamers know that Turbo Quarters is played with only a few glasses and when you make your shot you pass the glass on with the object to not be caught with two glasses at the same time or you have to DRINK MFer DRINK MFer DRINK MFer DRINK! The only other game they missed was SATANS POT the most hardcore and EPIC DRINKING GAME IN THE HISTORY OF THE WESTERN CIVILIZATION.You couldn't ask for a better cast in this movie obviously with the Broken Lizard group but also with Cloris Leachman who was very funny and had a great German accent playing Great Gam Gam she also was very arousing in the sausage scene! MO'nique who played Cherry was a show stealer with many hilarious lines but also two of the best scenes in the move the first was the Beer Goggle flashback sex scene with Jay Chandrasekhar who played Berry and one of the funniest fight scenes I have ever scene between her and Kevin Heffernan who played Landfill.BeerFest is a load of laughs and makes you want to go out and get your drink on! So I know its 9 am and I'm at work but talking about BeerFest makes me want to get trashed! I guess its going to be a liquid lunch today! Who's coming with?".

His unscripted brand of forced improvisational goofiness only works when he has a good script and ensemble cast to back him up Anchorman a rare gem in his repetoir. The Broken Lizard comedy team picks up where all other comedians of the past two decades have failed. While movies like American Pie offer watered down PC gags for the masses Broken Lizard provides solid laughs only the great comedies of the seventies and eighties delivered. Lizard's brand of bawdy humor hilarious pop culture and sexual references combined with the right amount of gratuitous nudity and bodily functions is reminiscent of the great comic genius of Mel Brooks and the writing team of Abrahams  Zucker.Beerfest is the latest Broken Lizard film behind Super Troopers and Club Dread. The critics ripped Club Dread as a failure but as a horror fan I found entertainment in the onscreen antics of it's cast and am appreciative of their comic take on the slasher genre. They cover all the proverbial bases and clichs delivering a lot of laughs along the way. Super Troopers is an essential for any comic collection and Beerfest runs a close second. I dare say Super Troopers and Beerfest are by far the best comedies of their generation.Beerfest is the Animal House of this decade. An homage to beer and every beer drinking game ever invented Broken Lizard's chugalicious romp through the fictional secret society behind Oktoberfest reaches Fight Club proportion as their US team faces off against the Germans to regain their heritage to the Wolfhausen Brewery throne. Guest appearances by Chloris Leachman Mo'Nique and Jurgen Prochnow lend hilarity to the Broken Lizard teamespecially Prochnow Das Boot references in tow! I highly recommend buying the DVD. Extras include a comic lesson on the history of beer and you'll enjoy the commentary behind the film. I'll put the genius of Broken Lizard up against any of their peers working today in comedy today. They literally blow away the competition on any playing field!".

Indeed this critic feels that the five of them are building an acting resume equal to that of their writing credentials.The movie itself displays a slight shift towards a more overthetop style of comedy in some scenes but even those are incredibly hilarious and are done in a way only Broken Lizard would do. Furthermore as stated earlier the subtle dialogue that they have become famous for is found throughout and in many ways is the best the group has written. As for the characters Broken Lizard again shuffles the cards and cast themselves in unique roles most of them different from those previously played in their other movies. All are hilarious with Steve Lemme's character Fink perhaps taking the cake as the scenestealer.Throw in a handful of smaller but strong performances from MC Gainey Nat Faxson and Donald Sutherland and Beerfest is absolutely bubbling over with sheer comedy.If the movie has a weakness I would point to the occasional reliance on a token visual joke more so than in their previous movies and a disappointingly short Blooper Reel during the credits. However too fine a point can't be put on it this is a great movie a comedy that will no doubt develop a cultlike status irrespective of its commercial success and should be viewed by anyone who likes to laugh that's pretty much all of us humans right....?An excellent movie and my salivary glands burst into action at the mention of a Super Troopers prequel.....Great show Broken Lizard great show.".

This is possibly the worst movie I have ever watched and I have seen Epic movie and Date movie. Having checked through other rating I notice a correlation with the votes. Every single person who voted 9 or 10 stars is from the USA. Surprise surprise. This movie is boring I never laughed once offensive if you're German or English the special effects were a joke and the story was shocking not to mention the acting. The whole 'Landfill' dying and then his Texan twin brother appearing at the wake asking to join the drinking team and be called 'Landfill' too was a dire waste of 20 Min's of the movie. I noted that 'team England' stood under the Union flag union jack to you yanks yet there was also a team from Scotland competing who stood under the Saltire flag of Scotland surely 'team England' should have stood under the Georges cross!!! Now the film makers were obviously aware of the difference because when it showed the atlas illustrating the main characters on their plane bringing the ashes to Germany near the beginning of the film it showed the 4 territories of the UK England Scotland Wales and Northern Ireland in a different colour. Why just presume that because you show a Union Jack everyone who stands under it is English and has a terrible cockney accent. It's those little things that really annoy me. This film demonstrates why the world today generally despises the USA and the sooner Hollywood realise this and stops offending our intelligence the better. Here is a suggestion why not make a film about how the USA who are allegedly a nation against world terrorism through the north American Irish republican group NORAID collected millions of US dollars to fund the IRA war in Northern Ireland. America you have a lot to answer for.".

Terrible acting. An established actor named Juergen Prochnow from Berlin ! trying to imitate a nasty Bavarian Opa. And a director playing on every clich that herewith proved he knows nothing about. A camera director who should have been shot along with Herr Schniedelwichsen. And what was that male prostitute thing all about anyway. There was nothing comical about it. At all! I cringed about 4 times per scene. Fake Oktoberfest scenes one might forgive but for Pete's sake  if you're in Munich why not take a day or two and run over to Angermaier's on the Donnersbergerbruecke and buy proper even modern Bavarian Tracht for costumes  even a lowbudget film could afford his prices! These were cheesy outfits only an American schmuck would have thought up.And why use faked German accents and Gestapo  SS style Prussians? That gag was funny maybe twice but after the 18000th time it's just OLD!!! There were perhaps 3 funny lines in the whole movie but I can't remember them even 1 day after seeing the movie  that's how bad this one was.The script was simply terrible. The Germans were definitely not native speakers ich weiss wovon ich spreche. Whoever wrote this heap of Scheisse should be tarred and feathered like his little Bavarian whore and her bastard son.This is a movie for people who are gluttons...for punishment  probably the same type of folk who think Coors Light is beer. Funny the main part of the story takes place in Colorado...wouldn't be surprised if ol' Pete Coors had his hand in this somewhere....and the worst thing is it even had potential for being funny but this found a short pier and took a long walk.2 HOURS OF PAIN for nothing  I'd rather drink Loewenbraeu! gez. madmark of munich".

	schema:reviewBody "I must say this movie was excruciating to sit through. I went with four friends who all have a varied sense of humor. There were about 200 audience members in the theater. I had my hopes up I'm an avid fan of beer I've brewed my own bought my own ingredients and tasted as many varieties as I could both good and bad. As we all know Germans are famous for their outstanding beer and their Oktober festival. This was the perfect film right?I'm afraid not. The movie lacked all that I expected. I was looking forward to an absurd romp through Germany during its drunkest hour filled with twists and turns and plenty of fun. Brilliant plan but the whole drinking in Germany part of the movie took place in a fictitious underground club that resembled an organized fraternity party based on thoughtless drinking games more than anything else. The Germans who were the bad guys were made to be trite Nazilike beer game champions and in terms of character boring. Even the talent of Jrgen Prochnow couldn't save this film. He had no script to work with just like in House of the Dead. The American characters our protagonists were right at home in this juvenile club of college drinking games. The broken lizard team's acting performances were mediocre and simple minded.The plot revolved around becoming better at drinking games not exploring Oktoberfest. Now I wasn't looking for a documentary on the German festival but it certainly contains more comedic material to work with as opposed to a frat party with drinking games. I doubt broken lizard has ever been to an Oktoberfest. A wild party celebrated by an entire country for nearly a month that spills out onto the streets drinking itself into oblivion would have been the obvious source for comedy compared to a dark and dank underground club hosting frat boy drinking games. The material is already there unfortunately for broken lizard they missed it right over their heads. Point being it was not funny. I didn't hear a single hearty laugh throughout the audience. The jokes were childish and often fell short at the punchline. The delivery was awful. The characters weren't interesting and the general structure was full of holes. There are no subtle comedic undertones in charter or plot. One character gets killed only to be replaced by an identical character played by the same actor. The only difference is that the replacement wears a cowboy hat. Who writes this stuff!? Oh yeah broken lizard... It was in your face mindless humor. Forget about cinematography or editing or sound design nothing interesting there.Now I went to college for film and at times it's hard for me to detach myself from all that I've learned about making a worthwhile film. I can say however I don't expect everything that I see to be an award winning beautifully directed and scripted masterpiece. I'm often much like the next guy who enjoys a couple of beers and watching an absurd comedy with hardly any lasting virtue. There are great comedies out there and this isn't one of them.I'm afraid that the studios hype these types of movies for revenue purposes only. And plenty of unknowing movie goers see movies like these and laugh at them. broken lizard and similar production companies are dumbing down American audiences and this movie is proof. It's the classic cookie cutter example of not straying from the money making formula and instead focusing on revenue not film. It's happening in all genres of new releases and they're coming out a dime a dozen. This just happens to be one of the worst examples I've seen yet. Aside from my own knowledge of film I went to the theater with a bricklayer an automechanic and a welder each a friend of mine... When we left all four of us agreed. That sucked!".

	schema:reviewBody "Two American brothers in Germany to spread their dead father's ashes encounter an ancient drinking contest and round up their old college buddies to compete. This is the latest in the series of movies produced by the Broken Lizards comedy troop.Some movies are critic proof. That does not necessarily mean that they are so bizarre that critics can't figure them out. Sometimes it means that the flick in question is geared specifically towards an audience that never reads movie reviews. This is the same audience that went to see Dukes Of Hazzard same director who made it too.The question every film critic is offered by a movie like Beerfest is why even bother to review it? You'd have to sit through almost 2 hours of crass humor about power drinking frog masturbation and barmaid cleavage then write a review no one will likely read. The question is somewhat akin to that whole if a tree falls in the forest... philosophical query.Another question. How did cinematic greats like Donald Sutherland Jurgen Prochnow and Cloris Leachman get in this movie? Talk about slumming. Sutherland at least had the good sense to go uncredited.Sadly some of us have our masochistic streak and do not let years of being scarred by seeing awful movies stop us from seeing more awful movies. Some of us go in and watch as our suspicions are confirmed. Sometimes...in fact quite often it is agonizing to be proved right.In the case of sophomoric comedies like this one I can tell you that I started cringing at this type of humour well before I was twenty and I loathe it even more that I am past 30.Stupid crass lewd childish...shall I continue? I don't think I need to...sheesh!".

	onyx:emotionText "Two American brothers in Germany to spread their dead father's ashes encounter an ancient drinking contest and round up their old college buddies to compete. This is the latest in the series of movies produced by the Broken Lizards comedy troop.Some movies are critic proof. That does not necessarily mean that they are so bizarre that critics can't figure them out. Sometimes it means that the flick in question is geared specifically towards an audience that never reads movie reviews. This is the same audience that went to see Dukes Of Hazzard same director who made it too.The question every film critic is offered by a movie like Beerfest is why even bother to review it? You'd have to sit through almost 2 hours of crass humor about power drinking frog masturbation and barmaid cleavage then write a review no one will likely read.

A man who is dissatisfied with his senseless existence in his familylife and social status steals the uniform of a policeman and then enters the Oktoberfest.  Now he is somebody he is important he can help people respect him etc. His wife other relatives and some friends start to follow him while he gets some new acquaintances. The craziness begins! Full ahead! You cannot really say what the sense of this movie is maybe it's about senselessness of life in general and about the relativity of common values. Amateur actors philosophize about this and that  most of them unemotional as a stone. But this doesn't ruin the movie  it's quite the contrary and supports the absurdity of the scenes and texts. There's no real storyline it's more like a collage of sketches and clips. And it's also funny that you never know if the protagonists are actors who know they play for the movie but I guess they do not know WHAT KIND of movie this is!! or if they are just visitors of the Oktoberfest who happen to fall victim to a crazygenius moviedirector by chance you know like hiddencamera or something.  You never know.  And sometimes people get really angry by being annoyed by our false policeman out of control  and I am very sure that he'd got some punches in the face without this uniform. Many of the mono and dialogues are really funny as hell and also quite intelligent in a subtle and subversive meaning. This movie and with it it's director was a total find for me I must recommend this a lot 10 out of 10!".

By watching the movie one will soon encounter that everybody visiting that place just needs some minutes to mutate into a beerquaffing songshouting sexsearching anybody. Having a historical background in celebrating the Bavarian culture the Oktoberfest has evolved to just a megaparty of twelve vastly big beer tents with ordinary disco music visited by millions of amazed international guests every time. Such an interesting tension is created when director and main actor Achternbusch being a sensitive artist on the one hand and a traditional Bavarian on the other is thrown in that funoriented superficial setting. Making things easier by being dressed as a policeman Achternbusch goes for it. We can be witness of one of the greatest movie scenes I know when he runs uncut through a beer tent making some fun with and provoking people you surely could label as drunk and who react sometimes amused as well as quite aggressive. I'd like to say that it has got something from Tarkovsky. 'Bierkampf' in the whole can be seen as a great artful movie essay about tradition sexuality friendship and the sense of celebrating. Highly recommendable.".
